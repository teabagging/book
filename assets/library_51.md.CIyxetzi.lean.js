What Nero really did. Better than Claudius.Bravo the aythor."},{"Title":"The Baby's Book of Babies (Picture Puffins)","review":"My daughter is 22 months old. She has always had board books, but we just introduced her to picture books. This was the first one SHE picked out at the library. Her reaction when she saw it was priceless, \\"Babyyyyyyyy!!\\" Since getting it a week ago, we have easily read it 3 dozen times. Each time, my daughter LOVES pointing out the babies and has even started trying to say the verse on each page. The verse is wonderful (my husband likes it but says it doesn't rhyme very well) and very creative. All the photographs are very realistic and full of action. A great book for any child age 6 months to 24 months."},{"Title":"The Baby's Book of Babies (Picture Puffins)","review":"Great photographs, simple joyous text, thick glossy pages and an adorable group of multicultural babies creates a book for the earliest months of a child's reading life. This was far and away my daughter's favorite book of the 20-30 we had during her baby months. It would be a great addition to any parent's wish list. I hope it goes back into print."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"I was a little disappointed by this book. I found the subject matter really interesting, and Peril has done a good job gathering information from all kinds of sources. Peril puts very little of herself into the book, though. I would have liked to see a bit more theory or application. The early chapters indicate the blueprint that is to be followed throughout the rest of the book and there is very little development from then on."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"This book was witty and a great reference for all things mid-century and female-oriented, but beyond that wasn't much of anything. Homosexuality is never really covered in regards to women and doesn't really analyze or comment on things or even try to understand the why behind it: the book is just sarcastic in a rather juvenile sense. The best part of the whole book is when Peril indicts Betty Friedan for being a part of the pink think problem.I actually got the impression from the book that if you happen to be a contemporary female who is feminine, you're evil. And that is sad."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"This book is a true gem! It's rare to find a book that tackles such subject matter without hitting you over the head with a heavy dose of feminism. Instead, you can be mortified by some of the ways women were treated and marketed to over the years, but you can also enjoy and remember back to some of those silly games, toys, magazines, etc, you too got caught up in (as did thee author)."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"When I first saw Pink Think at Barnes and Noble I thought that it was misplaced in the women's studies section as it really did not look like a book with a feminist glance.BOY WAS I WRONG!!! I wound up actually taking a look at it one day and could not leave the store without it!!!I have always been intrigued by women's history. I am not into cooking or sewing or cleaning by any means to be honest. However I find that the stuff that dates back in time regarding those issues really shed light into the lives that women of the time would have lead. Its really hard to find that kind of information and Lynn Peril did a really good job at not only compiling the stuff that she found, but presenting it in an easy to read fashion.I must admit as I read the stuff in the book I really could not help but wonder: how far have we really come?? When I think of womens magazines, women's fiction, ivillage and the stuff that we market towards teen girls.Lynn Peril has a fun Pink Think website that has links to other fun information on these kind of historical facts. A few other books I would highly recommend if you are into these historical view on women are: The Way We Never Were by Stephanie Coontz as well as From Front Porch to Backseat by Beth Bailey."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"Think Pink analyzes the socially constructed feminine gender though the lens of pop culture. Advice books, education, fashion, television, household product marketing, magazines and movies all do their part to make sure growing girls are trained to accept their lot in life as the bearer of children. Dating and marriage just happened to be incidental steps. By comparison, books and magazines produced for boys encouraged them to become more fully rounded human beings.Lynn Peril walks us through the evolution of femininity using various points of popular culture from the 1920s through the mid 1980s. Her wit and sense of humor with have you cracking up and feeling sad and pathetic by turns. Makes you wonder if we really are past the bad ole pre-feminism days.You'll hunger for more of the mind blowing ads and images. I like how Peril grounds the information by including personal anecdotes so the book doesn't read like a dry text book.This book will hold interest for folks into a lot of topics including sociology, gender and American pop culture."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"I stumbled across Ms. Peril's website once, relieved that I am not the only person in the world who collects old home-ec and charm books :-) I got this out of the library, not expecting this book to be as exhaustive as it was, really thinking it might be more of a pictoral &quot;poking fun of the kitschy 50's&quot; type of book which I've seen now and then. However, I was delighted to find that Ms. Peril does a fantastic job exploring the mores of the past. Funny, scary, unbelievable. I would have to agree with another reviewer here, though, that present day &quot;pink think&quot; is only briefly touched upon. This is fine with me, because I look upon this as more of a historical perspective of the 20th century through the 70's. Nonetheless, I found it fascinating and hard to put down."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"Elegant writing matched with eye-catching period graphics combine to create a very readable popular history."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"Pink think, according to Lynn Peril, is the set of notions society holds and has held about the nature of womanhood and appropriate feminine roles. Pink think originated as early as the nineteenth century but enjoyed its most powerful era in the consumerist decades of the 1950's, 1960's, and 1970's. During those years, women were sold personal grooming products, charm courses, kitchen items, and a myriad of other goods and services that purported to make a woman more feminine or to help her attract a mate. Peril's book is a collection of these items: descriptions, ad copy, and pictures fill its pages.But &quot;Pink Think&quot; is little more than the sum of its parts. Its historical treatment of pink think is brief, and it barely even touches on present-day pink consumerism. The book also makes no attempt to analyze its subject matter, instead restricting itself to what amounts to a detailed list, and while the entire book is interesting, it's hard to find an impetus to continue beyond the first few chapters."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"I love the color pink, don't get me wrong. However, after reading this book, I can't look at it quite the same! This book was an excellent read, which I picked up while doing a project on women's sexuality from the 1950's to today. This book is definitely an eye opener--for those of us who thought we knew--but really had no idea. I think everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"Absolutely love this book. I am constantly going back to it and taking notes from it. Combining my two loves, vintage style and culture with feminism. Most excellent. Worth The read."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"although i've enjoyed this book, i did not find it as fascinating as some of the other reviewers. except the part about a product that was a douche/ enema/ mouthwash all-in-one: &quot;three orifices, one product&quot; and using lysol as a douche, there was nothing really new. nonetheless, a very good read."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"I LOVE this book. I have been waiting 2 years and it is not LONG enough. I almost had apoplexy last night from laughing so hard while reading it! This book is very good in the genre of Nature Abhors a Vacuum: A Handbook for the Domestically Impaired, Kiss My Tiara and Southern Ladies and Gentlemen. Thanks for getting it into print (FINALLY) W.W. NORTON. When is the next book?P.S. I am SOOOOOOO happy it was delivered on September 30th! You will have to read the book to realize the significance!"},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"A fascinating read. The author has a bit of a hobby in collecting examples of 'Pink Think,' or, paraphernalia which encourages women to do groom themselves to be appropriately girly to fulfill their potential (i.e., how girls were brainwashed for decades that their only goals in life should be to snag a husband and to find their true happiness in motherhood).It's enraging and yet at the same time strangely intriguing to read about books, magazines, advertisements, games, television shows, movies and more were so often geared toward steering a woman to be a certain way.Strange details include how women were encouraged to be 'fresh' from douching with disinfectants to childhood games where the goal was to get the perfect date to how a woman only achieves true sexual satisfaction after she had fulfilled her destiny of marrying and having children. On top of that it details how girls were encouraged to always dumb themselves down in front of men to flatter their egos, and the author even provides quizzes published decades ago in magazines to test girlishness or career woman potential.Any modern independent woman will be both shocked, amused, angered and more than likely grateful that so much progress has been made (even though we're still encouraged in many ways to continue to 'think pink'). Just open up a woman's magazine and see the advertisements for pink feminine hygiene products and diet aids, among a million other self-improvement articles. It's great to see a book like 'Pink Think,' however, to realize how far we've come along."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"This book is genius! It walks a fine line between rationally exploring the history of social expectations for girls and reporting the horror contained within, without ever giving into the temptation to go on one long, humorless feminist rant. In fact, it approaches the topic with remarkable good humor. Well written, informative AND funny!"},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"My mom makes a whole lot more sense to me now."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"This was great. Terribly entertaining and very informative as well. Lynn Peril obviously has a passion for this stuff, and her research is quite extensive. I thought that the information was presented in a very manageable and clever way. I only wish most of the non-fiction I read in college was this good while still teaching me things. Should be required reading for EVERYONE! I loved her chapter at the end about how, sadly, we are none too far away from this type of thinking, with several examples, such as \\"The Rules.\\" It just made me very sad and angry at times, while laughing out loud or cringing in horror at others. My roommates and I had a grand time taking the 1947 Ladies Home Journal quiz to find out if we should look for a job or a husband. (One of the instant \\"job\\" qualifiers was if you were over 26 years old or \\"above average height\\")"},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"After enjoying Lynn Perils sarcastic wit in Mystery Date, I was excited to read she had a book in the works. Lo and behold here it is.Peril reviews highlights of advertisements and home ec propaganda from mid-century america, when gender roles were apparently our patriotic god-fearing duty to obey. Along with illustrations and reprints of such epherma, we get her commentary, which isn't as obnoxiously judgemental as it could be- instead she is just amused and continuously dumbfounded at the ploys used to develop brand loyalty from age 3 on, instill a pride in fragile, meek femininity (strapping robust heterosexuality in the males), and exploit adolescent anxiety in order to do so.Open any womens magazine from the era and you will find page after page of ads for deoderant and listerine- all with the same message that failure to use their products might ruin your chances at MARRAIGE, the be all end all, apparently, of female life in the mid 1900s.Lynn Peril collects and organizes the best of these ads and textbooks for you. It is up to you to make any conjectures about what they imply past and present about their place in politics and commerce in America.The 8 color pages in the center could be put to better use, such as putting more pictures on each page, but that's really just a minor detail."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"Pink Think is hysterically funny...but I'm in my mid-40's and I grew up with a lot of the &quot;Pink Think&quot; examples in this book. I urged my 25-year old daughter to read it so she could better understand the environment I grew up in. This book is worth reading just for the entertainment value, but it also serves as a wonderful reminder of how much attitudes about women have changed and improved."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"It is what I saw to be a modern &quot;Feminine Mystique&quot;. A very insightful book on the media's effect on women and how impactful society affects females to the point that a color becomes a technique to manipulate women. As a high school student I found this book truly amazing and an awesome reading that I would recommend for everyone to read as we are constantly blinded by how detrimental society can be to women."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"This book is positively brilliant. It is likely that even the most well-educated feminist will learn new and horrifying things from Pink Think. My blood pressure went up several notches.I would like to point out one thing, however, something which the author herself addressed: things haven't changed. In my opinion the only thing that has clearly changed dramatically are women's career opportunities, but we are still expected to keep a happy, clean home, raise children, and keep hubby sexually satisfied. While reading this book with the TV on, I was struck by the similarity between today's ads and those presented in Pink Think (cleaning products - nuff said.) Rather than coming away from this book thinking that you have it so much better than your baby-boomer mother did, allow it to open your eyes to the hilarious propoganda in the present.I can't wait to see a book from the same author chronicling current magazine ads, dating advice books, and TV commercials."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"I happened to just pick this off the shelf at Borders when just doing a browse, as a collector of \\"femorabilia\\" it really stood out. After a quick look, the faithful consumer in me just HAD to have this book. I have a collection of cheesy \\"nurse in love\\" 1960's romance novels, old health textbooks, Barbies, you name it- but I never really thoroughly thought about all of it (or why I was so strangely attracted to it) until I read this book.The writing style is great- it moves at a quick pace and I had trouble putting it down. You do get glossy pictures in the middle, and vintage ads are always fun. But the meat of this book shows just how twisted the image of \\"femininity\\" (and in one chapter, masculinity) is in our media and society. It illustrates very clearly that while we have come a long way, \\"pink think\\" is still alive and sashaying. Passages reminded me of personal weird \\"celebrations of your womanhood\\" that were fed to me, like in sex ed in the 5th grade they made getting your period sound like an amazing, wonderful thing. Me and my friends literally couldn't wait, and even said things like \\"I hope mine is a week long, and not just three days!\\"It's embarrassing now, but I was thoroughly brainwashed and naturally pretty bummed out when menstruation wasn't like a party in my pants. I also remember having those Mall Madness and boyfriend board games as a girl (for the author it was Mystery Date), which I played years before I had much interest in guys or my credit rating.This book is incredibly smart, interesting, surprisingly non-judegmental, and as fun as it is scary. Ranging from the hilarity of a \\"Lady\\" marketed pink train set to the horrors of ads for douche made from LYSOL, this book will keep your attention and keep you thinking long after you finish it. Highly recommended to all age groups."},{"Title":"Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons","review":"This book is fantastic. For anyone interested in gender studies, women's studies, or just 50's/60's culture, this book is just great. I had read Peril's column in Bitch magazine and decided to get her book. (the column is similar to this book) I couldn't believe all of the amazing and frightening tidbits of female life in the 50s... like Lysol being sold as a douching product?? And even more disturbing was the death toll from using Lysol in such a capacity. More upsetting still was the company's reaction to these women's deaths - the women had failed to properly dilute the product and, therfore, caused their own deaths. Most of the book is not so disturbing. In fact, most of it is really charming. The kind of stuff that makes you look at bullet bras, cardigans, saddle shoes, and other icons of 50s femininity and think \\"wow, I've got it pretty good.\\" A great read if not for academic purposes then for simple head-shaking humor."},{"Title":"The Essential: Hieronymus Bosch (Essential (Harry N.

Simply put, it is blasphemy. No editor caught this one?Luckily, the author seems to be much better at writing about art than theology. However, as I am a neophyte about art (hence, my reading of this book) it makes me much less sure of the accuracy of the author's views after seeing such a huge blooper about something that even the most basic Christian knows.I am enjoying the art info enough to give it this four star rating."},{"Title":"Oracle JDeveloper 3 Handbook","review":"The book provides a good overview of the JDeveloper product including some of the future direction.

Where formerly, landscape design rested on a strict axial orientation, with Eckbo's brilliant influence, this rigidness exploded into designs more like Wassily Kandinsky compositions. No other designer has played a greater part in the development of modern landscape design. Just looking at the intricate, beautifully hand-drawn landscape architectural drawings he made, from small-scale gardens to large-scale parks, is a big treat. The authors integrate Eckbo's writings into the text, as well, to give us a sense of this apparently, humble, yet, brilliant man's thoughts and process. This is a wonderful book for someone interested in the history and dynamics of landscape design, or someone just developing a small garden. This is also a great addition to the library of the mid-century design enthusiast or scholar. For me, beginning to understand the underpinnings of landscape design, as well as the social value of public landscape design through Eckbo's eyes and mind, made a world of difference in my approach to seeing or modifying space of any kind. This is a quiet, illuminating and wonderful book."},{"Title":"A History of Russia, Central Asia and Mongolia, Vol. 1: Inner Eurasia from Prehistory to the Mongol Empire","review":"As an archaeologist working on the archaeology of North East Asia, I found this book a very big disappointment. Then again what should I expect from a historian whose speciality is the 18th and 19th century history of Russia?The author draws heavily on secondary works in English, German, French and Russian. Instead of depending on those, he should have gone directly to the archaeological site reports and the historical annals themselves. Its also sad to see a synthesis on Russia and Central Asia that relies heavily on the works of English language scholars and ignoring the Russian and Mongolian language scholars. In terms of some of his English secondary sources, ones like Davis-Kimball et al. (NOMADS OF THE EURASIAN STEPPE) and Barfield's PERILOUS FRONTIER are still in print and available from AMAZON.COM.Production values in this book are also uneven. The photographic reproductions in many cases are also poorly scanned copies (see for example p. 53, 214 in the paperback version). The publisher should have done a better job.My advice: you can do a lot better (try the two suggestions above)"},{"Title":"A History of Russia, Central Asia and Mongolia, Vol. 1: Inner Eurasia from Prehistory to the Mongol Empire","review":"This book is the only book to deal with the lands in question (Inner Asia) so thoroughly. I feel as if a large gap in my knowledge of history has been at least partially filled (there is always more to learn). Not that I'm without my complaints: the maps are few and far in between, the photographs poorly done. Sometimes, the book was downright boring, but that's to be expected with such an extensive book.If you want to learn about the dynamic relationship between argricultural civilizations and pastoralist civilizations, read this book. It does leave some questions unanswered though. Such as, why did new tribes replace old tribes (ex: the Goths in Hungary, being pushed out by the Huns, who were pushed out by the Magyars)? What were the relative populations of the time? What was the relative demand for the goods of the steepe peoples? What was the trade balance between steppe and agricultural peoples?Despite the questions, the book was worth the read."},{"Title":"A History of Russia, Central Asia and Mongolia, Vol. 1: Inner Eurasia from Prehistory to the Mongol Empire","review":"this is an excellent book for all people interested ine the early tribes of China and Inner Mongolia.

Inner Eurasian pre-history spans the history of a large part of mankind itself. It is home of the Indo-Europeans, a linguistic group that spread in pre-historic times to India, Iran, Asia Minor and Europe.The impact of the warrior tribes from the Steppe lands - such as the Huns, the Goths, Vandals, Alans and the all-important Mongols - shattered some of the world's greatest empires.

I found it to be a very satisfying read that kept me turning the pages. When the main character (Garner) is being &quot;wrapped&quot; by Dane, I felt like it was happening to me. The relationship with Garner and father was excellent, though unresolved as many relationships are...particularly with parents. I am looking forward to reading other Waterhouse mysteries."},{"Title":"Graven Images","review":"As Waterhouse's story opens, narrator Garner Quinn, a forceful, driven and highly successful writer of true-crime books, is convinced of the innocence of a young farmboy accused of being a serial killer known as Holy Ghost. She champions his cause and works tirelessly to free him.Once the young man is acquitted, Quinn, despite her promise to spend time with her teenage daughter, is immediately caught up in her next case. How can she help it when it concerns body parts found in the sculptures of Dane Blackmoor, a romantic enigma Quinn once cast as her father in lonely childhood fantasies? Is Blackmoor a killer? Is Quinn being stalked by the real Holy Ghost?Although the plot takes several meandering turns, Waterhouse's writing is punchy and vivid, her flawed heroine skillfully depicted, and the ending pulls out all the stops, involving the forces of nature as well as the diabolical workings of a sadistic killer's mind."},{"Title":"Graven Images","review":"Although this is Waterhouse's second book, it is the first in her Garner Quinn series. The protagonist, Garner Quinn, is a well-known author who writes books about true-crime. It can a little difficult to follow sometimes, because Waterhouse jumps back and forth between Garner's past and present, a book Garner wrote about one of her father's clients (Garner's father is a well-known, well-respected lawyer), and two current storylines all being interwoven into one story. This book requires a good deal of concentration (and maybe even a little backtracking) to keep everything straight, but was overall very interesting."},{"Title":"Graven Images","review":"This is the fourth Jane Waterhouse book that I have read. I read two later Quinn Garner books which I liked so much that I decided to read Jane Waterhouse's backlist. I found the characters complex and compelling. The plot was a little bizarre at times, but I found the book hard to put down."},{"Title":"Graven Images","review":"I read two of Jane Waterhouse's more recent books first and I was really looking forward to delving into this one. It started out tremendously and I could barely put it down, but then things seemed to unravel. The guilt or innocence of the Bird man was fascinating, but that plot came to an unfulfilling end. And the body parts in the sculptures, while resolved, still left the reader with tons of questions. I felt like the book could have been 100 pages longer to allow the plots to really develop and draw to a satisfying conclusion. I loved the attraction between Dane and Garner, but even that relationship never really developed. Overall, a good book to borrow from the library, not one I'd necessarily want to make part of my own book collection."},{"Title":"Graven Images","review":"While the plot is full of twists and turns, the characters never emerge beyond the two-dimesional. The author sets up complex relationships between the heroine and her father and daughter, but never develops them at all. The plot has large holes in it; the heroines actions are often inexplicable except in terms of advancing the plot. For example, a policeman comes to her door after her house has been ransacked and her daughter is missing, yet she fails to enlist his help, so that she can be alone when the killer attacks...So many threads of plot are left hanging that the story seems abandoned rather than concluded. Thumbs down."},{"Title":"Graven Images","review":"I really enjoyed the sophisticated pen and hope to see more. Wonderful development -- of each story. Waterhouse created Garner Quinn, a character to whom anyone with an ounce of critical marrow could relate. Garner Quinn could easily live on in subsequent stories -- which could be the flaw with this one.Waterhouse, in her enthusiasm to create a brilliant mystery, actually created two. If it had worked, the brilliance would have been in the glue that held them together. Instead, without any connection whatsoever, other than Quinn's frantic pace of overlapping one crime with another, all that is left is a quick summary, short explanation of why any of it happened at all.I think that with more indepth development of a single plot, further development of her household relationships and the true brilliance of her penmanship, Waterhouse will become one of the best in this genre."},{"Title":"Graven Images","review":"Believe it or not, the &quot;statue mystery&quot; is nevercompletely resolved. The climax of the novel concerns a completely different thread. Despite being portrayed as a strong independent character, the heroine is really a passive victum throughout the text. My guess is that the author had outlines for two different mysteries and threw them together to meet a publishing deadline. Alsoas a Jersey Shore native, I'd like to remind Ms. Waterhouse that there are no beach-front homes inSpring Lake."},{"Title":"The New Spanish Table","review":"This book has authentic flavors of Spain. I am married to a Spaniard. Everything I have prepared from this book for my husband or for his family when we are in Spain has been a hit. I have a copy of the book at our home in Chicago and a copy of the book in our home in Sevilla. (It's too heavy to cart back and forth!) I love this book."},{"Title":"The New Spanish Table","review":"I took this book out of the library, along with several other Spanish cookbooks, before a tapas party that I was hosting. This one was head and shoulders above the rest in terms of having interesting-sounding recipes, and it was fun to read to boot. (An added bonus is the descriptions of the wine of each region: I went to a local wine shop and chose two terrific Montsant wines from Catalonia that were both under $15 but tasted like they were easily twice the price.) As to the recipes, I cooked multiple items from the book, and every single one was a hit. (The Manchego cheese biscuits went like wildfire, in particular. Fabulous and so easy.) I am now going to buy the book online from Amazon but am sad to see they only have paperback--I have the hardback out from the library and it's a lovely, heavy, lasting cookbook. (For cookbooks I'm going to use a lot, I prefer hardback.) I recommend this cookbook highly.--International Home Chef"},{"Title":"The New Spanish Table","review":"I can't think of cookbook I've bought recently that I'm enjoying more. The recipes I've tried are all delicious: chorizo with potatoes (secret ingredient: dates, believe it or not), crispy shrimp pancakes, Ferran Adria's weeknight recipe for improving a store-bought rotisserie chicken... we're really enjoying these. And there are many more I'm planning to make; this cookbook is definitely in the rotation. The flavor combinations are great and intriguing, and the recipes are not fussy or difficult. Oh, and the ingredients are (almost all) very available.In addition to that, the extra notes about Spanish cooking and ingredients are really enjoyable and informative. If you don't have a Spanish cookbook, get this one. (I realize that if you don't have anything negative to say, it's sounds like a shill piece - but I don't. This book just fit my needs really well.)"},{"Title":"The New Spanish Table","review":"This cookbook is a must-have. Unlike other Spanish cookbooks (many which are lovely in their own right), this one is less traditional and more modern and eclectic. The recipes are creative and so delicious! I've already made several in a single week, owing in part to how surprisingly easy some were to make. If you've heard about the modern gastronomy movement or chefs like Ferran Adria, you absolutely must buy this book! I was shocked how easy and diverse some of the recipes are; unlike other cookbooks I will never get bored with this one."},{"Title":"The New Spanish Table","review":"This is a marvelous cook book. It shows fashionable Spanish food today; this include both traditional recipes as well as new twists on the old. The focus is on a pretty robust understanding of the basics. We also get an overview of the different regions. The writer has really interviewed and talked to a lot of Spaniards so this is not a shallow piece of work at all.All the recipes include original ingredients, often beans or hams that are only available in Spain. This give you a good understanding of the Spanish ingredients, but off course makes cooking more difficult. Some ingredients can be sourced and others can be substituted. If you have a decent knowledge about cooking that should not create a problem.In addition, it is pretty well written and the non-recipe text can be quite interesting. We hear the author talk. It is not some fluffy filler-text sdaying nothing that we often find in cookbooks written by non-chefs (and increasingly by chefs).Finally, note that \\"new\\" in the title does not refer to the ultra-trendy Spanish food from Adria and others."},{"Title":"The New Spanish Table","review":"Upon my return from a trip along the coast of Spain I wanted a cookbook that would help me create many of the wonderful dishes we ate.

I have traveled widely in Spain and I love the fact that von Bremzen covers all parts of the country, as the regions have very different cuisines.Every dish I've cooked has been eye-poppingly delicious. My favorites include the Basque Hake & Clams in Salsa Verde (just as good without the clams), Minted Lamb Meatballs, and Chicken and Apples Braised in Hard Cider.The important thing to know about this book is that it doesn't feature quick preparations. The ingredients are easy to gather, but the prep and/or cooking time is often quite long. You have to read the recipe carefully to estimate what you're in for; I spent almost 2 hours on the minted lamb meatballs, start to finish. When you have the time, this food is well worth it.My only complaint to the publisher is that my one-year-old book has already lost a signature, i.e., the quality of the binding is not the highest for a cookbook."},{"Title":"The New Spanish Table","review":"This is the best cookbook on Spanish cuisine that I have ever owned.

Well, in the first 15 minutes of sitting down with this book, I knew it would most likely become part of my personal collection. The text is robust--giving historical refrences, cultural nuances, and very practical food preparation tips. I especially enjoyed the author's description of how well a particular recipe was received in various settings based on her personal experiences.I decided to keep the book because I just had this tremendous feeling of confidence by reading all that was included and I made the right decision. Each and every recipe I chose for the party won raves. Some were a little more time intensive than I expected, but definitely well worth it.

If cooking is a true expression of love, creativity and exploration for you, you will enjoy this book without a doubt."},{"Title":"The New Spanish Table","review":"I actually collect Spanish cookbooks, always looking for the innovative twists on old classics. I found The New Spanish Table to fulfill this category to the letter. The tidbits and introductions to each and every recipe give hints to actually being with the author as she savored the dish for the first time.There are old classics like Paella Valenciana which (in my humble opinion) is almost a sacred dish not meant to be \\"fusioned\\" with. Ms. von Bremzen gives the best tips to making this famed dish and the secrets and reasons to why it tastes so great in Valencia. I have actually come close to recreating it, only after I followed her advice in this book.On the flip side, there is a recipe for beet and cherry gazpacho which hails on genius. If you like to try new innovative twists on an old favorite, this is a must try!There are many, many more recipes to numerous to mention here, and they won't dissapoint!A true classic cookbook to enhance any serious collection!"},{"Title":"The New Spanish Table","review":"There are many prominent US chefs who traveled to Spain, loved their cuisine and brought them back to incorporate in their menus and restaurants. For example, Bobby Flay's endorsement of this book on the back cover sold me. Flay is serious Spanish influenced superchef, who uses their cheeses and wines, etc. Then there is the tapas craze from Spain.All of these and more is incorporated into this almost 500 page volume documenting this Spanish new cuisine which is sweeping the world, and now this culmination of von Bremzen's time in Spain for over twenty years and this marvelous collection of some 300 recipes collected from all over Spain.There is quite a variety of offerings here, the usual gamut from appetizers to desserts and everything in between done here by regional organization. Some of the ingredients such as cheeses and wines are particular to Spain and might be hard for some to acquire if not Internet users. Some of techniques are somewhat difficult, but the huge variety here allows spectrum of easy to more difficult and time consuming techniques. Sources are provided along with fine Spanish Pantry section help.Wonderful text with societal and geographical commentary along with fine color photos and chef resumes provided. The section on Tapas history and development is best so far, and such great reading!Impressed with these offerings: Eggplant Stacks with Tomato Jam; White Wine-Pear Sangria; Roasted Squash Soup with Saffron Ice Cream; Basque Leek, Potato and Cod Chowder; Tortilla with Chorizo, Potatoes and Allioli; Moorish Chicken and Nut Pie; Gypsy Pork Stew (unbelievable with pork and fava beans and artichocken and saffron wine and stock broth);"},{"Title":"The New Spanish Table","review":"Of the several Spanish cookbooks that I own, this tome sits head and shoulders above the others. Its more thorough, better written, anticipates ingredient challenges and explains the significance of each dish to the reader. The book covers the major regions, highlights their specialties, and, most importantly, takes the reader from entry level (ie. the classic Spanish tortilla) to the advanced (the Tortilla with piquillo peppers and artichoke hearts). Everything I've made from this cookbook so far has turned out beautifully. Cheers!"},{"Title":"The New Spanish Table","review":"I bought this book on a whim because I was interested in Spanish cuisine. I didn't know anything about it but figured with over 300 recipes I could find something I liked. Every recipe I have made has been fantastic. I found the dishes very easy to make even if they involved a lot of steps. Instructions were very clear and easy to follow. The smoked almonds I had actually made before with a different recipe and had so so results. The recipe in this book was much more clear. We bought an ice cream maker to make the best ice cream ever(honey cinnamon!). My parents also have the book and after eating the ice cream they bought an ice cream maker! I like that it combines traditional and modern cuisine. A must for the serious cook."},{"Title":"The New Spanish Table","review":"As I have recently become a little obsessed with Spanish food, I decided I needed a decent cookbook. I certainly picked the right one. First, the recipes in this book range from very high brow main courses to simple, easy, delicious tapas. I am starting small and working my way up. Second, the author does an amazing job of explaining Spanish cooking: product definitions, descriptions of the regions and their cuisines, suggestions on cookware selection, etc. I have literally sat for hours reading and looking at the pictures. It was a great purchase and I know I will get a lot of use out of the book."},{"Title":"The New Spanish Table","review":"This book is amazing.

It points out the difference between authentic Spanish tradition versus tourist's interpretation."},{"Title":"The New Spanish Table","review":"I was looking for a book that contained healthy, delicious recipes with ingredients that are readily available in the Midwest. Italian is too heavy and had gotten boring, and we love to entertain with small plates and a great bottle of wine. So, we tried The New Spanish Table. Wow! Every recipe that we have tried is absolutely delicious and we talk about each meal for days. The prep time is a bit daunting at first, but when I got used to that I learned to plan ahead and prepare parts in advance. Our favorites? The Scallops with Garlic Cream and Tomato Jam and The Basque Fishermen's Stew. I keep a batch of the Tomato Jam around all of the time. It yummies everything up and turns a hamburger into a gourmet delight.Thank you!"},{"Title":"The New Spanish Table","review":"If you are looking for a cookbook that is authentic, informational and provides delicious (yet fairly easy) recipes, THIS IS THE BOOK! I am currently living in Spain and many of the dishes I have created from this book are extremely similar to dishes I have had in local resturants. In addition, the recipes are quite easy to cook--only a few steps for each recipe.Don't think that merely becuase you don't live in Spain that this book would not be useful to you. The book provides information on where to get many of the Spanish food products in the recipes. Also, many recipes use food products easily available in the U.S. (or you can find very similar substitutes in the U.S.)I am EXTREMELY happy with this purchase."},{"Title":"The New Spanish Table","review":"I have several Spanish book but this one caught my eye because of the comments about it by Steven Raichlen and Bobby Flay. The introductions to many recipes and more gave it a book an instant feel that it was just more then a book filled with recipe and photos. It is compilation of rich recipes recipes written by leading Spanish chefs that give an insight into the heart, soul and food of the many different regions of Spain and their unique food. The recipes have photos and include mini- essays that guide you through the directions. Some recipes are simple others take time and include a lengthy list of ingredients. But the recipes range from tapas, to soups, meat, shellfish, fish, stews and much more. Empanadas, paellas, egg dishes, rices and pasta salads and many more are included.

Now I really want read more classic Nesbit books!"},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"The work itself was excellent, worth five stars! E. Nesbit is a fascinating author, with a whimsical style reminiscent of our own adventures as children. The only facet of this particular edition I did not like is that some of the punctuation (I think it was - dashes,) didn't show up on my iPod, which made reading a little difficult (and made the sentences seem more like run-ons). In short, the work was excellent, but the transcribers to electronics should have picked a dash that rendered better."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"My 7 year old really enjoyed the book; much of it was a bit over the head of my five year old. It reminded us of \\"Five Children and It,\\" by the same author (which we liked much better, by the way, definitely a worthwhile read). This seemed to drag in places. The 4 stars are for the book content itself. We read this on the Kindle edition, and I'd give about 2 and a half stars for the poor editing. In some places sentences were improperly punctuated, and words were misspelled or omitted entirely. This poor proofing detracted from an out-loud reading and took much away from the story. I expect an occasionally misused or misspelled word, but in this text there were more than 10 in the book."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"When three children discover a castle, a sleeping princess, and a magic ring over their summer holiday, what they find are magics false and true and tricky, beginning them on a rambling journey of enchanted adventure. The Enchanted Castle is a book of fluff and whimsy, but it's not without heart. Much of the plot is the near-episodic doing and undoing of mischievous magics--tales of \\"be careful what you wish for,\\" but never quite in the way either characters or audience expect. Characterization is slightly more colorful than realistic, and Nesbit's voice is wry, humorous, and hugely enjoyable to read--and while it's antiquated, that serves to make it quaint rather than unapproachable. These adventures are simply fun, and the book's other aspects help to sustain their longevity, but for me they nonetheless began to run a little long. It's not that aren't some wonderful moments: it's just that they begin to run together after a while, with too little forward movement to give them purpose. Luckily the book's final third revives it, rediscovering the plot to give the story backbone. And what a plot it is: there's still plenty of fluff and fun and silly character interaction, but the truth of the remarkable enchanted castle is original and gently breathtaking. In the end, sprinkled selectively within the froth are a few sympathetic events, some beautiful images, and true enchantment--which is never a small thing to find, and in The Enchanted Castle it twinkles brilliantly from the hidden corners of our own real world. This book is engaging, color, clever, unusual, and well stands the test of time--and though its architecture was not always to my personal taste, I enjoyed it. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"Four English children discover the magic of a ring, a castle, true love, and many adventures. How amazing that over 100 years later this story still enchants children and adults alike. The mix of magic with everyday life is brilliant! My children and I enjoyed reading this story that inspired other fabulous authors like C.S. Lewis. We're grateful for Nesbit's creativity that not only kept us spellbound, but also opened the way for many of the modern fantasy books that we love."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"I read this book more than fifty years ago when I was a child and have never forgotten it. How wonderful it is to see that it is available at Amazon! It has everything...humor, mystery, a little bit of romance, but best of all...MAGIC!"},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"This is a really enjoyable work, truly magical. I just wish we had more children's books like this one and more writers like Edith Nesbit. The children discover a magic ring but their wishes come true in a way they never wanted or expected. One of the best children's books I have read."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"This turn-of-the century children's classic proves a gentle fantasy in the style of her FIVE CHILDREN AND IT. Typical of her fantasy stories these children learn the hard way that wishes are not really free--that sooner or later there is a price to be paid. In this tale three siblings and a neighbor girl (who pretends to be a princess) find themselves relatively free of adult supervision one summer in the English countryside. Obviously the lack of parents and guardians is a critical element for the juvenile protagonists to have the freedom to explore both the physical and magical realms; they quickly realize that no sane adult will take seriously their explanations or narrations of fantastic events.Gerald, the eldest and a born commander (who imagines himself the hero of a novel which he is writing aloud) leads his sister Kathleen and little brother, Jimmy, on quests of exploration into surreal realms. But it is the acquaintance of Mable, the niece of a housekeeper at a nearby castle, who proves the catalyst for a summer of magic, since it was She who discovered a magic ring amid a secret horde of undreamed of treasure--at least she Claims the ring is magic. Inevitably during thecourse of this novel each child Must have a turn to try on the magic ring--with curious, amusing, awkward and even dangerous results. Gerald'sresourcefulness and courage are tested often during 12 long chapters.As in other Nesbit's fantasies the children soon learn the pitfalls of making thoughtless or unintentional wishes. But all literary children seem destined to learn the price of magic the hard way. Despite the absence of the parents and Mable's aunt there are some adults of interest in the story, adults who have a Past and whose star-crossed paths finally cross in the magic gardens, where stone statues come alive in the moonlight--to be witnessed by special folks only. Related with dainty digs at current affairs and social behavior THE ENCHANTED CASTLE provides is a modest stage for the author to express her personal positions and observations of women's and children's roles in a male-dominated world. Despite the typically Victorian attempts to instill Manners into her young readers E. Nesbit's resulting work offers many moments of unexpected humor. With its homespun quaintness it is arguable how much this book will appeal to 21 century young adults. The entire story is enhanced by the delightful pen-and-ink sketches of H. R. Miller in this Puffin Classics edition."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"Like most children's fantasy adventures, this one begins with several displaced children, removed from their usual situation due to unfortunate events, and finding their independence in new surroundings. In this case, Gerald, Jimmy and Kathleen find themselves staying at Kathleen's school over the summer holidays in the care of her French teacher. But adventure is on the way, as soon they find a secret path into a beautiful garden where a young princess lies asleep in the centre of a hedge maze.Of course, it's not real princess, only the housekeeper's niece, but soon her games of make-believe come astonishingly real as the children discover that her ring is really magical and capable of granting any wish they desire! Of course, being children their wishes usually lead them to trouble; and in a book full of living statues, dinosaurs, headless ghosts, burglars, embodied clothing, accelerated growth, invisibility, and reunited lovers, there is plenty for the children to handle and for readers to discover.Edith Nesbit is one of the masters of children's literature, and is therefore virtually unknown. Published nearly one hundred years ago, E. Nesbit was a Bohemian liberal and philanthropist with a wicked sense of humour and a respect for children that shines in her thoughtful, realistic portrayal of them in her novels. Though some of the language is a bit dated (yet for me, phrases like \\"jolly good!\\" and \\"what a brick!\\" are part of the charm), the main appeal found within her books is the humour and wit with which the children behave and react to the magical events. Here it is Gerald's habit of narrating the situation, Jimmy's subversive comments concerning his siblings, Kathleen's worrywart nature and Mabel's insistence that she's brave though she speaks: \\"with the tone of the truly terror-stricken.\\"Almost secondary to this portrayal of children's habits is the magical components of the ring that Mabel finds in the secret treasury of Yaldhurst Towers. Making several wayward wishes, the children gradually discover some of the rudimentary rules surrounding the ring and its powers whilst attempting to rectify the problems that they get themselves into. Nesbit's melding of normal life and magic is the defining feature of her work, and for the first few chapters the reader is kept in suspense of what's real and what's not. As we get into the more magical components of the story, Nesbit moves from terror-filled scares to comedic escapades to beautiful moments of mysticism, written in a dreamy poetic prose. At all times Nesbit writes in a conversationalist tone, with an ongoing commentary on the nature of facts and magic.There are some things that could have used some more work, such as a more detailed background story on the ring and its properties. Nesbit has the children realise some fundamental facts about it; such as the time limit on its wishes, the way it removes fear from the wearer and the behavioural changes it creates in the wearer's loved ones, but never explains how and why the ring has these particular traits or where it originally comes from. The golden rule of any fantasy book is for its magical components to have a basic set of rules - if not the book runs the risk of feeling random. In this case the children help to balance the more surreal magical elements, but a few more details on the ring and its origins would have help make the magical storyline a bit more stable.E. Nesbit is one of the finest children's authors out there. If you haven't already, then give her a go as she's published plenty of great books. \\"The Enchanted Castle\\" is a great place to start."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"I read this as a homeschooled 13 yr old. For me, the reading level was extremely easy--but the story was neat. Nesbit has some cool ideas, but . . . I guess her style just isn't what I like. I think I'd recommend this for a read-aloud to younger children. Nesbit *does* has a wonderfully developed imagination!"},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"Working in a bookstore, I meet a lot of people, especially parents buying books for their children. As you can imagine, several of them ask, \\"What do you have that's like Harry Potter?\\" I always recommend E. Nesbit's books. They never know who I'm talking about. But they usually become interested very quickly.Edith Nesbit was an outspoken British writer who wrote enormously entertaining children?s books in her later years. Many of these books combine normal, everyday children with magical themes or elements. In 'The Enchanted Castle,' three children - Gerald, Cathy, and Jimmy - stumble upon a lush, beautiful garden, where they find a princess who has been asleep for 100 years. Or is she really who she says she is? All the children know is that something strange is going on - like why are the statues moving?'The Enchanted Castle' IS enchanting. The writing is colorful, exciting, and engaging. If your child is looking for something in the Harry Potter vein, the E. Nesbit books are just what the doctor ordered. Kids won't even care that it was written nearly 100 years ago. It still reads pretty well today, and that's what counts.291 pages"},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"My children and I have been reading this as our bedtime book. My son, age 8, was going to read it himself, but we soon found his sister, age 6, wanted me to read it instead (so I could do the \\"voices\\") so it has been turned into the nightly story. The characters: Gerald, Kathleen, and Jimmy are each drawn clearly and individually. My children are fascinated with Gerald's way of speaking as though he were telling a story. And they love Kathleen's way of alternating between being practical and yet longing for all things \\"magical\\". Jimmy is funny and endearing, as he is at that age of Not believing and yet eager for adventure. Their friend Mabel is full of mystery and make-believe and soon pulls them into a grand escapade. The author is able to vividly paint each person and each scene. It is with great reluctance we put the book down after a couple of chapters each night, wanting to finish all at once, but wanting the magic to last a little longer. When we finished, we all decided it was one of our favorites. Extremely well written. I did not find even the beginning dull or slow. From start to finish, this is one of the best children's books I've found. And we've read very many."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"Although written around a century ago, this still remains one of the great classics of Children's literature. I have not read Harry Potter yet, but I would suspect this book is at least comparable. The plot is actually fairly complex -- there's humor, drama, romance, and magic. It can be read by both children and adults and both will enjoy it.The story deals with a number of children who find a magic ring that can make your wishes come true. But this only gives a small idea of the wonders that lie within.Other great Nesbit works -- Five Children and It, The Phoenix and the Carpet."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"I first read this book at the age of 10, and have made a point of reading it again nearly yearly ever since, for more than 30 years. It is timeless and magical, and for adults as well as children, as long as they have kept their childhood beliefs in enchantment alive. I am not in the habit of gushing praise, but this is absolutely the best book I have ever read, and has become a part of my children's lives as well. I am so happy to see it in print again. My mother searched everywhere for it in the 60's because I was so enamored with it that I wanted to copy it by hand, if necessary. I am now ordering a new untattered copy to keep forever."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"This book is a wonderful, magical read. I got it because I watched the BBC adaptation as a child, and loved it. It's a story of magic, childhood and friendship, but more than it it captures the magic of the unknown - the statues that come alive, and the sense of adventure and mystery that every child knows. The story of the Ugli-Wuglies is truly creepy, but necessary - theres too much tendency these days to protect children from anything that might scare them - its good for them to be scared occasionally, they'll come to learn that the real world is far more frightening place. When you read it later as an adult, there's the theme of love, and the pain of love lost and the fact the that nothing is free, everything has to be paid for ultimately. The only reason I deducted a star is that, enchanting though it is, it lacks the depth or richness of, say, Phillipa Pearce's &quot;Tom's Midnight Garden&quot;. All the same, still a children's classic, and every child should have the opportunity to read it."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"This book launched a whole subgenre--fantasy books in which a group of three to five children (usually mixed gender) cross the boundry between the everyday world into the world of fantasy. It is the inspiration behind CS Lewis's Narnia books, Edward Eager's books, and generations of more recent novels. And it happens to be a wonderful read! My eight-year-old adored it--she's a huge Harry Potter fan (another series in Nesbit's debt) and thought this one was fabulous, though the Victorian language did slow her down a little."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"A wonderful, wonderful book. One of the best things about it is that it creates a true, multi-dimensional, believable moral universe. This book steers clear both of the syrupy too-goodness of the Little Lord Fauntleroy and the moral blah-ness of Harry Potter. HP's world (and I've read all of them except for the last politically-correct one) is morally flat; villains do terrible things simply because they are villains, and while racism is appropriately execrated, lying does not even register as a moral choice: everyone does it, including figures of authority like Dumbledore, without a moment's thought. In contrast, in The Enchanted Castle things like lying, stealing, courage vs. cowardice, kindness vs. meanness to others are not assumed away but processed, reflected on: was this lying and when is it OK to lie, was he kind to her just then, etc. And the quality of the writing is outstanding, the language is a delight. This is Literature... HP is mere fiction."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"I loved \\"The Enchanted Castle.\\" It has the same quality that is in all of Edith Nesbit's books--thought provoking and fun. I really like how in all of Edith's books, her characters find out that magic can be annoying when you meddle with it. In other books, like Harry Potter and The Gammage Cup, you seem to get the idea that magic is essential.In the Enchanted Castle, the characters are Mable, the houskeepers niece, Gerald, the one who knows how to manage grownups, Kathleen, \\"Cathy Puss Cat,\\" and Jimmy, who is always thinking about his tea. Of course, there are other characters, but I would use up about 6 pages writing them all.The children find a magic ring that makes you invisible, four meters tall, and is a wishing ring--as well as other things like that. The ring helps them earn money, get into scrapes, and bring two old lovers together again!"},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"The children of Edgar Eager's imagination think so and I'm inclined to agree with them. This one has it all, a sleeping princess, a garden labyrinth, an enchanted castle, not to mention a summer in an abandoned school supervised only by a darling French teacher. Wait, that&#65533;s only the first two chapters! Truly this is my favorite of Nesbit&#65533;s magic novels featuring her trademark plucky heroine (times two), complicated persnickety magic, and a sequence of misadventures each more inventive and hilarious than the last. The unexpected (and often disastrous) well intentioned exploits in the style of the Railway Children and the Wouldbegoods are delightfully combined with the fantasy of The Magic City and Five Children and It. Simply required reading for any child or adult with the slightest bit of soul."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"I first read this book when I was 11 and fell in love with it. I am re-reading it now and love it more than before. Her descriptions of the children's feelings, the way she describes their conversations (they weren't always agreeing with each other!). This book is funny, heart warming, imaginative and everything else wonderful!"},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"This read by my 12 year old daughter. She is an avid reader, but couldn't \\"get into\\" this. She says it was a bit dull. Only read one chapter."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"This book is a really good book. It has many stories to keep you entertained. This book has stories for many diffrent people. It has roamance and lots of flowers. you will certainly enjoy this book of fabls anf myths!"},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"Don't purchase this reprint from Wilder Publications. The punctuation and type-setting is a complete mess. Many punctuation marks are missing, while others are in the wrong place. Some paragraphs don't start where they should, others start where they shouldn't. It would be very frustrating for a child to try to read this reprint, so even at this price, it's not worth it. I'm going to purchase another edition for my girls and recycle this one."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"A wonderfully written and highly enjoyable book. The author and characters feel like old family friends as you make it further and further in your book."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"Story overview:---------------Three children--Gerald, James, and Kathleen--away on holiday, discover a country estate that resembles a castle. Having believed it really was a caste, the children were fooled by an enchanted princess. The princess, Mabel, turns out to be nothing more than the housekeeper's niece. However, while in the mist of her performance, Mabel happens across a ring. A magical ring.At first, the children believe the ring's only power is to turn the wearer invisible. However, as their escapades increase (including detective work, a carnival show, and scaring the maid) the ring is found out to be a wishing ring.After wishing more trouble upon themselves than good (such as turning clothes into real people), the four children learn of the ring's true origins and the mysteries behind the place known as The Enchanted Castle.My thoughts:-------------I'm surprised that I haven't come across this book before now. Not that it is any great masterpiece mind you, but there are markings of a classic here. At first, I was fooled into thinking this was a typical fairy tale, but was happily surprised by the modern day twist (that is, modern day for 1907). There were places where I found the plot to move slower than I like, but overall the originality and freshness of the tale had me reading to the end.Things to consider:------------------As mentioned, this was published in 1907. That means it is technically a Victorian novel. With Victorian novels comes a style of writing not seen much in modern books. However, this one happens to be written fairly clear in comparison to many of its kind. The most difficult thing for some American readers might be the use of British slang, but overall it was easy enough for me to follow. Not much in the way of questionable content. No use of foul language, sexual situations, or violence. Good for both girls and boys in their teens. Perhaps younger if a parent were to read it to them.James D.

I have had trouble in the past getting into books of this age because of the word choices and writing styles of the time, but this one easily overcomes that common problem. There will be a few odd expressions of the day that will need explaining, but they are slight and the kids of this book are real and human and anyone today would relate to them.Pick it up and have yourself a wild, fun and exciting ride."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and I consider it to be Edith Nesbit's best work. The children behave like real children and the plot is full of wonderful magic. The story of how the children made an audience for their theater production out of broomsticks and umbrellas is most charming and endearing. And what happens to that audience after the play is wonderful. It is tragic that not many people know of Edith Nesbit's works. They deserve better. All playwrites and screen writers take note. You could do a lot worse than writing a script based on the works of Edith Nesbit, especially the enchanted castle."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"The Enchanted Castle was a great book with delightful characters that act out a memorible tale of magic, imagination, and mystery. My favorite picture in the book was the one of the children following the red string that is attached to the girl's finger. My favorite part in the book was when the girl claims that the ring makes it's wearer invisible, and then her fib becomes a reality. All in all, I think that this a book will be shared and passed down generation to generation"},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"I had many mixed feelings about this book. I really like the plot of this story. I also really like how the author explained all the details about a main point and she didn't just assume that you knew what something was or what was going on. She also described the characters very well. Especially the &quot;princess&quot;. She explained how the dress looked and how her face looked in great detail. It really made me have a feeling of what the princess looked like. What I didn't like was how confusing some parts of the story were. When the author was talking about the gargoyles in the story, unless you read it word by word it didn't make any sense. I also liked how she didn't have a lot of details that didn't relate to the story. It kept me on track with the book and it helped me want to keep reading it. This book also had a lot of different kinds of story types. It sort of had mystery like when they were invisible and they were listening to secret plans. It had even more fantasy than anything else. I liked how the ring in the story opened up many doors for the children to explore and helped them learn what the real power was of some things. I really liked the children that were in this book because they all had some of the same things with there personality but in other ways they were all totally different. That made me want to learn more about all the children. This was overall a pretty good book. I would like to read other book's of her's too. I think it would be fun to compare."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"The reason I only gave this book 4 stars is because of out of the 5 Edith Nesbit Books I have read so far...this is my least favourite. I think it is beacuase of how it is written. It, to me, was lacking something all the other books she wrote have. I also did not particularly enjoy the beginning of the book, as it started out dull etc. But as it went on...I fell in love with the four children. One thing that is very evident in this book is the thing of good magic. Evrything thing seems to be filled with it, therefore making the story all the better and all more exciting. I loved how it showed each of there adventures, and each of there luck with the magic ring. I also got a few laughs out of the children's injinuity. This is truly a classic, but not my favourite Nesbit book. It certainly is worth getting though."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"A wonderful tale by E. Nesbit great for children of any age! Imaginative as are all of E. Nesbit tales."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"It seems, so far to be pretty cool. It's about like a Harry Potter book but no fighting in it."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"A wonderful, fairly innocent adventure involving four children and fantastic imagination. Builds on classics, but reading those first certainly isn't necessary.This is definitely a read-aloud book for kids with longer attention spans and more extensive vocabulary. Since the book was written in the \\"proper voice\\" of a woman of the turn of the 20th Century, the language can get a bit weighty and the vocabulary is certainly more advanced than that used by most of us these days, but we got over it by reading with a bit of a \\"stuffy attitude.\\" We pretended to be \\"propah\\" (imagine an accent there) ladies when we read this aloud.I read much of it aloud...when I could peel it out of the hands of our 6 year old precocious reader.The 4-year-old (precocious verbalist) was less enthralled due in large part, I believe, to the vocabulary and style of writing."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"Let's get one thing straight: under normal circumstances, I would not have read this book. But one of my friends was telling me that I had a deprived childhood since I didn't read it. Fine, I said, I'll read it. Was I pleasantly surprised! This book is a delight for adults and children alike. I was so impressed with the way that E. Nesbit had captured the essences of the children down to the very last detail. And the scenes that she presented seemed like they had come out of a dream. The characters were heartening and the story was so elaboartely woven that I marvled. You won't be dissappointed."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"One of the warmest, most inventive, and genuinely interesting children's books ever written. You can't go wrong reading this to your child - it's easily the best of its genre and should inspire a fair bit of imaginative energy in any kid. Nesbit's characters are belieavable, mischevious, and good-hearted, all in ways that never come across as saccharine or flat. The best book by the best writer."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"I picked this up because another favorite author, Edward Eager, says it was E. Nesbit who inspired all of his incredible works. What a wonderful decision I made! Nesbit does not condescend to her reader, whatever their age, and has written an enchanting tale of the magic that can happen withn you believe. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"I've always been enraptured by children's books with magic in them, especially when the author writes about ordinary children, weaving magic into the plot with such ease that it's entirely believable.I found this book in a collection of my granddaughter's childhood books, was out of reading material, so picked it up just for a quick glance. Well, that \\"quick glance\\" turned into several hours of pure reading pleasure as I followed elder brother Gerald, his sister Kathleen, and younger brother Jimmy through a cave that ends in a magical garden surrounding an enchanted castle.When they meet a \\"sleeping princess\\" who is not really a princess, but the niece of ... well, that would be a spoiler if I told you more, so I'll refrain from temptation.Who is this mysterious girl named Mable who leads them on a tour of the castle, showing them some of its mysteries? Are the jewels she conjures real or figments of their imagination? What does a magical ring have to do with it? And how do they become invisible? And just where is the elusive owner of the castle and what connection does he have with the French mistress of Kathleen's school who is in charge of the children for the summer?Those questions and more are answered by this fantastic author, Edith Nesbitt, in the most charming, believable way. Her writing style is impeccable.This children's classic was written almost a century before the great HARRY POTTER books, with the adventures being just as original and exciting. THE ENCHANTED CASTLE has everything, including a heart-breaking, old-fashioned love story.This book held me captive from beginning to end and is written in the style of Edith Nesbit's most popular book, FIVE CHILDREN AND IT!A must read for all kids ... and kids at heart, like you and me!"},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"This book is such a delight - funny, imaginative and engaging. I love the humor that E.Nesbit always has (enjoyable for both adults and kids) but I really loved the world she created - the amazing garden with it's visitors. The images still remain with me in the same way that I'll never forget Dr. Doolittle's garden. I think that's a sign of a great book. Other books by Nesbit are more well known but I'd recommend this book before any others. I hope someone makes a film of this book - it would be magical. Anything so that more people would get a chance to enjoy this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"Possibly one of the greatest &quot;for children of all ages&quot; books of all time - Nesbit practically invented the genre and in this book she achieved her greatest heights. The Enchanted Castle is a true classic and essential for anyone wanting to give children a sense of wonder and maybe a little joy in the process."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"This book was the first book I had ever read by Edith Nesbit, and I thought it was such a wonderful style that she had. The little things that were so right on for me about the silly things kids do. (I shouldn't talk, I am a kid) I don't necessarily read her books for the subject matter, I read them for the way she writes them. This is one of five of the other books I've read by her, and I plan to get more at the library."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"I can't believe this book was written over a hundred years ago! Wow. It's still sooo good. Some kids may take a bit of time getting used to, and understanding, the English as spoken at the time, but after 30 or so pages, it won't be a big deal. But note, there are some pretty old-fashioned and bizarre turns of the phrase; for today's American kids anyway. Strong characters, funny situations, good story, nice resolution and really great writing make this a must-read. Cheerio."},{"Title":"The enchanted castle,","review":"I found this book in a thrift store last week, and thougt it looked interesting, so I bought. I cannot think of any time I have gotten more for my 75 cents. I was truly amazed at the quality of this book. Mrs. Nesbit has the same magical writing ability as C. S. Lewis. I would not be very surprised if I were to learn that Lewis got some of his ideas for the Narnian Chronicles from this book, as there are many similarities.This book seemed very much like a book Lewis would have written, though it is lacking his Christian ideas and themes. The characters are amazingly good, as each of the four children has a very unique personality, and it is very interesting to see how each person responds to the situations that arise. I must say that Gerald is one of the best characters in fiction in a very long time. He ranks up there with Mr. Bennet of Pride and Prejudice.I have encountered very few writers that write truly magical stories. By this I mean that they write stories that somehow feel real. They make an adult feel like a child again while the story lasts. Such authers would be C. S. Lewis, George MacDonald, Susan Cooper, and newly arrived into my elite group, Edith Nesbit. I am very eager to find more of her work in the hopes that it will be just as good.Overall grade: A+"},{"Title":"Classified: How to Stop Hiding Your Privilege and Use It for Social Change!","review":"Books that speak honestly about class priviledge are few and far between. Books that speak honestly about class priviledge in a voice that is completely grounded and are BOTH thought-provoking and good for lots of laughs AND throw in a super-practical guide to using your own resources for social justice are, well, this just might be the very first one.This book covers alot of uncomfortable territory (class, money, family dynamics) in a totally approachable and supportive-yet-challenging way. The graphics and comic strips alone will pull you in, and, while primarily aimed at younger folks with access to wealth, there are several parts of this book that will resonate with a much wider audience."},{"Title":"Classified: How to Stop Hiding Your Privilege and Use It for Social Change!","review":"Classified will be a classic resource for people with class privilege who want to create social change. I love the book for it's concise clear language, sense of humor and the concrete possibilities it provides for taking action. It is truly inspiring.There is no other book like Classified. I have longed for a book like this and am so happy it has arrived. After reading it, I bought 10 copies and gave it to friends. This is a book to not only buy for yourself but to share with others. While it is geared towards young people, anyone who is trying to understand how to create social change from a position of privilege (especially class privilege) will learn from its insights.

(The Matrix Re-Invested was hilarious.)Any young person with money--earned, inherited, or to-be-inherited--or anyone who grew up with class privilege should read this book! I think it would also be a helpful and entertaining read for anyone who works with or lives with young people with money and class privilege: community organizers, fund-raisers, college students and professors, activists, financial advisors, wealth coaches...This book totally changed the way I think about money, privilege, class, and the role they play in my life.

However, I think that in this story following the end of the Formic War, he focused too much on Bean and Archiles and not enough on Peter. I think that if this book would have been writen with Peter in mind for the main character it would have been a lot better.As much as I like Bean, I don't like Archiles. Not because it's a character that I don't like because of his personality, but because I didn't like him in Ender's Shadow. Somehow Peter doesn't make Battle School because he's too aggressive, but they administer this kid in there even though he was older and had a gimp leg (they fixed that I know). But nonetheless, Card makes Archiles way too powerful, and it takes away from the story.It's a good read, but dissapointed me as it could have been much better."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"As always, I am amazed at the levels OSC writes his books on. On the first level, this book is about child geniouses who have enough control on earth that they can get into ruling positions. Not only do they rule countries, but they vie to rule the world. Although this makes for interesting reading, it has other levels to add value. On another level, this book shows the personal introspection that we should all attempt as we try to understand all the hard questions in life. Forays into our on consciousness to try to understand ourselves are not common, but they are vital. Another aspect is the struggle we sometimes face between choosing what we believe to be the lesser of two evils, when life has us trapped. Bean did not know what he should do, support a power hungry despot to save a loved one. Or try to do it alone and possibly fail. Although none of us may face a choice of such magnitude in our lives, we are faced with difficult decisions, and wisdom alone guides us through them. This book was a terrific story and a good read, with value in the deeper levels as well. It took place in a world with several factions struggling for dominance, much like the game of risk, a favorite of mine. ..."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I found this book much less appealing then Ender's Game. The character interactions are totally predictable, the fictional world geopolitical situation from the other hand totally artificial in order to bring Risk-like game to life. Still is good reading if you are Ender's fan."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I love to read Orson Scott Card because regardless of the specific story, it is the shared humanity of his characters that make the stories so enjoyable to read. As in the previous books in this series, the joy for the reader comes in the development of his characters and their interaction with each other. Other reviewers have described the story, so I will limit my review to the following: I always feel like I have learned something important about the way we interact with each other after I have read a Card story. I feel like a better person. Card uses his stories to teach us a larger truth without resorting to preachiness. Shadow of the Hegemon continues in this tradition as the reader is left thinking about more than the story at hand. Highly reccomended."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I really liked it, because almost all of my favorite characters were there. It was very dramatic and really pulls you in after the first couple of pages and you can't put in down because you want to know what happens to Bean, Petra and the rest of Ender's crew from the 3rd invasion. Both Bean and Petra come back but they are older and try tp fit back into their old lives where it seems they might not beable to. You meet Peter Wiggin(Locke) and the Parents of the Wiggin kids."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Don't fall prey to the nitpicking reviews that crab Card for the odd error, or supposedly flat military strategy and the like. This is a great book and a fun read that takes you back to first time you read Ender's Game. Favorite passages of mine are Card's musings on how nobody understands anyone else's motivations and his slamming of the American &quot;intellectual community.&quot; If I were to criticize this book at all, I would say it's a bit too short, and seems to rush to the finish at the end. He promises two more books in the series, but I think he/the publisher could have expanded this book a bit. Nevertheless, a strong entry from Card into a series that by and large has been terrific (I confess, Children of the Mind, failed to hold my interest.)"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I finally got around to reading this book, and I was not disappointed. As is usual for Card, both the plot and the characters are exceptionally well developed, and he provides plenty of places where the reader is forced to actually think and/or confront his own preconceptions on an idea. All in all, this is almost always an excellent book. Why the almost? It seemed as if Card sometimes felt the urge to get a little bit too preachy. Near the beginning of the book, a paragraph was included almost at random about how JFK wasn't really as good of a president as people thought he was. Why? It didn't seem particularly relevant to the situation at hand, so it seems likely Card just wanted to mention that idea and work it in to the book some way, any way he possibly could. Also, there was one particular plot &quot;mystery&quot; that Card kept building up to, only to reveal that it was one he already revealed in Ender's Shadow. It might have been necessary to the plot, but Card could have worked it in a little better and given less emphasis to the surprise factor."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"In Ender's Game, a masterwork, Card invents three highly memorable characters: Ender Wiggin, and his siblings, Valentine and Peter. In Ender's Shadow, Card takes a relatively minor character, Bean, and gives us a new focus on Ender. It works reasonably well because we love Ender. Bean would probably not be worth writing about himself. Yet, Card insists on doing so in Shadow of the Hegemon. Bean dominates, along with Petra and Achilles, two characters we could, frankly, care less about. They are cardboard cut outs. Peter, Peter, is the character we want to see, now that Valentine and Ender are out of the picture. Yet we see little of him. The book lurches suddenly to life, albeit briefly, when an adolescent Peter slides into a seat beside Bean and his mentor, Carlotta. The momentum is too soon lost. Card reveals in the epilogue that he allowed the Petra/Achilles storyline to capture him, and postpone the Peter/Bean interaction to another book. Our loss, and our waste of money. The book is a shadow, and no Hegemon."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"SHADOW OF THE HEGEMON is yet another worthy episode in Orson Scott Card's excellent series about the Formic War and its consequences. While this book is not as good as ENDER'S GAME or even its immediate predecessor ENDER'S SHADOW, it is still a great read.Bean, otherwise known as Julian Delphiki, has now returned to Earth after being discharged from Battle School. When several of his classmates are kidnapped, Bean must figure out who is doing it, why, and how he can help. Eventually, Bean's adversary Achilles surfaces as the major antagonist, and Bean must deal with his own history as he attempts to figure out how to rescue Petra Arkanian, his closest friend at Battle School.Card has woven an intricate plot, with international themes and some religious undertones, though SHADOW OF THE HEGEMON is not nearly as religious as the last three Ender novels XENOCIDE, SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD, and CHILDREN OF THE MIND. Bean is still the arrogant, confident mastermind who was responsible for many of the innovative plans Ender used to conquer the Buggers in the Formic War, only this time he is working to save his friends. Peter Wiggin, Ender's older brother, is working to put himself in a position to assume the title of Hegemon and lead Earth to worldwide peace, and Bean must assist him, fully knowing that the difference between Peter Wiggin and Achilles is less than one would desire but enough to make a world of difference.Card has again written a book with an almost impossible premise (children so brilliant that they hold the future of the human race in their hands), but he writes it so well that one barely notices the improbable aspects of the plot. SHADOW OF THE HEGEMON continues the Ender/Bean saga very well, drawing ethical and theological concerns into the narrative seamlessly and effortlessly. This book is worth your time, especially if you enjoyed any of the other books dealing with these characters."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I haven't yet finished this book, but so far it is pretty good. However, all of my enjoyment is ruined by turning each page. every time you turn the page the words are either a sentence ahead or behind where the previous page ended,forcing you to constantly search for your place over and over again.I wish i could give this book a better review. And i might, after i get a refund for the ebook and buy a real one."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"\\"Petra Arkanian. The only girl in Salamander Army. With more balls than anybody else in the room.\\"When Petra so modestly introduced herself to Ender inEnder's Game, I sorta fell in love with her right there. So here's the thing: I first read Ender's Game many years ago and as a girl, I naturally took a special interest in Valentine and Petra even though their characters weren't given nearly as much development and face time as the star of the show, Ender. Still, I vividly remembered both characters, particularly Petra, the smartass military genius and only girl commander in Ender's jeesh. It was only recently that I learned that there were a crapload of sequels to Ender's Game and I wasted no time in reading them all, as I was excited to revisit these characters, especially Petra.Shadow of the Hegemon is the 2nd book in the Shadow series, which heavily features Bean, Petra, Peter and Achilles (if you want to read the sequels that follow Ender and Valentine, then start withSpeaker for the Dead (Ender, Book 2), although be warned: it is very, very different from what you'll be expecting. But still great.) Anyway, I loved this book. I don't know if my opinion is colored too much by my nostalgia over Ender's Game, but whatever, I loved it, mainly because I got to see so much of my girl Petra.Of course, I wouldn't say this book is perfect. There are some things I wish could have been different. *slight spoiler* I wish Petra didn't have to be rescued (or at least, I wish she could have been a little more involved in the rescue. It felt like the author kind of just forgot about her halfway through the book). Then there's Peter. His character was so deliciously evil in Ender's Game. There was so much Card could have done with that! but to me, it all sort of fizzled and Peter just didn't feel all that impressive anymore. The book is chock full of political maneuvering and military strategy, which, while very interesting, can get tedious at times. There are also some long winded dialogues that feel preachy.But none of those things were deal breakers for me. If you liked Ender's Game, I'd say to definitely give the Shadow series a try."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I love all of these Orson Scott Card Books all of his books are a great read. thank you very much!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This is the 2nd time I have read this book, and I enjoyed it just as much as the first time.

Give it a try."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I enjoyed this book and all of the Shadow Series as well as the Ender Series. Orson Scott Card is a great writer."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Card does a great job of keeping the Bean story going in Shadow of the Hegemon. It was very exciting to read, and after a slow start, had me hooked. I really enjoyed that they continued the story of battle school. And how the grads would be used in military planning around the globe. I highly suggest this book to anyone that liked Enders Shadow."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I loved both \\"Ender's Game\\" and \\"Ender's Shadow\\", so I was definitely ready for this one. Overall, I liked it very much... as a narrative. Certainly a must-read for fans of the earlier books.A persistent problem, though, is that it doesn't really work as believable \\"future history\\". I had very much looked forward to Card's vision of Earth's political and social situation circa 2150 A.D. But it seemed as if he's off by a century. The geopolitics and the the state of technology and society struck me as being more in line with 2050... if not earlier. Additionally, there are some plot twists and situations that struck me as wholely implausible, but it would be a \\"spoiler\\" to describe them here. Let it suffice to say that the way some nations behave in this book is not very believable.But like I said, it was a good read. I like Bean very much, and Sister Carlotta is much more fleshed out here. The next book should be just as good... and I hope even better."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I love orson scott card's books, especialy Ender's Shadow, so i waited eagerly for the sequel. while not as good as the first, i wasnt disapointed. the book was suspenseful and very intersting. while the long descriptions of India, pakistan, and thailand's political history got a little boring, Petra's interactions with achilles and bean's with sister carlotta, were great. while its not exactly what i hoped for, Shadow of the Hegemon is a terrific book that provides a great lead-in to the next sequel."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Once again, Card has done it and this time he's done even more by answering so many questions that were left open in Speaker of the Dead. We get more insight into what makes Peter, the ignored Wiggin tick and how he managed to gain his influential position. With more fascinating characters and background, the second Shadow adds more depth to the Ender series. Can't wait for the remaining ones!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Probably a book for die-hard Ender/Card fans only. \`Shadow of the Hegemon' takes the reader into territory that Card hasn't previously explored in the ever-growing Ender series. The novel is set back on Earth after Ender has been fled to the stars. Superficially, the story follows Bean as he is forced to confront his nemesis, Achilles, who has kidnapped all the remaining Battle School children. Achilles plans to use the veterans of the Formic War to gain global domination for himself. But in all honesty, I don't think the book is about Bean. It's really about Peter and his equally ambitious ego: he too wants to rule the world. For Bean, an alliance with Peter is the lesser of the two evils.There are no aliens or spaceships or any other of the standard paraphernalia of Science Fiction. Card seems more subdued here - his trademark philosophical bent is less apparent than usual. The novel is more concerned with the machinations of international politics and war. It's a field Card seems to know well (see his Afterword). While \`Shadow of the Hegemon' is a bit of a departure from the norm for Card, it is a welcome and thoroughly enjoyable departure."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"The book is wonderful most of the way through (for those who enjoy books like the other novels in the series); however, there was very little closure. The main plot of the book details the post-formic wars, Bean's continuing relationship with Achilles, and Peter Wiggin's path to Hegemony."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"With Mr. Card, you either love him or you hate him, and most of the reviews of this book are in the 4 to 5 star range. But I couldn't finish this book. Card is beating the same dead horse over and over again: talented, but abused children rise up to best their betters (grown-ups) and win the day. However, I couldn't help but get the impression that Card's just writing to fulfull a contract or to wring as much blood out of the Ender turnip as he can. I never believed that these characters were children, nor could I get into their plight. I think I've out-grown Mr. Card's universe (as well as his turgid writing style). Mr. Card is writing pulp now. Perhaps he will improve with his Biblical fiction. That seems to be where his heart is anymore."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This book is a sore disappointment for those of us familiar with the Ender series. The characters are poorly developed and the plot has turned too predictable. The premise that humanity depends on a group of children no longer appears tenable--what appeared as a truly clever devise in &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; has now become implausible. Are we to continue to believe that 10 and 12 year old geniuses are capable of holding the respect of their 20 year old subordinates and of outsmarting the military high command? This just doesn't ring true.The &quot;Afterword&quot; in the book is downright bizarre. Card seems to have forgotten that he is writing escapist fiction--his ranting about how &quot;America is now a nation in decline, and my people have little will to be well led&quot; sounds like self-aggrandizing silliness. I'm surprised the editor allowed that in (a perk for a top selling author?). Card should stick to improving his craft (writing escapist fiction); if he can do that, perhaps the next installment will be back up to standard."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"First of all, the entire series is based on the fact that humanity would trust a brilliant child to lead them in warfare. The reviewer above who thought that these children coming back to lead nations was a ridiculous concept obviously does not understand the first book which he/she claims to have liked. Secondly, the issue of religious beliefs being entered in to this book which were never there before is also ridiculous. Read Ender's Game over again and you'll find very clearly there are references to religion in there...... Card's craftsmenship is flawless in this series, and his skill at dealing with human beings placed in moral situations--no matter how young or old is unrivaled. The best sci-fi author alive today period! Shadow of the Hegemon is a fine novel and continues in the excellent tradition of this series."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Orsen Scott Card has delivered another supurb novel, although he has change his genre. However, he has still managed to keep that same moral delimma/smart children style.Card's first book of the Ender quartet, Ender's Game, was a great hit. His combination of genius children, evil I.F. leaders, and space combat made a book that would make you think, but still be a fun read. The second book of the quartet, Speaker for the Dead, took a gigantic leap from action to science/discovery; and yet, for how much it changed, it still had the same feel to it and was very enjoyable to read. After completing his last two books(Xenocide and Children of the Mind)he took another huge leap and created a parallel story: the story of Ender's right hand man. Ender's Shadow(the story of Bean) was quite an origanal novel, even though it was a parallel to Ender's Game. It was a great book, and just begged for a sequel. Card, most likely knowing that he most likely could not create another like it, chose to write a more political book, instead.He titled his book Shadow of the Hegemon. His book focused on a world about to be torn apart by war. Russia has aquired Aqullies, a psychotic teenager with a hungry need for power. Ender's jeesh are starting to disappear and China is starting to again look like a super-power. Indian's and Thai play a huge role as well. This book is a must buy. Its political and moral dilemmas have again succeded in making this book an &quot;On-the-edge-of-your-seat-thriller&quot;. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"It suffers from a bit of lack of focus; the point of it is _strongly_ tied to &quot;shadowing,&quot; as we see:- Ender, on his way out of the solar system;- Peter, never quite actually attaining influence, even though this would _seem_ to be a book about him;- Bean, showing ongoing &quot;flawed-but-nonetheless extreme&quot; brilliance, as most nearly the main character, behind...- Achilles, the villain that apparently must be just as brilliant as the others.As the book nears its climax, it was most fascinating to see it focus not on some traditional &quot;First World&quot; geographic location, but rather Hyderabad, India, a city I had recently visited for the first time. (It is described as a major Indian Army site; the nearest I can find to confirm such is that there was considerable conflict there in around 1948.)The book tries a little too hard to evoke sympathy for the characterizations of too many characters; a bit more concentration would probably have been better.The other unfortunate thing is that the book draws to a climax right near the end, and the &quot;dissonant resolution&quot; shows that this is only a temporary resolution that MUST be followed by another book in the series. It's fine to leave the third movement of a concerto unresolved when the orchestra will immediately raise their instruments to bring on a resolving fourth movement. It's not so fine when the resolution involves waiting a year (or so) to get another book."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Well, Orson Scott Card is back again with another saga of the world run by pre-adolescents. His first book in the series, &quot;Enders Game&quot; was believable because Ender &amp; his siblings were so superior to everyone around them that they could be viewed as aberrations. The next three, &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, &quot;Xenocide&quot; &amp; &quot;Children of the Mind&quot; dealt primarily with adults so the genius kid wasn't an issue. Then came &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; which told the story of Bean, a member of Ender's &quot;jeesh&quot; in Battle-School. The brilliance displayed by the infant Bean was less than believable but accounted for by Bean's back-story (which I won't give away if you haven't read it yet). Now though we are presented with not only Bean, Ender, Peter &amp; Valentine as pre-pubescent saviors of humanity, we also get at least 10 other children manuevering politicians &amp; armies. Mr. Card has lost me here.The villain of both &quot;Shadows&quot; books is Achilles whom Bean has known since his days as a street kid in Rotterdam. Achilles is presented to the reader as an older street kid who originally was handicapped by a bad leg, &amp; has developed a nasty sort of underhanded cunning to compensate. While the fact that Rotterdams mean streets could produce 2 children equally brilliant in strategic thinking is difficult enough to accept (especially when malnourishment &amp; lack of education is taken into account), Achilles has somehow picked up a knowledge of classical literature along the way! The author completely lost this reader at that point.The adults in &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; exist only to achieve objectives for the children who command them, or else they give them moral lectures. Orson Scott Card's Mormonism becomes particularly obtrusive during the latter. At one point Mrs. Wiggins lectures Bean &amp; the reader on the joys of children (&amp; lots of them!) for a number of pages. Later, the reader will probably be laughing over the mental image of a small 11 year-old personally commanding a platoon of adults. The scene where Achilles brokers peace between Pakistan &amp; India is even more mind-blowing if not quite as funny to picture.Still, &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; gets 4 stars due to it's suspenseful writing, fast pace &amp; execution. I just hope Mr. Card is not burning himself out; each of his recent books seems successsively weaker than it's predecessor."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I can't say I was disappointed in the continuation of Bean's story from Ender's Shadow (which I thought was great) but it was a bit flat.First the praise. Card does an excellent job in characterization and that is the main strength of the book. The reader familiar with the previous novel will learn new and important things about each main charcter: Bean, Petra, Peter, Achilles and Sister Carlotta. We even get a deeper understanding of the more peripheral characters in the novel, such as Ender's parents. And they are all, very, very interesting characters.I was troubled a bit by the plot. I think partially because I made the mistake of reading an online &quot;chat&quot; with Orson Scott Card on... , where he came across in some answers as a bit snobbish about his religion and not very forthcoming about some of his other points of view on issues. That's his prerogative, but I found his dismissiveness annoying. Secondly, I read the afterward before reading the book and didn't much agree with what he had to say there about America (or in the online chat) quickly becoming a marginal player in world affairs. I do agree with many of his criticims of the US, but I find it highly unlikely that the US will be marginalized so quickly. I'm saying this simply to state I had some biases before I start the book.Nevertheless, the plot is thin and there's little reasonable or rational reason why Achille's or Peter could pull the strings of world powers so easily. I need more convincing than what Card offers, which is extremely little. Second, I still don't like the easy way he sweeps nuclear weapons under the rug using the IF. And finally, that the Western hemisphere is a non-player in the whole the shebang.Basically, I don't think the plot that plausible and the author doesn't do enough to convince me.BTW, I was also maybe put off a bit because there are corrections to the novel posted on Card's official website at ..."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This book -- what can I say? It seems like the more of OSC's books I read, the less impressed I am with him as an author. This book strengthened that impression. For one thing, every single one of his characters sounds exactly the same. For another thing, I can honestly say that I didn't care about a single character in this book. I didn't really realize this until one Bean's friends died, at which point my main emotion was annoyance. It was a stupid and easily avoidable death.Also, I don't know for whom this book was targeted. Original fans (except the diehards who think Card can do no wrong) are going to be annoyed, but newcomers will probably be confused. It is dry and tedious at times, with bleak overtones and a nifty little romantic angle that seems thrown in just for the heck of it. With that said, the book gets its two stars because of the insights it provides regarding the Wiggin parents. I reread those scenes (and only those scenes) at least twice because they were very, very good. So, definitely check it out of the library, buy it used if you want, borrow it from a friend. But, I would not recommend buying it new."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Card's work on Shadow of the Hegemon has it's up sides. It's thoroughly entertaining, for one. Card is a master of pacing, and his stories, even with the degree of introspection shown, never seem to drag. His word choice, for the most part, gives a clean, smooth narrative which easily leads you through the book.Maybe too easily, however. If you actually take a moment to think about what exactly is going on, in both the military and political aspects of the work, the premise is revealed to be weak, and the plot certainly strains the suspension of disbelief.One dimensional military tactics, one dimensional politics, the improbable dominance of a few child geniuses in global positions? Given the apparent weight of battle school, I can forgive the last one to an extent. Although even with this justification, I fail to see how Achilles actually managed to accomplish anything at all. The depth of military strategy, as well as the portrayed motivations of entire cultures which Card seems only acquainted with in passing... I can see how some might find this not only implausible, but also insulting.The characters are two-dimensional. On the one hand, at least an attempt is made to show motivation. There is plenty of inner dialogue. However, the vast majority of the characters seem to use the same language and structure in their thinking and speaking, denying them their own voices. This becomes even more apparent when there is \\"banter\\". Two characters with identical senses of humor trying to out-clever each other? Come on. The one exception is Peter Wiggin, whose main personality-defining action, to me, was when he thought of sister Carlotta as a \\"bitch\\". For me, this one addition made his voice a lot angrier, in comparison to: \\"hey, I'm a kid, and I'm smart. Also, angst!\\" like most everyone else.All this being said, Card's presentation is more than enough to draw the reader into, and through the story. Maybe he should take up writing real history, where he could work in an area where his true talents as a writer shine."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I enjoyed Children of the Mind very much. In this book you can see the aftermath of the Bugger Wars. You can see a better look at Bean,Petra, and Achilles. These main characters were always my favorite and I feel Mr.Card did a very good job exploring these characters more. You have Bean, the super genius child. You have Achilles the teenage criminal mastermind out for blood and to rule the world by harnesting the top battleschool alumni children. And you have Petra the damsel in distress that's capable of taking care of herself using her mind, skill, and even charm. Put these three characters together with other interesting people, future bamboozled political situations, and lots of guns, brains, and Orson Scott Card and you have a book that is garenteed to keep you on the edge of your seat, never wanting to put it down."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"the book &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; is a novel filled with paranoia and intensity, where you never know which side anyone is on or when a new obstacle will appear. continuing with the characters from &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot;, but with Ender no longer a primary character, allows Card to explore the psyche of other major characters as they battle the intrigue and politics of a world on the edge of global warfare. this is a great book for any science fiction fan, intergrating complex emotions with brilliant technology."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Cards books on the Battle School genius's are all pretty good. I particularly liked Enders Game and this book, Shadow of the Hegemon.While I could never believe the premise that the worlds most powerful leaders would listen to children, regardless of the childs brilliance, Card still makes a plausible story of it all - and takes the reader on a fun journey into brilliance and madness while he is at it. Bean is the brightest of them all and this book takes you deeper into the thought process of the wonderkid at work - this time not in war but in Politics.I have only two complaints with the book; Peter Wiggen and Childhood Influence. This book seems to have softened the personality of Peter Wiggen, Enders older brother whom we met in Ender's Game - he seems much nicer and compassionate than he should be - I don't have the same sense of forboding I had before with Peter. Secondly, the realitive ease with which these kids get the ear of world leaders, particularly our main antagonist Achilles. Not only do they get the ears of all of these adults but they are easilly able to manipulate them via petty flattery and the petting of egos.Despite these weaknesses the story is good and has a great flow to it. I read the book in two afternoon sittings during my recent vacation and don't feel the time was wasted. The book is good entertainment while also delivering some social commentary about our not too distant future.However, more than the book itself, I enjoyed the afterword by Card giving some insight into the books that shaped his views of world politics and what makes the events that happen happen.The book can be read as a stand alone volume but I would recommend at least reading Enders Game and Enders Shadow before hand so that you have a solid basis with which to &quot;believe&quot; in the extrodinary children depicted."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I truly hate to rate any of the Ender series as low as 3 stars, but _Shadow of the Hegemon_ truly doesn't live up to such works as _Ender's Game_, _Speaker for the Dead_, and even _Ender's Shadow_. _Shadow of the Hegemon_ has elements of suspense within it, but is largely a not-too-cleverly-disguised platform for Card to preach his political beliefs, and to display his excellent grasp of political science. In many ways, it almost reads more like a reworked term paper than a science fiction novel.After finishing _Ender Shadow_, I immediately picked up this next book in the series with my usual high hopes for Card's work; however, less than halfway through the book, I really didn't care how it all turned out, or what happened to many of the characters - and this is hugely unusual for me. I finished it for completion's sake, but frankly, I believe that anyone reading this series could probably skip this addition to the Ender series.This is really a disappointment, much like _Children of the Mind_ was; it almost seems as if Card didn't quite have the material to create a full novel, but was under pressure to add another book to this well-selling series of boy-genius books. Still, I look forward to the next installment, and hope it returns to his complex story-weaving, and excellent character development."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This book is a sad example of Card trying to write like Card. It doesn't even seem like the normal author in this tale. The characters are shallow, the plot is thin (and borring), and when the last page ends you are left wondering at the title...why was this book called &quot;shadow of the hegemon&quot; WHEN the hegemon (peter) is almost completly ignored. Yes he pops in once in a while and writes a few essays but there was never one momement when you even glimps what will make this man great. This book is nothing more then a poor chance at making money off of &quot;Ender's Game.&quot; It falls flat"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I wanted to like this novel more, but in the end it simply failed to make me care enough. Any attachment I felt towards the characters here (Bean, Petra, Peter) originated from previous books. Their actions here often seem geared merely towards advancing the plot; the plot, meanwhile, seems to exist only so that Card can play with the rise and fall of nations. His enthusiasm for global politics and strategy is evident throughout, but I wish he had put as much effort into bringing his characters to life.Card's heavy focus on politics and philosophy is all the more frustrating because of the potential in his characters. This is particularly true with Peter, a character that demands more attention than Card seems willing to give him. Why bother making him a point of view character and only use him in a handful of chapters, particularly given his importance? Petra is another character of whom I wanted to see more. What little I did see was uninspired.This untapped potential makes me wish Card had followed his original plan and allowed other authors to tell the story of Peter, Petra, et. al. So why did I give this novel as many as three stars? Despite the desire for more, I was glad just to see Bean, Peter, and Petra again. Also, Card's efforts with regard to history and politics is not without reward. It's just too bad that the nations in this novel are almost more well developed characters than the people."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I'm writing this mostly in response to other reviewers. I'd like to address two points: the issue about Card's vision of geopolitics in the future, and the issue about the role of Battle School grads in the future.Contrary to a vision of the future where peaceful democracies are the norm, and the world is conflict-free (see Fukuyama's essay The End of History), the future depicted in Shadow of the Hegemon is one where nations, barely held in check by military balance-of-power, are one evil leader away from aggressive territorial conquest, a la Hitler. It's not clear that this vision is really plausible, but the reader needs to accept it at face value - otherwise there'd be no interesting plot! If you do find this premise highly implausible - don't buy the book. (Keep in mind this is fiction though so chill out!)As to the issue of whether the significant role of the Battle School grads is believable - I vote yes. These guys won the Bugger War, remember? The fate of humankind was put in their hands. But Card does make it clear that the ideas of Bean and other Battle School grads are not slavishly followed by world leaders - in fact acceptance is hard-won, if at all.In the case of Achilles - his charisma has always been emphasized - thus he is able to persuade world leaders to follow his bidding. Not entirely believable - and probably the weakest aspect of the book. It's not clear whether his charisma could truly surmount the initial obstacles posed by his reputation as a psychopath, and obvious inexperience at Battle School.Keep in mind, also, that the world has gone through some significant turmoil, having fought off an alien invasion. Geopolitical stability is NOT the norm, and this is the environment in which the Battle School grads are injected."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Card has tossed another &quot;Shadows&quot; book out of the Ender Wiggin series of sci-fi. As much as I enjoyed the Ender novels, I am coming to enjoy the Bean novels even more. From the dregs of Battle School to the real world, Bean overcomes as only he can, with guile, guts and a lot of know-how.I can't wait until Card gives us the story of Bean after Peter matures into the Hegemon of the future. It should be good."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"In this review I'll assume you've read AT LEAST Ender's Shadow before this one, so I won't describe the story itself. If you haven't, read Ender's Shadow first, this book is a direct sequel.I've read the entire Ender books published to date. All six of them. All the other got five stars, best books I've ever read. This one got only four stars.Why, you ask? Well, don't get me wrong, Shadow of the Hegemon is still a GREAT book, only I enjoyed it a bit less than the other books in the series.While reading the other five in the series, there wasn't a single dull moment, swallowing every line with interest. With this book, for the first time, there were a few dull moments.The parts of world geo-political intrigues were a bit boring for me: China vs. Thailand vs. India vs. Burma (etc.) is reasonable to a degree, but can, when stretched, be a bit too much.And, for the first time I encountered some modern-day religion (Mormon?) references here (Wiggin parents), which aren't my cup of tea.Still, this book is great. And Card fans will certainly enjoy this book (and others too). Not as great as the others, but still great."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"If you were a fan of Ender's Shadow, you will undoubtedly enjoy this book as much as I did as a fantastic sequel.This sequel fills in much of the gaps whereas the Ender's Series concentrated primarily on what happened to humanity in outer space. Ender's Shadow and the books that procede it concentrate on the struggle for humanity to unite under one ruler in Shadow of the Hegemon.This book was great as it tells you what happens on Earth while Ender is busy helping humanity colonize &quot;The Hundred World's&quot;.Card adds a bit of refreshing insight into the life of another hero, Bean and adds another interesting perspective on the Ender story with the story of what happened after Ender left Earth.If you haven't read this book, I highly recommend that you don't miss out for much longer!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I Have always enjoyed the way that Card has been able to tell a story. He does so in a way that captures your mind and makes you never want to set the book down. But, in this book he has outdone himself. I did not want it to end. He brilliantly shows a story from many different view points. Switching from person to person he has managed to give you enough information to make it great, yet keeps just the right amount of information from you to make you keep going. I am very excited to see what his next book will be. With one question in mind, can his next book live up to his new, higher standard?"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I followed the Ender series and now the Ender's Shadow series on audio. This is the first book I've been this disappointed with, and the first I've heard unabridged. Whenever I read abridgements, I worry I'm losing something. This time, I was desperate for an abridgement. So much so that I actually gave up reading it mid-book and prayed for an abridgement to appear. When none did, I finished it out, hoping it would get better.It did get better. But not by enough. Card repeats himself a lot, and is a prime candidate for abridgement. No wonder I didn't feel like much was omitted from the prior volumes I &quot;audited&quot; (my term for &quot;listened to the abridgement of&quot;).Structurally, I suppose, this book was a lot like Ender's Game. Not the ending, but the battles. But it's played out on Earth, not some fanciful space station. And it's played out with real countries and real issues of race, ethnicity, and protocol. I don't know about you, but I read sci-fi to escape from all of that. Our world has lots of problems, and sci-fi often comments obliquely about those problems through use of the problems of other societies. But largely this one was just a story about world politics, realistically in some ways, unbelievably in others, but most of all lacking the fanciful and so coming up dry.It did a few things with characters that I didn't like. I was sad about that. But I was more sad because of the very few options left to him about where to take this. The next book looks like it will be more of same, and I pretty much can guess who will end up married to who at the end, and why. Bleah. I wish, somehow, this were not so detached from the other series. Peter could use a healthy dose of chat with Valentine by ansibel.The first book in this series was great. I wish he'd rewrite this one, but he probably won't. I don't see any way to avoid reading this one just to get a sense of resolution. But don't have your hopes up for a lot more, unless you're a big fan of the art of military and civilian diplomacy and want to see it detailed for you like a how-to manual.3 out of 5 stars, in sharp contrast to the prior books. Could definitely benefit from abridgement..."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Hello my friends.The problems I am having with Ender's Shadow and Shadow of the Hegemon: 1. Bean is Ender. They are very much the same. It's as though Card, realizing he wanted to write about a young Ender again, and realizing that he couldn't, just went back and changed Bean to fit Ender.2. Achilles is a terrible plot device; his origins in Ender's Shadow were poor, contrived work, and his continued existence reminds me of nothing more than the sad but inevitable prevalence of Jar Jar Binks in the next two Star Wars films.3. Much of the efforts to make this a &quot;historical novel&quot; on Card's part, though interesting--the SF novel as historical novel from the future is a great idea--fall short, as multiple references to the twentieth century do a great deal to show the time the book was actually written. This is not a major failing, and depending on the precise year, given the 100-year &quot;freeze&quot; on international development during the Formic War--but it's still very noticeable, unfortunately.4. I do not quite understand the emphasis Mr. Card places on the religious side of these characters: however, at times I feel as though Mr. Card does not have as full an understanding of traditional Christian doctrine as one might hope, since one of the main characters is a nun: at times he appears to mix LDS beliefs about such trivia as salvation by works under the guise of Catholicism.With that said.Here are the good things: We like this tone, this Ender's Game tone that disappeared in Speaker, Xenocide, Children (although they are all great books in different ways). We like these characters, we like the kid-geniuses, even though the third time through the device is starting to show wear, starting to feel a bit hackneyed.All told: this books is an interesting and excellent read that lets us join Bean and company as they outsmart their enemies, even their smartest enemies. This is joy, and our heroes are good. I like Bean. I like Petra. I like reading about how good they are doing, and although I find Achilles unconvincing and the end of the book basically contrived in order to continue the series--as if Achilles would really be a major contender, or would be the only thing stopping Peter from taking over...I would like to read more about Peter and have a closer study of his character: something deeper than has been presented here, which seems to be a relatively simple desire for his parents to be as proud as him as they are for Ender (and this feels true, this is a good characterization but mightn't there be more to it?).Thank you. .... .... It is a good read. It is a good book; it took me five or six hours."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Where Ender's Shadow was a new twist on the same story, &quot;Hegemon&quot; begins a completely new story, with two more books to come. In Hegemon Card continues with the story of Bean, also focusing on Peter Wiggin and Petra. While we are reminded of the connection to the Ender story, this is mostly new territory -- a story that explores human nature, cultural values, world politics, and confict. The story hits closer to our reality because it is only a few hundred years in the future and takes place on Earth. As usual, Card writes an engaging story and develops the characters well. I'm looking forward to the rest of the Shadow series."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Although this book definitely did not dissappoint me, it did not resonate with me quite as much as the four books in the Ender Series or Ender's Shadow. Like many of Orson Scott Card's other books (i.e. the Homecoming, Alvin Maker, and Ender books), this novel deals with the problems of near-perfect characters in Bean and Peter. Unlike the other books, Shadow of the Hegemon does not deal as much with metaphysical themes or moral dilemmas but instead describes the struggles of the two smartest people on Earth as they attempt to take over the world and save a friend kidnapped by a power-hungry lunatic. The reader is continually reminded of Ender's perfection, and OSC seems too careful not ever to debase his deified character. Don't get me wrong, I'm really grasping at straws to find flaws in the book, but OSC had raised the bar so high in his previous novels that I could not help but become a little greedy for more genius. I look forward to the next two novels in the series and the continued stories of Bean and Peter."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I enjoyed reading Hegemon, as I've enjoyed all of the Ender series. The problem, as I saw it, was that Hegemon creates a new world which doesn't capture belief the way the old ones did. A small point, but one which bothered me- all of the military references are ones which any person would know. These references to Stalin, Hitler, Mandela, etc. are all references which would be made today, not hundreds of years in the future. To me, the solution would be to simply express the situation as clearly as possible and not rely on references such which date the book. It wasn't so obvious in Ender's Game, but now all the international politics feel directly spun from what the situation today. It's as if, because of the buggers, world conditions remained exactly the same as they were today. The attempts to create international intrigue and complexity felt somewhat weak, simply because they were too understandable. The idea that Battle School children are so far beyond normal people in intelligence makes no sense if the situations are so simple that most anyone could understand them. In Ender's Game, the conditions of the battles were not dwelt on; Ender was the focus. It was taken for granted that Ender was being brilliant and that the battlefield situations were so complex that the reader couldn't begin to comprehend them. This doesn't feel like it's the case anymore."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I have read almost all of five of the books in the Ender series and by far this is the best of them all. Ender's Game was a very good book and when I partly read the next two books I was seriously disappointed. They just had no imagination! Orson Scott Card makes up for this in a big way in the story line of Ender's Shadow and especially Shadow of the Hegemon. They bring back the true spirit of the series. This most recent one has to be one of the best science-fiction books as well as an overall war story that is futuristic but very believeable. Its only low point is the fact that as I have found with the entire series, it is really slow going, but once it starts it doesn't stop till the last page. This book is great! The letter near the end written by a nun to Bean is one of the most personally realistic few pages ever written in a book. Read Ender's Game, skip the next three and read the Shadow books. The next two books should make it a complete series."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I really enoyed enjoyed Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow, but this book was less of a joy. I was pleased that it covered Bean and Petra more, but was disappointed that the book did not go in more depth about Ender's parent or Peter more. It also did not move the story along very far. It rehashes the Battle School kids getting to Earth and maybe a year or so of what they encounter (kidnapping and battles) and their reaction. It was like a half-sequal setting up two more sequals to finish the story. If you love Ender and the kids, it is worth the read, otherwise save 20 bucks and wait to see if the next does more because in skipping this one you will not miss much of the story."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Orson Scott Card has a large following (see the many reviews of his books). This is well-deserved. The Ender saga is probably his most famous endeavor. However, IMHO this 6th volume is not as engaging as some of the others in the series as far as pure science fiction goes. On the other hand, Card embeds his works with gems of psychological commentary on humans and how they think, act, etc. These are brilliant. As a collector of quotes, my favorites from this book are:p. 58: What a laugh, though. To think that one human being could ever really know another. You could get used to each other, get so habituated that you could speak their words right along with them, but you never know why other people said what they said or did what they did, because they never even knew themselves. Nobody understands anybody.p. 81: You don't have to eat the entire turd to know that it's not a crab cake.p. 111: Most victories come from instantly exploiting your enemy's stupid mistakes, and not from any brilliance in your own plan.p. 138: It isn't lying to tell a bureaucrat whatever story it takes to get him to do his job properly...If he does his job properly, he'll understand the purpose of the rules and therefore know when it is appropriate to make exceptions.p. 153: Whether you trust somebody or distrust him has a lot more to do with the kind of person you are than the kind of person he is.p. 322: Satyagraha-The willingness to endure great personal suffering in order to do what's right...What matters is that you do not hide from the consequences. You bear what must be borne.It's worth the read just to hear his insights."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This time the battlefield is set firmly on terra firma, Earth! Ender and his sister, Valentine are not around. The intelligent children from Battle School were trying to blend back into life on Earth when they were kidnapped, except for Bean. He, his family, and his neighbors were bombed! Bean went into hiding with Sister Carlotta. Ender's brother, Peter Wiggin, was their only hope.Peter may only have been a teen, but his intelligence at politics and pulling strings were as great as any of the Battle School Grads were at commanding! He held two names on the nets. Both were well known and had much influence. He was &quot;Locke&quot;, known as a peacemaker, and he was &quot;Demosthene&quot;. He would help retrieve the brilliant children. But Petra was the most important and she was held prisoner by Achilles! Peter intended to rule the world...and soon. He would become the Hegemon. But first, he and Bean must become alliances to defeat Achilles, before he manages to destroy all the nations!***** Orson Scott Card's deep thinking strategies on national and global politics, as well as, on national and global military tactics are proven once again to the Sci-Fi reading public!The story mainly follows Bean, with Petra and Peter as secondary characters. But my vanity makes me like Petra the most. After all, change the P in her name to D and you have MY name! But more than that, I enjoyed watching her (as a 14 year old) using logic against grown men who trained in psychiatry. Petra has a way of seeing things more clearly than most. Here is a story that will hit the best seller lists almost immediately! It is not only excellent, it is awesome!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"While &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; was a parallel to Orson Scott Card's classic &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; this next novel in a projected quartet deals with the aftermath of the Bugger War on Earth. All we really knew from Card's future history was that Peter Wiggin became the Hegemon. In &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; we not only find out how that came to be, but also the involvement of Bean, the &quot;Shadow&quot; in both books, who acts behind the scenes while others take the world stage. The main story arc involves the kidnapping of Petra Arkanian and other Battle School graduates from Ender's group by Achilles, Bean's nemesis from &quot;Ender's Shadow.&quot; This is merely the opening gambit in Achilles move to rule the world.As the geo-political situation unravels in &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon,&quot; I found myself thinking that this was like a real game of &quot;Risk.&quot; So, when Card admitted as much in his afterword, I had to laugh. This novel really has more in common with Card's novel &quot;Pastwatch,&quot; where he dealt with an alternative reality regarding Christopher Columbus and the &quot;discovery&quot; of the Americas. Both have at their core the idea of remaking the world into a better place, for while the Battle School dealt with inter-galatic video games, Card is now dealing with more traditional war games on Earth and his take on the Asian nations, particularly India and Thailand, is quite interesting. But we have all known for quite some time that Uncle Orson is a thoughtful writer and one of the best writers of serial novels as he has repeatedly proven.Similar to &quot;Xenocide,&quot; Card decided while writing &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; that he had two books here not one. Consequently, it is hard to judge this novel because there is more of the story to be told and the ending has very much of a &quot;to be continued&quot; feeling. The character of Bean remains as fascinating as Ender Wiggin, albeit without the overwhelming angst. The best parts of the book are when he deals with those who disagree with his proposals; as a rhetorician I admire Card's creation as a model of persuasive efficiency. I read everything Card writes, but I am especially looking forward to the rest of this series (even more than Alvin Maker, believe it or not)."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"What an amazing book! Much alike Ender's Shadow, I didn't expect to be stunned and amazed! The book is centered around Bean, Peter, and Petra, through a series of politcal ploys. Also much alike Ender's Shadow we are given a deeper look at Bean. I must say this book is perfect for Ender fans, though as everyone has said before, don't begin the whole series with this book."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This book is just as good as any of Card's others. It has the same ingenious writing style, captivating plot, and incredible creativity. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"We continute the tale of Bean aka Julian Delphiki in Shadow of the Hegemon, as we know from the Ender timeline, this would be the point where Ender has headed off to the world with the pig people and is searching for a home for the larvae of the new Formics queen. However, all is not well on Earth. Bean's nemesis Achelles is out there, and he's gaining most of the top kids from the Battle School to begin his plot to control the world. Bean's solution....make Peter Wiggin go public with his writer personae, and make his move to become the Hegemon, and save the world from the chaos that Achelles would bring. In this book, the author definitely went for an approach that would further humanize Bean, from the cold calculating whiz we knew from Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. His primary motivation for stopping Achilles is to save Petra Arkanian, the one whom he considers probably his only 'friend' from the Battle School, and the one graduate that was not released by the Russians when it was made clear what type of person Achilles was. This story also gives you a slight bit of insight into Peter Wiggin, older brother of Ender and the eventual Hegemon of Earth. At this point Peter is still a teenager, but behind his writing personae he's built up a huge network of contacts and informants, so that his political base is solidifying. All in all, the plot was fairly good, the storytelling while at times left something to be desired, was well thought out, and the book overall was enjoyable. Definitely an effort worthy of the whole 'Ender' universe."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I have read all Ender's books, I liked all of them with the same passion. This book is half of a book as Scott explains at the end of the book, I was some what disappointed by that. Another sad thing is that he spend too much time on too little things, making you feel a urgent need to finish the book sometimes. That's why I took one star away.Yet, I admire the book greatly, it teaches you a lot about how to manage people, and also has great suspense for most of the time. It has that special Scotty taste to it--the way characters think make you feel you are them and they are you, not like some other SFs that totally run off the ground; the intelligence, the philosophical depth to it that make you think constantly; and the drop from sudden high to low at the end that makes the book both loud and quiet; the solving of all the puzzels; also the kids power.Overall, it is great, but the world scemes that Scott set up is more like kids playing than reality, and makes the book a kind of stupid."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"when I first found out about the shadow trilogy, I was excited: the ender's books were great, and although I read them many times They never got boring. so I bought Ender's shadow, and although it was a great book it had some problems: there were this long sections where bean thinks about himself, and quite frankly - those parts were boring. so when I got to the Shadow of the hegemon book, I was afraid of the same repetition... I WAS WRONG!!!!!!This is one of the greatest book I have read. it combines all the style of Orson scot card, with the character of Bean. Unlike Ender's shadow, this book does not contain any boring parts - every chapter, every page, every word makes you want 2 keep on reading. I started reading it for the first time, and didn't stop until I finished it... and still I wanted more. this book is full of suprises, twists, and changes, from commando warfare to political debates... and all writen in Orson's great style, viewed by Bean special perception of the world. What I loved the most is the meeting between Bean and Peter - those two great characters clashed from the begining, and I can't wait 2 c how this will develop... as well as the special bond between Bean and Petra (I admit - I never saw this coming).If you have any doubt about this book - lose them, you won't regret it... All that is left 2 say is that I hope that the third book of this trilogy will be as interesting as this one."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Shadow of the Hegemon is one of the best books in the Ender Series. It tells you what happened on Earth while Ender is gone. In the book Bean is being tracked down by an old opponent from his childhood. He has had numorous attempts on his life. Not only is Bean in trouble but his old friends from the famous battle of Ender's Game. Petra is with this old opponent and Bean must now figure out how to save her while keeping himself alive. This book was great! It had moments of pure suspense and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I pick up any book in the Ender series with great trepidation because Xeoncide &amp; Children of the Mind were 2 of the worst books I have ever completed. Then Ender's Shadow blew me away - I loved it. So I started Hegemon with cautious hope.I was not disappointed. The book has a lot of good qualities. I enjoyed reading more about Bean, Petra, Carlotta and Peter. I thought the story moved at a good pace &amp; was interesting. In fact, I must admit that I read the book nearly every free minute for a couple days until I finished it.As other reviews have mentioned, the book has flaws. It does have a bit of a &quot;pulp&quot; SF feel to it and some of the situations do stretch the suspension of disbelief to the limit. For example, much of what the villain accomplishes in terms of international alliances &amp; betrayals was difficult to swallow.Having said that, the bottom line is that I couldn't put the book down for several days ! I am looking forward to the next installment in the series. I can't wait to learn more about what Bean, Peter &amp; Petra do in the future (and maybe read more about the other Battle School kids). This is in sharp contrast to how I felt during Children of the Mind, where I totally lost interest in all the characters -including Ender !"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Lovers of the Enders series will not be disappointed, although this installment has far less of the physical battles and intrigue that mark Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. I read it in one day. The ending is a bit disappointing, but that's partly because Card is setting up several additional sequels (can we spell m-o-o-l-a-h?) Also, while some people say Card added to Peter's depth here, I disagree. I wanted a lot more of Peter in the book, since he is the Hegemon, and because he's probably the second most interesting character that Card has ever created. Unfortunately, in this book, Card backs away from the sadism that we all know from previous books which lurks under the surface for Peter. Peter goes from a fascinating enigma to just a supersmart superdriven Geek who wants to rule the world.However, the growth of Bean is what this book is all about, in more ways than one. Bean starts to develop a personality beyond being an ultrabrilliant young Napoleon.Card also uses too many contrivances to move the plot along and to construct additional sequels...In some ways I liked it better when he spent years between these books and came out with something completely different.Also felt Card vastly oversimplified and stereotyped various countries, but perhaps it was the only way to write this story.I also never quite got why Achilles was so successful. Achilles' great plans seem so implausible, and yet they occur. Card says it is Achilles incredible, weird force of personality. Maybe, but I wasn't convinced the way I was about Ender's force of personality.(And maybe, just maybe people in India would read the reports that Achilles is a psychopathic killer and not turn their country over to him? D'ya think?)Okay, so it's a flawed book. I still loved every minute of it. Keep pumping them out, Card, and I'll keep buying."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Although I love the way Orson Scott Card writes, I feel that the subject matter in the latter Ender books appeals to a different audience than the original Ender book."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Why I think this book and others in this series are good is simple. They kept my attention. I am a sixteen year old girl that when I get bored I want a good book to curl up with no distractions and I totally get lost in the charecters and thats what happened when I read, not only this book but all of the ENDER books, I got lost for hours on end. With Bean having to save his friends, nobody quite knowing whats going on, and the budding romance between him and the only girl in BATTLE SCHOOL to have fought in the Bugger wars. A good end. Or is it a new beginning...? To this the bean segment of the series. I don't know about anyone else who's read these books but i hope he comes out with more of them maybe Enders children...?"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I found the book riveting and had trouble putting it down. This book rivals Enders Game, and is the best in the series since the original work was published. Card is at his best when writing about children. Excellent effort and a rewarding read."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I've been reading Orson Scott Card's books for 7 years. I've watched him mature from a great writer to a sensational one. I'm going to give an example from bean; Card talks about his emotional reactions being stilted, because he didn't learn them from an early age, and yet none of his actions are truly stilted. He feels awkward, and yet at the same time Card conveys his actual actions as completely, believably, human. In other words, he displays Bean as feeling emotionally stunted, but at the same time his actions show maturity. I wonder how may of his readers see how deeply he writes. I wonder if I truly see how deeply he writes."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I just got done with SotH and it is great. I would consider it just a little under EG. The plot, charecters and everything else about it is great. If you like sci-fi, buy this book."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"All that stuff about Peter Wiggin getting the world by the tail by posting on the Internet. It's just stupid.What would really happen is Peter would post something, then scores if blowhard nitwits would excoriate him and call his mother a female dog fertilized by a chicken.Nobody would take it seriously at all except the stupid people posting, like Peter, but lots of typing would happen."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"What a huge disappointment. Ender's shadow was a great read. Shadow of the hegemon was an utter waste of time. Im an avid Orson Scott Cart fan, but with the exception of the Alvin Maker series, he's not the greatest sequel writer."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This book, although highly readable and recommended, is somewhat of a departure from Scott's usual sci-fi space-traveling &quot;hero's journey&quot; of the Ender series. &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; is more of a earth-bound story, where space and interstellar xenocide fade into the background amidst the usual suspects in the fight for world domination.Following Bean's story would, in and of itself, make a great novel. We also follow Petra and a few of the other battle school graduates as they show that they have matured past being just child genuises used as pawns by adults to save humanity. In this story, we finally see them using their own resources as they act alone to save themselves.Peter Wiggin, formerly known as the sadistic brother of Ender, becomes a fully rounded character, both impossibly arrogant and charismatic. In my opinion it is this interaction between Bean and Peter Wiggin and what they accomplish together which is truly the gem in the midst of this high-stakes story of world diplomacy. And it is this relationship, and Peter's subsequent rise to power that sets the stage for this story's obvious continuance."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"When Orson Scott Card wrote this book he had a few limitations. First, he no longer had the magic of the Battle School to aid him. Second, he had to work around limitations he may or may not have meant to put in previous books. Last, he was writing a sequel, and that is always dangerous.Orson Scott Card, though, did a great job of overcoming all these limitations. The book made earth into the Battle School, and brought in even more elements. No longer were these kids all living in a world of their equals. They were now in a world of stupid Adults, and power-hungry nations.At first, I was afraid that a certain flaw in Bean's genetic makeup would severly limit this story. But, again, Orson Scott Card worked in the genius he used when he wrote Ender's Shadow. He made the book even more enriching, using Bean's limitation to further the story, and make it even more understandable. Few authors have this almost magical ability that Orson Scott Card has.Orson Scott Card was taking a huge risk by writing a sequel to a parrallel novel. He had absolutely never addressed what had happened on Earth, besides in one of his sequels mentioning that Peter had become Hegemon of Earth. He could have potentialy destroyed the characters that we all coveted so dearly in Ender's Game. Just making Petra one of the main characters was an incredibly risky move. Luckily, though, I'm almost completely sure that Orson Scott Card was aware of all this. He was very careful to keep the characters realistic while also using their genius to make the story all the more interesting.Orson Scott Card has shown us again and again his ability to make an engaging world out of just some words on paper. He has been able to suck us into a world that we do not want to leave. He has made us wish that Ender had really existed, almost made us wish that WE were the geniuses made to destroy an alien species. When he writes, he almost makes us believe that we are part of the book, that we ARE its characters. And this is why this book is so successful. Orson Scott Card does it again."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Ender's Game was fantastic. The rest of the books surrounding Ender's life were different, but good in their own way. Ender's Shadow was a glimpse at the original story from a different perspective, but it was still intriguing and very fun to read. Now, we have Shadow of the Hegemon, and we're starting to ask the big question: Do we really care that much about Bean?The book is pretty good, but not on the same level as Ender's Game. Of course, if you look at Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow, this book is the next progression in the \\"series\\", but somehow it leaves you wanting more.Mr. Card, Ender's Game was terrific, and we would have been thrilled had you left it there. Fortunately and unfortunately, you didn't.Final thoughts: If you loved the series, get the book. If all you've read is Ender's Game, please, for the love of all that's sacred, leave it there!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"&quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot;, like its predecessor, &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; is not really a continuation of the Ender saga. Card very nicely wrote that story across four excellent novels. These stories are about Bean, the smallest and most intelligent of all the kids Ender trained with at the Battle School. The fact that they all contain the word &quot;shadow&quot; implies that Bean belongs in the periphery, when in fact he deserves a spotlight just as much as Ender, or does he? This is where one main source of dissatisfaction may lie.One of the huge differences between Ender and Bean is that Bean does not for one moment doubt his brilliance or ability. This grows tiresome after two novels. In &quot;Hegemon&quot; he is not alone either. Peter, Bean, and Achilles all believe that they have the patent on always being right. There is a constant interplay between them trying to one-up each other's ability to be right. With no other motive, this is extremely tedious, plus it seems insufficient that a human being would not know doubt. Ender as a character was interesting partly because he struggled painfully to do the right thing and overcome his guilt and doubt. Bean proclaims to care only for his own survival, until the end when he is overcome with shame. By the final chapter of this book, Bean has come to terms with truths about himself and the people he has grown to love. In a final scene he tells Petra that he is &quot;not human&quot;. Until this chapter, those words are believable. In my eyes, Bean becomes fully human in the closing section of this book.Although a lot of this novel reads more like an animated game of RISK, its conclusion sets up the two sequels to examine Bean's fate and the recreation of the Hegemony under Peter Wiggin. Who knows, there may even be romance budding...&quot;Hegemon&quot; on its own is not terribly impressive, but it opens the way for two exciting novels to come. It's time for Bean to step out of the Shadow, but please Mr. Card, no more shadow titles."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This book just isn't up to Orson's standards. The first five chapters are very interesting, but the rest of it is just boring boring BORING. Unless you are really into world history (especially with Thailand and India and Pakistan and that whole area), or you are willing to put up with boring discussions about military operations that aren't very exciting in the first place, just wait for this book to come out on paperback."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Ender's Game and The Speaker for the Dead are worth the time. This book is not.Card thinks too much about his insight on political science. In the afterword, he brags that he's been interested in international relations since he was a kid. Unfortunately, he hasn't grown up. His plot is two dimentional and he has no understading of the history or politics regarding Russia, America, Thailand, or any other country.His characters are also thin and two dimentional. The story: Bean and all the other \\"child warriors\\" return to earth, where an evil kid somehow awaits them. The evil kid leads entire nations to kidnap on all the other smart kids in order to rule the world. Huh?Read Ender's Game and forget about this one, unless you're stuck on a 13-hour plane ride with nothing else to read."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"It's rare for me to only give a Orson Scott Card book three stars, but Card seems to have really stumbled with this one. Although the book is very entertaining, it also has some very serious flaws.One major problem with Shadow of the Hegemon (and the one that I found to be the most bizarre) is that it doesn't really appear to be set in the future. Card never tells us exactly what year it's supposed to be, but we know that humanity has spent several generations fighting a major interstellar war, we've built fleets of starships with weapons capable of destroying entire planets, and we've unlocked the secrets of faster-than-light communication. Yet for some reason, virtually all of the technology - military and otherwise - in Shadow of the Hegemon seems to be from only a few years in the future. People are still flying around in helicopters, shooting gunpowder machine guns at each other, and generally living their lives and fighting in the way one would expect two or three years from now. The world's geo-political situation is also largely unchanged, with most of the world's nations characterized by political stereotypes from today. Although this in itself doesn't really ruin the book, it's all jarringly incongruous with the previous books in the series.A second, more fundamental problem has to do with the way in which the main characters in the story interact with their world. The battle school children seem more like forces of nature than actual characters. They seem to be so far above the rest of humanity that they come to dominate everyone and everything they come into contact with, despite that fact that most of them are small children. The entire world seems to bend itself to their will, and they alone are able to successfully oppose each other. Of course Ender's character had that sort of importance in 'Ender's Game,' but there was also an elaborate backstory to explain how a single child came to have such an important role in deciding the fate of humanity. In 'Shadow of the Hegemon' it seems that Card again wanted to make his child characters pivotally important, but he never really comes up with a credible explanation for how any group of people - no matter how brilliant or well trained - could end up so incredibly influential in world affairs.Despite all that, 'Shadow of the Hegemon' is still a very entertaining book. The plot is quite entertaining in spite of its problems with consistency and believability, and the action proceeds at a brisk pace. Although Card seems to give his battle school children far more credit than plausibility allows, they're all quite fascinating and well-developed characters. It's genuinely interesting to watch Bean, Petra, Achilles, and company spar with each other for world domination. Even with its flaws, Shadow of the Hegemon is still better than most of what you'll find on bookstore shelves."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I'm afraid after 'Ender's Shadow', this is another descent in quality for the overall Ender series. Besides the inflation (or reflation) of Bean, this tale of war in South-East Asia is pretty stale stuff.It is strange that a science-fiction author who had us riveted at his tale of interstellar war, becomes so trite when trying to adapt to the confines of one small planet. There is no sense of place or culture among the characters and scenes (ranging from Greece to Russia, South Carolina, India and Thailand), merely stuff that sounds as it it was ripped from history books and travelogues. Card's Afterword suggests he is now trying to write 'future history'. If so, that is a disappointing turn for someone who wrote one of the best science fiction books of the last 20 years.As well as the overall writing, Bean just fails to hold the attention as Ender did. Ender lived as a tragic figure, scared child and xenocide in one. Bean, despite his problems, does not attract the same sympathy. For example, Bean's comic remark at the start of Ender's last battle against the Buggers is now 'Bean's analysis' that showed Ender how to win the battle. Sure, so Democritus invented Quantum Mechanics, and Malthus should be credited with Evolution.The novel's main lack is a 'Maguffin' - the expression used by Alfed Hitchcock for the device on which he hung his plots. Card has had some brilliant Maguffins - Earth been saved by child video-gamers, Battle School, Buggers etc. 'Hegemon's' Maguffin is just a tame recycling of what went before in the Ender series - genius kids at war. If you read science fiction to be enthralled by imaginative plots and plot devices, then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Once again, I wasn't disappointed by this sequel to Ender's Game / Ender's Shadow. Card returns to what he does best - blending worldwide military and political strategy with character studies. For anyone who's read the previous Ender books, this will be hard to put down. I'll try not to reveal too much detail, but the story concerns the group of child military geniuses from Battle School and what happens to them after the bugger war when they return to Earth. (Ender and Valentine don't appear in the book at all.) However, most fans have long awaited more details about Peter, what he did on Earth, and how he rose to power. Other primary characters from previous books are Bean (main character from Ender's Shadow), along with Petra Arkanian and others.The author has an amazing knowledge of military strategy. More amazing, though, are the riveting dialogues between his characters! (He writes such intelligent and witty characters. I often wish I was half as smart!) Lest the talk of global strategy make this book sound dry, let me assure you that it's not. I had to discipline myself not to finish it too soon. :) Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I have read the whole ender series, but with a strange sequence which may have affected the way I view the different books in the series. The first book I have read was the Shadow of the Hegemon, thanks to a tourist that had left it in the library of a hotel in Skiathos island. This book got me hooked, but it confused me also as I didn't know if I should start reading the next books or the previous ones.The general pattern in the whole series is:The beginning book is Ender's Game. Then we have two subcategories, one the Shadow series (which, with the exception of the first book, take place on earth and are more within military strategy) and one the Ender series (which take place in space and are more into new sci-fi ideas). Shadow series probably can be read from everyone, while I guess that the Ender series (especially from Speaker for the Dead onwards) would be read mainly from sci-fi fans.Below are my comments for the books of the series, in the order I have read them and a marking (10 is the highest mark):Shadow of the Hegemon: The first book I have read, and which I could not leave from my hands. I finished it in 2 days. It was fast paced action, very smart plot and after reading it I believed that Orson Scot Card (OSC) has invented/re-invented a new genre of literature. That of military strategy and adventure combined with brilliance/mind games and hidden portions of romance. Such books always existed but this seemed to be THE book. It was like the way Dan Brown re-invented books with trivials and puzzles, together with fast paced adventure. I strongly recommend it to everybody that likes such type of books. (mark: 10)Shadow puppets: The sequel to the above. I found it interesting but somehow boring as the above story developed little and the focus was on the characters (maybe too much focus so that it seemed to me that it was slightly mumbling jumbling. Strategy, brilliance and adventure seemed to be very low here. I would not recommend it for anybody to read it in isolate, unfortunately you have to read it if you want to go to the next book. I really believe that OSC made a mistake here (deliberately or not) as this book should have been told in 50-60 pages and be included in the previous or the next book. (mark: 6 but you will read it because you will want to read Shadow of the Giant)Shadow of the Giant: (see below)Ender's game: A really great book to read, probably the best of the series, however, as I had read its sequels first, when I reached the 80% of this book, I had predicted the end. However, it's at the highest standards of sci-fi, military strategy, adventure, brilliant mind games and very good depth in the human aspect of the characters. In comparison to the shadow series, it is more \\"space\\" sci-fi, while shadow series have much lesser sci-fi elements and are more down to earth. (mark: 10)Speaker for the dead: Another great book, but different style. Less adventure, more human aspect, more maturity. Brilliance yes, but not military, sci-fi yes (some great ideas) but not spaceship style. (Mark: 9)Xenocide: A good sequel of the previous novel. In certain points more brilliant, in other sections more boring, however is again a very good sci-fi book. The only flaw in these series (Speker for the dead, Xenocide, Children of the mind) is the idea behind one of the alien species described which I found outrageously extreme, however if you ignore it becomes first class reading. (Mark: 9)Children of the mind: I think that OSC has wrapped up his case pretty badly in that one. It's a fair book except the fact that I felt that OSC mumbles jumbles for one third of the novel not having decided how to end it. In other critiques I have found it described as nice approach to moral dilemmas, however, moral dilemma is when you describe it once and make your choice, while here the dilemma is repeated and repeated... I felt like I was watching a movie worth 10 oscars and the end did not worth to be included even in a cheap video movie. And again, many open ends at the end (for possible sequels). (Mark: 7 but you will read it as you will be hooked from the previous ones).Ender's shadow: Having read Enders Game and Shadow of the Hegemon, I found this book probably the best of the series, which of course is my subjective preference. I could characterize it as probably the best book I have read ever! Not to repeat myself, it has all that Shadow of the Hegemon and Ender's Game have, and even more...(Mark: the absolute 10).Shadow of the Giant: When I read shadow puppets, I said, \\"that's it, OSC has lost either his talent or his appetite for good writing...\\", so I was pretty unwilling to read it. Fortunately I decided to, as it proved to be a good one, were I believe that OSC has nicely wrapped up his story, with two small flaws.* The one is described below (its end needed to be slightly more complete) and,* The other is the fact that although he describes certain smart battles, he does not focus enough on them as it seems that he is in a hurry to wrap all things up. It had all elements to become a masterpiece but it ended up being a good to read book (Mark: 9)In general, both series have three categories of good stuff:1) Some great sci-fi ideas (battle room, battle games, fantasy game, ansible, aia, Jane, in/out travel, raman varelse etc)2) Great military strategy, mind games etc combined with adventure3) In certain books, depth of characters, moral dilemmas etcAnd two main bad stuff:1) Mumbling jumbling in certain books which was completely unnecessary (either OSC wanted just to produce and sell another title - see shadow puppets- or he could not decide how the story will continue-see last book of Ender series).2) One of the alien species described in the Ender series was so too outrageous even for sci-fi that made it look ridiculous. The idea behind it was brilliant in sci-fi terms, but he could try a different living organism...Finally, OSC has left open ends in both series (probably for next sequels), however I believe that there are two things missing. a) the story of the Hive Queen and the Hegemon, told in a metaphorical manner so it means much for humanity. b) In ancient theatre, a story should end in a way that brings \\"katharsis\\" to the story, and the souls of the readers. I believe that the end of the shadow of the giant may be smart for commercial purposes but it was very unfair to the reader as it did not bring full \\"katharsis\\"."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This book is a direct sequel to &quot;Ender's Shadow,&quot; but can be read once you read &quot;Ender's Game.&quot; That is, one does not have to read &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; to read this book as the book makes sense and can stand alone provided one has already read &quot;Ender's Game.&quot;The gist of the plot, without giving everything away:The Formic War is over, won by Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin and his team of brilliant child warriors (members of what is called Ender's jeez). Since Battle School has disbanded, the war vets have no place else to go but back to Earth and home, afterall, the vets are still minors, most between 12 to 15 years of age. So, back to whence they came, they go: i.e., to Armenia (Petra), to China (Hot Soup), to Japan (Shen), and to Greece (Bean), etc.. Since aliens are no longer a threat to humanity, humanity once again conspires to start a war within. Afterall, isn't that in our nature? Anyway, a mysterious country, seeking to start a war for dominance against its enemy or enemies (will not tell you which countries are involved so as not to spoil the fun of reading), kidnaps the Battle School children.Written in a classic thriller genre with a hero, protagonist Julian Delphiki, AKA Bean, the anti-hero, the homicidal Achilles, and the object of both men's obessesions, damsel in distress, Petra (who is the most prized kidnap victim for she is the most brilliant of all of Ender's jeez), this is better written and more intelligent than the dribble that comes out from Clancy's camp. Along the lines of well done movie love triangle hooks like &quot;Mission Impossible, II&quot;, &quot;No Way Out&quot;, and &quot;Against all Odds,&quot; this is a darn sexy classic thrillers. Yes, I said sexy, which this book is. Where &quot;Ender's Game&quot; only hints at the possibilities for more complex plot and anti-heros, and where &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; deviates into Ender's post Battle School life, this book will more than fulfill expectations of thrills, chills and sheer exhilleration of it all. As in &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; (the prequel which you don't have to read to follow this book) in Bean, you will find a hero parallel to Ender in character, complexity, intelligence, and angst."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"First let me clarify that I loved the writing and the assorted narrators. I discounted a star on this audio version for the poor editing. I can only assume that the word Hegemon was mispronounced throughout the book and the \\"patch\\" used to insert the correct pronunciation is a bit jolting. It does not sound as though it was recorded with the same equipment and I'm not sure if it's even the same narrator. For those of us who like to be totally immersed in the story - it will jolt you back to reality. The first couple of times I found it amusing but after that it became annoying. I think I would rather have had the mispronounced word rather than the jolting edits. I ended up listening to this audiobook while driving - I wasn't as immersed in the story and not as annoyed by the poor edits. From now on I will check the reviews of product from this company and will read the book myself rather than pay for a poorly edited audiobook."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I've read Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow and decided to keep reading the series for the ladder because honestly, those books are brilliant. Shadow of the Hegemon, however, at least for me, was not.I felt like it was very inconsistent with what I've already read, and while you expect the kids that made up Ender's jeesh to change, you don't expect them to just...I don't even know. It's hard for me to believe that Petra is the only one of them to maintain a strong personality and not give into Achilles. And while Achilles was terrifying in an underhanded psychological way in Ender's Shadow, in SotHegemon, it's almost like his weapon is his charisma, which made him seem very weak in terms of villainy.Bean's memories and the references to Ender's Shadow seemed super distorted to me, almost like Card had forgotten what he'd written and just guessed at it. At one point, Bean has this pivotal realization that the happiest time of his life was when he was with Sister Carlotta before leaving for space, and how he cared about her so much and etc. But...I'm pretty sure, if I remember correctly, Sister Carlotta gave him a hug and he accepted it, but not without thinking, 'I don't really understand why we're hugging but if she wants to, okay, but I'd really like to leave now.'I don't know. I feel really bad because I desperately wanted to enjoy this book, and maybe even expected to since I could not put Ender's Game or Shadow down. Unfortunately, it just didn't take advantage of all of the potential it had. Peter, who could have been a wicked awesome character in this - and holy crap, could have gone head to head with Achilles politically which would have been BRILLIANT - became an odd side character that had very little purpose. And the sudden romance between Bean and Petra came out of nowhere and, again, was something that was half-heartedly alluded to from Ender's Shadow. It left me thinking, \\"Um...I thought that they really disliked each other since the whole Bonzo Madrid situation, but all right...\\" Even though they were able to sort things out, I never got the impression that they were suddenly BFF's.Also, the beginning bugged me. It was such a beautiful and meaningful moment at the end of Ender's Shadow that he discovered he had family, and then...well, bye bye. Not a thought spared for them through the rest of the book.Again, I feel horrible. This could have been phenomenal. I wish it had been."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I didn't love this one as much as some of his others, but it was still great. This series of books has got to be the best of all time. If you haven't read these books, you're crazy. Even if this isn't really the type of book you normally read, I would still give it a try becasue you'll probally surprise yourself and love them."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Although I loved Shadow of the Hegemon, and found it worthy of its place in the Ender series, one thing jarred me back to reality again and again. Whenever the word \\"Hegemon\\" appears in the text, a disturbing voiceover interrupts the flow of the story. It is for this reason that I rated this a 3 instead of a 4. It really is that bad.I have deduced that the voiceover edit is because the original authors mispronounced the word as \\"HEG-a-mon\\" rather than \\"HEDGE-a-mon\\" throughout the text. This is confirmed when, in the closing track, it appears they missed one, and the word \\"HEG-a-mon\\" is pronounced by the reader without interruption.It would have been much better to have a consistently mispronounced word than a completely out of place voice adding horrible over-dub. It is worse than the beeps that dub over profanity on the radio.I would recommend that Audio Renaissance re-release this with the original audio. Keep the pronunciation errors. After all, in a book where Achilles is pronounced \\"a-SHEEL\\" half the time and \\"a-KILL-eez\\" the other half, we can easily forgive \\"HEG-a-mon\\"."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"The only reason I gave this book three stars was because of the previous books. I know all of the characters and I wanted to find out what happens to them so the book kept me interested. If it was a stand alone book, I would have not finished the book and would have given it only 1 star. Achilles 'the psychopath' is given absolute power in India and no one even suspects that he is driving the country into the ground until it's too late. Yeah, that would happen. Anyway... enough bitching. The only people who should read this book are the ones who want to read the 'complete' series."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This is a good continuations of Ender's Shadow, but not quite at the same level as Ender's Shadow. A major annoyance throughout is every time one of the voice actors says the word \\"Hegemon\\" it is dubbed over with some other person's voice saying the word, which kills the flow of the story. The dubbed voice is not even close to whichever voice actor is speaking. At first I believed that it was momentary glitch in the media. until it repeated again, and again throughout the story. Also, someone should really have rethought the music to this as well.In the above I have hit all of the bad points of the audio book that I notice. It is still well worth the money, a good story, and I don't regret buying it."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Most reviews I've read on this page address the book itself, not the audiobook. Not a mention of recording quality, production, or any aspects of the recording. Card mentions repeatedly at the end that audiobook is his preferred way to present his works, but if this is the best they come up with I disagree. FIND THE TIME TO READ THE BOOK. To me these little things in the recordings progressively became more annoying: the recording sounds very tinny, and for some reason \\"the hegemon\\" is recorded out of context?; continued mispronunciation of the antagonist throughout the book; and cheesy, poorly thought out musical \\"interludes\\" that become more invasive and jarring. Buy the used book and enjoy this great book for a fraction of the cost of this audiobook."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Ender Wiggin and his sister, Valentine, have left Earth on the advice of their older brother, Peter. That's a good thing, because the other former Battle School \\"students\\" who were part of Ender's jeesh, who fought to victory against the insectoid alien Formics, are kidnapped shortly after this book opens. They are still children - the oldest are in their early teens - and that makes them even more valuable to the captors who want to use their tactical expertise in wars of nationalism. For that ancient scourge is rampant once again, now that Earth no longer needs to be united in order to fight the Formics.Voluntarily working with those who have kidnapped Ender's jeesh is Achilles, an orphan recruited for Battle School by Sister Carlotta. Achilles didn't last long in Battle School because Bean, the most brilliant student of all, recognized him and got rid of him. For Bean was also an orphan on the streets of Rotterdam, and Carlotta also recruited Bean. What's different about Achilles is that he's a serial killer. And now the lives of Bean's dearest friends are in that mad young man's hands...including the life of Petra, the only girl in Ender's jeesh and the closest friend Bean has ever had.Politics bore me, even when they are part of a future universe lovingly created by a master storyteller. This book's plot revolves around politics. I enjoyed it thoroughly nevertheless, because its characters never take a back seat to its plot. Peter Wiggin, who in his 'Net identity of the mysterious \\"Locke\\" can sway opinions and influence events all over the world. Carlotta, the nun who takes the risk of loving someone else's child as if he were her own. The Wiggin parents, whose religions (yes, that word definitely must be plural) put them at odds with the world in which they must live their lives and rear their children. Petra, who failed Ender during the final battle and can't forgive herself. And Bean himself, this tale's hero, a pint-sized military genius who never had a chance to be a child - not even before Battle School, to which children went at 5 or 6 years old because only a child's unfettered creativity could hope to defeat the Formics...these characters are unforgettable.Fun even for a reader who hasn't been exposed to the rest of the \\"Enderverse\\" books!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"The Shadow of the Hegemon picks up where Ender's Shadow left off. The children have returned to earth and are trying to restart their lives. From this introduction the book would seem to be a highly boring tale of a bunch of kids trying to get along in life. But Card takes it farther then that. He writes in such a way that you feel a sort of connection with the characters.Card makes this connection easy for the reader. They don't think like you would expect a normal kid too, largely because they are geniuses. They think on an adult level yet their motives are that of a child their age. This combination makes the characters very intricate. It also draws you in as a reader.You are able to sympathize with Bean as he struggles against Achilles because his motives are pure. You can see his frustration and his happiness. The fact that the reader is able to connect with the characters is what makes it a good book. Otherwise it's as if you are just along for the ride. But if you feel connected to the characters then the book becomes more then a ride, it becomes a story.As good as the book is, there are still some parts that are a turn off. If you don't appreciate politics then the chances of you enjoying the book are severely diminished. It is vital for at least some of the other books in the series to be read before this one. Otherwise you are left highly confused and it takes away from the book in a big way.So if you are looking for a book in which you can connect with the characters, I highly recommend this book. But if you are looking for a child's story to read to your kids, then I recommend you looking somewhere else."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"You loved Ender's Game, right?And even though the next couple of Ender-related books were more confusing and not of the same quality as Ender's Game, at last came Ender's Shadow, the parallel story of Bean. Terrific.Then came Shadow of the Hegemon.It is, literally, a shadow of the original talent and quality of the first five books. The dialogue is tedious, the story line pencil thin, and the plot has a huge Achilles' heel (pun intended).This is another example of a book out by an author (in this case Orson Scott Card) who must have been pressured to produce, because this baby needs more cooking.It will make no sense if you haven't read Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. It hardly makes any sense at all. Beware!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"\\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\" doesn't really even deserve one star. After Ender's Shadow came out, I had some hope for the Ender series, but with Shadow of the Hegemon, it's going right downhill again.First of all, the characters in this book are unbelievable and are nothing like themselves in previous books of the series. Achilles, instead of being a clever-but-psycho serial killer, is now an astronomically brilliant, meglomaniacal super-villain bent on world domination. All he lacks is a brightly colored mask and a goofy nickname, and he could be a perfect foe for Batman. And the whole suppressed romance between Bean and Petra confuses me. I mean, Bean is ten years old! Isn't he a little young for that kind of stuff? Most children that age are still at the stage of \\"girls are yucky\\". True, Bean isn't your average ten-year-old, but I still found the whole thing a little disturbing.Secondly, Card spends too much time switching from plot to plot. Half of the book is talking about Petra's captivity with Achilles, and the other half focuses on Bean's adventures with Peter and Sister Carlotta. All of the skipping back and forth can really interrupt a reader's train of thought. I found it rather annoying, myself.And what has he done to Peter? Peter, it seems, is not really a little ... in training. He's really just trying to take over the world because he wants Mommy and Daddy's approval. Somehow, his abrupt change in personality was less than believable. Whatever happened to the half-mad, violent-natured little tyrant of \\"Ender's Game\\"? If you ask me, he was much more likable when he was torturing squirrels.But what really annoyed me about this book was Card's thinly disguised Messiah complex. He seems to have only written this awful novel as an excuse to ... America. And his LDS preachiness was even more tiresome. I am a Mormon myself and it even got on MY nerves. If he wants to preach, he should put it in a story where it fits. The preaching in Shadow of the Hegemon didn't really fit in with the story or advance the plot. Between that and his reversed-patriotism, I was about ready to throw this book out the window by the time I reached the end.In short, this book was definitely not on a par with its distinguished predecessors. It was just a tragedy. A tragedy that they did this to Bean and Peter, a tragedy that they did this to the readers, and a tragedy that they killed a tree to print this. If you really have to know what happens to the old characters, I suggest you save your money and get it from the library."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I don't really have time to write a review, but I wanted to make sure that I add my full five stars into the book's average. If you read no other books in your life, you should read this (and its prequel, and the original Ender's Game). Everything by Card is top notch, but in this book he goes beyond just top notch into amazing. I couldn't find a single fault with it, and I read the whole thing in only 2 days. All the characters are superb, and the fact that Bean has a major crush on Petra doesn't even bother me, it's written so well :-). Card, I have one word to say to you: &quot;Wow.&quot;"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Card returns to the world he created in a very new style. The characters we fell in love with in Ender's Game, and those we commiserated with in Ender's Shadow, are in a new environment. And on the world scene,those characters seem to lose much of their charm. Whereas before they were geniuses among geniuses, outwitting each other through intellectual battles, here many &quot;stupid&quot; characters come into play. Personally, I was hoping for a biography of Peter Wiggin, playing cruelty and generosity off each other as situations provided to gain power. However, this is more a story of Bean and Petra, much like the old novels yet very different and somewhat &quot;uncomforatable&quot; in their new surroundings."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Orson goofed with this one. It is probably hard to keep track of all those characters, but in the second printing the mistakes will be printed correctly. Here's the deal - Bean the primary protagonist is now on Earth. Every other soldier from the final battle waged in &quot;Ender's Game&quot; has been kidnapped. The premise for these kidnappings was predictable from &quot;Game&quot;, but in the actual writing, it came across poorly. But here is where it really fails, Young Bean, in an effort to contact Peter, goes to the Wiggin Home in Greensboro of the future. He has a dialog with Mrs. Wiggin and we see them discussing where Ender used to live. If you read the first edition you'll see the error. Luckily the corrected scene is located on Card's Website hatrack.com . Otherwise you too would be confused too. That was a fogiveable error. After all Card is human. But the unforgivable part is that the characters are not as clever or imaginative as they should be. Card can do much better. They are genius kids who think like grown-ups. Mr. Card has forgotten that kids suffer from biology - even if they are geniuses. The kids all behave like adults. Orson forgets that these kids are apt to behave like kids at least once in a while. He wrote about short people who have been programmed to behave like adults and never fail to do so. In the first book, at least they acted like kids once in a while. This book could have been better thought out. If you want to stay abreast of these characters, read the book. But wait till the corrections are made in the second printing."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"What's good - great fun to read, good insight into tactical desicion making, some nice historical perspectives, interesting characters and great presentation of conflictWhat's not so good - the evil kid (Achilles) does not have enough background to adequately explain his actions. Peter Wiggins is also poorly explored.Other : The Ender series is loosely based on an idea that very, clever children are capable of providing answers to questions that adults can't. This mindset has become very popular of late. When you run out of ideas - let someone or something else make the decisions.Card is well bright enough to provide an aged nun, Sister Carlotta, to temper the ego of child genius.Children will love it and adults should hope to learn from it.Engaging, clever and timely; we are lucky to have Orson spinning fine yarns.caslo"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Obviously i capitalize Amazing because the story truely is Amazing, yet to make sure that there is a sequel, Bean has to make some retarded moves.

Intense, gripping, fascinating - loved every minute and page!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"The book is a continuation of Ender's Shadow which tells you about what happens after all the battle school kids get back to earth. This is one of the best series I've ever read and most other Orson Scott Card books are the same way. Just read Ender's Shadow first."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I have become addicted to the Enders Shadow series after reading the Enders game series some 20 years ago. The draw for me is the political intrigue as the formics have by this book bitten the dust. Nobody reveals the mind of the Napoleons of our day better than Card. Luckily for me I am reading this series as Shadows in Flight has come out so i am enjoying all the Shadow books at a single read. With Peter as the Hegemon struggling to make the office relevant to the rest of the world we see the members of Ender Jeesh impacting the world in a number of countries and often at odds with each other. Card has had a remarkable run with Bean and this is some of his best work."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I've read each book in this series and they all flow together which is nice. It's almost as if the author wrote them all and then found places to end one book and start the other. This makes for a nice flow between characters when they speak to each other. It's also nice because it doesn't take 50 or 100 pages to get into a new book... it is simply a continuation of the previous book....I'm not sure there will be any more in this series after his last one, which is sad, but... a good series. Young adults I'm sure would love these! I as a full adult sure did.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Shadow of the Hegemon continues the Ender Saga in a most satisfying way. As a parallel to the original, it casts an intriguing new light on the main figures and creates new angels of view. And it is damned well-written!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This review is about the audiobook. Other people who gave this book 1 and 2 stars have amply explained the problems with the story.I would like to add that the audiobook is rather poor as well. The readers do a good job, as good as they did in Ender's Shadow. However, apparently all of them (except perhaps for the female reader) mispronounced \\"Hegemon\\". Why didn't the producer or someone else in charge verify the pronunciation *before* recording the story?Someone (perhaps someone's middle-school kid) edited *almost* every instance of the word, in various ways:1) The reader re-recorded the phrase which included the word, and that phrase was replaced. However, absolutely *no* attempt was made to get the replacement recording to sound even *remotely* the same as the original. In most cases it sounded like the replacement came from a laptop type of mic, with a hollow sound that contrasts sharply with the professional studio sound of the recording as a whole.2) The sound of the \\"g\\" was replaced. You can hear the click sound of the edges of the editing, something that only an amateur, or someone with no editing budget to speak of, would leave in there. It's trivially easy to smoothly replace a sound in a voice recording. In some cases a bit of the sound after the \\"g\\" was cut, so it just sounds mangled.3) Enough of the mispronunciations were left in that the whole effort to fix it only draws attention to it, in an extremely jarring and irritating way. If you're going to fix a mispronunciation, then at least be thorough about it!I checked this out from my library (via Library2Go), so I listened to it for free. But if I had paid for it, I would be very angry and the ridiculous editing job, and I would want to return it. I don't know if multiple versions of this audiobook were released, so I suppose it's possible that the one offered by Amazon doesn't have this problem."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This ebook of the Ender series, is as interesting as the rest of the Ender ebooks. Hard to put down when you start reading, so you should start reading on a weekend. After you buy, read and enjoy; rate and write a review, your opinion is important and is worth the same as everybody else. Have a good one"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This novel follows Bean, Peter Wiggin, and Petra (characters introduced in Ender's Game) as they exert their influence and take on Achilles, Bean's long-term nemesis. The plotting is excellent, and the character development is good. Card's knowledge of geopolitics and both the strategy and tactics of warfare is evident. My only quibble is that Card sometimes explains too much."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I don't care how genius a kid is the dialog and maturity of this story speaks more wisdom out of these childrens mouths than any life experience could possibly have endowed them with. The story though often boring was still enjoyable, however I am pulled out of the story every time their age is brought up. I loved Enders Game and even it at times bordered on overly wise words from children that couldnt possibly understand these things. Had their ages been bumped up even 5 years in these stories it might have made it more believable for me."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"The end of the PLOT of any book( that is.. when the story stops happening and all that's left is to write the conclusion chapter, and that is of any GOOD book) there are two options. Either, everyone dies and it's really rather depressing, or... everyone lives and everyone is still depressed for deep reasons unto themselves, or the book does not REACH an end and you realize that there's going to be another book where you find OUT who died. With Orson Scott Card, all of these are very possible endings. Which one does Shadow of the Hegemon end with? That's the surprise. and i WAS surprised, not to mention a bit shocked, It didn't seem to fit with the rest of the plot. But that's not the point. The point is, this is yet another GREAT Bean book. The actual concluding chapter is also exeedingly good. Plus, being surprised is always fun."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"First of all I need to say that Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow are two of my all-time favorite books, not just in Sci-Fi but in any genre. I think that Ender's Game is a classic of Science-Fiction and every fan should read it. That is the main reason that I can't give this book 5 stars. It isn't as good as the previous two. This book isn't as much Sci-Fi as it is a political novel. This book could almost be dropped into present times. But even with these problems it's still a very enjoyable book. There were twists and turns in the plot and it got more into the lives of Petra, Achilles, and Peter. Some people that have written reviews of this book complain that this isn't a complete novel. If they have read the afterword they will know that there are two more books after this one to fully explain the story of Peter Wiggin's rise to power. I would definitely reccomend this book to any Sci-Fi fan, but I have to say that you need to read either Ender's Game or Ender's Shadow. I suggest that you read both."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I enjoyed reading Shadow of the Hegemon, mostly because it continued the story of Bean, and I love to know what happens after the story ends. I must confess that this book did lack the ultra-clear focus that drives Ender's Game, and, to a great extent, Ender's Shadow. It's difficult for an author to take characters out of an enclosed environment (such as the Battle School), spread them all over the world, and then tie their fates together. It was fun to read this book and try to match Ender's timeline to this book. Was Ender still on Eros? Was he on his way to govern the bugger planets yet? I was expecting Peter to be more prominent than he was, and for Peter's struggles to become Hegemon to actually BE struggles. The changing world order would have given the old Peter more opportunities to flex his muscles, especially since he was Ender's older brother and the great Locke. I thought Peter would be more ruthless about consolidating his power than he was. The title initially led me to believe that Peter was going to be manipulating Bean the way he would have manipulated Ender. Well, you can't have everything, and I'm glad that the Wiggin parents were finally given their due - they did seem rather too unremarkable to have reared three geniuses, didn't they? Altogether, an enjoyable read for Ender and Bean fans, and I hope the saga continues, but fighting wars is much more enjoyable than dealing with the fallout after the war is won."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Orson Scott Card has written several novels, but is perhaps best known for his series of stories about Ender (Andrew) Wiggin, the prodigy who led the military of the interplanetary federation in its successful defense against interstellar invasion. Backed up by a group of other children almost as brilliant as he, Ender is responsible for the tactics that provide for a successful counterattack that defeats the enemy and destroys them and their home world completely. After the last battle, Ender moves on into the colonization of space and works through the personal and corporate trauma of the genocide that was necessary for human survival. After taking Ender's story to its conclusion in a series of novels, Card took an interesting tack, returned to the beginning of the story, and retold it from the point of view of characters who were supporting actors in the original. Primary among these were Ender's principal aides, Bean and Petra, and Ender's brother Peter, who was barely mentioned in the original. This new story was appropriately titled Ender's Shadow. That story line is concluded very effectively in Card's new book, Shadow of the Hegemon. After the war is over, and Ender has gone off to colonize deep space, the children who were trained to be soldiers and who helped Ender are returned to Earth and their families. The transition is difficult, since they are used to being treated far differently as they are at home. People can't seem to realize that they are not just children any more. When all of the members of Ender's inner circle, except one, are kidnapped, it seems that someone knows they are more than just children, and wants to use their special skills. Petra is one of those captured. Bean is the sole escapee. With Peter's help, Bean launches an effort to rescue the others and foil whoever it is that has taken them. Card's Ender Wiggin fans seemed to be pleased with the return of the prodigies in Ender's Shadow. They will also be pleased with the neat ways in which Card continues and concludes the story in Shadow of the Hegemon. It is not very often that an author creates supporting characters who are so interesting in their own right that they deserve their own stories."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Shadow of the Hegemon (2000) is the second SF novel in the Shadow subseries of the Ender-verse.

Read and enjoy!-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Compared to other scifi/fantasy books, Orson Scott Card's Ender series is pretty good. I've read three of the four on the Ender series (Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide), and two from the Shadow series (Ender's Shadow and this one). Shadow of the Hegemon doesn't totally ruin the series like Xenocide did, and the characters all seem true to themselves and are developed decently. Besides that, the book is marred with the usual flaws: unrealistic intelligence for young teenagers, writing that gets melodramatic at times. The book thankfully doesn't have the ridiculously long start-up time that Speaker for the Dead had, and it doesn't have the even more ridiculously tedious history of Xenocide.Remember that throughout this story, Bean, Petra, Achilles, and Suriyawong are all supposed to be like, 14 or 15. Peter Wiggin is supposed to be 20. And throughout the story, they're taking over the world, outsmarting the highest officials, turning countries against one another for personal gain, etc. They're all supposed to be tactical geniuses who can almost perfectly predict their adversaries' and their friends' movements. The problems are obviously (1) that their ability to manipulate governments is just ridiculously unrealistic; and (2) their ability to understand each other on a quite frankly almost supernatural/telepathetic level is totally unrealistic.It's unrealistic on a bad writing level. Everyone seems to have the same vocabulary (\\"mat&eacute;riel\\" is a surprisingly common word hundreds of years from now, I guess), the same sense of humor, the same pace of talking, etc. It's a problem that's characteristic of the rest of the series, but it's still a problem.Orson Scott Card's also a huge fan of doing really dramatic paragraphs.Like this.These are just technical flaws, though. The story's character development is decent; the plot is decent; the themes developed are ok. It's a good book by scifi standards, but there isn't too much scifi going on, and there isn't really anything groundbreaking here.Also, the epilogue at the end is all kinds of cheese. An ego from someone who's writing will never match Philip K. Dick's."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Continuation of the Ender saga, occurs just after the events of Ender's Shadow.Novel is somewhat worthwhile for three reasons.Mainly, Ender's Shadow was such a good book that it's inherently interesting to find out what happened to Bean, not to mention Achilles. There is a lot of action involving these two, so it should satisfy curiousity as to their fates.Second, the Ender universe is probably the last refuge of the meritocratic vision at one time popularized by Asimov, Heinlein, and other authors from the last century. The notions that people on \\"the net\\" as Card terms it are going to be swayed by reasoned arguments or that nations will fight over gaining access to bright kids with high test scores, is laughable but endearing. (Parodied in xkcd #635). Meritocratic ideals have long fled the real world, but it's still pleasantly nostalgic to read about this alternate reality where they matter, since they're virtually extinct from modern fiction as well.Finally, the byzantine political machinations are somewhat interesting, and in particular Achilles' plans are notable.The novel is nowhere near as strong as Game or Shadow, however. The writing is overly simplistic; the style of the prose is insipid and boring. There is much, much too much dialogue, most of it monotonous. Sometimes characters launch into ridiculous, lengthy and dull speeches for no clear reason, indeed even when there's obviously not time for that. There's one particularly cloying speech by Sister Carlotta where she suddenly describes her whole philosophy of life for pages and pages. The characters, except for Achilles, are drawn on the sappy and uninteresting side as well. Some of the plot developments - the attempts at Bean - are either cliched or not realistic. Bean himself doesn't really do much that clever here.Overall, there is just a lot of \\"filler\\" in the novel, long pointless conversations, and I found myself skimming or speed-reading near the end. Nevertheless, despite its flaws, fans of the Ender saga may find it worth reading."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Please do not let this be your first Read of the Enders series books! This is like the 6th(?) book in the series and has the feel of being a bit tired. A person will get frustrated with the charicter development in this book if they haven't read Enders Game and the other books in the series. Without that background the reader may think some of the charicters a bit empty and grow inpatient with the pace of the story. If you do not have the history of the previous books you may tire while waitng to find out what happens to them. Card is a great author and is still able to squeeze out clever twists in the story that seems to have gone on for lifetimes. And, Enders Game with it's fantastic ending will be a masterpiece that all his work will be compared to for lifetimes. I don't know of any author who wrote a masterpiece every time and it would be unfair to the author to his work be evaluated by this one novel. You will be unfair to yourself if you read this book before reading the others in the series."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Shadow of the Hegemon is not as good as some of the other books in the original series, but it is nothing less still worth reading. Maybe that's not fair to this second series of books, because even though they are set in the same world they lack a few of those characters that we knew from the originals. This should not lead to too much disappointment because quite a few of the old favorites are back as well being joined by a few new ones.Card has been writing his masterpiece with the Ender series and this book belongs in that masterpiece. Every time I read a book of his, I realize his genius and ingenuity. This book is no different. Card knows what makes people tick and does that quite well in this book. Card has never wanted to write just a book. He is constantly trying to teach us something through his very real life lessons that are experienced by his characters. Card really wants all his readers to think about what they are reading.I do want you to realize that this book is only the first part of a story that will continue, because Card once again didn't plan on writing as much as he did. This book lacks some of the hard-core sci-fi that is present in Card's other Ender books but makes up for with his deep look into a futuristic political climate.Card has a way that makes his characters seen older and more mature without meaning to, and I do sometimes see that as a flaw. These children are geniuses, but they do not I think, deserve the maturity and respect they are given to such a degree in the story. Very few adults would let the reigns of humanity rest in these children's hands. I guess this could also be why there are so many Card fans, because he does strain the borders of common sense at points while staying very original in thinking.I genuinely enjoyed this story as Card once again explores Ender's world through Bean. Bean and Petra come closer as dramatic changes happen around them. The plot is sometime rather unbelievable at time, but this is science fiction. Bean archrival is back and hopes to bring the world into turmoil. Bean has to decide his place in the world as two forces fight for world domination or at the very least manipulation. This is also the story of Peter's ascension to the hegemony and control of the early fate of mankind. Peter must overcome all his weaknesses to succeed. Bean and Peter are not Ender but that doesn't hurt this story at all. I applaud Card in this fine book.I do hope that the sequels will continue the story of Shadow of the Hegemon and finish out what he has started. If Card does as he usually does there will be a lot more books. He never seems able to write a story with just one book. I have never minded, and I can't wait to get to the new books."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This book by Orson Scott Card, is a very good sequel to Enders shadow. It gives more depth about the character known as bean. They tell about his personal life and how he struggled to stay alive. Bean is my favorite character in the Enders game series. He shows the most wits and learns the fastest. He develops emotion, which he has never felt before. Bean, ends up saving the world along with a team of super intelligent kids that think they are playing a game but in reality they are actually commanding star ships in a galaxy where the buggers reside.Not only is Bean a survivor of 25 which 23 were burnt down, he ends up finding his parents and eventually meets his long lost bother. His savior, who is also like his mother, finds Enders brother Peter. Bean helps peter become Hegemon.To me this is the best book of the series, because to me Bean was my favorite Character, because of his intelligence and his past experiances."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"A book that explains how Bean helps Peter came to become the Hedgeman and unite the planet under one government."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This was my least favorite Orson Scott Card book to date, by far.

The only reason I believe people read these books, is because they loved Enders Game so much, they cant bear to stop reading the books and reliving the experience over and over again.I thought in the book, the switching back from character to character was quite annoying and disrupted my reading. I would have enjoyed the whole story told from Peter, Bean, and Archilles rather than having to read parts from Petra's point of view.Also, the book seemed to get into politics and military so much that I was left puzzled and skipped through many parts. I enjoyed Enders Game and Enders Shadow as it was fast-paced and was easier to understand. The beginning of Shadow of the Hegemon was similar to Enders Shadow, but as you continue the novel, you get more and more confused as to what is really going on.Another thing that I found quite annoying is how Bean thinks about how he should have stopped Archilles from killing Poke. Orson Scott Card seems to feel that we need to hear him regret the incident every other chapter. As a reader, I understand that Bean wishes he did something to stop Archilles, and once or twice mentioning it in the novel would have been more than enough.Overall the book is a great read. However, don't expect another Enders Game or Enders Shadow, as you are only setting yourself up for disappointment. The book, however, did entice me enough to continue in the series and read Shadow Puppets."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This is the sequel to Ender's Shadow, and continues the story begun therein. This story takes place on Earth in the immediate aftermath of the victory over the alien menance. Ender has departed on his long relativistic travel to the distant future, but the other children trained at the Battle School have returned to Earth. Any hopes of living quiet, peaceful lives are shattered when the members of Ender's army are kidnapped. Now Bean must team up with Ender's brother Peter to rescue them and fight the psychopathic Achilles.This book delves deeply into international politics, intrigue, and strategic maneuvering. Orson Scott Card brings his impressive story telling skills to bear on a global stage and provides a science-fiction thriller every bit as exciting as any contemporary military thriller. This book should have wide appeal to fans of the Ender series, as well as military thriller fans and general science fiction fans. As always, Card provides us with complex characters and deep emotional context for the action, drawing the reader fully into his vision of the future."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"okay you cannot not like this book. Shadow of the Hegemon focus's on the protaganist of ender's shadow, bean aka julian delphiki (WAY better than ender by far) as he stugges to prevent wars while searching for his kidnapped friend from ender's jeesh, petra arkanian. the story first starts out with everybody from ender's jeesh being kidnapped by Achilles and Achilles is his normal psychophant and events proceed from there. i think that this is the best of the shadow series with intrigue, politics, and action."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Once again, I feel Orson Scott Card and his child characters fly off the of every page in this book. I thought the tie-ins with political and military history really helped to ground the obvious sci-fi elements to a very possible future of our world. Doing this gave the book a horrific reality that I didn't necessarily feel in the previous Ender books. I was, however, a little disappointed in the end, as I was hoping for something a little less predictable. I felt all of the books in the series could stand alone more or less, but this one definitely finished with a \\"sequel is coming\\" ending."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This time the battlefield is set firmly on terra firma, Earth! Ender and his sister, Valentine are not around. The intelligent children from Battle School were trying to blend back into life on Earth when they were kidnapped, except for Bean. He, his family, and his neighbors were bombed! Bean went into hiding with Sister Carlotta. Ender's brother, Peter Wiggin, was their only hope.Peter may only have been a teen, but his intelligence at politics and pulling strings were as great as any of the Battle School Grads were at commanding! He held two names on the nets. Both were well known and had much influence. He was &quot;Locke&quot;, known as a peacemaker, and he was &quot;Demosthene&quot;. He would help retrieve the brilliant children. But Petra was the most important and she was held prisoner by Achilles! Peter intended to rule the world...and soon. He would become the Hegemon. But first, he and Bean must become alliances to defeat Achilles, before he manages to destroy all the nations!***** Orson Scott Card's deep thinking strategies on national and global politics, as well as, on national and global military tactics are proven once again to the Sci-Fi reading public!The story mainly follows Bean, with Petra and Peter as secondary characters. But my vanity makes me like Petra the most. After all, change the P in her name to D and you have MY name! But more than that, I enjoyed watching her (as a 14 year old) using logic against grown men who trained in psychiatry. Petra has a way of seeing things more clearly than most. Here is a story that will hit the best seller lists almost immediately! It is not only excellent, it is awesome! *****"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"In Speaker for the Dead and Xenocide, you get a few small glimpses of what Earth was like after the Formic Wars. In Shadow of the Hegemon, you get all the interesting details.While I don't think this was nearly as good as Ender's Shadow, it still has most of the same characters, and it is interesting to see what happens to them on their return from Battle School.The plot is not all that plausible, but Card writes well enough so that you don't think too much about that. The story is good, and the characters are great. The only problem that I have with this book (and this series) is I really never saw enough depth from the Achilles character to see him as a real person.I would recommend this to anyone who has read and enjoyed Ender's Shadow."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I will be very blunt in this review, even though I have been a huge fan of Mr. Card since reading Ender's Game over ten years ago, this latest effort of his just fars fall short of bar he set for himself. The problem is that he writes a novel that deals with the military strategies and political intrigues of a world nearly two hundred years from now, but it appears without actually having thought how advances in technology would effect this. His idea of combat is actually outdated for this day and age, the over use of armor and discussion of supply lines actually comes from WWII military thought.Anyone who has read Brookings Institute reports or bothered to ever read even Scientific America or such info would know that the future is to be based more around the individual soldier, who will be very much like the Mobile Infantry in Robert Heinlein's classic Starship troopers, which was written in 1959.At least with Ender's Game he was descirbing combat that was nonexistent in our day and age and was purely theoretical, he could then enjoy descibing those battles in his own personal way. But when choosing to write a military-political back on our homeground you have to be that much more aware of &quot;realism&quot;.Also as student of Political Science, I think Mr. Card's understanding of world affairs and interactions is very basic and actually, for anyone who is also in that field of thought very &quot;traditionalist&quot; or &quot;realist&quot;. For others its dated to again a pre-WWII philosophy. Again I think it fails to accept the modifications to human interaction that have occured in the last twenty years alone due to technology advances. His net is about as advanced as the internet is today, if at all.I think in reading the Afterword he left in the book one understands why Mr. Card's vision is so limited. He claims knowledge on subjects from having one book in the area, and in one case on Thailand the concise history. I have read Guns, Germs and Steel, as Mr. Card has and highly recommend it as well, but one of the points of that book which Mr. Card misses is that dynamic changes in technology, through the luck of viral competition and the societies that arise from climate farming techniques, that are unexpected can make all the difference between a Spain conquering the Aztecs or the Aztecs conquering Spain.Mr. Card though writing interesting characters, creates a world, where even thought there was a political stagnation due to the Bugger Wars, there has been no attempt to advance or theorize how that society is different from today, beyond pulling the old stock bit that sci-fi writers have been using since the 60s that America will go into decline and become a second rate power."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I bought this for Christmas for my 32 yr. old daughter. She loved it."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Shadow of the Hegemon is not at all about Peter Wiggins (who we all know eventually becomes Hegemon). No I don't get the title either then. Shadow of the Hegemon is all about Bean and his old nemesis Achilles and Bean's attempt to foil Achilles' little game of Risk and rescue his beloved Petra. The military strategy and geopolitical aspects of Shadow of the Hegemon easily overcame any weakness in the story. Rather than personal characterizations this novel is more like a thriller: will the brilliant Bean succeed? what will the insane Achilles do next? what is his plan? This may be explained by the afterword in which Card explains that this was really half a novel (the other half of which is now Shadow Puppet's I guess). Not nearly as moving or intense as Ender's Shadow, SotH is still a fine piece of work with a strong story and a page turning suspense level."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I've never read Speaker for the Dead or it's sequels, because I just wasn't interested . . . but when Card came out with a book about what happened on earth right after the Battle School kids got home, I couldn't resist. It's a good book, as long as you brush past the swearing."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"It has always been a complaint of mine since the original Ender Series that Peter Wiggin was merely a templated character-a nothing which helped define Ender, Peter seemed to exist only to be a foil to Andrew Wiggins goodness.No longer.Scott Card has done an amazing thing with each of the characters in this book and that is breath life into them. Peter is three dimensional and we can actually sympathize with any and all his situations.Without giving anything away from the tremendous plot of the story, Scott Card is going strong in this series and has made us fall in love with other children as well as Ender of old.I look forward to the rest of this series with absolute joy. Definitely a great read for anyone who has read the original Enders series. If you liked Armour and Starship Troopers, some of the military actions in this book will make you salivate.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"To make my preferences known from the start: yes, of course I was struck _Ender's Game_ (I don't know who wasn't), but _Speaker for the Dead_ left me unimpressed, let alone its subsequent sequels. I was therefore skeptical about _Ender's Shadow_--but found myself liking it very much, and even considering it superior than _Ender's Game_ in some aspects._Shadow of the Hegemon_ is even better.When I heard the title, I was shocked. The Hegemon? Who cares about Peter? I didn't want to know his side of the tale. Nasty bloke, he. But the promise of more Bean pulled me in. (You *do* need to read _Ender's Shadow_ first.)There is some Peter, yes, but his ascent to power is almost incidental. It is Bean who grows here, without the constraints of the tightly pre-determined plot that were present in _Ender's Shadow_. He was already a remarkable character; but, getting the sprinkles *and* the ice cream, you also learn the stories of other people who were in the Battle School: Petra, especially.But the focus is on Bean, and how he wrestles with the turn toward war Earth is taking. Bean admits himself that his primary concern is for himself, not for world peace or even for other people; yet he is nonetheless pulled into this conflict.I am neither a political scientist nor a historian, but I found the international scenario presented quite plausible. And the fact that it is children who are pulling all the strings doesn't seem ludicrous, either (although there are frequent occasions when adult characters can't quite believe it--a quite realistic touch). Card doesn't hide their conversations and ploys, and he does a very convincing job of portraying kids whose intellects are likely tenfold that of ours. There are also quite a few email-like messages presented as interludes, often referred to within the story itself, and I was quite pleased to see that they were included in their entirety, so that we could judge them ourselves. (And my judgment was generally favorable.)I do object to Card's military history. If you take children, even geniuses, and train them for warfare in space, they are not automatically brilliant at earth-bound warfare, as well. Perhaps they're so smart that they can grasp either concept near-instantly, and I'm too dull to comprehend the possibility of that. But still, it gnawed at me, especially considering the heavy amount of strategizing that occurred in the story. Plus, he uses the ubiquitous &quot;net&quot; as a far too convenient tool. Its presumed security and use are frankly laughable, but forgivable, seeing how it *is* a tool, and a necessary one.See how I'm picking at the little flaws? Perhaps this is the novel of less technical merit, when compared to its prequel; but in terms of pulling at emotions and weaving brilliantly colored characters, I believe this is Card's best."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"First Of All......the &quot;Ender&quot; series is the best SF read of all time.After reading &quot;Shadow Of The Hegemon&quot; cover to cover nearly 6 times (I have apprx: 2 chapters left) in the past few months, I must admit that with every new book, I have new a new favorite.Shadow Of The Hegemon is now the #2 book in the series.....only because it would be morally wrong to place it in front of Ender's Game.I personally feel that the storytelling in &quot;Shadow&quot;, eclipses at many points that of the original. It keeps you in suspense much like the &quot;battle against the buggers&quot; did in &quot;Ender&quot;, but with more plot twists. But yet as always with Orson Scott Card, The Story NEVER Gets Lost In The Storytelling.Orson Scott Card Books Only Get Better With Every Read....And Re-Read, And Re-Read, Etc.Ps: I now have my wife HOOKED on the &quot;Women Of Genesis&quot; Series...Thanks Orson, For Writing About Something Dear To The Hearts Of So Many."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Ever since reading Ender's Game, I have been mesermized by Card's style. I immediately purchased Ender's Shadow, and loved it just as much, perhaps even more. Then I saw this book. It was just another sequel. However, I loved it. It was truly brilliant. The storyline is exciting, the characters are thorough, everything is compelling. I don't recommend readin this book if you haven't yet read Ender's Shadow, as it is somewhat a sequel to this book, more so than any other book in the Ender Saga.All in all, a terrific read. Any science fiction fan would love it. Any Orson Scott Card fan would die for it =)."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Really cool. I love the issues Card brings up in this book. The action is nice too. It has depth, it has sorrow, it has victory, it has defeat, and it has drama- everything a book needs!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"A very nice book. Definitely one of the best Orson Scott Card books yet. Shadow of the Hegemon is all about Bean, and how he manipulates the world through Peter, how he runs from Achilles, and how he finds out that he'll die very soon, due to the key that was turned in his brain. This book is action-packed like Ender's Game, but it's also philosophical, like Children of the Mind. It's definitely worth reading, and if you liked the Ender series, you'll like this book."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"With great hope I opened this new book in the Ender series, hope that it improves on the previous one in the series, Children of the Mind. Which was just plain boring. Had to skip to the end as could not bear the appallingly plodding script and magical approach to plot devices. Bad luck for me, this is worse. Within a few pages the stupidity of the plot, shallowness of the characters and non-exploration of SF causes headaches. Perhaps one of the worst books I've bought. Do not buy! Orson has lost it."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"o.s.card wrote ender's game, which was one of the great sc-fi fiction i ever read, then he went on and wrote sequels, based on ender's game epilogs.later he got tired, started to write paralex stories : ender's shadow, which was ender's game by a prespective of other chracter : bean - an upgrade to side figure in ender's game.shadow of the hegemon is a sequel to ender's shadow, and in some way a magnifying glass action on some of the side stories or background stories in the original ender's game.what's wrong in this book, and this are just main points :1. the original background stories in ender's game, were very unclear, and didn't have any importance, what so ever on the plot.2. the upgraded hero, bean character is totaly un-convincing, i can't beleive such a chracter can exist, and act like it does.3. upgraing petra arkanian to a female heroin character - she was a side figure in eneder's game and wasn't a positive one eather - \\"politiocly correct\\" move from scot ?4. upgrade to ender's family - is parents are not the idiots, like they were portrated, and petter is not a monster, looks artifial, again did i say \\"politicly correct \\".5. a realy bad plot, and un-reliable one about the new achiles-bean conflict, i could understand a chapter before bean \\"the geneous\\" what achiles is up to, and he had to learn it from informer !.so finaly this is a bad story, that it's only purpuse is to milk you some more money, and prepare you to the next sequel in bean-peter weigen stories.waste of time for those wo read ender's game.for those who didn't read scot - read ender's game - that's cover all is creation."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I simply did not care what happened on earth in terms of political power.

I want to understand how Bean is going to deal with the real world, as well as his classmates. I don't care who is in power on earth. And I thought the handling of Peter's parents was absurd! Plus, the killing of Sister Carlotta was a waste. How did Achilles become so powerful? There is no clear explanation for this. It was a bad book. I hope the final 2 are better. Perhaps Card is out of ideas..."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Great work. Good plot, good characters, and a good base for future books. This book is similar to &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; in setting up a solid base for a series of books. This book went in depth, showed the development of youth, and issues which affect us every day. I can't wait to read his future books."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This book is full of non stop suspense and political action. Another great addition to the Ender series by Orson Scott Card. As predicted in earlier books, all the children from the battle school were kidnapped by some government with hope of controlling the world with the powerful generals that won the war against the buggers. All except for Julain Delphiki (Bean), and his brother, the less important Nikolai, who narrowly miss being killed in a bonbing of his house with the Delphiki family. Bean realises at once who it wmust be, an occupant of the town where he grew up and a Battle School late arrival, Achilles (AH sheels).The Belgian boy Achilles is found to have made a pact with the Russian goverment and has control over the whole area. As Bean identifies and enlists the help of the famed Locke and Demosthenes, who is Enders Brother, Peter, he has to stop Achilles and the Russians from taking over the world. Using Peter's knack for persuasion and his mastermind, he forces Achilles out of Russia, freeing all but one of the Battle School Captives, Petra.In the Battle school, Petra was one of Ender's jeesh, along with Bean and other memebers of the battle school. Bean tries to free her, but Achilles quickly enlists her as a tactician for his new country, India. Bean must stop Achilles from taking over the world before its too late. All though there were a few errors, no one is perfect, so this is worth 5 stars anyway."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Wonderful sequel to Ender's Shadow - can't wait for the next 2 books in the series."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This book gripped me and broke through my reading dry spell. Read it all in one day, and wished there were more. Not a master work like SONGMASTER or ENDER'S GAME, but a stirring read relating to what it means to be human in this universe.Small brains natter about details and unimportant errors. But as usual, Mr. Card, for all his intellectual prowess, is speaking to the soul of his reader. Too many zomboid americans who think they are cultured because they learned to read will not connect with this material. They will be unable to relate to the spiritual, emotional basis of this book."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Although I found the sequels to Ender's Game rather disappointing, these last two novels spun off correlating with Bean and Ender's adventures at Battle School and his rise to power were surprisingly well written and very interesting. Like the other reviews I could not put the book down. The plot was thick and nail-biting and the story left off perfectly for the next book. I am eagerly looking forward to the two following this novel."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"For fans of ENDER'S GAME, this book is a must. As a sequel to ENDER'S SHADOW, this book explores the possibilities of the genius Battle School alumni entering the world military and political scenes. It deftly blends Card's quick-paced, more political style (e.g. ENDER'S GAME) with his more thoughtful and philosphical style (e.g. SEAKER FOR THE DEAD).Like ENDER'S GAME showed us human behavior through young and innocent eyes, SHADOW OF THE HEGEMON shows us vast societies from the same perspective."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I really like the books about Ender and his &quot;Jeesh.&quot;(Companions)These books are great becasue they show all of these charecters at their finest. They are all pushed to the limits-and some of them break under the presure! They are like real humans. They are all believable! I loved this book and can't wait for the next two in the Shadow series!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This novel continues Bean's story after the events in Ender's Shadow. Bean returns to earth to join his family which happens to be his good friend Nikolai's family. He and the rest of the Battle School children are threatened by the various countries across the globe that want to kidnap them and use their tactical skills in conflicts against each other. Achilles returns as Bean's nemesis in this book.This book starts going bad after Bean's character development stagnates about halfway through. After that it becomes more of a chase from one place to another with endless amounts of technical detail about the brilliant strategies that Bean and the other Battle School children are employing in the conflicts across the globe.Card does a lot better with fictitious battles in zero gravity than he does with something closer to reality. By the time the book ends it's hard to care who has won or lost or to figure out what exactly they did to end up there. Card's intent seems to be to mix up his coterie of characters and universe in a small scale war situation and explore the strategies and tactics involved. Unfortunately his dry descriptions of what should be done, what could be done and what Bean and the other kids end up doing takes up much of the latter half of the book.Peter, Ender's brother, and Ender's parents play small roles in the book as well, but mostly it follows Bean's path through the earth conflict.The book is a definite step down from Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow and has turned me off of reading further books in the series. The good thing about Card's previous books in this set was that he didn't focus too much on the details of what the kids were doing so much as their reactions to those situations. The characters were the focus, not the minute details of what they were doing."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I have been an avid reader of Orson Scott Card for years. The Ender's Quartet and Shadow i considered to be fantastic books although in different ways. Ender's Game was interesting while still action and suspense-filled. The next three were philosophical and fascinating. Ender's Shadow amazed me at the depth of the subplots. But Shadow Of The Hegemon seemed to fall flat. I was immensely dissapointed after reading the book. The plot seemed to follow the wrong people in the wrong amounts. Ender's jeesh, especially Petra, did not seem to be fleshed out in an interesting way. The majority of the book was talking about the kids, but they had very little personality. What made Petra any different than some &quot;genius kid&quot;? Bean had fascinating twists in Ender's Shadow, but nothing could be fleshed out throughout Hegemon, even Bean's state of being &quot;not quite human&quot; was quickly dismissed. THe plot lost track of the importance of people, and focused more on Tom Clancy style war tactics. I would have hoped for much more on the interaction between Peter and Bean. Peter's character was changed to drastically from Ender's Game. The psychotic-ness was still there in a way, but Card tried too hard to make him more &quot;vulnerable&quot;. He should have expanded on the twists within peter's mind, not his basic humanity. THere were good points in all of this though. The plot flowed smoothly most of the time and was interesting enough to continue. There was suspense at all times to keep the reader reading. The reintroduction of Graff was a nice touch. This is a great book for an easy, adventurous read.All in all, it was a decent book and a good read, but not even close to the standards expected from this series. It was no where near what could have been done to further expand the series."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"When I heard Card was coming out with another Ender book I couldn't wait to get my hands on it and be one of the first to read it. Well that excitement lasted for about the first 100 pages before Shadow of the Hegemon took a serious turn for the worse.Card opens this 6th installment of the Ender series from the prospective of Petra Arkanian, Ender's only female &quot;jeesh&quot; member. The war against the formics has ended and the planet has now only to worry about squabbles within itself. Petra is a famous war hero - a great resource to her homeland and this demand for battle school successes is the foundation of the plot.Shadow of the Hegemon is a major step down from it's classic predecessors. At no point did I have the &quot;wow&quot; feeling that I have grown to depend on from Card. Only at isolated points is any real creativity displayed and more often than not, he uses his work as a platform for a history lesson. The in-your-face, real, and primal action that is the trademark of Ender's Game NEVER comes and only rarely was I turning the pages for a reason beyond getting to the end. There is simply WAY too much politics in this book and not enough action.Shadow of the Hegemon is only recommendable to the most hardcore of Orson Scott Card fans. I though I was one of them until finishing this job. For those of you who want to get into the Ender series, PLEASE begin at the core, Card's best work and MY favorite book, Enders Game."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"He wrote a masterpiece worthy of Heinlein (sp?). Now he is churning out plot filler like an anonymous serialist. The Ender series is working on the Star Wars principle--the closer to the original the book is, the better it is. I stopped reading this one 1/4 of the way through after realizing that, a) not only was I not enjoying this book, but b) it was also sucking the life out of the other, good books in the series. For this reason, it deserves a couple of negative stars, but the space-time continuum of amazon.com won't abide that."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I have to say that I loved this new book. It was interesting and indeed a book I would recommend. I think this new series is a much-needed addition to the Ender's Game universe. Its new perspective is not just the same old stuff again, but, in fact, a very new story that fills in holes with the old series and brings to the spotlight a new hero.I really like Bean. His supernatural intellect makes him more interesting. Some people say that this book is less good because of the unbelievable characters, but I think it strengthens its story. Makes it more fun to read. I don't want to read a story about everyday kids that happen to get lucky and save the world. That style of story telling grows old. This plot is new and refreshing. The world is divided into a gigantic chess bored and these super-genius children use people and countries like pieces in a grand battle for domination.The Battle School grads are back from their space station and find their homelands in chaos. Talk of war spreads like wildfire among the people of Earth. The world powers are in a state of unrest, just waiting for a reason to lash out at their neighbors. This sets the scene of a story that only Card could tell. World politics, stunning military tactics and a mind-crunching plot are all wonderfully put by Card. I couldn't have hoped for a better book. This is a must read, folks, the best book of the year. You'll want to stay up reading and stay up even more nights just waiting for the next book. That's how good this was, Shadow of the Hegemon, a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Finally, the long downward spiral of the Ender series (soon to be renamed the \\"Wiggin\\" series? - Ender never appears in this book) has been halted, and we have a truly entertaining page-turner. While Xenocide was less enjoyable than Speaker for the Dead, and Children of the Mind less enjoyable again, this second book in the \\"Shadow\\" subseries is definitely better than the first. Returning from the Battle School to an Earth that is once again fighting with itself, the young men and women who won the Formic War are in high demand to plan strategy for the nations bent on world domination - in this future universe, they are India, China, Russia, and Brazil. Achilles, Bean's arch-nemesis from Ender's Shadow, has re-emerged as a mastermind bent on world domination. As his first step he kidnaps a number of Ender's former army-mates and sequesters them in Russia, in addition to trying to kill Bean. Bean escapes and enlists the help of Ender's brother Peter. The stage is then set for a battle of wits between the schemes of Achilles, aided by his captured Battle School graduate, and Bean and Peter.The action is furious and fast paced. Card's vision of the future is an interesting one - he sees the United States as growing complacent and lethargic, existing only to cater to markets for their trade goods (I'm sure political scientists could read all sorts of hidden meaning into Card's statements on the U.S. in this future history). The politics he creates are nicely interwoven, and are believable. He continues to emphasise the folly of arrogant adult leaders, as compared to the non-linear thinking possible only of the young and irrepresible. It's to Card's credit that he doesn't get bogged down in details (like Children of the Mind) but lets his characters inhabit their future world as if it really exists. We learn about it simply through inhabiting the same space while we are reading the story.There are a few problems. It is a little simplistic in its portrayal of military affairs (especially when compared to a Tom Clancy book, for example) - there is little here that is innovative (socially or in military equipment), and the diplomacy practiced by the main protagonist countries is laughable. That Achilles can so easily manipulate the governments of these powerful nations is a serious strain on plausibility. However, none of these points detract unfavourably from the overall story, which is well-paced and thoroughly enjoyable. While not as good as Speaker for the Dead, easily the best book in the Ender series, it is very good and a worthy addition to the Wiggin Saga."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"You know what, I just want a mini-tirade to begin: Orson Scott Card's novels shouldn't be shelved in a sci-fi/fantasy ghetto -- in fact, I don't believe there should be such genre Balkanization at all. Card's presence has improved character development and storytelling in sci-fi/fantasy, but I think American fiction on the whole could use that help.Now to the real review:This novel is the perfect follow-up to Ender's Shadow, showing the further development of Bean's character and his coming into humanity -- he is still the calculating machine of the earlier novel, but he now allows himself to have genuine human attachments, not just the calculated relationships of Rotterdam and Battle School.However, to have the full emotional impact, one must read the first novel first (people may find this to be a truism in a novel series, but there have been several series that I have managed to read not only out of order but in reverse order without losing what is necessary to follow the action or characters). In many ways, Card is an adept at playing on emotions - as Petra notes at one point, one can know an author is deliberately setting you up for a particular emotional response in a very blatant way, and still not be able to prevent that response. I was in tears twice during this novel, even knowing what was looming ahead.Orson Scott Card admits that his original idea for this book ended up getting split into two novels, and perhaps I would have been impatient had he decided to fuse what will now be two novels into one really long one (not impatient because I can't handle the length - my favorite books are all over 700 pages long - but because he would've published later). But I think I could have withstood the wait! I hate it when he finishes his novels in the middle. The post-Ender's Game trilogy irritated me in that very way. I understand that he does better than many authors in staying true to reality, and in that way one can't expect all ties to be neatly gathered at the end, but for crying out loud this is fiction, and I need more resolution than Peter getting to be Hegemon at the end! (I'm not giving anything away plot-wise really because: 1) Orson Scott Card's novels are almost never about plot but about character development 2) Anyone who has read the Ender's Game books know that Peter ends as Hegemon eventually anyway.)Card has been very smart in these books, Ender's Shadow and Shadow of the Hegemon, for he always leaves a big hole for one to peer into and wonder: What is happening in there? People may have seen Achilles' escape at the end of Ender's Shadow as an obvious ploy to a sequel (which it was), but I found the disclosure of Bean's probable future physical development to be even more intriguing -- how long does Bean have to live? What will he accomplish before he dies? This question remains open at the end of Shadow of the Hegemon, and one knows this will hang until the 4th book - or 5th if Card ends up splitting up another novel.For the sake of the reader, Card, please don't split another novel! Just make an extra-long one! If kids can handle a 700 page Harry Potter book, Card fans can handle an 800-page Bean book! Argh!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Like many fine novel writers before him, Card has written a book that is more absorbed with the political complexity that functions as backdrop than he is with his own characters.He is still a gripping writer, and I found the political landscape interesting. While by no means as addictive as the original trilogy, I still found myself coming back to the story with pleasure.Sadly, the pleasure was often marred by disbelief about the characters and their actions. As brilliant as these children are, their arcs are not well developed past that point of brilliance. Petra and Bean seem stuck in a permanent first act, even when events wrapped in personal loss should propel them further.It is worth noting that Card originally conceived of this book and its sequel as one book. It may well be that many of my issues are coming from the pacing of a unity split in two. It will certainly be interesting to read the next book in the series to see if I can get a feeling for how the completed book might have been.This book is not recommended for readers who have not read the earlier books-- too many of the nuances would be lost if you tried to begin here, rather than with Ender's Game. Card fans should like it, if not love it. There is still enough raw skill in his writing to keep me hopeful about the next series entry."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Very witty book in which the characters are realistic, the insights interesting, and the plot has enough action to keep a 13-year old boy on the edge of his seat. It goes very deep into human nature and brings out some of the flaws in civilazation and human behavior that we see today, that have always been here, and will never go away. Card manages to bring many hypothetical situations into his story withot changing the course of history. All in all a very well written book."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I enjoyed the exploration of Petra's character in this book as well as her growth from smart-ass little girl to young adult. Many of the other characters who had just been mentioned by names are full characters in Hegemon. Taking place after the battle school has been disbanded, Shadow of the Hegemon encompasses a much wider scope, dealing with the politic of the countries/world that Ender has left behind. The most important focus of the novel are the events that lead Peter to power. His ambition leads him to the Hegemony, but Bean is there behind him in the shadows!Card's handling of politics between countries makes the book engaging, as it revolves around a kidnaping of Petra by Achilles and Bean efforts to save her. We even get to see what Battle school graduates are doing after Battle school; they are at the heart of military strategies in the book.Bean is more human in this book. He shows more emotion for people and he interacts more with his environment. Peter's role in this book was surprisingly small, but he plays a bigger part in the remainder of the series.It is well worth the read. It continues in the Ender tradition, but it 100% new events as opposed to Ender's Shadow."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Nobody liked Orson Scott Card's great books more than I did: Speaker for the Dead, Ender's Game, and the first few books of the Alvin Maker series are real classics.Which makes my disappointment at reading Shadow of the Hegemon all the more heartfelt.If you are a complete OSC fanatic, or a 16 year old science fiction fan, go ahead and read it. It does have a certain amount of Heinlein-esque derring-do and fun. For anyone expecting more from a book, like fully fleshed out characters, a fully imagined universe, or even a modicum of plausibility, you can do much better.The story continues the adventures of Ender Wiggin's sidekick Bean from Ender's Game; after being returned to Earth at the end of the Formic War, Battle School kids have become prized commodities and the ones from Ender's group become sort of pawns in an immense and totally implausible geopolitical game. Inexplicably, one battle school reject, a psycho street kid from Bean's past, as taken over Russia and has led them try to capture all of Ender's team. Petra is captured, Bean is on the run, and Peter Wiggin is on the way to not only becoming Hegemon but having a miraculous transformation into a nice guy, apparently because his parents told him (once) that they were as proud of him as they were of Ender. A couple of leaks to the captured kids, except for Petra who's dragged off by the pscyho to India; she inexplicably follows him around missing many opportunities to escape as he plots India's attack on Burma and Thailand, then all his plans fail but WAIT he was actually working for the Chinese all along, and Bean allows him to escape when he finally rescues her. And Bean and Peter are so successful that China ends up capturing India, Burma, and Thailand whom they were helping...this is a dumb book in so many ways I can hardly describe them, but of course I'll try anyway:a) Ender's Game had a level of believability because the war there was essentially a video game; it's easy to believe that kids would be great at that sort of 4 dimensional strategy. It's almost impossible to believe that kids, no matter how smart, could have that sort of effect in a real world military campaign, in any century. I've never soldiered, but I have enough respect for what they do to know that to lead them, there's no amount of genius that would substitute for some real world experience.b) Achilles is a ridiculous bad guy--he FAILED OUT of Battle School--so if Battle School was so good, why would he be any better than all the Battle School graduates? Let alone able to convince three successive governments to let him run their country without showing any success. This is so ridiculous as to be insulting to the readerc) Petra who is supposed to be tough is ridiculously weak and lame: we hear about how she is battleschool trained and Achilles isn't so she can take him in a fight, but she only tries attacking him once, very late in the book, and lets him get the drop on her...she's alone with him and the prime minister of Pakistan and never tries to get away from him. If the book were deeply written enough to imagine some sort of Stockholm syndrome at work, that she was somehow under his spell, it would have been more believable but that is clearly not what we are told.d) This is an incredibly thinly imagined and poorly conceived future world. We're told in an afterword that he's read one book about India and one book about Thailand...but his understanding of geopolitics and of war is something a smart 9th grader should surpass. China is able to conquer India because India moved ALL their soldiers to Burma and Thailand? Come on! The geopolitics of the book have been compared to a game of Risk, and that's really about the level it is: incredibly simplistic. So simplistic as to be just dumb. Reflecting no understanding at all of how relationships between countries, at peace and war, really work, and making no attempt to try and guess how 200 years might change things.e) Lastly, the whole issue of character and genius are just not working any more. To write effectively about genius, the author has to actually SHOW the reader that his character is highly intelligent, not just repeatedly tell him. Card is unable to convince me that any of his characters are really smart, which makes the whole house of cards fall part.This is really a disappointment compared with good contemporary sci-fi as well as with Card's great work. And very sad because of the quality of Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. It is, unfortuantely, consistent with some of the mindless pulp he's been turning out in the last few years, like Pastwatch and the whole Homecoming series, and I'm afraid that the Alvin Maker series may have gone downhill as well. Obviously I liked his best work enough to keep reading this stuff--but I sure hope he'll concentrate on salvaging his talent and deliver us something better...this is nothing but a disappointment."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"The Bugger War is over. The threat to humanity's existence is gone. Thus, the danger that united Earth in its defense is no longer present to prevent the simmering national and ethnic tensions from erupting into another World War. With nationalism running high, the children still stationed at the Battle School are kept from returning home until the Earth-bound war can be resolved, lest any party in this war get an unfair advantage from these military geniuses. The initial war and governmental powerplays among the Triad (the Polemarch, Strategos, and Hegemon political machines) end in short order and the children are free to return home. International tensions still simmer and threaten to explode at any time. Suddenly, many of the battle school children start to disappear. The mystery over what is happening to these children (who are all connected by being former members of Ender's army) and political intrigue involved in development of unifying world government of the Hegemon (mentioned with great import in \\"Speaker for the Dead\\") power the incredible thriller that is \\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\".\\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\" continues the on-going saga of Ender's trusted lieutenant, Bean, whose story was first expanded in the spectacular \\"Ender's Shadow\\". Bean has found his true family with his former Battle School mate, Nikolai and his family. While content with this new life, Bean knows that trouble waits on the horizon. Bean's arch-nemesis, Achilles, somehow escaped from a criminal mental institution during the brief League War. As Battle School children start to disappear and an attempt is made to assassinate Bean and his family, Bean realizes that Achilles must be back in play. In the midst of this crisis, Bean must also contend with effects of genetic tampering that made him a super-genius, but will also cause accelerated growth resulting in an early death.\\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\" gives the reader a chance to delve more deeply in the backgrounds and personas of a number of different characters. Where Bean was the primary focus in \\"Ender's Shadow\\", more time in spent exploring people like Petra Arkanian and Peter Wiggin, to name a few. Author Orson Scott Card shows a keen knowledge of world history as he sets actions in motion that will pit one nation against another in the course of this dramatic struggle to control or restore peace to this world. The action and plot developments are thrilling and, at times, downright shocking. \\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\" plays out in similar fashion to the Season 1 of \\"24\\". While not exploring the real-time aspect of \\"24\\", it still mimics it with the various political battles, plots for revenge, personal betrayals, and heart-pounding action.This novel, along with most of the other novels in the Ender Saga, clearly demonstrate why Card is one of the most gifted science fiction writers there is. As stated in previous reviews of his books, Card's skill lies not in his ability write about ridiculous futuristic technologies, but to focus on the development of the individual characters. He has a gift for dialogue and an innate ability to make the reader empathize with the characters he writes about. Truth be told, \\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\" contains no elements that would make it a science fiction novel. It could be classified as a political thriller or action novel. It's the depth of Card's characters that make the reader not care that there aren't any spectacular space ships or alien species. With the exception of his existential rantings at the end of \\"Xenocide\\" and throughout \\"Children of the Mind\\", Card has created a near-perfect saga. \\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\" is just the latest jewel in that saga."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Shadow of the Hegemon is a different type of story compared to Ender's Shadow or the trilogy that preceded it ... I think it's even a stretch to call it \\"science\\" fiction: more of a future political fiction instead. Think of it as the game of Risk on steroids.That might be an oversimplification, but many times that's what the story feels like: a game. The players are Bean, Achilles, and Peter (and Petra and other Battle School alums to a lesser extent). The book centers around how they use their power (and sometimes, lack of power) in a struggle for world domination. The detail of, say, a Tom Clancy novel is left out, but the human side is more developed than a typical military/historical fiction.Card's afterward is interesting to read as well. I'm glad that he decided to spend more time on Bean's extraction of Petra, although I think Card might've been well served to spend just a little bit more time on it, as the interaction between Achilles and Petra seemed to end right after Petra beats him up. Maybe Achilles was busy negotiating with China. Maybe Card just didn't know where to go from there and shifted his focuses elsewhere. Who knows. I was a little disappointed with how Sister Carlotta exited the story line as well ... not sure if Card's going to go into that more in the next books or if that really was the end there.There are a couple parts in the plot that seemed like Card had an idea but couldn't figure out a plausible way to carry it out. The time when Bean, while shooting the breeze with a Battle School buddy, suddenly thinks that people are trying to kill him and they escape in the nick of time seemed a bit much. A couple of the political moves seemed a little sketchy as well: Russia was intimidated by China's power but Japan wasn't?It seems like I've given the book more criticism than praise, but the few complaints I have did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the book. Bean's developing into quite an interesting character. I was surprised to read in the afterward that there are two books following this one (I had assumed that Card would wrap everything up in just one more book). I felt kind of like Card ran out of gas towards the end of the Ender trilogy ... here's hoping he can continue his success with the Bean series."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I don't need to say that Ender's Game was one of the greatest science fiction books of the century, nor do I need to point out that Ender's Shadow was very impressive as a sequel. Unfortunately for his readers, Orson Scott Card has not been able to pull off a third such masterpiece. Shadow of the Hegemon had potential, but it had several irrtating flaws.First of all, Card uses historical allusions on virtually every page of this novel. Now, Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow had allusions in them, but they were done tastefully. In this book,every other sentence is a military history allusion. Now, I enjoy history myself, but the way Card does it is ridiculous. It gets really boring after awhile. And many of his readers are teenagers, like myself. Most teenagers aren't going to grasp the significance of the Charge of the Light Brigade.Secondly, he will NOT stop rambling about the politics. I realize that politics are an important part of a novel like Shadow of the Hegemon, since the whole story is about children trying to manipulate the world's politics. However, he goes a little overboard. He spends at least half a page talking about the socio-political effects expected to come of Peter moving the Hegemony to brazil. He goes on and on and ON about why Thailand is the most effective country for Bean to seek an office in. He explains in great detail why the Muslim nations wouldn't want to kidnap Petra. He drones endlessly about the spirit of Russian imperialism. That is important to do, but he does it OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. Even the politicians don't ramble about politics as much as this book does. He needs to focus on the story a little more.The story was somewhat interesting. I had often wondered what would happen when the Battle Schoolers were repatriated. The only trouble is that he spends too much time on Petra and Achilles. I can't speak for the rest of the readers, but everyone I've talked to who has read the book wants to see more of Bean and Peter. They are the ones we know from the other books-they are the ones we are reading the book to find out about.Basically, if you are going to buy a book from the Ender series, this isn't the one. It does not even come close to doing justice to its distinguished predecessors. Furthermore, it is too long. The story Card takes the entire book to tell could easily be told in a novella. Unless you are a hard-core fan of the series, I advise you to save your money"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Shadow of the Hegemon does not live up to its predessor works. The book is loosely written and not as tight as Card's other works. You can skip the first 200 pages which is repetitive, predictable and simply not up to his standards. The remainder of the book is fine but it comes to a rapid conclusion with a number of sweeping paragraphs that wrap everything up with little imagination. The book reads more like a play-by-play account of the game RISK, something that the author points out in his epiloge -- it should have been the prologe.The characters are particularly flat and one dimensional -- a real disappointment given the earlier Ender books. Achillies is bent on taking over the world and killing Bean, Bean is bend on killing Achillies and the other characters fall on either side of this fence. Peter Wiggen while present in the book is really dealt with in a superficial way with a minor role.I know that Card returned to the Ender series after a long hiatus and Ender's Shadow is as good as Ender's Game. Unfourtunately this work reads like it was written as part of a multi-book publishing contract -- something he had to do but didn't have enough material for it.It could have been a terrific Novella or short story but it goes thin very fast when streatched into a novel.Overall a poor showing. I almost bought this book in hardcover after reading Enders's Shadow -- a very good book and highly recommended. But I am glad I only invested a few dollars in the paperback edition."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I ADORED Ender's game. But I loved Speaker for the Dead and Xeonocide even more. I read them both in three days, because the ideas and characters were fascinating to me.I read Ender's Shadow eagerly, and loved revisiting Battle School with Bean, who I quickly fell in love with as an intriguing character.And I was beyond excited when ANOTHER book in the Ender series came out. But I have to admit that this book lacks what Card does best: smart, intriguing development of character. Sure, we've got a good guy (Bean the Brilliant Ambitionless Mutant) pitted against a bad guy (Achilles the Psychopathic Power-Hungry Monster), and desperate world circumstances, but this book lacks heart. When Bean's vaction home is blown up, there is no commentary about how it would feel to be separated from your parents with a monster trying to kill you. When his surrogate mother is killed, there are maybe two sentences on his grief. When the awful truth of what he really is comes out, Bean barely notices it.Moments that have been built up to since Ender's Game fall flat. There is little emotional intensity to this book, and finally the detailed &quot;guesses&quot; and leaps of intuition made are confusing and unbelievable. I wish Card had spent a little more time on the relationships between his characters and their growth as people, and a little less time on the uninteresting, fictional world stage.But if you're an Ender fan, I still recommend the book. For me, just reading about the characters I loved originally is enough. But don't buy this book in hardback. And if you can, wait till it's at the library."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"It has been many years since I finished reading the first 3 novels of the Ender Saga. While not without its high points, I was generally disappointed, though not surprised, with Shadow of the Hegemon. On the positive, Shadow has some interesting plot twists and some entertaining action/battle sequences. I agree with other reviewers in that it was nice to meet with Bean, Petra, and Peter again.However, shaping brilliant child minds to effect compelling military strategy as in Ender's Game is a profoundly different story than that of having children bend nations to their will. Card pushed the child prodigy notion well beyond the realm of the plausible.The author's machinations of events and plot were also clear throughout the story. The scheming and plotting of Achilles, Bean, and Peter were simplistic and amateurish. Instead of telling a story, the author is telling us -why- he's telling the story. In the epilogue, you are rewarded with a diatribe on American decline, history as story, and the failings of the Clinton administration as validation of your suspicions about Card's motivations.If you are enamored with stories of child prodigy, or looking to fill in your picture of Ender's universe Shadow of the Hegemon is OK. If you are looking for a powerful depiction of politics and intrigue in the SF genre, check out Frank Herbert's original Dune Chronicles."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Long ago (1977) and far away (I think he may have still lived in Utah) Orson Scott Card managed to jot down one of the most captivating stories ever written. The saga continues.Taken out of context, SHADOW OF THE HEGEMON is not Card's best work. But it does an amazing job filling a nagging gap in Earth's post-Bugger War history. We always knew Peter came to be to Earth, what Ender was to the Galaxy, but we didn't know much more than that. Card weaves a beguiling story that dovetails perfectly with the first five books.I found SHADOW OF THE HEGEMON facinating from the continuing perspective of &quot;gifted youth who are forced into greatness.&quot; In the most powerful fiction, it's difficult to imagine how the human race could have placed its future entirely in the hands of youngsters, but 25 years ago, only Card guessed the prowess of youth against the Game (the video game). Today, I know precious few adults who can whip the average 10 year-old on PlayStation2. If and when war comes to full-scale computer-driven battle, is it such a stretch to think Earth would turn toward youth?And in HEGEMON, only Card could build a plausible sceario which effectively answers how youngsters could be so important to the future of Earth even when the computer-driven Game is not the overarching center piece. Card says it in his end notes &quot;A giant game of Risk.&quot;For years (bordering on 2 centuries) Earth pulled together as one people against the Formics, the Buggers. Political infighting remained civil--words not arms. With the war over the great powers are back to their old games and desires to control Earth.Card, shows as no one else could, how and why children (Battle School graduates)make the differnce. And for his female fans, I think he does a fantastic job developing two very powerful female characters. We can all use more of that.If there was an overarching disappointment, it's that Card supposes human nature won't change, even after Earth was one against an alien race. The seed that spelled doom for the Buggers, is deeply planted in the human psyche. I prefer more uplifting themes. Who needs reality?So, good book? Yes. Great book? No. But Card says there are 2 more to come. Let's consider this a new base from which to launch the next great chapter in this saga."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"How can I break this to you gently... &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; lacks the raw conviction and the powerful equalizer of &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and its parallel novel. It is essentially a sequel to &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot;, detailing the events that happened after Battle School was disbanded, the Formic War won, and the children sent home to rest on their laurels. It isn't even about Peter - he is dealt with in two chapters throughout the book - once when Bean meets him face to face, and at the very end, when he auspiciously rises to the lofty position of Hegemon.What &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; actually deals with is Achilles' struggle for world domination, and Bean's campaign to stop him. Unfortunately, since neither any longer relies on pure wits, but rather falls back on extensive connections and the military prowess of armies, the book simply ends up being a cheap political thriller. Few new characters are introduced, and the recurrent ones hardly have changed since the preceding pair of parallel novels. In addition, for a novel that takes place all over the globe, there is barely any sensation of change. The quality of characterization certainly fell since the previous book - I was at a loss to distinguish the characters one from another; they are all mere conveyances for whatever piece of philosophy Card is trying to put in. Even the resolution is quaint: though Peter assumes his post (no thanks to Bean), the Hegemon hardly has any discretion at all - it will take a sequel to show how Peter changes from a figurehead to a virtual emperor. Even the dastadly villain - Achilles - isn't dealt with with any measure of finality at the novel's end.Without a doubt, this is the worst entry in Ender's long-running saga so far."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Shadow of the Hegemon is the sixth chronologically written book of the Ender's Game Series, the first sequel of Ender's Shadow (book five). Orsen Scott Card is an indisputable literary genius, and to critique his book is to dabble the black arts. Flawless characterization and storytelling is expected, and again, Scott Card weaves and stuns with each keystroke. Therefore, expect this 'review' to be only the most humble quibble and sigh.Shadow of the Hegemon follows the storyline of Bean and the rest of Ender's jeesh after the end of the Formic War. Following the known facts from previous (chronologically written) books, more was expected along the storyline of Peter, whom we know becomes a great political figure as the Hegemon. Instead, the story is almost usurped by Petra Arkanian; 'Hegemon' revolves around Petra's kidnapping and Bean's well-plotted endeavors to rescue her (perfectly setting up the scene for the next book, Shadow puppets).This is because of one of Card's greatest assets: his humility toward his inner circle of wise readers. Hegemon's afterward explains how a wise reader changed the scope of the book by suggesting (in an early manuscript) that the kidnapping plot of Ender's jeesh was too easily resolved. Card responded by extending the conflict of Petra's storyline, therefore changing the account of the entire book which ultimately spilled the expanding story into the next book, Shadow Puppets. Petra carries her part of the story superbly-- a perfect trade off for deviating from what we expected from Hegemon's title.Which brings me to Peter Wiggin, our Hegemon. Although Scott Card has stated that the order of reading the Ender Series matters little, with the exception of Xenocide and Children of the Mind (http://www.hatrack.com/faq/003.shtml), I must make the case for reading 'Hegemon' after Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind. Shadow of the Hegemon illustrates the classic struggle of deciding between the better of two evils, in this case, between Achilles de Flandres and Peter Wiggin. Except, it's an obvious choice. Achilles makes another chilling bow in 'Hegemon' as Bean's arch nemesis with a terrifying performance as the resident sociopath and psychopath, the all around bad-guy. Peter, however, makes a mild case as a contending antagonist. Not only is he unconvincing as the barely-better villain, reading 'Hegemon' before the above mentioned books aggressively dilutes the shocking and genius plot twist in Children of the Mind.Lastly, our hero, Bean. Within a single chapter, we are reminded ten-fold why we love Bean. While the scope of the Formic War in Ender's Shadow may have been arguably riskier, Hegemon deals with War on earth which strikes closer to the reader's heart, and Bean is just as confident and reassuring. Never are we left with the mediocre feeling that Bean is smart for smart's sake; Card grows this character with craft, balancing Bean's brilliance with an equally trying plot reeking of the despicable Achilles. Bean carries this book with his irresistible aplomb while Card continues to branch his Ender's Series with their two distinct story lines and unique tones.Conclusion: Never are we left with the feeling that the author is wringing the last drops from his previous success; Hegemon proves possible that the limits of literary mastery can be shattered, yet again.4 Stars, and only because of the 5 Stars I must reserve for 'Speaker of the Dead'. Because 'Speaker' outranks Amazon's star system."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I absolutely loved Ender's Shadow and have reread it multiple times. I was so fascinated by the life and students of Battle School, that I was actually upset when the book ended right at the end of the war. So, when I realized that there were more books about Bean, I was thrilled, and I could not wait to read about what the Battle School children did with the rest of their lives after the war. Orson Scott Card hit a home run with the book Shadow of the Hegemon. It was so interesting to follow Bean through early post-war life, and to see how he dealt with the repercussions of the war. The reader can really understand the characters and how they think through Card's writing. I always love reading this series because the characters are described so well that, in a way, I start to think of them as real people. The action of escape is so thrilling, and when you add in the suspense, and even some mystery, of kidnapping, it makes for such a great book. Relating to the characters is easy because they are adolescents, even if they are extremely brilliant. I really enjoyed learning a lot more about some of the smaller characters in the previous books such as Peter and Petra. In Shadow of the Hegemon, they are much more important to the story and play bigger roles than before. There were definitely some surprises and just a little too much military history from Card, but overall, this book was very enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"In truth no matter how good this book may be it is not ever going to gain the same level of popularity that Ender's game has. Personally I like where these books go as they give a in depth look at the other children from battle school and what they return home to. If you were a fan of the Ender's Game and want to know about the characters that remain behind after Ender leaves this is a pretty good read. HOWEVER be warned that you will never be able to look at Ender's Game in the same light again."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"If all of your friends were kidnapped, would you try to save them? This is the dilemma that Julian (Bean) Delphiki faces in Shadow of the Hegemon, by Orson Scott Card. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and its prequel, Ender's Shadow. Shadow of the Hegemon takes place in the future following the end of an alien war. The child geniuses who saved the planet have returned to Earth only to be kidnapped by a treacherous villain named Achilles. The only child soldier not captured, Bean, is cunning, but to save his friends he will have to overcome some of the world's most powerful nations. This book held my attention from beginning to end because it had action, humor and suspense. I also loved how the author used third person narration to tell the story from the protagonist's and antagonist's perspectives. This futuristic sci-fi novel is intended for older readers because of some strong language and violence. If you enjoy this book, then you will like Orson Scott Card's other novels in this series: Ender's Shadow, Shadow Puppets and Shadow of the Giant. Shadow of the Hegemon kept me riveted and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"if you've read Ender's Shadow, you've GOT to read this! the outstanding psychology, portrayal of child geniuses, and genuine slang dialogue is enhanced by Card's slightly humorous writing style and it's really a masterpiece. unlike many sequals, Shadow of the Hegemon does not fall short of its prequal. i love that parts are told by Peter and Petra as well as Bean. it's realy an awesome book"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I found only one flaw as I dug through this thoroughly enjoyable new installment in the Ender saga. Because this one flaw involves Bean doing the one thing he has spent half the novel warning other people never to do, it puts his character development on shaky ground. However, SHADOW OF THE HEGEMON nonetheless proves itself a complicated, intelligent new science fiction thriller.In the future world-stage, three great superpowers have arisen with the collapse of the Hegemony: India, Russia, and China. Asia, and Southeast Asia in particular, is quickly becoming a battleground; unlikely alliances are forged, nations fall under great tides of political and militaristic force, and agendas are furthered by webs of intrigue and deception far too complex to be controlled.And, behind it all, is the sociopathical Achilles, who has escaped from the nuthouse and has devised a grand master plan to reunite the world under his rule. He has several Battle School graduates kidnapped, including Petra, who for some reason the author decided would make a good damsel in distress.The only one that can stop him is Bean, who needs to choose sides and fast as world wars ignite. He goes to Peter Wiggin, who hopes to one day restore the Hegemonial Office to its former glory. The Peter of SHADOW OF THE HEGEMON is very different from the Peter of CHILDREN OF THE MIND, and is perhaps the most complicated character of the entire series. Bean gives Peter a plan to become Hegemon while still in his teens, and Peter in turn helps Bean detirmine what it is that the treacherous Achilles is really plotting.Throughout all this, the International Fleet becomes very important. Legally, they can only interfere with Earth events by preventing the use of nuclear weapons, but the Polemarch is confronted with many moral dimellas as the fighting heats up. Peter seems to need the current Polemarch to accomplish his goals as well, but it is unlikely that Locke can bend him to his desires.All in all, SHADOW OF THE HEGEMON is a worthy sequel and quite on par with ENDER'S SHADOW."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Orson scott card has created a spectacular series (ender and bean) out of nothing.

Shadow of the Hegemon is the hair tingling story of Bean and his adventures to save Earth from the plans of his power hungry archenemy Achilles.This book is somewhat unbelievable, because many of the strategies used by characters in it would never work. Of these one is Achilles convincing the Russian, Chinese, and Indian government to forfeit all their power to him when he didn't even spend a month in Battle school, when there were many other children that had graduated.If you look beyond the unbelievable parts of this book it will have you sitting on the edge of your seat and wanting to stay up all night reading it."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This book was fun. The action and characters are good.

The intricate plot may be beyond some people, as there is definitely no lack of characters, but it makes sense if you're actually paying attention. Petra plays a large role in the story, and we, as the readers, get to know her much better. It's nice to finally get into the mind of one of Card's female characters. This is probably one of my favorite books in the Ender Series. (My other favorite being Ender's Shadow.) Some of the events in the story would be unlikely to happen and make the story seem to try too hard, if any other author had written them. As it is, Card makes even the most doubtful events seem quite believeable, especially since we're tensed up for action throughout the entire book. I would definitely suggest that you buy this book instead of borrow it, since you'll want to read it again, and everybody gets a bit miffed when you don't return books, especially books this good."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Shadow of the Hegamon is deffinately one of the weaker books in the Ender series- Xenocide being the other weak one in my opinion. Card delves so deeply into speculative politics that I had to read passages three or four times to understand the character's supersonic train of thought. The development of Petra was enjoyable, as she had been semi ignored in the other books, but the changes in Bean and Achilles I found disturbing. While the book is clearly the work of a geinus-too much so for me- it lacks the something that made Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow so special for me."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I was apprehensive when I heard another Ender book was hitting the shelves, having enjoyed all of the original series as well as Ender's Shadow - I didn't want anything to ruin the previous books. But I needn't have worried.Orson Scott Card has done a remarkable job filling in gaps in his original story line. For those who were curious what was happening on Earth while Ender was settling a new colony in Speaker for the Dead, this book will be very enlightening. Card does an excellent job describing the events that take place following Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. Some of the true strength in the novel is that it plays on the same themes (leadership, morality, spirit and determination) that made Ender's Game such a strong and powerful novel. And the good news is that Card states in the afterward that there's more to come. Until then, enjoy Shadow of the Hegemon."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This book was amazing, I bought it today and finished just a few minutes ago. I loved this book and gained a lot of insight from it about more of the characters of &quot;Enders Jeesh&quot;. In comparison with Cards other books it still is up there, it of course was not as good as Enders Game, but still none the less was an excellent book. I however feel that readers should read Enders Shadow now available in paperback addition before reading Shadow of the Hegemon. Reading Enders Shadow provides much needed information on Bean and other characters that are not explored as greatly in Enders Game. So readers enjoy all your Card readings and I highly recommend making Shadow of the Hegemon one of them."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"The Ender Quartet was great stuff. Ender's Shadow was awesome. But something happened between the last Shadow and this one... whatever it was, Card failed to come through with his normal grandeur.The story itself is somewhat hard to buy, granted we suspend disbelief for fantastical works, but it was still a little much. Kidnapping the kids to force them to command your armies? Even a mediocre commander is going to give you better results than an enemy held at gunpoint. I simply couldn't buy it.The endless amount of Bean being compared to a Christian ideal is exceptionally irritating. Card can only bring it up so many times until you want to scream &quot;Ok, I get the point, not get on with the story!&quot;The whole thing left me with a feeling of dissatisfaction. My advice to you is just to quit with Ender's Shadow and guess as to what else happens... certainly much more fun than wading through this."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Ender's Game is of course the fantastic book that started it all and remains one of my very favorite books. I also thoroughly enjoyed the completely different but still good &quot;speaker for the Dead&quot; which continued the Ender story. Unfortunately, from there, the Ender series spiralled down until I began to just pretend that the later books had never been written. It was with trepedation that I picked up Ender's Shadow, Card's return to the original characters from Ender's Game, but it was excellent and Shadow of the Hegemon is no different. In it we follow Ender's Classmates as they become involved in the conflict on Earth following the Buggers' defeat. Many of the great characters are still there, and it's enjoyable to explore these heroes, while stil seeing the awe and love they hold for their own hero, Ender. I flew through this book and am keeping my fingers crossed for the next in the series."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Orson Scott Card has done it again ladies and gents. From going back into Bean's past (as you would have read in Ender's Shadow) to the heroics of Bean and the other Command School children. This O.S.C. book is based after Ender has left Eros (end of Ender's Game) where Bean and the other Command School children are being kidnapped by different countries to prepare themselves for an overlearing war that may be ahead for them. Bean proves once again to be even more clever than the great Ender Wiggin himself. Bean seems to be able to overcome ANYTHING ,as long as it is for his survival. The plot is overwhelming and I couldn't drop the book down for a second. It is as great as Ender's Shadow was when it was published. Achilles returns once again for you &quot;evil minded people&quot;. &quot;Shadow of the Hedgemon&quot; has shown that even a brilliant child can create chaos. Go ahead and grab this book if you're a vivid Ender fan. It is a must have."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"What was Card's intention in writting this book? To make money, I suppose. But while this is most writers intentions, you can tell Card's desperation in this book. He should have stoped writting about the Achiles character in Ender's Shadow, but he does so again in this book, with guarentee that he'll be in the sequal to this. The Bean character was strong enough to hold &quot;Enders shadow&quot; together, but he came across as an unhuman like character. In some respects the book is satisfying, but not enough for me to recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Be prepared when buying this book, it is not the usual space-opera of the 4 Ender books and Ender's Shadow. I don't even know if you could classify it as science fiction. It's more like...futuristic Tom Clancy.After the Buggers have been destroyed, war is breaking on Earth and the gifted students from Battle School are being kidnapped to be used by different governments. The entire book is politics and military based but what wins me over is how educated Card is on this subject. One cannot deny that he knows a lot about historical leaders and military tactics, but this is good and bad. It makes for a convincing read but Card overuses the comparisons to historical figures like Stalin and Napoleon. My thought is that Card was trying to explore the reasons behind the actions of dictators and heroes and this is further confirmed in the Afterword. This works in some places and doesn't in others.The only other thing that bothered me was the Achilles showdown at the end. I'm not sure if Bean's decisions in that battle were great character development or a contrived part to guarantee the next 2 books. Of course the story has to go on because conflicts have not been settled, but few people would've had the integrity of Bean and Petra to let him off as easily. But I guess the point is that they aren't like most people."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy Card's writing, especially his, uh, \\"Enderverse\\". I loved Ender's Game, I absolutely adored Speaker for the Dead, I'm reading Xenocide and I love what I've read, and I liked Ender's Shadow.I don't like Shadow of the Hegemon though.It's nothing but boring, long and tedious talk about...politics. Also, Card doesn't seem to understand how much the world would have changed in 200 years. I don't know, I seem to like Card better when he's writing about philosophy, not politics."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Shadow of the Hegemon picks up directly after the events of Ender's Shadow and Ender's Game. The Formics have been vanquished, but the nations of Earth have been thrust into political turmoil. As powerful countries grapple for dominance, the brilliant strategic minds of the Battle School children are priceless to world leaders. Bean, Petra, and the rest of Ender's team are torn between personal ties, national allegiances, and enemies that want them killed. Achilles--the psychopathic killer from the first novels--is also out to seize power for himself, using his political clout as a Battle School student to insert himself in the inner circles of global leaders. As the story unfolds, the reader is caught up in a grand saga of international intrigue, personal passions and friendships, and Bean's own search for truth.Granted, your suspension of disbelief may be sorely tried in some sections (a 14 year old negotiating a non-aggression pact between India and Pakistan, for instance), but most of the action is believable and real. Some of the characters--Petra and Bean specifically--come across as rather bratty and arrogant early on, but it soon becomes evident that the book is about their own maturing and coming-of-age as much as it is about international warfare and politics.By the end of the novel, you will have fallen in love with the characters from Ender's Shadow all over again. Bean's search for his own humanity and religious struggling are heartfelt and true. Achilles' twisted machinations are as frighteningly real as ever. And the friendship, love, and compassion that binds Bean and his 'crew' together, through thick and thin, resonates long after the reader has closed the book.Some say the book lacks the action and originality of Ender's Shadow and Ender's Game. This may be true; it is more stereotypical sci-fi/historical fiction than its predecessors. But the core of the story is gold. The writing is impeccable, the characters are truly brilliant, and the experience is unforgettable."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Was closer to the Enders Game, Enders Shadow style of books made it a very fun read, again dealing with the children. If your familiar with the Enders series, this story is about \\" Bean's\\" battle keeping piece and trying to save the battle school children."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Book two of Orson Scott Card's Shadow saga. The fragile global alliance forged whilst mankind fought against the Buggers is beginning to disintegrate and in the wars to come between various nations and groups of nations seeking hegemony in the world the military genius children trained in Battle School will be the greatest resource that any nation can have. Against this backdrop the megalomaniac Achilles (the villain of the piece and Bean's nemesis) kidnaps most of Ender's \`jeesh' - the group of Battle School graduates that supported Ender in the final battles against the Buggers in Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow - and has them taken to Russia to aid in Russia's bid to become the superpower of the world. But Achilles doesn't attempt to capture Bean but instead tries to kill him and his family to get vengeance on Bean for what Bean did to him in Battle School and before that on the streets of Rotterdam when Bean and Achilles were homeless orphans (see \`Ender's Shadow'). He fails to kill Bean because when Bean and his family hear that members of the jeesh are being targeted, they get away (they are on holiday at the time) and escape from their holiday villa before it is blown up by a missile attack. The Greek military then come to the aid of Bean and his family and they go into hiding. But soon their new location is discovered by Achilles. Graff - the former head of Battle School and now Minister of Colonization - and Sister Carlotta - the Catholic nun who recruited Bean for Battle School in Ender's Shadow and who became Bean's mentor - get them out of their confinement and the family is split up: Bean and Sister Carlotta go one way and the rest of Bean's family go another way, so that neither group can ever be found. But Bean and Carlotta are now on the run.Whilst on the run, by utilizing new ally Locke - Peter Wiggin, Ender's older brother and the world's most influential demagogue - Bean has all but one of the captured jeesh released by revealing to the world that Achilles is a murderous psychopath. The only member of the jeesh that is not released is Petra, who Achilles has decided is the best of Ender's jeesh and so wants to hold onto. When the rest of the jeesh is released, Achilles sees to it that he recaptures Petra by killing the people setting her free. He then takes her to India, where along with some Indian Battle School graduates she will find herself caught up in events that will lead to war and the creation of a new world power via one man's treachery. Meanwhile Achilles is now aware of Locke so Peter Wiggin and Achilles are destined to become future rivals. As for Bean, he means to rescue his friend Petra from the clutches of Achilles, and so following Peter's advice allies himself with Thailand - the natural resistance to Achilles and India as the historic leader of southeast Asia - so that he can get himself an army to train, join in the fight against Achilles' aggression and rescue his friend Petra. But can he rescue Petra without getting himself and Petra killed? And can anyone fathom what Achilles is really up to?Comments: this book was mainly about international war and politics set in the near future. Although Orson Scott Card is a science fiction writer there was not much science fiction in the book (indeed the writer himself describes the book as \`historical fiction'). The book starts off a bit slowly but this doesn't last and it soon becomes very engrossing, with its intrigues about politics, military operations, military tactics and world affairs. All the main characters - Bean, Sister Carlotta, Petra, Peter Wiggin, Suriyawong and Achilles - are very interesting and hold your attention. At one other point in the book it becomes a little dull but, again, this doesn't last and we are soon once again back to the action. Any fans of Ender's Game and / or Ender's Shadow will enjoy these new tales of Orson Scott Card's Battle School graduates. Above all I enjoyed seeing Bean's brilliance and what a master military commander he really was. I read this book very quickly. Recommended."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"The messages at the beginning of each chapter look beautifully terminal/usenet styled. The text of the is also nicely formatted, without any issues. Paragraphs are all correctly indented without line breaks between each other, and I saw no OCR mistakes or the like.As for the book itself, it's Orson Scott Card. I think that speaks for itself."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"In chronological order, this is the third book in the Ender series (if you put Ender's Game, Ender's Shadow, and A War of Gifts all in the first slot, since they all take place at around the same time period at the beginning of the events in the books. Ender in Exile would be Book #2.)I didn't like it quite as much as Ender's Game, Ender's Shadow, or Speaker For the Dead, but I did like it very much. The reason I didn't like it as much was that this book is focused less on psychology (although there is still some of that) and culture; and more on political maneuvering and military actions. But like all of the books in the series, it is still highly intricate, intelligent, and subtle.In Shadow of the Hegemon, the main action centers around Bean, Petra, Achilles, and Sister Carlotta. Peter Wiggins is also important, although usually as a writer of emails and articles rather than as an actual presence. The war against the Formics is over, and Ender has been exiled to space for his own protection, so he is absent from this novel. Now that they are no longer united against the alien species, the countries of the Earth are in a struggle for domination, with Peter and Achilles competing for individual domination.As always in this series, the book's depth is its greatest strength: the extensive development of the characters (continued from the previous books) and the explorations of philosophy and spirituality (but never preachy or dogmatic.)Having just read Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell, I noticed that in this series, there is an implicit assumption that it is the sheer genius of the kids (their super-high IQ's) that allow them to be so successful and powerful. According to Gladwell, this would not happen in real life, especially in the case of Bean and Achilles, who did not come from backgrounds that support success. And in fact, the author does have Bean ponder that it was the permanent repercussions of having to fight just to survive in his early life, that caused Bean (who had the highest IQ) to take second place to Ender as the leader in the Formic War. Just an interesting aside . . .(365 pages)"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This novel continues the story of Petra and Bean as they attempt to make sense of and influence the direction that the world would be taking in the aftermath of the formic wars. This novel is more a story of political intrigue and struggle than the adventure story of either ender's game or ender's shadow.An entertaining read."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I love the Ender series and have been sharing them with my 12-yr-old son via audiobooks. This format makes the stories readily accessible to weak readers. However, the mispronunciation of a major character's name when the text explicitly and repeatedly clarifies how the name SHOULD be pronounced is frustrating and distracting. I would still recommend any of the Ender/Shadow series to anyone. OSC is one of my top 5 favorite authors!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This story follows Bean and Peter Wiggin after all of the battle school graduates come home to earth and find that world war is about to break out. Old rivalries reignite between nations and things get really twisted when the dark nemesis Achilles is found working for any ambitious country willing to hire him for his genius battle strategies for world domination. Achilles is so evil that one of the main characters says, \\"The Chinese no doubt think they are using him, but I know Achilles, and my guess is that within a year, the Chinese leaders will find themselves dead or taking orders from him.\\" Bean and Peter team up to try and bring world peace to the warring nations, while at the same time avoid assassination.This book is definitely science fiction and occasionally hard to swallow since most of the characters are younger than 15 years old. The battle school kids are too smart, and are so perceptive of other characters that they almost appear to read minds. It is a little unbelievable and could certainly be a weakness. Another weakness of this book is the fact that you never see or hear what the parents are doing. The story follows the battle school graduates closely, and when the children are reunited with their parents, the parents were not taken into confidence. The kids are adults in children bodies. If you can get over the fact that these kids are calling all the shots, then it is a great story.Orson Scott Card does a great job showing the battle strategies through the eyes of children. He also does a good job of character development and throws in tons of inner turmoil. It is a pretty easy read and I didn't find the plot too hard to follow even though it moves quickly. It has a lot of military action and draws you in with subtle comic relief from the characters. At some points it has mystery and you find yourself trying to figure out the \\"who-done-it\\" along with the characters.This book follows some of the characters you already know from Enders Game and Enders Shadow. It is best read after Enders Shadow since it picks up right where Enders Shadow leaves off, but you could read it after either one. I recommend this because this book throws you at the characters and the plot right away. This is a great series that I propose to those who enjoy a fun action story."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This sequel to Ender's Shadow was a lot of fun. It serves better at any rate as a sequel to Shadow than it does as a sequel to Ender's Game. Orson Scott Card does a great job in developing Bean further and he's very consistent with previous development. The novel is, of course, centered on Bean as he exploits his training and background from the International Fleet battle school as war breaks out on Earth.Peter Wiggin, on the other hand, feels like a different person from the one described in Ender's Game. I think Card missed the greater opportunity here. The main character of the novel is already well-developed and we get to see him act in a dramatically different and exciting setting. Peter, on the other hand, is more thinly sketched. I wish he had been more fully and consistently developed. When he speaks or acts, it seems incredibly weak compared to his previous performance. His accomplishments are amazing, as we would expect from the character's prior setup, but he always accomplishes them offstage. It is simply stated that he has moved world governments in the background. I would have liked to see more of Peter, and particularly more of the Peter I know and fear. :-)In addition to Bean, Achilles is also wonderfully developed. By contrast to Peter, he is developing into such a larger than life character that it stretches plausibility. That's easy to forgive though -- our heroes need a villain to fight. I can't wait for the next installment to watch the battle continue."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This is the continuation of a series... if you have not read the previous books leading up to this one you will find yourself completely lost. This is the story of Bean from what is left off in Ender's Shadow. The book tells the story of Peter Wiggin and Bean as they struggle against Achilles for the ultimate goal of world peace. Anything else that I could say would be a spoof. If you like the books previous in the series, you will like this one."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I was a huge fan of Enders Game and Enders Shadow, however, Shadow Of The Hegemon disappointed me. There was almost no action in it. The whole book was just political conversations, so political, that they were hard to follow. What little bit that I was able to follow, was uninteresting. If you were a fan of the rest of the Ender series, I recomend that you at least try this book. That is why I gave it two stars instead of one. You may get something out of this book that I did not. But before you dive into this tale be warned. It is extremely political and almost entirely comprised of long conversation. But at least attempt to read it like I did."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I am sure that I am not the only one that suspects that Card wrote Ender's Shadow to take one final squeeze out of the cash cow that is Ender's Game. How fitting the book is called Ender's Shadow, because it IS the same story, the same characters, only paler in comparison. Bean is an interesting character and perhaps Card should have expounded more on the other battle school kids earlier, but to retrofit the story this way is just plain unnecessary. It lacks the newness, uniqueness, and ultimately - the surprise ending of the original. Most of the book is rehashing the same events of EG, but with a seething, gnashing jealous, yet superior, Bean in the background. With the help of Sister Carlotta, he does redeem himself from being a soulless, arrogant Napoleonic runt, though not by much. What is next? We will find out that it was Petra - the real uber supremo genius, not Bean, not Ender - who won the war?What is new: modern technology that justifies Bean's abnormal genius traits. There is one particular scene that some may find ludicrous involving Bean's miraculous feats of survival whilst in diapers. This first book is insubstantial, but I do recommended giving it a run anyway, as the rest of the series takes an arc that a lot of Ender fans were yearning for - the first couple of years post Battle School. The tale takes on mythic proportions as the young prodigies assume leadership of various nations and battle for control of Earth - against an arch nemesis named, quite suitably, &quot;Achilles&quot;. It is less sci-fi and more speculative political drama with a dose of Card's singular use of child heroes."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"A Review by KyleAfter the Formic War is over, Bean, Petra and the other battle school graduates return home. After 10 years of battle school they all plan to return to a normal life. Achilles, a student who was expelled from battle school and sent to a mental hospital, does not have the same plan for them. He has them all kidnapped except for Bean, whom he attempts to kill. Bean escapes and decides to do all he can to rescue Petra.Shadow of the Hegemon is another book written extraordinarily well by Orson Scott Card. The story keeps you guessing each character's next move. Orson Scott Card switches characters almost flawlessly. The author keeps the book realistic yet still amazingly interesting, integrating history with the future making the arguments and discussions easier to understand. The conflicts that the characters endure are perfect for the story. The author keeps the descriptions short but still full of the detail needed for the book. The action that Orson Scott Card incorporates into the story is exciting but not too long. The characters that the author puts in this book are all very realistic, everyday people. I would not be surprised to meet one of them on the street.Shadow of the Hegemon is a great science fiction book. I would recommend it to anyone who had read and liked Ender's Game, Ender's Shadow, or any other books by Orson Scott Card. Even if you haven't read any of those books you might still enjoy Shadow of the Hegemon."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"The book \\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\" is a novel riddled with conspiracy and paranoia that keeps you wondering who's side anyone is really on, or when a new foe will appear.

A very good read, and I highly recommend it to any avid science fiction reader."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"After Bean, Petra, and the other Battle School children are returned home following the conclusion of the Formic War, they become pawns in the struggle for supremacy between nations. The evil genius Achilles, Bean's old enemy, kidnaps Petra and others in order to further his own plans for world domination; Bean must join forces with Ender's brother Peter to thwart him. Thus begins a novel of political intrigue and manuevering that at times reads too much like the narration for a game of Risk. Author Orson Scott Card has fashioned a good story, but dilutes its effectiveness with too much conversation and polemic. He passes up most opportunities to inject some action into the events. Characters die and nations go to war, but for the most part Card tells us these things through the dialogue of characters who are not present rather than putting us right there at the scene and showing us. A good story, but a step down from the previous book in this series, \\"Ender's Shadow.\\""},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This time the battlefield is set firmly on terra firma, Earth!

Ender's brother, Peter Wiggin, was their only hope.Peter may only have been a teen, but his intelligence at politics and pulling strings were as great as any of the Battle School Grads were at commanding!

But my vanity makes me like Petra the most...But more than that, I enjoyed watching her (as a 14 year old) using logic against grown men who trained in psychiatry. Petra has a way of seeing things more clearly than most. Here is a story that will hit the best seller lists almost immediately! It is not only excellent, it is awesome!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Shadow of the Hegemon is the sequel to Ender's Shadow and takes place a year after the events described in Ender's Game / Ender's Shadow . Like in Ender's Shadow the protagonist is Bean, formerly a member of the Battle School and a hero of the Formic War under the leadership of Ender Wiggin.The elite children of the world are sent to the Battle School to combat the threat of the Buggers. With that threat met and the war ended, the school was disbanded and the children sent home. Now, nine of the children are kidnapped and an attempt was made on Bean's life. Bean has to go into hiding. He believes and old rival is behind all of this. The Battle School children are valuable as military strategists and the stability of the world is beginning to evaporate.With the publication of Ender's Game so many years ago, Orson Scott Card has created a possible future for our planet that is stunning in the intensity of what is done to children to ensure survival. The original Quartet followed Ender Wiggin. The new series (the Shadow series) is following Bean, the smallest and smartest of them all. Bean has always been in the shadows, though. In the shadow of Ender Wiggin, and in the shadow of Ender's brother, Peter, who will become ruler (Hegemon) of the world (we learn of this in Card's second novel Speaker for the Dead , published in the mid 80's). While some events may be implausible, they are believable within the confines of Card's created world. This novel can stand alone and works well on its own, but is much more enjoyable as part of the larger series."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Shadow of the Hegemon, the sixth book in Orson Scott Card's Ender series, is a &quot;must read&quot; for fans of these books.In my opinion, this book, the second dealing with Bean instead of Ender, is the best of the series. It is not as philosophical as previous books, with more action and a view of world events and politics that makes you wonder if it could actually happen. The fast-paced action of this novel moves the story forward at a frantic pace, but give you time to appreciate the complex nature of each of the characters as they develope.Because this book builds heavily on previous novels in the series, I definitely recommend that you read Ender's Game (Book #1 in the series) and Ender's Shadow (Book #5 in the series) at a minimum in order to appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"... If I'd listened to ...[the negative feedback], I would have missed out on an outstanding read. Card had a tall order in SotH and he pulls it off well.

I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Orson Scott Card has turned out another masterpiece in the Ender series. This book is unlike any of others.

In fact, the whole series holds a special place in my heart. Imagine my delight when I discovered Card's new line of Ender books was coming out. Faithfully I await(ed) eac new installment.Shadow of the Hegemon was the second such installment, after Ender's Shadow, and what a great installment it is, though it lacks the incredible appeal of Game and Shadow. Bean and his friends face up against the ruthless boy genius general Achilles again, but the plot - and the characters - jump around a lot. I found myself having trouble keeping track of Achilles' movements, and I was in his head.Besides that, I'm not a very politically-minded person, and politics abound in Shadow of the Hegemon. What makes it even more confusing is that it's an undulating sense of politics, besides which it is entirely fictional, being set in the future.So, confusing yet very satisfying, and capturing some of the music of the past books. If you're an Ender fan or a Card fan, it's a great read. If not, it's still good, but it will lack the extraordinary appeal of Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. I'd stick with those first.(3.5/5)"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This book is filled with suspense from start to finish.

It covers what happens on earth after the events of Ender's Game/Ender's Shadow.

Not the most developed book in terms of character development and so on, but fun and hard to put down."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Attention all science friction readers: All praise to Orson Scott Card for his maginificent creation, \\"The Shadow of the Hegemon.\\" This sequel picks up the action following The League War at the end of \\"Ender's Shadow.\\" The brilliant young children of the International Fleet have been returned to their families on Earth. As countries become restless after an uneasy peace, the brightest children are being pressed into military service for their home countries. Other countries, under the influence of one physcopathic child, Achilles, choose to make a grab for the best of the best, Ender's former \\"jeesh.\\" The action continues as war opens on Earth again, and a new power under the leadership of the evil Achilles rises. The action follows Bean, who has been altered genetically to be impossibly genius, in his attempt to save the world from destruction under Achilles any way he can. Card's fast-paced style will keep readers turning the page to see if Bean will survive his next encounter and stop his arch-nemesis. The author's voice pulls the reader into the twisting, ever-chagning plot. Card's amazing attention to detail and imagery paint the scenes perfectly for the reader. This book deserves the five-star rating in most respects. A few distracting points include slower spots in the story. The book is almost too long. For example, one chapter focuses completely on Bean when he is left alone by the Thai military. Bean is isolated from the world essentially, and Card doesn't alleviate the problem by keeping the action going. The chapter consists of Bean sitting in his room waiting for someone to call on him. On the positive side, besides these minor points, Card delivers once again. Readers of any of the Ender Series or Card's other books must read this novel! They will not be disappointed in the least."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"OSC is capable of much more depth than Shadow of the Hegemon has. It is a watery story with little character development and the pace of a poorly played chess game. Granted, it is difficult to write characters who are supposed to be smarter than the author, but OSC did it with Ender's Game.....OSC admittedly wrote Shadow while concurrently writing a different story. It shows."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I enjoyed the exploration of Petra's character in this book. Many of the other characters had been ignored from the original Ender's Game, partly because he was so isolated from the rest of the battle school. Shadow of the Hegemon has a much wider scope than the previous book, dealing with the politic of the countries that Ender has left behind. We learn the events that lead to Peter being Hegemon.Card's handling of politics between countries makes the book engaging, as it revolves around a kidnaping of Petra by Achilles and Bean efforts to save her. We even get to see what Battle school graduates are doing after Battle school. They are at the heart of military strategies in the book, sometimes to the chagrin of adults. It you truly believe in the child geniuses being brilliant strategizers then the books work. People who have read Ender's Game and accepted a six year old killing another bully of a six year old seem surprised with the maturity of battle school graduates. The whole point was to make them grow up faster and draw out strategies for war. It stands to reason that they could plan wars on planets or space since their training would have started with the history of wars on Earth and then branched out into space.Bean is more human in this book. He shows more emotion for people and he interacts more with his environment. Peter's role in this book was surprisingly small, but he is sure sure to play a larger role in the future books.It is well worth the read. It continues in the Ender tradition, but it 100% new events as opposed to Ender's Shadow."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This is the second of four books in the Bean series, the parralel novels to the Ender series.While the Bean books do not carry the heavy moral explorations of the later Ender series, they serve to flesh out many of the plot points only alluded to in the Ender series. I would also contend, that except for Ender's Game, the Bean series is the more entertaining and plot driven series.Card's study of world history shows through in his development of the military conflicts that plague Earth after the defeat of the buggers. He plays one nation against another very effectively.The reader is also given a glimpses at Ender's early family life. We meet his parents and see how the family interacts with Peter and Valentine.Finally, I'd like to say that I find the character of Bean much more interesting than Ender. While both are fantastic characters, Bean's background and his mark for death make the reader feel sympathy for Bean that we never feel for Ender. I simply feel more empathy for Bean, understand his motivations better, and just plain ole like him better. I can't wait for the final two books!-HawkeyeGK"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I must admit, I had no idea this book was about Bean until I picked it up and saw that it resembled 'Ender's Shadow'. I like how Orson Scott Card took the original 'Ender's Game' and split what happens after that into two seperate series, one for Ender as the Speaker for the Dead, and one for Bean on earth.Although I like action stories (and movies) opposed to psychological, the Ender (and Bean) series is so great becuase of the required thinking to make it through any of the books. It dissapointed me however, when within the first ten pages of the story, Bean and Nikolai were running away from missiles. I thought it was very cheezy when the Delphiki family just came up with the solution to the missing children sitting around the breakfast table in less than five minutes. This didn't require the reader to think about what or who might really be behind it.Although it wasn't as long, and the reader didn't have to be involved or using their brain much... It still had all the elements of the first two. Card has created a world of the future, complete with it's own political system. But at the end of 'Ender's Shadow' everyone was wondering, 'What happens to Bean?'. The other books were awesome... 'Shadow of the Hegemon just put the icing on the cake.&quot;"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"When he's at the top of his game (Pastwatch, Speaker for the Dead, etc.), Orson Scott Card is one of the most interesting authors in Science Fiction. Card's better works rise somehow from his anchors in science fiction nerdiness and in religion, and combine subtle moral dilemmas with old-fashioned action SF.The Shadow . . . series seems to fall in the second tier. The books share some of Card's best elements, but have a fair share of his less admirable tropes, including endless conversations about morality and characters with the weird need to remind the other characters and the readers of just how superhumanly cool they are.Shadow of the Hegemon follows Bean, Ender Wiggins' youngest officer, after his return to Earth, together with the stories of Petra Arkanian, another of Ender's child soldiers, and Peter, Ender's brother and the future leader of the world. Bean, Petra and Peter attempt to manuever as the world collapses into chaos, and all of them spend a fair amount of time thinking and talking about how to live an ethical life in difficult circumstances.I will confess that Bean has never worked for me as a character. In Ender's Game, he is presented as an unusually smart kid who relates to Ender somewhat as Ender originally did to the older students, and lets Ender explore whether he wants to be cruel to those weaker than him, kind to them, or find some third way to act. In the Shadow books, Bean has been retconned to be the smartest person in history, with all kinds of tragic backstory, and somehow I can't get interested. I would love to read a book about Peter, or Petra, or Surly, or really anyone else, but Bean ends up as the least interesting, and least believable, character in the books."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Orson goofed with this one. It is probably hard to keep track of all those characters, but in the second printing the mistakes will be printed correctly. Here's the deal - Bean the primary protagonist is now on Earth. Every other soldier from the final battle waged in &quot;Ender's Game&quot; has been kidnapped. The premise for these kidnappings was predictable from &quot;Game&quot;, but in the actual writing, it came across poorly. But here is where it really fails, Young Bean, in an effort to contact Peter, goes to the Wiggin Home in Greensboro of the future. He has a dialog with Mrs. Wiggin and we see them discussing where Ender used to live. If you read the first edition you'll see the error. Luckily the corrected scene is located on Card's Website hatrack.com . Otherwise you too would be confused too. That was a fogiveable error. After all Card is human. But the unforgivable part is that the characters are not as clever or imaginative as they should be. Card can do much better. They are genius kids who think like grown-ups. Mr. Card has forgotten that kids suffer from biology - even if they are geniuses. The kids all behave like adults. Orson forgets that these kids are apt to behave like kids at least once in a while. He wrote about short people who have been programmed to behave like adults and never fail to do so. In the first book, at least they acted like kids once in a while. This book could have been better thought out. If you want to stay abreast of these characters, read the book. But wait till the corrections are made in the second printing."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I just got done with SotH and it is great. I would consider it just a little under EG. The plot, charecters and everything else about it is great. If you like sci-fi, buy this book."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This book continues Card's great storytelling, dealing with many of the untouched aspects of the original story. It's great to see how Card works the problems of post-bugger Earth."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I have read through other 2 books in the Ender's series including Ender's Game and the Speaker for the Dead. Though it's really a pity that I didn't cover Ender's Shadow,I am still quite like this book,because Card's plot is just unresistable. You can never predict what is going on next. Also I like Card's feature of beginning every chapter with a small passage (emails, most times), they give you small hints or brief accounts of what is happening. It IS really a perfect book if there is not that thing. And that's why I didn't give it a full mark. As a Chinese, I cannot accept the fact that Achilles ended up going to China and that China appears in the book as an evil country. I think Russian peaple will get the same feeling when they saw Mother Russia be described as a country which would destroy the peace of the world for its own privilege. I believe China would never do such evil things."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"My book, Shadow of the Hegemon, by Orson Scott Card has a billion realistic thoughts and involves geniuses and their ideas. The book has basically three geniuses, one is trying to rule the world, another is trying to kill everyone especially on kid who put him in jail, and another who is a clone and is trying to escape the killer. My book has some action and a lot of twist, you think someone will do one thing and they do another or the actions of something go completely different then you thought.This book is a sequel to a science-fiction book called Enders shadow. The books basically follow the main character, Bean, who is a clone and grows slowly every second. Right now he is very small for his age but when he is 25 years old he will be a giant! This book has little science-fiction thoughts and is mostly about escape and conquering.I really liked this book because I love to have surprises around every corner. I don&#65533;t like it to be very obvious what is going to happen and I like to see what they can thin of with there &#65533;genius minds&#65533;. I liked the continuing story line of the first book, that made it more interesting for me.I believe that anyone who likes twist and mysteries and loves to think of what will happen next with the clues given will fall in love with this book. It always has you thinking and usually what happens is not what you expect. I think that people at most reading levels will love this book and enjoy reading it. This book was very enjoyable to me with the twist and the mystery and the genius minds and I would recommend it to most readers who love that kind of stuff and have read the first one &#65533;Ender&#65533;s Shadow&#65533;."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Not bad. I didn't read for 5 years (due to college junks). And I read Ender's Game cause my friend got it for my bday. Guess what? I read all 4 in the series, and read the two of the shadow series too. Pretty great stuff.I like how Bean becomes more and more like a human. He's too smart and that makes him sound like a robot or something. But his character builds up and it's fun to see that.I'm glad there are two more books to the series. Can't wait. :)"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This book is a great, great read. It's quite different from &quot;Ender's Shadow,&quot; much in the same way &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; was different from &quot;Ender's Game&quot; (Orson Scott Card says as much in his afterword.) About 30 pages into the book I could already tell it was yet another example of Card's fine philosophical storytelling.My only disappointment in this book was finding out that there are to be two more of them -- I read the original Ender Quartet after they were already all available in paperback and was able to read them one after another. Now I have to wait!As for the supposed continuity error pointed out by aeirould regarding Valentine's identity as Demosthenes -- Valentine and Ender traveled through space at near-light velocities, thus they arrived at their destination many years after everyone else they had ever known was dead. No one suspected that Valentine Wiggin was still alive -- and continuing to write under the pseudonym of Demosthenes. As I recall from the later Ender books, others had picked up the pseudonyms &quot;Locke&quot; and &quot;Demosthenes&quot; long after Peter the Hegemon was dead. So it's not really a continuity error -- just continuity!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Orson Scott Card is quickly, writing himself into becoming one of the great sci-fi masters. He agian proves that he can write a book that combines action, with in this case political ideas in a way that only a few others have managed to do. Of the authors that I have read most of thier works, only Niven rivals his storytelling, and Only Asmov rivals his scope of ideas.These novels about bean are more than just another attempt to make money of of the success of Enders game. Card contiues to delovop new ideas in politics and theology. This is what real sci-fi is all about. While the ideas in this book are not quite as well integrated than some of his other books, it still succeded within its scope."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Card got a little tedious in the middle books of the series that started with Ender's Game, but things picked up with Ender's Shadow, and the later books that detail the lives of Bean, Peter, and crew. Maybe Ender had just run his course.This one's still a heavy read, and probably best suited for fans of the serious who have read all the previous books. If you're one of them, you'll enjoy this greatly. If not, prepare to puzzle over some of the backstory that never quite becomes clear.I liked it, anyway."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"As the title of this review indicates, this novel lacked nothing. Truly a worthy piece of the continuing Ender and Bean Saga. Card seems to have pulled away from the internal struggle of right and wrong that Ender so valiantly faced and has now clearly drawn the line between good and bad. Bean vs. Achilles. I waited patiently for this novel to be released and it did not let me down. I can only say that with at least two more books coming in the continuation of the story....I hope Card never lets these characters disappear."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"this book is good, but ender's shadow was better. ender's game was the best. i reccomed reading those three, and then swearing off of the rest of the ender's game novels..."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Orson Scott Card says in the afterword to &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; that this book is as different from &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; as &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; was from &quot;Ender's Game&quot;. He's right. Where &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; turned and looked at the universe 3000 years hence and examined, in great detail, religion and life, &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; turns and looks at political interplay and fear in this world 150 years from now.What made &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; stand out for me was the political aspect of the novel. Orson Scott Card has done a better job of painting national politics and intrigue across a worldwide scale better than any science fiction or fantasy writer I've seen since George R.R. Martin's &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;. The scope that he uses is very impressive as he takes the political action of the novel across most of the Asian continent and shows situations that are, on the whole, relatively plausible.Card's work in blending national policy with personal motivation is very impressive. However, there are a few small areas I quibble with. I think that the world community he paints one hundred and fifty years hence is a little tainted by personal bitterness, both to the US and China. Whether he meant it to or not, it does, to me, detract a bit from both the plausibilty of the book and the overall quality of the writing. Likewise, while I am not a student of South and Southeast Asia, I question his wisdom in using just once source apiece - as he states in the afterword - when creating his India and Thailand circa 2150. This fact appears rather obvious when reading characters' discussions of these two countries. Card trys very hard to make the countries he creates plausible extrapolations of today's countries, and they suffer for these two reasons.Nonetheless, the novel is still a wonderful read. Card takes a couple of classic premises for novels and blends them into a story that, if it occaisonally lacks for original plot twists, one that shows how well he grasps both individual struggle and national interplay.On the individual side of the novel, Bean, Peter and Petra all take on additional depth in this novel and all three become characters that I am eager to read more about in the remaining two novels in Card's &quot;Shadow&quot; series. As adolescents and teenagers, they are as believable as they were as children in &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot;. As people, they develop more depth to their character - especially Peter - and move in directions that are, if predictable, certainly arrived at unpredictably.In retrospect, what definitely stands out for me in this book, are the political machinations. I'm sure that will be what primarily stands out one, five, or ten years from now. Anyone with an interest in political struggle should read this book, as well as any Orson Scott Card fan who wants to see him successfully tackle new areas of writing. While I do have minor reservations about the world as he creates it, I have none about the way his characters move it and move through it."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"How do I review this book? Do I review it on the basis of the craftmanship of the storytelling? In that case, five stars without question. Do I review it on the basis of the fact that I stayed up five hours past my normal bedtime to finish it because I was so involved in the story? Again, five stars without question. You'll notice, though, that I gave it four stars. Without giving too much away, here is why:1) In reading the scene with Bean and Ender's mother, there was a point at which I no longer heard Ender's mother, but heard Orson Scott Card. Normally, he does not do this... I think that his passion for that particular belief was so strong that it overwhelmed the character. I may be wrong, of course, but that is how I percieved it.2) As another reviewer has mentioned, the plot relies heavily on the notion that a nation would follow Achilles in a situation where it is highly unbelievable that that nation would do so.3) There is a major continuity flaw in the book with the other ones. When Peter reveals to the world that he was Locke and Valentine was Demosthenes, it breaks the confidentiality that Demosthenes appears to enjoy in the Speaker for the Dead trilogy. That could be explained by Jane cleaning up the references as she does later, but unless I misremember there is a point where Ender and Valentine are travelling, Valentine is writing as the &quot;unknown&quot; Demosthenes, and Jane had not yet been introduced.If you have read and enjoyed the earlier books, of course you should read this one regardless of the minor flaws. If you haven't read Ender's Game, though, do not read this one yet. Go, now, and buy that book. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"When I picked this book up, frankly, I was worried. Several months ago, I read Ender's Game, and loved it. Not long after that, I devoured Ender's Shadow with gusto, becoming ridiculously enamored of the main character, Bean. But... how could this book, Shadow of the Hegemon, possibly live up to the high standard of the earlier novels?Well...it did! Card weaves a thick, suspensful plot about the political intrigue on Earth after the Formic Wars. We learn more about each character, their personalies, their secrets, their motives. Sort of an insight of why they do what they do. Petra and Peter in particular become far more in focus than in Card's other books. The storyline was surprisingly good, and not at all predictable.Do I recommend this book? Of course. But first, read Ender's Shadow, which is equally good (if not slightly better). Card's a great writer for people who don't like SF books, and those that know they do. Don't worry. You won't be disapointed."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I first read Ender's Game, the short story, about 15 years ago. It was a masterpiece. The tight story grabbed me with the descriptions of battle school. I felt Ender's stress during combat school, and was as confused as he was about Mazer's motivations. When the suprise ending hit, I was genuinely startled, and immediately reread the entire story. I loved Ender's Game.Shadow of the Hegemon is the opposite in almost every way.The plot, briefly, is that the Formic War is over. The graduates of battle school are a highly prized commodity by the petty nations of Earth. Achilles, the cartoonish supervillian child from Ender's Shadow, is hatching a plan to kidnap the battle school grads and thus take over the world. Only Bean, cartoonish supergenius that he is, has any chance of stopping Achilles. He seeks an unlikely ally in Peter Wiggin, Ender's older and vindictive older brother.The first problem is that the reader can't truly sypathize with any of the characters. Bean has the best chance, but the unbelieveable intelligence that alienates him from other characters alienates him from us, too. Peter has already been established as a cold and violent person, and no amount of backpeddling can get us to forget that. The other characters are worse still--in fact, when one of Bean's friends dies, I wasn't saddened so much as I was relieved that I wouldn't have to read any more strained dialogue between the two.The second problem: Robert Burns once wrote &quot;The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry,&quot; but Card apparently thinks this cannot apply to graduates of battle school. The children can come up with a ridiculous plan, one which requires every participant to behave according to a preposterous script, and the plan will succeed every time. I can accept that the children are military geniuses, but I need for the genius to be believable. The characters appear smart only because Card has them never fail.The last major problem is that the war is not directly described so much as it is relayed to us by dialogue between characters. Card uses this as a way to have the characters spout philosophy regarding war and their role in it. This could be interesting, but in this book, it's just preachy.I wasn't sure if I should give this book three stars (which I consider the lowest book I'd recommend) or two. But in the last week, I reread two of Card's short stories, &quot;Unaccompanies Sonata&quot; and &quot;A Thousand Deaths&quot;. These short stories are works of art. Card can do great things, but Shadow of the Hegemon is below him, so I cannot recommend it."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"[....]Now comes Shadow of the Hegemon. It is much faster paced. I did enjoy its story better than Ender's Shadow simply because Bean is a bit older and I thought it would develop a similar relationship between Bean and Peter. I thought we'd get a glimpse of what Ender would write about the character of Peter in his \\"Hive Queen and the Hegemon\\" -- but no. Peter is a sniveling bratty teen who somehow commands great authority and respect as an online persona but has no backbone of his own. If Bean doesn't push him to do the least little thing, he'd rather just play on his computer.Also, I didn't like the formula way Card tries to make his characters smart: \\"I know that you know that I think what you will do so I will do the opposite thing...\\" -- All his \\"smart\\" characters \\"think\\" like this and it gets a bit weary and boring because you hit a paragraph of this twisted thinking and you know how it's going to end, but there's still a paragraph of info that's not needed.Beyond that, Card is becoming more and more cynical in his writings about the U.S. He's also actively interjected himself as an adult into characters in his book (much like Robert Heinlein did) to lecture us, the readers, on what he thinks instead of letting his own characters speak for themselves. So we are regailed on how America is a country in decline and in bed with the Chinese. Card is becoming the Dr. Laura of science fiction, using his books as a vehicle to espouse his political and religous views. [....]"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"2 stars for the story, 0 stars for the politicsOk, I thought Ender's Game was really fantastic. Of course I read that book when I was a kid and so maybe Orson Scott Card's political jabberings flew over my naive little head. I just read Shadow of the Hegemon today, interestingly enough on the train from Bangkok to Chiang Mai (as some of the events are set in Thailand). There are several major problems with this book.First, it is really set in the present day with only a fig leaf of being in the future. If it was really set in the future, why do all the nations have the same boundaries and general political/social outlook as today? Why is China the bad guy and the U.S. [ prostituting] itself in trading with China? Why the angry denuciation against fashion-bound American intellectuals by Ender's Mom who reveals herself to be a religious nutcase a la Orson Scott Card? If you make it to the end of the book, and you likely will, because the story isn't too bad...Well, the basic plot line that there are a bunch of military geniuses running around and they are sought after by the different powers is pretty solid. But unfortunately, when they are no longer needed by the story, the various geniuses just disappear. If Thailand is fantastically transformed into a heavyweight by having one of these geniuses on call, why is China's rise to power a fait accompli if there are so many other geniuses running loose out there?I think the reason that Ender's Game worked was because it purposefully kept some of the details of how genius Ender's crooked little mind worked out of the picture. That combined with a change of venue and an otherworldly foe was enough to keep awkward questions from arising in our brains. The genius of Ender's Game was also that while the kids were super-smart in their military capabilities, they still acted like little kids in other ways. In Hegemon there is too much effort to show off the thinking of the kids...This whole book is a good object lesson in why Ender's Game was enjoyable--alien foe whose motives are shrouded in mystery, novelty of kids being warriors, slightly sinister nature of the main character (remember wondering if he would turn out like his older brother?), and real tension in the political/personal relationships. In Hegemon, you've got other humans as the enemy, and worse, recognizible as present day people, the novelty is gone from kid-warriors, the characters are honestly cut-outs and fairly bland, and there isn't any thriller like tension between characters. We know that Achilles is bad, Petra is good. Achilles is not going to be reformed, Petra will not be corrupted.Ah, its all pretty tedious. I wish I hadn't read this book so as to recollect Ender's Game in a better light."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I couldn't wait to pick up my copy of Card's new book! Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow are important books for me so it is hard to be critical of this new installment. However, this book is much more accessible than some of the other Ender sequels and is a great continuation of Ender's Shadow. Bean is far from normal and he makes an interesting character to follow.Without giving any spoilers, it is great to finally read about Peter and the events on Earth after Ender's departure. Of course, the other books set in this universe have referred to some of the events that occur, but now knowing the story behind them is much more satisfying.If you are not familiar with the Ender series, please do not start with this book. Ender's Game should be read first for the pure joy of it. Then read Ender's Shadow and finally this book. You won't regret it. I have recommended Ender's Game over and over for more than a decade and have never had a negative response."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Ender's Game is a classic; Ender's Shadow is remarkably good; this book I found disappointing. It picks up where Ender's Shadow left off: the war against the aliens has been won, which means that all of the domestic tensions set aside for that battle have re-emerged in full force, and the brilliant children who won the war for Earth become prizes in those battles.Again we focus on Bean with more emphasis on Peter Wiggin, Ender's brother. Early on, it's a gripping read as many of the child generals are kidnapped and attempts are made on Bean's life.Later on, though, the book bogs down in pages and pages of talk about how to deal with the politics, which I found tedious. I also found limits to my suspension of disbelief with the continued dominance of the children over the adults in military and political strategy. One sees that in young adult fiction and can accept it, but I don't see very many young adults finding this book very interesting.As I said, it's rather a disappointment and not at all up to the level of its predecessors."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"When I first heard that this book was being published, I was wary. While &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; proved that Card could produce an excellent novel of a story he had already told us once in &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; I was somewhat doubtful that Card could write another novel in this storyline and have it come out well. Indeed, in my opinion &quot;Xenocide&quot; was a very poor sequel to &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Speaker for the dead&quot;. However, like &quot;Ender's Shadow,&quot; this novel is surprisingly good, adding some intriguing insight into already familiar characters, nicely filling in the history and character gaps of previous novels, and doing it all with comfortable but imaginitive prose.However, somehow the Battle School children in this novel are less believable than previous novels... In &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot;, Ender, Bean, Petra, and even Achilles were presented in a manner that I thought was believable, and somewhat representative of the more brilliant children I have met. However, in &quot;Hegemon&quot;, while Bean and some of the other children are still well written, Achille comes across rather two-dimensionally, and it's rather hard to actually accept this character as Card wrote him. However, this is a minor flaw, the storyline and discussion of politics and war are interesting by themselves.If you've read the rest of the &quot;Ender&quot; novels, and like &quot;Ender's Shadow,&quot; you'll probably like this novel. If you're new to the &quot;Ender&quot; books, I certainly wouldn't recommend starting with this one, however."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I liked &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; enormously, I liked the whole idea of going back to the beginnings of Ender's story.Therefore, I started to read &quot;Shadow of the hegemon&quot; in a flurry of anticipation... only to realize, after a few pages, that I was BORED.I kept skimming through the pages like an impatient student who HAS TO read &quot;Beowulf&quot; for English 101, and wants to get it over with as soon as possible.The book is filled with ENDLESS discussions; the author creates artificial emotional confrontations, to hide the lack of action. He is a masterful, most accomplished puppeteer, but the fact remains that here, his characters are not REAL people, only masks.Card's philosophy, that exceptional individuals shape history, is carried here a little too far. Ender and Bean are, maybe, plausible, but really... the rest is too much. Just one example: what kind of government would let itself be manipulated by a psychotic little twit like Achilles? On the strength of his having spent once a few days in the space school. And the rest of the little geniuses are just as naively portrayed, and just as irritating.The ending is also disappointing; nothing really is finished and clarified. Peter is finally the Hegemon but the title has absolutely no prestige and real power; we don't know yet how he will change all that. The pathetic little villain, Achilles, is still alive.I assume there will be another book in the series to fill the gaps - I will certainly buy it, for I'm a huge fan of Card's, and hope for the best."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the story.I, however, did not enjoy the audio presentation. There were several voice overs where the narrator voice was over written with a different voice. The last track on each CD was blank. I am not sure if this was by design. I had the impression that there was missing material. I listen to many books on tape, many where the books author is Orson Scott Card and I have never had issues until this particular book."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Shadow Of The Hegemon pales in the brilliance of Ender's Shadow. But then again, sequels to works such as Ender's Game (Speaker For The Dead, Xenocide, etc.) and Ender's Shadow are exceptionally difficult undertakings - how does one compete with a world-class big brother who can do no wrong?The principal element of greatness in Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow is character development. Because the sequels employ the same characters, for the most part, Card has to depend on the story line to carry the book. It becomes clear fairly quickly that Card's greatest strength as an author lies in creating unforgettable super-hero-type personalities, rather than in yarn-spinning.Nevertheless, Shadow Of The Hegemon is entertaining and a good read (unlike the off-world sequels), as long as one does not expect to be taken in the same way that Ender and Bean inevitably capture the reader: innocence triumphs over evil through character, brilliance and sheer willpower."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This is the first book in the Ender's series to have Card's child prodigies seem unbelievable. Card has become a little too infatuated with his concept of child military geniuses conquering the world. Once again Bean returns as the brilliant child hero of the book and the story focuses strongly on him and his struggles to defeat arch-enemy Achilles. Peter Wiggin, the future ruler of the world and Ender's older brother, is relegated a minor role.The characters are stretched rather thin and I had difficultly believing them. Achilles, who was a broke child on the streets of Rotterdam, surprised us all when he was sent to battle school in the first book. He was only there a little while before returning to earth, but that time was apparently enough to hone his military genius, allow him to take control of three different nations at his leisure and also broker a peace agreement between Pakistan and India in only two days of work. That's pretty impressive!Peter Wiggin does not appear as the brilliant internal political mind we had come to expect, but as someone unsure of how to act moving forward lacking in courage and ambition. He's worried of his role in the upcoming strife and what he should do. Lucky for him, slightly less intelligent Sister Carlotta is able to give him advice on manipulated international politics.The book was fast paced and entertaining if a little unbelievable. I find myself growing less interested in Bean with each book. If you're a fan of the series, like me, you'll enjoy the book, but probably not love it as much as some of the previous in the series. Perhaps the next book will allow Peter to mature to brilliant political dictator we know he is suppose to become."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I loved Ender's Game and, although it didn't measure up to the original, Ender's Shadow was an intriguing look at the same events from a different perspective. I read Shadow of the Hegemon to find out more about the fate of Bean, which certainly appeared as very problematic in Ender's Shadow, but I was very disappointed. Somehow, it was much easier to suspend disbelief about warrior children when the story took place off-planet and Earth was facing annihilation by an alien invader. Somehow it just doesn't work very well when the plot revolves around Earth politics. Moreover, it's hard to work up much interest in a character like Peter Wiggin, who has already been established as a nasty piece of work. Shadow of the Hegemon has its moments of excitement and some engaging characters in Bean, Petra, and some of the other Battle School grads, but the baddie here, Achilles, is just not credible (13 year olds or whatever age he is just don't take over the world this easily!) and Peter Wiggin is eminently forgettable. It looks like there is another sequel coming, but if the focus is on Peter Wiggin and Achilles again, I think I'll pass it up."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This novel really falls flat in comparison to other Card masterpieces. Instead of a tightly woven plot, Card seems hyper focused on the interactions of emotionally bonded competing protagonists. So much so that the plot becomes subverted to the expedient whims of the characters emotional development.Shadow is a book of military strategy that takes place two centuries in the future - using contemporary technology. This is seems a novice error. Or is this book intended to be more metaphorical? The lengthy afterward defending his future personas would dissuade this thesis.I think it safe to say that Card lacks a general grasp of air power (or space power) specifically and political power generally. Power never lies with the smart. Brains and geeks shape the world but they do not re-forge it in their image.Evan Hitler had to go to jail. Stalin had to wait in the wings.The political maneuvering that Card envisions is simply silly. Wheels within wheels of deception. Too many break points. Too little plausibility. Too much power entrusted to those who have not earned it.So I am left thinking that this book fails because it is not a novel. It is a launching pad for Card's various well documented broadsides: America is on the decline, (morally and otherwise) the world is easily manipulated by strong personalities etc.Card's philosophy, as presented in Shadow, is heavily tainted by his Mormon belief structure - witch seems to force him to always show his own country in a negative light. This is, after all, the country that denounced and persecuted his church fathers for their beliefs.It is hard to be this brutally honest with Card. He left a beautiful eulogy for his late son in the final pages of Shadow of the Hedgmon. But I must be frank. Card has sunk to the level of Bath Tub SF with this novel."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"When beginning to read &quot;Shadow&quot; it appears to make some sense, yet as you go on, it becomes too improbable to believe. The way that these brilliant children can manipulate adults and gain such status is irrational. And it appears to not have occured to Mr. Card that there must of have been other generations of brilliant children, who are now grown adults, probably in positions of power. The theory of the child that is smarter than anyone else holds up with Ender, because he is the only one. And it holds with Peter and Valentine, because they are his siblings. And it manages to hold with Bean, because he is genetically engineered, yet the idea that all of these children are more brilliant than any of the leaders of the world, who have the benefit of experience, is ridiculous. And I don't believe in the idea that experience closes the mind, because Ender and Bean are both very &quot;experienced,&quot; and yet still manage to look at situations with the same ingenuity."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I loved Ender's Shadow, and I just purchased Hegemon last evening and finished it today. Although I hate to say it, I think Card should have left these idea's alone, thus ending it at Ender's Shadow. Everyone just seemed to big for this story, and with that I mean, with every distraction and problem there were complicated situations and resolutions that were pulled out of thin air. I usually have a hard time seeing into the future of Card's books. He always kept me on my toes, but with this I could almost smell what was going to happen, and I hoped that my conclusions wouldn't actually come, but they did. I just wasn't fullfilled with this one. Everyone that was once complex and interesting just seemed, for lack of a better work, basic. It was like a really big budget Hollywood movie where there are so many flags dropped in the first ten minutes, that you know what's going to happen. Sorry Mr. Card, you're my favorite author, but please leave Bean and the Wiggin's alone now--their auia's can't handle anymore."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This is the first book by Orson Scott Card that i have read, and i found it to be pretty good. I would have liked to have started with one of the Ender books, but this is an interesting place to start as well, being as all of Ender's glory is referred to in the past.I enjoyed the characterizations of the kids. They obviously went through a lot in Battle School and in the previous wars, and now that they are back, they are struggling to be kids and to be human again. (That is, if they ever were.)One of the gripes that i have with this book is that i am never sure about time. Petra's age is given, but i am never sure how old Bean really is - and with growing kids, i think this makes a difference. I think there was a mention in there of Bean not looking older than 6. Well, if you are 10 and being mistaken for six or if you are 13 and being mistaken for 6, this makes a difference. In the same way, the period of time in which this takes place is fuzzy too. We know that it is sometime a couple centuries in the future, but the countries of the world look pretty much the same, and when Card refers to past wars, generals, etc, they are 20th century at the latest. I know, i know, there was the Hedgemon and the Formic wars and stuff, but i didn't READ the Ender books, and seeing a map so similar to the one today is just strange.The other criticism of this book that i have is of the national characters. There is a lot that Card writes that is true, but even if i believe that the US is &quot;a nation in decline&quot;, i don't think it will be as fast as Card makes it out to be. Similarly, i don't believe that Russia will be in the same situation that she is in now in 300 years' time.. Again, it may be that the maps will change more dramatically.Overall, i really did enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I just want to start off by saying that I have read every single book in Card's ENDER series. He kind of dropped off with &quot;Children of the Mind&quot; and i lost a little interest in his writing, but when he wrote &quot;Enders Shadow&quot;, I don't think i was into a book more. Now with &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot;, I consider this Card's best book yet. I bought it two weeks ago and I never put it down. He uses Bean alot in this book, but not as much as Petra. I think Bean will become a major player in Card's next book (in the afterword, he said to be writing another called &quot;Shadow of Death&quot;). Though the book probaably isn't a huge hit now, but I know a lot of people online and at school that this book will be read by all of them. This is a book for teenagers (like myself) and adults who have followed Card's writings or just a big sci-fi fan. This book will hopefully be a big hit soon."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I've been a huge fan of the Ender series since I read Ender's Game in 1988. I thought Ender's Shadow was possibly even better than Ender's Game. But I was disappointed in Hegemon. It just lacked the emotional punch of the best books in the Ender universe. Card says in the afterword that the book is like &quot;a huge game of Risk,&quot; and that's the problem. The characters come off as game pieces being moved around the board.I also thought the various points of view dissipated the focus and impact of the book. The three main protagonists end up casting shadows on each other's stories. While reading about one character in a given chapter, it was hard for me not to wonder what was going on with the others at the same time -- particularly Peter, who figures heavily for a while but all but disappears in the latter stages of the book.The book felt too much like a &quot;bridge&quot; between Ender's Shadow and the next book, and I didn't think it held up well on its own. It just felt like something was missing -- which might be because this and the next book were originally conceived as one."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This is the sixth novel in the Ender's Game Series. It shows what is going on in an alternative location from where Ender is. I really enjoy reading novels that have a parallel story elsewhere and piece together what is happening from other books in the series.This novel delivers in helping to piece together some of the activities on Earth. I always wondered what happened on Earth after Ender leaves on the colony ship. All the knowledge you get from reading Ender's game is that his Brother the Hegemon conquers the world. This novel helps fill some of the pieces but leaves much left unsaid.Bean, the brilliant child who was an important battle school solider for Ender is now in pursuit of Achilles. Except the rivalry between these two is involving Earth as the playground rather then the slummy streets of Rotterdam.Very few novels have the subject of children taking over the world. Teenagers and younger children will get a kick out of the power these child geniuses attain. Although the characters are very one-dimensional, the problems they deal with and the emotional battles taking place are well written enough to overlook this.When I heard about this book at first I was hoping it would be more of a conquest book but card leaves that for a future novel. I love books with the subject of Human's future history and this book delivers. Card has some good references to non-western cultures which helps keep interest in the book till the end on top of a predictable ending.Expect a follow-up novel from Card."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Card does it again this book ranks up there right with Enders Game! While Card's Speaker for the Dead and Children of the mind were more of a background to Enders Game his Shadows book do capture the adventure that I enjoyed so well in Enders Game.Shadow of the Hegemon is good reading from the first to the lastpage as with Enders Game I managed to get through the book in 2days. I truely enjoy Cards work with the Ender series. If youtruely enjoy science fiction you will enjoy Shadows of the Hegemon as well as any book in the Ender series.I wait for his next piece of work!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"An excellent addition to the Shadow series. Although not quite as powerful as Ender's Game or Ender's Shadow, Hegemon is nonetheless one of Card's best works. The characterizations and setting is so well developed that the reader easily finds himself immersed in the storyline, despite the sci-fi aspects of the novel (children so bright that they hold the fate of the world in their hands). Card is one of the finest authors of the 20th and 21st centuries--and this is one of his best works."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"The book is good, but not as good as Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead or even Ender's Shadow. The plot of the book is pretty much this: Shadow of the Hegemon describes the battle for dominance of the superpowers back on Earth. All countries involved in the conflict aspire to utilize the services of their most brilliant subjects - the strategic geniuses from the Battle School. Some countries realizing the enourmous importance of those kids are even willing to assassinate them, or kidnap them in order to gain monopoly on the best military minds in the world. Achilles, Bean's archrival, has his own agenda - kill Bean and Bean's friends from the Battle School that severely humiliated him. To accomplish that Achilles is trying to gain control of the most powerfull army in the world. In the meanwhile, Ender's older brother Peter, hiding behind his made-up identities on the net, attempts to gain political support that will enable him to begome the Hegemon after revealing his identity.Shadow of the Hegemon starts really well, then somewhere loses its flow and credibility, and at one point deteriorates to an action sci-fi. Having said that the characters in the book are perfectly sharp and crisp. There is a very interesting twist involving Ender's, Peter's and Val's parents. Another line that adds a lot to the plot is Bean's struggle against time (those who have read Ender's shadow will know what I mean). Overall, Shadow of the Hegemon is definitely worth reading, as long as you don't expect of it the greatness of Ender's Game. It is suspenceful, well written and allows one to reunite with the favorite characters one more time."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I think Orson covers the development of the charectors very well. The reader learns more about the charectors as the charectors learn more about themselves. He also keeps you guessing on the gray area of light and dark. In the writing he also proves the point that no matter how smart you think you are there are people out there that are most likely as smart as you. Most important of all it pushes forward the idea that hearts are what binds people together not countries, not birth right, not family, not even religion. The greatest bind is the bind of the heart."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I love this new series about Bean and his role in saving the universe. Card continues the story of Bean that he began in the book Ender's Shadow, in fine fashion. There was a huge gap in time between Ender's Game and Speaker For The Dead and this series shows what happened during that time.The Battle School kids are all sent home after the Bugger War. Someone or some Country steals all the kids from Ender's Jeesh hoping to make their country the superpower of the world. Bean and Nikolai are the only ones not captured. Bean along with Sister Carlotta and Peter Wiggin work to get the kids released from their captors. All are released but Petra.In this novel it is up to Bean and Peter to save Petra and stop Achilles from taking over the world. This is a great book and very enjoyable. The only thing that gets me is, how many times is Achilles going to get away? He should have been dead several times over already. Well, can't have everything."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"This book holds up to the standard set by Card in Ender's Game with some differences. One of the most obvious is the lack of 'science' in this sci-fi, as the book focuses more on the political plot and employs less of the futuristic and 'techy' stuff. Any fan of the series will genuinely love the continuation of the saga, whereas someone reading it as an intro to the series may not like it all that much."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"Maybe I'm just the biggest Ender sentimentalist out there, but I loved this book for every reason that I loved &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; &quot;Speaker for the Dead,&quot; and &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot;: It's fantastic in every way, outlining its characters with the kind of precision and mastery that I could only hope to accomplish in all my days as an author and, one day, a screenwriter. &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; picks up one year after &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; left off and moves on for another two or three years throughout the course of the book. The plot is quite ingeniously conceived and executed, and it finally answered a lot of the questions I had been asking myself ever since I finished &quot;Ender's Game&quot; for the first time, the main one being: How did Peter Wiggin become Hegemon? This book answers the main question of how it happened, but it left off in a spot that left me with a new question: How in the name of God and sonny Jesus are Bean and Peter going to pull of this imminent victory that they are prophesized to achieve, as is foretold by the last three &quot;Ender&quot; books? I was content to not have the answers. On the other hand, I can barely handle this feeling in my stomach that I call anticipation. Anticipation for the final two installments in Bean's saga, which is every bit as gripping and well thought out as Ender's. I just hope Card doesn't take a wrong turn after &quot;Hegemon&quot; like he did after &quot;Speaker.&quot; I mean, don't get me wrong, I still loved &quot;Xenocide&quot; and &quot;Children of the Mind,&quot; but they seriously lack in the kind of pace and brilliance that are evident in &quot;Game,&quot; &quot;Speaker,&quot; &quot;Shadow,&quot; and here in &quot;Hegemon.&quot; Nevertheless, despite any doubts I might be harboring, I do not presume that Mr. Card will let me down. I have every confidence in him. But in the meantime, I'm eagerly awaiting the fifth installment of Harry Potter. Godspeed, Orson."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"There are so many new character's in this book, but it's not overwhelming, but then again there's plenty of the same character's as in Ender's Shadow. One thing I love most is the introduction to the character Virlomi, though she's in the very end. Just a flat out good continuation of the story."},{"Title":"Shadow of the Hegemon","review":"I will read anything that Orson Scott Card writes.

HIGHLY recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Raising earthworms for profit","review":"There is good information in this book concerning the basics. However, when the topic came to advertising, much of the info is dated. I'm sure all the info was pertinent in the 1960s and 1970s. I am still gad I purchased the book."},{"Title":"Raising earthworms for profit","review":"This book was purchased along with several others on the topic, and after reading them all, I would say this one is the most useful and complete for any person desiring to raise some worms, whether commercially or for home use for composting, fishing bait or a poultry feed supplement.Instructions are given for setting up various sizes of worm bins and pits, indoors and outdoors. Various methods of worm feeding are mentioned. There are profiles of a number of worm farms, and advice on marketing. The illustrations are very helpful.This is an older book--- the original edition was written in 1959--- but it was updated in 1994. While there is nothing on the internet marketing of worms--- I anticipate eBay would be a popular marketing tool for the novice worm farmer--- I believe the general marketing advice given is pretty sound.The instructions given pertain mainly to the common red worm, but there is also a section on the African nightcrawler. It is advised to start off with the red worm, which is easier to raise, and later, if desired, add the nightcrawler to one's business."},{"Title":"Raising earthworms for profit","review":"Well written book with a lot of information but left you wanting more. Does not tell you how to seperate worms from compost."},{"Title":"Raising earthworms for profit","review":"While written some years ago the basic premise of this small handbook remains relevant today.

I would recommend the publisher update the book with modern information regarding suppliers and include web sites and e-mail addresses which did not exist when this book was first written. Some of the photos are a bit hard to make out, otherwise I would give this book 5 stars. Overall, worth every penny and I recommend it to those who may be interested in raising worms."},{"Title":"Alex Raymond: His Life And Art","review":"The warning bells started going off not long after I opened this eagerly anticipated book. On page four the author tells us that the \\"Buck Rogers\\" strip was syndicated by NEA. Then a few pages later he tells us that \\"When Mother Was a Girl\\" was the topper to \\"Blondie\\" and that \\"Dumb Dora\\" was Chic Young's first syndicated strip. These errors aren't exactly earthshaking I suppose, but such details, all of which could have easily been fact-checked, don't speak well for the quality of the research that went into this book.I soldiered on, though, and found that Tom Roberts is certainly an expert on all things Raymond. Only when his story has to touch on other creators and comics does his expertise take a serious fall. In fact Roberts is such a Raymond fanatic that his devotion to the subject ends up being the real source of the project's undoing. The book is chock full of rare Raymond artwork, but that material is presented in lieu of long loving looks at \\"Flash Gordon\\", \\"Secret Agent X-9\\" and \\"Rip Kirby\\" art, the sort of material that this reader presumed would be given more play in a Raymond bio. We do get some material from all those strips, of course, but the book is chock full of all manner of oddball Raymond work -- movie poster designs, pulp illustrations, ad campaigns, etc. It comes across as if the author is trying to impress us with the breadth of his Raymond collection which, don't get me wrong, is indeed astounding. The sense that the book was put together by a Raymond collecting wonk is highlighted when the author occasionally switches to first-person commentary explaining just how rare such-and-such an item is and how many eyeteeth collectors would gladly trade for it. Nowhere is that wonkish attitude more vividly apparent than with an utterly pointless two page sidebar detailing how an auction house approached the author to authenticate an unsigned painting as being the work of Raymond.Some of Raymond's rare artwork could just as well have stayed under wraps, too. For instance, we get fourteen pages of art from the juvenile book \\"Scuttle Watch\\", and another ten from an insurance ad campaign. In neither case did Raymond produce particularly distinguished work (at least by his lofty standard), so I would have much rather seen a few representative images from those venues and allotted some of that space for more of Raymond's best works. Roberts has the collector's myopia -- his devotion to Raymond leads him to focus more on minutiae than on what made Raymond famous.And speaking of minutiae, a fifty page chapter detailing Raymond's service in World War II is enough to test the patience of even the most devoted reader. Raymond served on the U.S.S. Gilbert Islands, an aircraft carrier that I now know in such intimate detail that if I materialized on its deck I could find the mess hall blindfolded. I dutifully read the whole chapter, a feat few will or should attempt, and got treated to a detailing of that ship's activities that might be fine military history but goes ridiculously far afield from telling the story of Raymond's life. Here's a taste: \\"The Gilbert Islands was an escort carrier of the CVE 105 Commencement Bay class. With a displacement of 23,200 tons, she carried a 28-foot draft. Not as big as her sister carriers of the Essex class, the Commencement Bay class had a flight deck spanning 500 feet...\\" etc., etc., ad infinitum. Look, If I wanted an exhaustive history of the Gilbert Islands I'd buy one. Any competent editor would have slashed this chapter by 30 pages without losing anything of Raymond's story.It's hard to imagine that a book so lovingly produced, about one of the greatest cartoonist/illustrators of the twentieth century, could fall so far short of what it could and should have been. And yet, even though the book is flawed in a whole variety of ways, I still have to give it a pass. Even a cocktail napkin doodle by Raymond is worth a look, and so a whole book chock full of his art, despite the questionable choices made in the selection, is a joy to behold. And since this is the most complete biography we're ever likely to have of the great penman it's a book that, flaws and all, deserves a place on any fan's bookshelf.PS -- for those keeping score, \\"Buck Rogers\\" was syndicated by John Dille, \\"When Mother Was a Girl\\" was the topper of \\"Dumb Dora\\", and Chic Young's first syndicated comic strip was \\"The Affairs of Jane\\"."},{"Title":"Alex Raymond: His Life And Art","review":"This book has a lot of little known, eccentric material about Raymond-- his Christmas card drawings and his design for his country club menu that you would never see any other way, but it does not begin to cover his major achievements such as Flash Gordon adequately (very little reproduced from original art). The author clearly adores Raymond, which is to his credit, but he sometimes loses perspective. For example, I could do without the author's two page discussion of the unresolved authenticity of a drawing done for a movie ad by either Raymond or Austin Briggs, recounting the details of the author's phone calls with an auction house . I wish he had replaced it with more of what makes Raymond great. This, combined with the thin, inferior quality paper and cheap binding, and the odd design (what's with the unnecessary blue stripes on each page?) suggests that the definitive Raymond book is still to be written."},{"Title":"Alex Raymond: His Life And Art","review":"To begin with, this is a beautiful book. No doubt about it - for the most part the graphic design of the book is really outstanding, other than the fact that sometimes it was difficult to understand where to find the caption that went with a particular photo. As far as pure content goes, in addition to what you'd expect (pages/panels from Raymond's comic art), there's also an equal emphasis on his illustration work, pin-ups, etc. We are also treated to extremely rare material, such as Raymond's colour guides - done in watercolour on small reproductions of his Flash Gordon pages. Raymond's assistant on Rip Kirby gives us a run-down on the kinds of brushes, pens, paper, etc. that Raymond used, and we even get to see a Flash Gordon panel \\"ghosted\\" by Austin Briggs in which Raymond wisely re-drew Flash's face. As far as the book's shortcomings go, there are some curious omissions. Roberts describes the initial, rejected version of the Flash Gordon strip when he could have simply reprinted the art - it saw print in the comics fanzine Alter Ego in 2005 or 2006. In a book chock full of Raymond rarities, that strip would have been a natural to include. There are tons of great photos of Alex, but I also would have liked to have seen more photos of Raymond's wife and children. In some ways I think that the material in the book could have been arranged a bit differently so as to give it a more natural \\"flow,\\" but I can fully understand the challenge of trying to organize and juggle such a huge amount of stuff.

An artist of Raymond's stature and influence deserves much better than this effort. Roberts does a good job reproducing some little known Raymond art and that is a treat for fans of his work, but as a writer and biographer he really falls down, providing little insight into either Raymond's art or life. The book reads as if the author just \\"dump-trucked\\" everything he could find out about Raymond and his creations into the book with little thought to overall theme, organization, and detail selection. Hence areas where he has a lot of information, e.g. the movement of Raymond's ship during the war or the cast of Flash Gordon movies, are way over-developed to no purpose. There's little presentation of Raymond's character or analysis of his art and his contribution to the medium and to American popular culture.

The amount of information is so great it tends to repeat itself often and could have stood up to some serious editing if only to create more breathing space around the borders of the pages. The amount of spelling mistakes alone had me shrinking with embarrassment for the author.This is clearly a labor of love by one man who had a wealth of access and serious dedication to the source material and the subject's acquaintances. The amount of detail undermines the craft but I felt like there was no stone left unturned.

With an open-minded non-demanding style, Howell tackles the issues most often asked about Christianity in a way that revives both believers and non-believers and does what most Christians somehow fail to do.. pull others closer.I recommend this book for every single person who's ever had a question about Christianity."},{"Title":"Introduction To Neural Networks: Design, Theory, and Applications, Sixth Edition","review":"This is far more of a survey than it should be. I expected far more in the way of technical/mathematical subject development than this book provides. Instead, the content is dominated by qualitative discussions about how to tune neural net parameters. This part is worth knowing (hence the two stars), but is not enough to justify an entire book.The math of back propagation learning encompasses all of 4 pages of Ch. 6. Nearly all the rest of the book are broad-stroke \\"examples\\" of how people use a proprietary package (BrainMaker) to build nets for various applications. The book is practically an add for BrainMaker, which I guess is not surprising since the book is published by \\"California Scientific Software Press\\", the makers of BrainMaker. Anyone sense a teeeeny amount of compromised objectivity here?Perhaps my biggest problem with the text is the lack of either implementation examples or code. Anyone who will be reading this will be hardcore CS types who can code, and what they are going to want to see are examples of a working NN and how to code one. What they aren't looking for are instructions on how to used a canned (and costly) closed-source software package.There are much better books on the subject than this one; please, read those and stay away from this one."},{"Title":"Introduction To Neural Networks: Design, Theory, and Applications, Sixth Edition","review":"A pretty good book if you want to learn about Neural Nets.

I largely agree with the other reviewers' praise of Mistry's fine character development and the story of Nariman's decline and the burdens this places upon his family is certainly poignant.My main problem with this book is the absurdity of the situations Mistry places his characters in which are far too contrived. Indeed, the silly way that Yezad sets up his boss had me literally tossing the book across the room. Ridiculous too, was Jal and Coomy destroying the ceiling of their apartment to keep their father from returning and the nonsensical handyman neighbor they invited in to 'repair' it. Also, their agreeing to have someone they knew was incompetent replace a structural support just didn't ring true.I cautiously recommend this book for the vividness of most of the characters and the insight it provides into the relgious divisions within India and to the meagerness of even middle class life. But you will not get lost in this book because the plot will keep reminding you that you are reading a work of fiction and not peering into real lives."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"i recieved the book in very good condition and in a prompt manner"},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Was forced to read this book as it was a selection of a book group I am part of.

I found it extremely difficult to pronounce the character's names and they would associate things with Indian names like well this thing is like the (Indian name here that you do not understand). This book definately needed a dictionary at the back because a lot of times I had to go and read a paragraph a couple of times to try to figure out what it meant.If you get grossed out easily or are offended by minor sexual content then you should definately not read this book also if you are not into politics or understand nothing about Indian culture or words, this book could be a real challenge. There were some good things about it I just don't know which exactly."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"As many other reviewers have said, if you have read A Fine Balance, then Family Matters is a disappointment.Or, it can be seen as evidence of a potentially very good writer.The book starts well and retains the interest of the reader with the issues of elderly people, sibling and parental relationships. It is also an interesting insight into what life in certain parts of india, for certain groups of people can be like. Mistry is a very clear writer and it is easy to visualise the different events and personalities.There are two reasons why the book does not get a higher rating.First of all, it goes into different situations and different themes without maintaining the attention of the reader. You need a central theme round which other stories can hang. But in this case, for example, the employment of Nirmal's son-in-law, it becomes disjointed from the earlier main theme of the elderly .Secondly, Mistry is very keen to make political points, reflecting on what was happening in India. What this means is that sometimes the connection between the specific political points and the main theme of the book seems contrived. At the same time, it is not fair on the reader who does not know much about Indian politics. The reader should get a balanced political view, unless the author has specifically stated their political stand or viewpoint.The book is very well written and the reader does learn a lot about aspects of life in India."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Family matters tells the story of who will take care of an aging father.

His writing is very descriptive, thoughtful and just downright good. This is a story of adult children caring for an ailing father. It is so appropos to any family of bickering adult children who feel resentment, love, grief, guilt, jealousy...... All the emotions that come with that. At the same time, he also delves into the feelings of the father. His shame, embarrassment, guilt, remorse......This is a must read for fans of Mr. Mistry but also for anyone who loves good writing that brings you to your knees. I found myself reading paragraphs twice because the words are so beautifully put together."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"It was interesting to me the dilemma of caring for the aged in another country that the story was about. Famlies caring for elderly parents here in the US share some of the exact same sorrows as those in other countries in the same situation. Some families pull together and pool their resources to ensure their loved one's dignified end-of-life. For families who never developed these inner and outer resources, end-of-life needs of the family patriarch/matriarch bring out the absolute worst behavior and decision-making. The concept to take away from this book is - no matter your culture, the dying process of family members is a true test of the soul for those in charge of overseeing the care of the dying. Let's all hope that when we reach that point in life, we will be in the care of those with developed and mature souls."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"This is a slow, patient, very delicately written book. The inclination toward the maudlin was saved by the superb writing. A very realistic portrayal of a family's attempts to deal with an elderly family member. No one is cruel, but they are tired, challenged, impatient, strained, and helpless. The elderly family member was once young and robust, who was the center of a young woman's obsessive love, and he experiences nightmares of shame and guilt of what to his beloved and his wife. His parents wanted to see him happy, and their insistence caused great unhappiness not just for himself, but for his wife, and his parents died before they could witness their destruction. What was so distressing at the end was how much the characters had changed - a good husband and father become a religious fanatic, very likely to repeat the errors that destroyed his father-in-law, that the good brother had come with good intentions only to now live in fear in his own home, of a good wife and mother who loses her husband to religious fanaticism, and all these observations by a clever little boy. It took some time to get into the book, but once you understood what was going, the book was very easy to read."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Highly recommend!

When elderly Nariman, suffering from Parkinson's disease and a broken ankle, becomes too much to cope with, his stepchildren offload him onto their stepsister. Living in a tiny flat with two children, a somewhat grudging husband and little money, things become difficult and her husband hatches a convoluted plot to get a promotion and a payrise...Meanwhile Nariman's stepdaughter is looking for a ploy to avoid having him back once his ankle mends...A beautiful book that really just encapsulates life: exquisite moments, change, tragedy, things not working out as intended, humour and how experiences can alter a person."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"This book, while different in many respects from Mistry's, A Fine Balance, nevertheless is similar in that it weaves multiple stories and characters together into a complex narrative which deals with ordinary and decent people trying to survive in a world out of their control. In this case, an elderly Parsi gentleman becomes helpless and is completely at the mercy of his children and stepchildren, two of whom resent him and the other who has money problems. His son-in-law Yezad has problems of his own trying to make a sufficient living for his family when his father in law is brought to his home. Despite the twists and turns that threaten to break them apart, circumstance actually brings them together, although ironically, the same intolerance which was the root of the initial unhappiness and disharmony in this family threatens to incarnate itself again as the book draws to a close.One things I like about Mistry's books is his weaving in of smaller characters and their stories into the larger narrative like Vilas Rane, the book seller who does double duty as a reader and writer of letters for the illiterate and the eccentric Mr. Kapur who tries to spread his love for Bombay and feeling of communal harmony by honoring every religious tradition with a window display in his store and the zeal by which he goes about it."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"As Mistry makes clear in this novel, the \\"one important story [is] of youth, and loss, and yearning for redemption...Just the details are different.\\" With these themes as the bedrock of his story, he depicts the world of a multigenerational Parsi family in Bombay, their world changed forever when Nariman Vakeel, a 79-year-old former professor and sufferer from Parkinson's disease, falls and breaks his leg, effectively ending any possibility of an independent life. His stepchildren, Coomy and Jal, quickly dump Nariman in the two-room apartment of their younger half-sister, Roxana Chenoy, her husband Yezad, and two sons, supposedly for only three weeks, while his leg heals. Beset with financial problems, lack of space, and resentment of Coomy and Jal, who remain in their father's 7-room apartment, the family does its best, but tensions rise and slowly erode their relationships, precipitating intense personal crises for each family member.Concentrating more on the world writ small than on the broader, more expansive views of A Fine Balance, Mistry creates a number of vibrant and fully drawn characters. Nariman Vakeel, recalling his dreams and disappointments, his 11-year love for Lucy Braganza, and his disastrous arranged marriage, is touching in his neediness and in his apologetic helplessness. His grandchildren delight in his stories and seek ways to help out; Roxana makes do in every way possible, tending to Nariman's most personal needs; and Yezad, frustrated by the lack of financial support from Coomy and Jal and a job in which he is underpaid, feels jealous of the old man's claims on Roxana. Mistry's dialogue, the subtle and not-so-subtle undercurrents it reflects, the often humorous interactions, the honest but nave motivations of some of the characters, and the meticulously depicted and subtle decline of the family are the work of a master.The one jarring note for me was the use of Shiv Sena, a fanatic political/religious group, as a motif thoughout the novel, their threats, extortion, violence, and fundamentalist rhetoric intruding periodically (and often dramatically) on the lives of the characters. While this obviously broadens the scope of the novel and offers a context in which to evaluate Coomy's religiosity, the fears of small businessmen like Yezad and his boss, and Yezad's eventual conflicts with one of his sons, it felt contrived to me, too strong and too obvious in what is otherwise a novel of more subtle interactions. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Mistry's latest novel, Family Matters, is a flawless gem and is a worthy successor to his equally impressive A Fine Balance. At the heart of Family Matters is the aging Nariman Vakeel who is in rapidly deteroriating health due to Parkinson's. Nariman is haunted by dreams of his ex-girlfriend, Lucy Braganza, a girl his parents forced him to renounce. He is cared for by his children Coomy and Jal. Coomy is a cranky woman with \\"too much anger\\" within her to care for her father well. When Nariman slips and hurts himself seriously on a walk, Coomy and Jal transfer custody of their bedridden father to their half-sister, Roxana Chenoy. Roxana's is a happy family with a doting husband, Yezad, and two wonderful sons, Murad and Jehangir. The arrival of Nariman in an already cramped apartment, though, puts enormous financial and emotional burdens on the family. As Nariman puts it, \\"People have their own lives, it's not helpful when something disturbs those lives.\\" Family Matters portrays the daily play of emotions with remarkable acuity.Mistry paints all of his characters very realistically with real strengths and failings. Roxana cares for her aging father with amazing grace. Yezad, who once dreamt of emigrating to Canada, tries valiantly to keep the cheer. And who wouldn't want to have Murad and Jehangir, two of the most amazing kids, as their own! There are many side players in the story-Daisy, who lives downstairs in Pleasant Villa, and who regales Nariman quite often with her violin. Also portrayed well is Mr. Vikram Kapur, Yezad's boss at Bombay Sporting Goods Emporium.Mistry's love for his old city, Bombay, shines through loud and clear in the words of Mr. Kapur: \\"Bombay endures because it gives and it receives. Within this warp and weft is woven the special texture of its social fabric, the spirit of tolerance, acceptance, generosity. Anywhere else in the world, in those so-called civilized places like England and America, such terrible conditions would lead to revolution.\\"These words of high praise for Bombay, however, come with a warning against the radical political party, Shiv Sena, trying to gain control of the dynamic city. As with Fine Balance, Mistry uses his platform to make a couple of political statements-a frequent rant against the Shiv Sena and another subtle one against the pro-lifers in America, the \\"empty talkers\\" who prevent research into Parkinson's.Mistry warns against fatalism: \\"In a culture where destiny is embraced as the paramount force, we are all puppets.\\" Despite that, his primary characters often accept fate as the only graceful alternative. Family Matters ends without strong closure and that is just as well. For we have learnt along the way that even in a culture riddled with fatalists, the common man holds his head up high and always emerges from battle, relatively unscathed.At one point in the narrative, Yezad and his boss peer into a mirror and Mr.Kapur asks, \\"See that? The faces of ordinary family men, not heroes.\\" I respectfully beg to differ."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Within Bombay's Towers of Silence, the Parsis expose their dead to hungry vultures-a practice as environmentally friendly as it is macabre. Ethnic Persians who had migrated to India, the Parsis have traditionally led Bombay's commercial class. And though they have become an endangered species due to stagnating birth rates and miscegenation, their Zoroastrianism has largely removed them from the constant squabbling of Bombay's Hindus and Muslims, which a decade ago erupted into carnage and fire.Behind the riots was the Shiv Sena, a Hindu supremacist band of thugs, whose agenda includes abolishing Valentine's Day, razing mosques and, according to writer Rohinton Mistry, \\"subjecting innocent letters and postcards to incineration if the address reads Bombay instead of Mumbai.\\" Such is the cultural and political backdrop of this exciting new novel by Mistry.Any novel set in Bombay must be as vast as the city. Mistry's knowledge of its customs, locales and languages is encyclopedic, his cast of characters panoramic, and his portrayal of Indian attitudes spot on. Indians perceive the use of toilet paper as unhygienic; they often converse in trite proverbs, and their attitude toward the West is decidedly conflicted. So is their attitude toward India, a great country and a \\"hopeless\\" one. Indians writing in English are producing some of today's most inspiring and original fiction, and I strongly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"This is the first great novel of the 21st Century that I've read. I think FAMILY MATTERS is a masterpiece. I don't use that term often. But this is the real McCoy. The quality of the writing is up there with Tolstoy and Victor Hugo. There is no \\"magic realism\\" here. Everything that happens comes out of character and obeys the Law of Cause and Effect. Nothing is arbitrary. This is a novel of karma. Others have summarized the plot. What they don't tell you is how moving this book is. There were several times in the book I found tears streaming down my face. My tears were never for the big moments in the book, but for the small deeds of love among family members: a father for his sons, a boy for his brother, a woman for her father, a small boy for his grandfather. Dickens was really good at writing mean people. So is Mistry, but unlike Dickens, his mean people have a human side, too. You can understand why they are mean and what has made them that way. His good people can be petty and unreasonable at times, too. I ended up loving them all. With his fellow Indians, Mistry shares a kaleidoscopic power of description, but he's also got a strong sense of structure. Whereas all the other Indian books I have read fell apart around of the way through (GOD OF SMALL THINGS, MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN, RED EARTH AND POURING RAIN, etc.), FAMILY MATTERS is solidly and logically constructed from beginning to end, making it a work of art. This is a great book by a great writer. I want to read everything Mistry writes. Five stars."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"I was initially attracted to Rohinton Mistry's fine novel \\"Family Matters\\" (2002) because its central characters are adherents of the Zoroastrian (Parsee) religion living in Bombay. Zoroastrianism and its practitioners are rarely treated in fiction. The religion is ancient, one of the world's first monotheistic faiths, and small with a dwindling number of adherents. As emphasized in Mistry's novel, Zoroastrianim is threatened by assimilation and intermarriage, and there are currently factions between the more traditional and the more reformist elements of the faith. In reading Mistry's book, I was reminded of a nonscholarly but still good introduction to Zoroastrianism that I read some time ago, Paul Kriwaczek's \\"In Search of Zarathurstra: Across Iran and Central Asia to find the World's First Prophet\\". This book is available in paperback, and I recommend it to readers of this novel who may wish to explore Zoroastrianism. It more than merits studying.With that said, Mistry's novel is less about Zoroastrianism per se than about common and intimate human concerns that, in this book, arise in a Parsee family in Bombay but, with allowances for place and culture, could arise frequently elsewhere. I was struck with the painful and in part intractable themes in this book. The story deals with questions of religious intermarriage, problems arising in a \\"blended\\" family between parents, steparents, children, and stepchildren, the difficulties of caring for an aged and ailing parent, and questions of guilt and change that can result in a family member as a result of dealing with these dilemmas.The central character of the book is Nariman Vakeel, a retired professor of English, 79 years old at the outset of the story and suffering from Parkinson's disease. In middle-age, Nariman fell in love with a non-Parsee woman, Lucy, but reluctantly gave her up based upon objections from his family. He married instead a widow whom he did not love, Yasmin, with two children, a daughter, Coomy and a son, Jal. Nariman has never lost his feelings for Lucy who haunts and follows him incessantly during the early years of his marriage to Yasmin.At the outset of the book Coomy and Jal, unmarried, live with each other and their stepfather. Nariman and Yasmin have their own daughter, Roxanna, who is married to Yezad with two young boys, Jehangir and Murad. They live in a small flat Nariman has purchased for them with his retirement savings.When Nariman breaks his ankle and become bedridden, Coomy and Jal resent having to care for him -- particularly for the need of tending to his bodily function which are intimately and fully described in the book. They foist Nariman's care onto Roxanna and Yezad. The book deals with the difficulties the couple and their children encounter in their tiny flat in caring for their grandfather and in finding space and money. Roxanna and Yezad begin to quarrel and each member of the family engages in compromising, questionable practices to bring in more money, to the detriment of their views of themselves.The novel details the fighting between Roxanna and Yezad and thier relationships with Coomy and Jal. The characters are admirably individual and well-differentiated in this troubled story. There are many well-drawn secondary characters, including Yezad's boss, Mr. Kapur, the owner of a sporting-goods store, and Daisy a violinist in the Bombay Symphony Orchestra and a neighbor of Roxanna and Yezad who befriends the family and Nariman. She visits the flat to play the violin to comfort him.As the story progresses, events with Nariman and between Rozanna and her siblings come to a sharp climax and denoument. The plot line is melodramatic in places. Yezad, guilt-ridden and needing consolation from the difficulties resulting from caring for Nariman, becomes increasingly attracted to Zoroastrian observances, seeking the consolation of religion. As the book progresses, he moves from skepticism and secularism to a traditional form of Zoroastrian practice, to the distress of his family. In the long epilogue to the story, Yezad becomes highly critical of his adolescent sons for dating and becoming involved with non-Zoroastrian young women. In a sense, \\"the wheel has come full circle\\" as Yezad comes to adopt the behavior of Nariman's family, with their strong discouragement of Nariman's romantic interest in Lucy.The book deals with common matters but not easy matters with a realism (in spite of some plot machinations) both provocative and wrenching. There are places in the book where each of the characters could have behaved differently. But I came away from the book with a feeling that I didn't want to judge any of the characters too harshly or to impose \\"shoulds\\" on them.I want to mention two thoughts that stayed with me upon completing the book. First, the book left with me with a feeling of compassion for human frailty -- and with the vague impression of the importance of some form of religion for teaching a sense of compassion. (There is a wonderful passage in the book in which Yezad and his family discuss having pictures and memorabilila of all the great religions of the world in one's home -- to promote a sense of tolerance and to remind oneself that each religion has something to teach in approaching transcendent reality.) Second, and with a more secular bent, the book reminded me of the power or art, coupled with compassion, to ease the difficult problems of human life. I found Daisy, who faithfully comes to soothe Nariman with music from her violin exemplifies both art and compassion. In the book, Daisy realizes her dream of playing the solo part in Beethoven's violin concerto with the Bombay Philharmonic. In this great work of music, and in the book, there is a timeless message of the power of art to transcend human suffering.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"&quot;Family Matters&quot; is a story about all that goes on behind the closed doors of a family home - lust and love, anger and betrayal, sickness and death. Set in Bombay, it centers on Nariman, a former professor grown old and sickly, and his progeny. His stepchildren Coomy and Jal, still bitter over 30-year-old wounds, refuse to care for him when he becomes bedridden. Instead, they send him to live with his daughter Roxana and her family in a two-room apartment. Roxana's husband, Yezad, must somehow provide for this newly enlarged family, and her children, Murad and Jehangir, must assimilate the lessons the new situation brings into their home.The Indian setting is integral to the book: the languages, the politics, the religion, and the lifestyle are all important elements of the story. Mistry does an admirable job of making the setting appear realistic without becoming obscure and intimidating.&quot;Family Matters&quot; has a number of different plots. Nariman, Jal, Coomy, Roxana, Yezad, Murad and Jehangir all undergo their own personal evolution, and the lives and stories of their friends, colleagues, and neighbors are interwoven with their own. The plots are interspersed in an admirably smooth fashion; however, the lack of a singular driving action makes the book less than compelling.After 430 pages of meandering, the book reaches an end. It's unclear, from a narrative standpoint, why the conclusion is necessary or inevitable; some elements of the book's closing appear to be out of place or even random, and others would be greatly enhanced by further development of aspects of the book's plot. This finale seems like a meager reward for so many pages of buildup; pleasant as the book is to read, it does not seem complete without a more significant denoument."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Family Matters is a solidly written and engrossing book which I literally could not put down. I read it compulsively over the course of two days and resented time spent on the mundane things like eating and family.The story is a familiar one-- an aging father with Parkinsons falls to the tender mercies of his family. Unresolved past issues, insufficient pension, and a host of unrealized dreams combine to create a story that is moving and very relevant. Mistry writes with clarity and compassion and never consdescends to either reader or characters. It is not always an easy book to read, but it never gives in to either bleakness or despair.Given the theme, and the remarkable number of sources from which it draws (Lear, etc.) it is amazing that Mistry does not fall into the trap of using stereotypes or cliches. Family Matters successfully avoids complaisance and completion, managing a satisfying ending without giving into the temptation to tie up too many loose ends.Although there is a great deal of detail in the book that is specific to Indian culture and the contemporary politics of Mumbai/Bombay, there are still enough issues of general human import that it should appeal to readers from every culture. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"One of the characters mentions having read a book about events in India which was \\"full of horrors, real as life. But also full of life and the laughter and dignity of ordinary people\\". That is not a bad summation of what Mistry attempts to achieve in his novels and achieves once again in \\"Family Matters\\". The problem is that Mistry is not as talented at portraying family life as he is in writing about characters struggling with the challenges of a poor, corrupt society. He has a good theme for the family story part of the novel, centered around the burdens of caring for an impoverished, helpless father, but Mistry does not pull it off that well. For me, the best character in Family Matters was Yezad, and he was of least interest when relating to his family. Only with the younger grandson does Mistry make the family story really come alive. If you have read \\"A Fine Balance\\", I would not discourage you from reading \\"Family Matters\\", although Mistry's first novel, \\"Such a Long Journey\\", might be a better choice."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Rohinton Mistry has done it again. Family Matters is a novel about the emotional, physical, and financial strain of caring for someone who has Parkinson's disease. Family Matters is also a portrait of India and the problems that exist there. Nairman Vakeel is a retired English professor who suffers from Parkinson's disease. He is the father of one biological daughter named Roxana, one stepson named Jal, and one step daughter named Coomy. Mistry writes about the physical effects Parkinson's has on the body with such detail. The harsh effects Parkinsons has on a person's speech and physical mobility is well described in this novel. The stress of caring for someone with Parkinsons disease can be great. This is clearly evident when Coomy and Jal thrust the responsibility of caring for their father to Roxana and her family after it becomes unbearable for them.There are many themes in this novel, but perhaps the strongest is religious prejudice. In India, it is important to marry and even associate with people of the same faith to avoid scorn by one's family. Nairman belongs to the Parsi faith and falls in love with a Catholic woman named Lucy. Their relationship is strongly discouraged, but their very public affair continues long after Nairman gets married to a widow of the same faith. Nairman has dreams about Lucy and his wife through the novel that reflect a sense of regret and loss about both women.Mistry describes the declining physical effects that Parkinson's has on a person's speech and mobility. All his characters are so well developed. He puts them in situations that reflect the problems of his country well. With Nairman's medical cost soaring, his son in law Yezad is forced to turn to illegal gambling to make ends meet. Yezad refuses to help his wife Roxana in caring for her father in the beginning of the novel. It is very interesting to see how Yezad's attitude and personality changes after some life altering events. There is another character in the book named Vila who writes and reads letters for people who are unable to write and read for themselves. In one of his letters, he describes how a young man for a lower caste was killed for associating with a woman from a higher caste. Poverty is so prevalent in India that even children take bribes and money from their classmates.There are many different characters in the novel like the violinist Daisy who dreams to be a professional musician. Edul is a interesting character. He is an inept handyman who just yearns to be helpful. Mr Kapur is the owner of a sporting goods store and Yezad's boss. He yearns for the India of old where citizens did not have to live with the threat of violence and riots depicted clearly in the novel.Family Matters is a wonderful book with many themes and characters. I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"This novel takes place in Bombay in the mid-90s. While it's story makes many interesting specific statements about the politics and social climate of Parsi life in this time period, it holds timeless meanings for any family that exists anywhere in the world. This immensely readable novel tells the story of Nariman Vakeel in his last years and his relations with his two stepchildren Jal and Coomy, his daughter Roxana and her family. Nariman, debilitated by Parkinson's, has come to a point in his life where he can no longer take care of himself and so must rely on the attention of his children. Throughout the novel, we discover the details of Nariman's tragic past while we simultaneously experience the fascinating and harrowing trials his children undergo. As the family struggles to decide whose responsibility it is to care for the aging man, Roxana and her husband Yezad labor to make ends meet while raising two enduring boys. Yezad, whose dreams of an idyllic life in Canada are thwarted, works in a sporting goods shop and finds the amount of comfort he receives returning each day to a loving family decrease. Through several trials of transgression, the family learn that chance alone can calculate when their fortunes will arise. Peace is a certain uncertainty. The only times that are certain are fleeting moments of contentment wrought from loving gestures.This is a beautiful and heartfelt novel. Mistry is thoroughly familiar with the tedious existence wrought from working in an uncreative job in order to keep the family going. (He worked in a bank for many years before beginning his writing career.) This is evident in Yezad's daily struggles. However, each character is sharply drawn making them seem instantly familiar as if they have long been a part of our own family. Therefore, the connections become extremely personal and during tender moments you may find yourself moved to tears like I was in one scene. The book also makes powerful statements about living in postcolonial India where the shadow of English culture still weighs over life. Yezad witnesses his son falling under the same amorous spell he submitted to as a child reading heroic novels about an England that only exists as an idea of England. Family life according to Rohinton Mistry is not a happy matter, but it is enlightening, complex, rewarding and surprisingly rich."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Rohinton Mistry's \\"A Fine Balance\\" was a majesterial novel, sublime in epic and subtle in emotion. His follow-up \\"Family Matters\\" by comparison is an exhausted novel, never really starting, and moving by the sheer force of its own inertia. The writing is hackneyed, the plot simple, the conflict nonexistent, and the resolution contrived. Unfortunately, it seems that the fame and success of \\"A Fine Balance\\" has simply exhausted a once thrilling young writer."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Mistry is a very talented author. About fifty pages into this book I found all the major characters believable. Mistry depicts their complexity by intermittently showing various sides of these individuals. His style is realistic and enjoyable to read. I was transported to Mumbai every time I picked up the book. In addition Mistry has the skill to show humor, human resilience, and happiness in people even at times of great stress.If you enjoyed A Fine Balance (Mistry's best selling other book), you will not be disappointed by Family Matters. Mistry is one of the best Indian authors I have read despite not being as famous as Rushdie. I highly recommend Family Matters and of course A Fine Balance.P.S. I am a stingy Amazon reviewer who infrequently gives books 5 stars. This one really deserved it."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"I enjoyed \\"Family Matters\\", and found it superior to \\"A Fine Balance\\" as a story. It was not overburdened with history and politics as was \\"A Fine Balance\\", therefore this book was a more natural, and less engineered read. The only problem I encountered with it was that I found the general turn toward the end a bit difficult to believe. It just seemed to come out of nowhere. I think that a little bit more character development might have remedied this apparent fault."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Mistry not only helps you understand Indian culture and sub-cultures, but allows you to feel the culture as well by creating a bond with his characters.Reading this book was like eating a really well prepared Indian meal."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"This was a really great book with lots of insight into families and the complicated feelings that we have for our relatives. Mistry is a great writer because his characters are so well developed, you can feel them; and there is always something redeeming in each character and some empathy to be found for even the most vile characters in his stories.The only reason I gave this only 4 stars is because I have read Mistry's other books and this one is not quite as good. For one of the greatest books I have ever read, check out A Fine Balance."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Family Matters, at its core, is a story about family. The family at the center of the novel are the Chenoys, with parents Yezad and Roxana and children Jehangir and Murad. The story revolves around the effects of the Chenoy's extended family (Aunt Coomy, Uncle Jal and Grandfather Nariman)upon the Chenoys. At the story's heart is the injury of Nariman, and how Jal and Coomy feel they cannot take care of him, and pawn him off to the Chenoys who have tight finances and a two-room flat. Interwoven are vignettes about Nariman's girlfriend Lucy; his wife and Jal, Coomy, and Roxana's mother Yasmin; Yezad's boss at work; and the Chenoy family's neignbors. These vignettes serve to further our knowledge of the different characters. The result is a novel where one feels as if they know the characters intimately, their weaknesses, their strengths, and their desires. Family Matters is a novel everyone can relate to. Everyone has had money problems, everyone has had problems with their relatives. Mistry manages to distill the experience of being a part of a family into a very well-written novel."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"After reading Mistry's latest, there should be no doubt in any reader's mind why Mistry has been hailed as one of the most important writers of the 21st Century.Keeping the formula of his earlier works (&quot;Such a Long Journey&quot;, &quot;A Fine Balance&quot;), Mistry takes a small group of people and forms their characters in the simplest ways: by dialogue, actions and re-actions. By doing so, he unravels a splendid story which everyone can relate to, in their own personal interpretation. Though the formula is repeated in each of his novels, it does not grow stale because of his masterful, emotional storytelling. A winning novel in every respect."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Having read Fine Balance, I was looking forward to reading Family Matters. However, my expectations were short lived.After reading the book I was left wondering what was the point of the entire book ! (apart from being a waste of time)The main characters were not developed thoroughly..they were far from realistic. The less sad the better about the numerous side characters! The manner in which Yezad set up his boss was ridiculous, Coomy and Jal destroying their own apartment was even worse, and I did not know whether to laugh, cry or throw the book out whenever I read about the \\"handyman\\". The cause of Coomys death was again ridiculous. The author has delved into too many details about parsis and zorastrism which made the book even more boring.Am glad I read this book after Fine Balance! Wonder if I should bother reading \\"Such a long journey\\"The only conclusion I have reached is... just because you liked one book by an author, do not have the same expectations as you will definitely be disappointed."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"The plot of Family Matters, plainly written, wouldn't make the average reader hit the Amazon.com One Click Purchase button, or the more culturally fastidious reader hop into their hybrid and drive down to the locally owned community bookstore to purchase it. Elderly Nariman Vakeel, a dignified retired professor suffering from Parkinson's disease, lives with stepdaughter and super shrew Coomy, and kinder but hopelessly spineless stepson Jal. When Nariman fractures an ankle Coomy is quickly overwhelmed by his convalescent needs, and she contrives to unceremoniously dump Nariman into the tiny two room flat of his daughter Roxanne, son-in-law Yezad, and their two young boys. An intended three week stay stretches to far beyond original intentions. Roxanne and Yezad, already in an extremely tenuous financial condition and in extremely cramped quarters, begin a long and painful struggle to deal with the significant demands that the bed-bound Nariman places on their family. Describe the plot to your average book group or bibliophile, you'll most likely get a polite \\"Hmmm. Sounds interesting\\", at which point the recommendation will sink from consciousness faster than spent uranium to the sea bottom. But hold on...Mistry, if you haven't read him (apologies to those who have) is one of this half century's most accomplished writers. Born in Mumbai/Bombay, he emigrated to Canada in his twenties, worked as a banker, and became a prize-winning author. His clear-eyed, unsentimental stories about human nature are usually piercing, devastating, full of social criticism, and at the core, determinedly faithful to the potential goodness of the human race. Family Matters holds true to this formula.Family Matters is a restrained saga. There are no sweeping victories, no bodice ripping romances, no heart of darkness unspeakable deeds. There are instead exquisitely crafted characters playing out their roles in an intricate drama whose themes include edge of disaster financial privation, religious and ethnic prejudice, enduring love, deep devotion to family, shabby pettiness, hypocrisy, personal redemption, temptation, growth into wisdom, descent into religious orthodoxy, and simple dogged endurance. The richness of detail about life in Mumbai/Bombay is deeply satisfying, Mistry's ability to verbally paint scenes and images is unsurpassed.To read, or not to read. Rohinton Mistry is an author of superlative talent, and he has some profound observations to make about our funky human race. He has an extremely keen eye regarding human behavior, rivaling the very best of the authors that have psychological depth. He is rant-free, his facts are allowed to speak for themselves. If you've never read Mistry before, A Fine Balance is a richer and more comprehensive tale: start there. If you have read Mistry before, and are up for a for deliberately paced, excellent tale of India, family, and human nature: settle yourself in for some serious literary satisfaction."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"interesting issues are dealt with in this book. The process of aging, the hints of Alzheimers, the relationship between all family members when an elder becomes ill. The family dynamics on both sides of the grandfather's family are full of emotion, anger, even betrayal i would say. I was expecting it to be on the same level as A Fine Balance but it is slightly less. However, i would still recommend it as Mistry is one of my top 10 authors."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Wow! I read this book 2 years ago and I still haven't found anything yet that could beat this book.It gives you an insight on the darker side of life and how people struggle to keep their lives moving. I am touched the writer's ability to convey such strong issues in the most intriguing way.This book is highly recommended for all and to appreciate little things in life!"},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Can love be sustained when the loved one is grossly imperfect? This question is explored on many levels in this absorbing and moving book.When Nariman, a respected professor of dry wit and warm feelings is incapacitated, he is compelled to move into the tiny apartment of his younger daughter Roxana and her family for round-the-clock care. If you are unaware of what it may feel like to be at the mercy of another's compassion, or to be the caregiver of an invalid, you can get a good sense of the hard work and humiliation by reading Rohinton Mistry's warts-and-all details. But distasteful chores are not all that Nariman brings with him. The tragic consequences of a past love affair has embittered his elder daughter, complicating relationships. And along with Nariman's physical dependency has come financial dependency, putting enormous strains on Roxana's paycheck-to-paycheck existence.The book's point-of-view eventually centers on two people most challenged by the situation--Roxana's loving but volatile husband, Yezad, and her sweet younger son, Jehangir.Although he loves and admires his father-in-law, Yezad's responsibility as family breadwinner becomes a crushing burden. Resentment, anxiety, desperate scheming, and remorse all come into play. Novels too seldom embrace the subject of financial desperation--and how it turns into emotional strain--but great understanding is displayed here.Nine-year-old Jehangir adores his grandfather and almost welcomes the challenges of forced intimacy. At first, the strain on his family is a painful mystery to him, but his growing awareness of the complexities of adulthood makes for a fine coming-of-age story.Love of country parallels love of family in this book. Yezad's life in the workplace reveals much about modern-day India--full of corruption and horrific injustice but also compassion and diversity.Like India, this book is full of life. Vices and virtues reside in equal measure everywhere you turn. Compassionate characters reveal shortsightedness, distasteful eccentrics reveal kindliness. There are many voices in this book, and Mistry writes dialogue well and abundantly, which makes the book a fast read!With all this going for it, why only four stars? Characters were almost always rendered with great care and detail. When character developments, however plausible, seemed short on explanation, they stood out. Exactly how did the young Nariman come to cave into his parents' wishes after he had defied them well into adulthood? How did Yezad's transformation (revealed in the epilogue) occur? And at least one important plot element--an elaborate hoax--seemed unlikely to me.Never-the-less, I am eager to read more of this author's work. In regard to FAMILY MATTERS, John Updike is quoted, \\"The reader is moved, even to tears.\\" Some perfectly beautiful moments made this promise true."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Set in Bombay during the '90's, Family Matters focuses on the travails of a single family as they try to cope with caring for a degenerating father, though as is typical for a Mistry novel, things are never quite that simple. Nariman Vakeel, 79, who suffers from the accelerating onset of Parkinson's disease, trips one night and breaks his ankle. His step-children, Coomy and Jal, at first try to care for him as they have for many years, but eventually ship him over to his blood-daughter's much smaller and more cramped home. Roxana and her two sons take him in gladly, but the monetary pressure brought on by his addition to the household begins to take its toll on her husband Yezad and eventually the entire family. Meanwhile, Coomy and Jal have varying degress of guilt over their actions and come into some conflict with each other. Underlying all of this is a family history involving Nariman, his first love, and his eventual wife (mother of all three children) that has caused much pain and anger among the children and especially between Coomy and Nariman, most of which is told through flashbacks interspersed throughout the novel via Nariman's recollections. Overlapping the family story is the story of Bombay itself, its seemingly eternally pervasive corruption, the dangers of its radicalism, and the depth and width of its people's characters.The strengths of the novel lie in its characters and its voice. The family members from oldest to youngest are fully fleshed out in wonderful precise detail and a fullness of humanity that is a pleasure to read. The same is true of of several side characters as well, especially Yezad's two companions--his friend the letter writer and his boss at the sporting goods store. Except for near the end (more on that later), you buy completely into the idea that these are living, breathing people. They are drawn in all complexity, with all the normal shadings of real people--weaknesses and strengths warring with one another on a daily or even hourly basis.The narrative voice is also a pleasure. Mistry gives us a range of character voices--the bombastic and poetic boss, the more resignedly poetic letter writer, the pragmatic and frustrated Yezad, the sometimes wandering Nariman. They are not single-note characters, however. Yezad too has his poetic moments, his emotional moments, while Nariman can move from sharply cantankerous to warmly, fuzzily recollective. Mistry is equally adept at male and female, young and old. And the narration itself has a softly poetic feel to it, never drawing attention to itself but still inviting the reader in, giving the book an intimate, cozy feel to it.Pacing is sometimes a problem. I thought the book lagged in a few places and probably could have been shortened somewhat, especially some of Nariman's flashbacks. My biggest problem is with the ending of the novel. Without giving away details, some of it seemed a bit perfunctory and especially regarding one character somewhat unbelievable, more of a plot contrivance than a natural outgrowth of events. That plus some of the pacing issues knocked it down a notch for me and made it not quite as strong as his earlier novel, A Fine Balance, which is one of the best books I've read in the past year.Those problems aside, Family Matters is a moving, intimate look at family, both immediate and extended. There are some simply beautiful moments in this book, along with some quietly hearthbreaking ones, ones a reader will savor while reading and which will stay with him or her afterward. It might be set in a place foreign to most of us, but at its heart, it will feel just like to home to many. Well-recommended with a stronger recommendation to read A Fine Balance before or after (depending on if you'd rather be somewhat disappointed or surprised)"},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Painted on a much smaller canvas than his earlier novels (Such a Long Journey; A Fine Balance; Tales from the Firozshah Baag), it is as wonderful a novel as the others. It focuses on one family and revolves round the care of the 79 year old patriarch who is crippled and afflicted with progressive Parkinsonism. Though there are some mean-spirited characters in the book, the affection of others is very touching. The love of the nine year old boy for his grandfather is especially heart-warming. Mistry has the gift of bringing sheer unforced goodness to life like no other writer."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Mistry has an enviable talent for blending realism and melodrama, consequence and coincidence, isolation and loyalty--all without testing the reader's credulity. He famously proved his worth as a Dickensian writer in \\"A Fine Balance\\"; in \\"Family Matters\\" he adopts a far more claustrophobic setting to portray a family torn apart and then strengthened by both poverty in a big city and proximity in close quarters.Nariman Vakeel, an elderly Parsi deteriorating from Parkinson's disease, breaks his ankle, and the injury is the last straw for his two stepchildren, who have tired of caring for him. The pair (quite literarily) unload Nariman on his daughter Roxana and son-in-law Yezad, along with their two sons, all of whom live in a tiny two-room apartment. The addition of Nariman to this impoverished household taxes the newly enlarged family beyond its means, and the strain caused to both their patience and their limited budget forces various members of this previously honorable family to consider schemes and deceptions to make ends meet.Meanwhile, Nariman's stepchildren plot increasingly outrageous acts of subterfuge to prevent his eventual return to his own home. And we eventually discover the details of the old man's past relationship with a Goan Christian woman, the tragic and scandalous consequences of which his stepchildren--especially his stepdaughter Coomy--continue to hold against him.As in his past books, Mistry relies in part on coincidence to advance the story, but he is adept at never subsuming the family drama to his plot devices. (He even offers a coy response to those who don't believe in the prevalence of happenstance, when Yezad realizes after one tragedy, \\"That was the problem, everyone dismissing the possibility of coincidence.\\") But this book is less about chance and more about the inevitable fate of the victims of a city, like Bombay, that is overwhelmed by corruption and callousness and deprivation.If this book is guilty of excess, it is in its characterization of Coomy. It's not that her wickedness is implausible--far from it. Rather, Mistry never convincingly presents the motives for the greed and selfishness that cause her to go to the lengths she does to keep Nariman from returning to the apartment she has managed to commandeer from him. More generally, we're never quite sure why she resorts to malice while her brother hesitates in cooperating in her schemes.But, in the end, \\"Family Matters\\" is not about Coomy and her brother but about Roxanna and Yezad and their two sons. The troubles that plague their household are all too believable, and Mistry's novel forcefully and affectionately describes one family's decline, partial redemption, and ultimate defiance against the inhumanity of fate and circumstance."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"This book will touch you in many ways and cannot be forgotten. Warm, tender, humane, at times funny - something only Rohinton Mistry can offer in a book. The characters in this novel are all well sketched. The struggles of a middle class Parsi family in Bombay taking care of an aged parent applies to all those who have an older family member to take care. Rohinton makes you sympathize with all the characters in their daily struggles in Bombay, India. Rohinton is able to skilfully portray through the eyes of Roxanna's children the beauty of grandchildren while taking care of their grandparent. Thank you Rohinton - a masterpiece indeed."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"This book was so well written and moving I want to read more of Rohinton Mistry's books. It wove a story around a family and their lives so clearly and with warmth that it brought back memories of my life too.I believe those people who like biographies and autobiographies would enjoy this too."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. One the one hand, it did give me a peek behind the curtain into Zoroastrian society in Mumbai, which was interesting. On the other hand, all of the characters had a fatalistic attitude about everything and be determined to find a way to make a complete mess of their lives no matter what.It reminded me of an Indian version of Coronation Street."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"This is the most depressing book I've read in a while. When their grandfather is foisted on them by the utterly unbelieveable Aunt Coomy and Uncle Jal, Roxanne and the children try to make the best of it, while Yezad only makes life more difficult for everyone. Leaving Roxanne to care for the &quot;chief&quot;, Yezad spends his time selfishly resenting every moment she's not dedicating to his comfort. I got awfully tired of his self-pity and selfishnes. I would have enjoyed learning more about Nariman and less about Yezad, as Nariman was the more interesting, sympathetic character. The children are delightful and appear much more mature than their father. I also agree with another reviewer--there were some ridiculous situations. Why would Coomy and Jal ruin their flat to justify keeping their father away? They didn't appear to need any reason anyway; no one was doing anything about it. I became bored and depressed way before the end of the novel...when, by the way, it got even more depressing! Poor Nariman! After all he's gone through, to have to put up with a son-in-law who has become as bigoted as his own parents. And so goes the circle--ending up just where the book began."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"It was used and it was falling apart before I finished reading it which made it a little difficult to read and I could not then give it to the library book sale."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"This is a thoroughly enjoyable book about a Parsi family living in Mumbai, India during the 1990s. In many ways it could be about a family any where - parents and grown children who don't always see eye to eye. But, because this is India there is a strong sense of family obligation and duties to one'w parents. There is also the problem of inadequet sized apartments.With both happy and sad moments, Nariman moves from living with his step-son and step-daughter to the home of his own daughter. She lives in a two room apartment with her husband and two sons, so life becomes complicated and even more crowded. Under these circumstances the true nature of the characters comes to the forefront.The book is very well written. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading novels set in another culture."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Very useful if you want to see how the Zoroastrian ( Parsi) rituals are still performed today but above all it is a book about humans interacting in a family when serious challenges arise. The old head of a Parsi family ,Nariman Vakeel, suffers an accident and the duty of care for him is shared by the younger members in the \\"house\\". They are fulfilling or not their duties according to their character, their possibilities and above all to their feelings towards the old man. This entire story is happening in an India shattered by nationalist and religious turmoils which complicate even more the lives and the decisions of the protagonists.I appreciated the style of the narrative , the psychological analysis of the characters, the historical and the religious value of the book but most of all the way it manages to describe the drama of the real common people's life without any hollywoodian/bollywoodian features.Overall, a very good buy."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Rohinton Mistry takes us right into the life of a family in this book, a family with all itsconflicts, its misunderstandings, its jealousies, and unexpected moments of redeeming love. India, his setting, seems to makeeverything feel bigger and more important, both hopeless and hopeful.Nariman is an old man who has experienced much sadness and pain in his life. He lives with his stepchildren, Jaland Coomy, who try without much success to protect him from the world. His natural daughter, Roxana, lives with herhusband and two sons apart from her father. The lives of all the family, however, are intricately bound together.The title, Family Matters, is wonderful, with its dual meanings of both family concerns and the importance of family.There are no simple answers in this story. Plans, even clever plans, go awry. Good acts are not rewarded. Out of goodintentions come undeserved troubles. Despite our best efforts to stop wickedness, people continue to do the wrong things.Moments of peace in this confusing world---acts of genuine compassion, a little laughter, a little music---are rare, butprovide us with just enough hope to continue to slog on.Mistry is a gifted writer, excellent at writing dialogue with edgy comedy, with a whiff of hysteria, and at creatingplots that twist and turn unexpectedly, like life itself.Recommended."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Rohinton Mistry is a genius! His prose is unequaled...When even narrative about the mechanics of \\"Using a Bedpan\\" can grasp your attention, you know he has the GIFT!Mistry's characterization is SUPERB!

You will feel you're a member of the family described in all its nakedness. This is not a black and white story, but neither is it an ethical relativist one.I found the characters and situations described by Mistry tremendously humane. Yes, with faults and temptations, but within their struggles and their cohesiveness as a family, able to overcome challenges imposed on them by cultural and social problems.In the mist of the story, Mistry takes us on a tour of the biggest problems of India, then and now:- A corrupt system that pervades every aspect of people's lives. This aspect of India is described not in its crudest form, as it was in his \\"A Fine Balance,\\" but this has been a constant theme in Mistry's books.- Cultural problems, such as arranged marriages. And here is where you can trace the tragedy of this entire story. An arranged marriage that should have not been.- Prejudice as usual plays an important role in the stories of Mistry, as well as class and caste differences. What's amazing is that Mistry, as most Indians, don't see in it a cause for rage, but a deplorable situation, almost the result of natural causes. Whether this attitude is the reason Indians gave us the only non-violent revolution in History, or such revolution molded their character is debatable.I'm sure people will see this multi-faceted story with different eyes. On one hand you see the rapidly deteriorating life of a once respected professor, victim of an arranged marriage and a weak character; the struggle of a young family that succeeds in raising 2 children with a high sense of morality; the cohesiveness of a family owed to a great extent to the family values of the same society Mistry criticizes; a woman that walks a fine line between her obligations as a daughter and as a wife. Children that agonize seeing their parents struggle, secretly trying to help solve their economic problems, afraid that their world is crumbling.But don't think that this is a predictable story. Mistry is a master at this, and you won't be able to guess what's coming as you go through this fascinating story.At the end, you will become a member of the Vakeel family, and you'll be happy about it."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"This book is about family relationships, with all their complexities and frailties and strengths that extend beyond time. A family in crisis is the focal point, with the ailing father as the central figure. All members are going through a personal journey, facing hopes that may never be realized and the fears that go along with such revelation. How strong should be our commitment to one another as a family? What is \\"fair\\" in such a situation? Should this word even be brought into the discussion? This book will help you to reason that out. I am in a similar situation myself and this book made me think more clearly.Recommended for tweens to adults."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"I enjoyed this book about Roxana and her family as they care for her aging father, Nariman. Mistry's strengths are his crystal clear prose and also his well drawn characters. With some, but not too much, emphasis on the poor living conditions, religious practices, and the government of India, the book moves along at a nice pace. Although we meet Nariman at the end of his life, his story is told through flashbacks as he recovers from a broken ankle. Yezad, Roxana's husband, is also a main character who struggles with his job, his religion, and with providing for his family. The secondary characters of Roxana and her two sons and her step-brother and step-sister are also nicely developed. The book is about family matters that we all have: aging parents, financial worries, problems with children, and relatives who make bad decisions. A nicely told story by a wonderful writer."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"It's interesting how so any compare this book to 'A Fine Balance' while neglecting 'Such a Long Journey,' Mistry's first novel with which it resonates strongly. Mistry excels in giving us a glimpse not just into family life in India, but more specifically into Parsi family life in Bombay. Its these details of a small and disappearing subculture if you will, that I find most fascinating. Many have written to say that the characters seem exaggerated or unrealistic-I assure you they are not. They might not all be in one family, but at the end of the day, Mistry's writing a work of fiction, so its natural that the book would be dense with the absurdities of Indian life, both modern and traditional. Rohinton captures the very 'Indianess' of his characters, whether Parsis, Muslims, or Hindus that someone from outside the culture may not fully get. Nevertheless, far from making the book inaccessible, he's provided an opportunity few would have personally, giving readers a chance to witness the very specific travails of a struggling Parsi family, and yet speak to universal themes that all families have to face, through the post-colonial lens."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Rohinton Mistry's FAMILY MATTERS is the story of differing attitudes toward caring for the grandfather of the family. The more affluent household is repelled by the everyday requirements of taking care of an entirely bedbound elder. The less affluent household is more flexible and creative, and winds up helping grandfather through the rest of his life.Work and young children are important parts of the family equation. The struggle to get more money in an established clerk's job winds up indirectly causing the death of his long-standing employer. There is a lot of amibiguity in the circumstances surrounding the death of the sporting shop owner at the hands of a militant Hindu association.A fatal accident kills grandfather's stepdaughter, thereby freeing the other members of the family to combine resources and residences. A happy ending is the result."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"If you are looking for a contemporary novel that can give you a broad, sweeping look at the human condition, this is it.

Shunning postmodern experimental deconstructionalism, political correctness, and all the modern shibboleths that litter the cultural landscape, Mistry has seen fit to write straight from the heart in a voice that creates verisimilitude with reality. His characters are alive, his choices of details are correct, his moral dilemmas are true, and he brings us from the personal to the political, from the individual to a whole social, economic, and living world. He gives us a small situation, a family in conflict, a once vital man now struggling with illness, and he shows us all the connections to the past, to youth, to loss, to a struggle for redemption. His themes are those of great nineteenth-century novelists, of Tolstoy and Proust, and these themes live in today's world as well. Why have so many writers abandoned them for an easier self-indulgence of their egos? Because it's so much harder to be an artist, to write well, to tell a story that carries universal meaning, and it takes great courage to stand on one's principles, to take a risk and perhaps appear out of fashion.Mistry is in the tradition of Turgenev, Chekhov, and Tolstoy. But he is his own voice and brings something unique to us. He brings Bombay, decrepit in its current state, but with a rich past that now is only remembered in photographs treasured by those who still care, although they too are a dying breed. He brings a family to us, replete with economic struggles, childhood struggles, marital struggles, political struggles, and spiritual struggles, but Mistry's talent is to take us to a far higher level, a universal level where we can see ourselves very clearly.That is the talent of a true artist, one whom you shouldn't miss.I read recently that Mistry canceled his book tour to the U.S. because he was constantly being harassed at airports due to his \\"foreign\\" appearance. What a shame. I would love to say hello to him, just once."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"I read Rohinton Mistry's \\"Family Matters\\" over Thanksgiving, and could not put it down. As anyone who has read any of Mistry's novels knows, they are not gripping thrillers or cliffhanging adventures, and this book is no exception. It is a finely-wrought study of character, family and society, intimate yet epic in its scope. Other reviewers have provided plot summaries, so I will not do so. In any case, plot for Mistry seems almost beside the point: it is simply a device to explore human emotion and behavior, and its interaction with society, from personal relations through family, religious and ethnic community, social class, city, country and humanity as a whole. Mistry gets to the universal through the personal, and uses his own Parsi religion and culture as the medium.A few words of the little I know about the Parsi community (with apologies for any errors): It is descended from the Persians (Iranians) that chose exile rather than submit to forced conversion to Islam in the 7th and 8th centuries. They found refuge in India, and their monotheistic religion has endured for millenia. The very reason for the Parsis' survival is their insularity, the fierce devotion to their identity and prohibition of marriage outside the community. The insularity also provides many, if not most of the personal dilemmas and tragedies in the book: forbidden love, catastrophically mismatched arranged marriages, impossibly high expectations for children, the need to uphold the community's reputation for honesty and integrity, the contradiction between Parsis' progressive ideals and the inherent bigotry of refusing to mix with others. The elegiac quality of the writing, its sense of loss is largely due to the final result of the community's insularity: a catastrophically low birth rate, and fears of the community's extinction in a few decades. The rest of the sense of loss comes from the memory of a more tolerant, enlightened Bombay where communities mixed, tensely but vibrantly, before \\"Hindu nationalism\\" took root, a memory that forms a large part of Salman Rushdie's fiction too.Some reviewers criticize the sub-plot about Shiv Sena goons, members of a bigoted, extremist Hindu nationalist movement, as contrived and unbelievable. The devious scheme of Coomi and Jal to escape their filial responsibilities by destroying their apartment's ceiling is also dismissed as unrealistic. I would respond by saying that anyone who has not lived with bigotry, communal divisions and violence, stifling careers, suffocating families, poverty, and absurd rent-control rules in a corrupt, teeming city should at least try to imagine these conditions. I have only experienced a fraction of these conditions growing up in Greece, and the schemes ring very true.Let me end with a few general comments. The Indian subcontinent has produced large numbers of wonderful fiction writers in English (there are far more writing in the major Indian languages I am told, but they are unfortunately inaccessible to most of us), and their ranks keep swelling with newer generations all the time. In terms of scope, type, characterization, technique, etc. they are all over the map. Compared, say, with the magical realism and wild, extravagant invention of Salman Rushdie, Mistry's fiction seems spare and very old-fashioned. It fits much more into the tradition of great 19th century realist novels, from Gogol, Turgenev and Tolstoy to Dickens and Trollope, but more like Turgenev, I'd say: the combination of vivid characterization, precise prose, and universal themes through the seemingly mundane adventures of ordinary people and families following a tragic arc. It is great literature. It is also proof that the realist novel is alive and kicking, and can keep at least some of us obsessively turning the page."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Set in the politically-corrupt Bombay, India during the 1990's FAMILY MATTERS centers on familial love and obligation of a multigenerational Parsi family. After 79-year-old Nariman Vakeel, suffering from Parkinson's Disease, falls and breaks his ankle his grown children are left to care for him, often reluctantly. His step children Coomy and Jal find the job too much to handle so they transfer the responsibilities to their youngest sister, Roxanne and her family. During the months of Nariman's recovery his family is challenged both physically and financially as they come to terms with the deterioration of their father. Meanwhile, Nariman relives his prohibited love affair with Lucy which has left his family altered forever.Similar to his previous novels, Mistry creates three-dimensional characters in unforgettable situations. However, his depth of plot revealed in A FINE BALANCE is absent in FAMILY MATTERS.Regardless, I found the theme of siblings caring for elders displayed in this book relevant across national boundaries. FAMILY MATTERS is an honest portrayal of how one family is affected by the illness of an elder and how much each party is affected."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Rohinton Mistry is quite simply the best writer out there right now. I have read this book and \\"A Fine Balance\\" and have derived more pleasure, sorrow, and enjoyment from his writing than from any other author. His books show humanity at its finest and at its worst. Do yourself a favor and read his books, because there is a reason he is always nominated for awards.... HE IS THE BEST!!! Can't wait for the next one... will it take another 7 years? I hope not!"},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"If you read A Fine Balance, and enjoyed it (as I did), you'll likely enjoy Family Matters as well; the two have much in common. Both follow Parsis in contemporary India through circumstances that are both believable and fascinating, familiar yet unusual. Mistry clearly has a gift for unpretentious storytelling, and his characters come alive; at the end of both books you will likely find yourself feeling as though the characters were real people whom you wish you could look in on now and then. The author does have a tendency to introduce catastrophy into his characters' lives. Although we can certainly imagine such events occurring -- it requires no great suspension of disbelief -- the reader may find him/herself wondering whether it is really necessary to drop bombshells in every novel to create dramatic tension. But this is a quibble -- Mistry is a very fine writer."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"In this latest masterpiece from one of the greatest authors of our times, Mr mistry narrates the story of a middle class family. And believe me coming from India, and having lived in Bombay for a very long period of time, the description of the flat and its neighbours are so real.... can it ever get more real than this.As I read the book i felt thankful for having all that i have in life,. cos the family in this books is just one example of millions and millions of families who live in this great city called Bombay or mumbai. And its only a great author like mistry who can give such detailed nitty gritties of life.Life is Bombay is a challenge and thats what this book is all about."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Mistry has mastered the art of describing human interactions so that every reader can surely identify with them. The father is a totally sympathetic character who is faced with the selfishness of a step-daughter, the weakness of a step-son and the generosity of a daughter who is challenged by trying to provide for her nuclear family at the same time she ministers to him. This book is unlike &quot;Fine Balance&quot; in that it doesn't directly address political situations that make difficult lives even more so. The reader is left to draw that assumption from such occurences as the attempt to migrate to Canada. Mistry is a highly proficient writer with an undeniable penchant for drawing his readers into the lives, hearts and motivations of his characters. Once again, Mr. Mistry, bravo."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Family Matters establishes Rohinton Mistry as a skilled storyteller. It is hugely entertaining and inspirational at the same time. Like all his other books, Family Matters is based on a very simple premise; a family forced on the responsibility of caring for an aged parent.Mr. Mistry is able to so vividly bring alive his characters and the city of Bombay it is hard to believe that he has been based in Canada for some twenty-over years. His stories capture the very essence of India, its people and its culture. Yet, the themes are universal - sibling rivalry, parent-child relationships, challenges in the workplace, friendships, poverty, religion and politics. Every life has a story to tell, and Mr Mistry brings home that point so beautifully in his book. Seemingly everyday people we meet on the street each leads a life wrought full of emotions, rewards and challenges. It examines the way we each thrive, succumb and adapt to our environment.I disagree with the other reviewers that they found it ridiculous for the characters of Jal and Coomy to destroy the ceiling so that they will have an excuse to keep their father away. It is precisely these quirky little elements that seem so ridiculous that it is hard to believe that they are NOT true! It is perhaps that very factor which made Seinfeld one of the most successful sitcoms on TV in the 90's.The only slight flaw I found in this book was his description of Daisy, the neighbour when she was first introduced. It felt a little jarring to me and did not seem to \`flow' well with the story and the development of her character in the latter parts of the book. I believe that Mr. Mistry tries to make Daisy out to be a sensuous woman yet, unconscious of her sex appeal and also to have her be a possible love-interest for one of the other characters later in the book. But he didn't have to make her play the violin naked!In weaving his stories, Mr. Mistry uses prose that is so reflective of his characters - common vocabulary that will make this book an easy and entertaining read for even a non-avid reader. Yet, by doing so, Mr. Mistry shows that he needs none of the purple prose so prevalent in some literary works to illustrate the skill of a prolific writer. Bravo Mr. Mistry! I look forward to your next book."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Family Matters is a must read. I read this and later read Life of Pi by Yann Martel. Both are fine books no doubt and perhaps its not a good idea to even compare these books since they belong to different genres. But I must confess I was left wondering how the judges picked Martel over Mistry considering that there is such a strong human element in this book, an uplifting yet realistic theme and a deft handling of the delicate social and political issues that prevail in India - just the elements that characterise the typical Booker.Mistry is a master at letting characters develop simply by allowing them to converse on his pages. He lapses only rarely into the third person narrative style to comment about his characters and when he does, he does with tremendous effect.The portions about Yezad's prayers at the fire temple are so life like that months later, I still have a picture of it in my mind and can almost smell the incense. It will take someone who has lived a long time in India to appreciate the minute details that he records about Indian life - as I read it, I found my attention being drawn to several things that I have seen but never observed. Mistry makes you see just how much magic a great writer can weave out of the mundane details of everyday life.Mistry is in the same league as Salman Rushdie, no I will dare say he is better, since I can hide behind my monitor and avoid the glare from under all those raised eyebrows."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Where do I begin? Mistry's prose is smooth, elegant, yet unpretentious; his characters are well-developed, interesting, and highly sympathetic; his sense of pacing is outstanding (a reader need only hop on at the beginning of his book and allow herself to be carried away); finally, the plot of this book is simple, direct. Unlike \\"A Fine Balance,\\" \\"Family Matters\\" has a distinctly limited scope--the central characters are few, and all the action is limited to a narrow area in space and time. Yet what \\"Family Matters\\" lacks in grand sweep it makes up for in its engaging intimacy. But ultimately, this books makes one realize that the vistas of such grand sweep DO exist within a family's life, and even within one ordinary individual's life.This book is often sad, but in a melancholy, bittersweet way. I highly recommend it, along with \\"A Fine Balance.\\""},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"This is an awesome book,written with great flair and passion.It paints a beautiful picture of bombay and it gave me many insightful viewpoints.However,as much as I liked the book,the ending was very disappointing.What was Rohinton trying to tell us?That the events that had happened triggered Yezda to become an obsessive prayer?That it's all family matters?I think it makes no sense.I finished the book with many unanswered questions.A great plot,but a very disappointing ending."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Like many of his works, Mistry paints a picture of an \\"ordinary\\" Parsi character, interacting with the diversity of people that is Bombay, dealing with aging and Parkinson's, and his own personal history. The photo on the cover is especially poignant. Ironically, it's a photo by acclaimed screenwriter Sooni Taraporevala; the same photo used on her beautiful coffee table book on Parsi Zoroastrians, PARSIS: THE ZOROASTRIANS OF INDIA- A PHOTOGRAPHIC JOURNEY. Clearly, Mistry was onto something when he used this photo for his book (he's said to have personally picked it) to create a visual image of his story inside."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Rohinton Mistry is well on his way to receiving a major literary award. Shunning postmodern experimental deconstructionalism, political correctness, and all the modern shibboleths that litter the cultural landscape, Mistry has seen fit to write straight from the heart in a voice that creates verisimilitude with reality. His characters are alive, his choices of details are correct, his moral dilemmas are true, and he brings us from the personal to the political, from the individual to a whole social, economic, and living world. He gives us a small situation, a family in conflict, a once vital man now struggling with illness, and he shows us all the connections to the past, to youth, to loss, to a struggle for redemption. His themes are those of great nineteenth-century novelists, of Tolstoy and Proust, and these themes live in today's world as well. Why have so many writers abandoned them for an easier self-indulgence of their egos? Because it's so much harder to be an artist, to write well, to tell a story that carries universal meaning, and it takes great courage to stand on one's principles, to take a risk and perhaps appear out of fashion.Mistry is in the tradition of Turgenev, Chekhov, and Tolstoy. But he is his own voice and brings something unique to us. He brings Bombay, decrepit in its current state, but with a rich past that now is only remembered in photographs treasured by those who still care, although they too are a dying breed. He brings a family to us, replete with economic struggles, childhood struggles, marital struggles, political struggles, and spiritual struggles, but Mistry's talent is to take us to a far higher level, a universal level where we can see ourselves very clearly.That is the talent of a true artist, one whom you shouldn't miss.I read that Mistry canceled his book tour to the U.S. because he was constantly being harassed at airports due to his \\"foreign\\" appearance. What a shame."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"This book provides a fascinating look into the lives of middle-class Parsis living in Bombay. It's also about old age, and about the difficulties a family has in taking care of an old man (Nariman) with a broken ankle suffering from Parkinson's. The book does not hold back on the details of Nariman's illness. It's also about religion in India and the narrow mindedness of certain sects. It's a difficult book, not for the squeamish, particularly at the beginning and in discussing the illness of Nariman.I wouldn't call it a literary masterpiece, and I had issues with some of the random events towards the end of the book (I won't go into details for fear of spoilers). I felt it trailed off the final third of the book as the author tried to bring everything to a close and distanced himself from the writing. But you feel very close to the family by the end - it's very engaging and interesting to read. You also get to learn all about Zoroastrianism (which was all new to me), which is a fascinating religion."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"A touching look at family relations and the effect of our choices on the ones closest to us. Straddling cultural boundries the author makes us realize that parents and children have the same motivations and heartbreaks the world over."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Once again, Rohinton Mistry turns his keen analytical eye on modern India. Nariman Vakeel, a seventy-nine year old man who suffers from Parkinson's disease, breaks his ankle. As the members of his family shift to cope with his incapacitation, their interrelationships and balance of power teeter, totter and threaten to collapse. The challenges mount and each family member must face his or her own demons. As in A Fine Balance, government and societal corruption play a large role in the progression of the story. But this is not another A Fine Balance. Mistry has introduced a whole new cast of characters and array of issues for thought. In short, Mistry has crafted another story and more characters that grab you and refuse to let you go."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Family matters is a wonderful book - from insight into India culture to the trials of growing older. The portrayal of a family and the manner in which they handle (or midhandle) family obligations, gives us an intimate connection to all that happens in this book. Mistry's prose draws us in and holds us in fascination as he takes us through the simpilicty and intricacies of the three generations of a family. A masterpiece on the human condition, a must read for anyone interested in deepening their understanding of the &quot;human condition&quot;."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"I had been waiting to read this book for months, and was excited when it came out in paperback. &quot;A Fine Balance&quot; singlehandedly made Mistry one of my favorite authors of all time. But I came away from this book slightly disappointed.While Mistry in &quot;A Fine Balance&quot; created vivid, wonderful, and bizarre characters a la Charles Dickens, here the characters seem one-dimensional and stilted. There is not a lot of change and growth here, so much so that at the end of the book I was left wondering what the point of the whole novel was. The title is a giveaway to the theme, but the characters never did live up to it. Family, in the end, didn't matter anymore than in the beginning. Also, the physical descriptions of the bedridden father were less than pleasing to visualize. Sometimes they made me downright queasy. While making the book less attractive, it did have the effect of reiterating just how difficult of a position the characters who had to take care of him were. Still, I could have done without the gross-out factor. Finally, I am not familiar with Indian religions, and they are gone into in some detail in this book, which made me quite confused. A basic grasp of some Indian terms would be extremely useful here.There were parts of this book that made it worth while. Mistry is at his best when he writes about tragedy, and this book certainly has its share. There are some memorable characters, I only wish they would have been developed more thoroughly. But the book still lacks the raw emotion so evident in &quot;A Fine Balance.&quot;Bottom Line: If you are looking to read Mistry, read &quot;A Fine Balance.&quot; While &quot;Family Matters&quot; will satisfy Mistry fans, I doubt it will succeed in creating new ones."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"This review is based on the Audio bookThis was the first time I had heard the story written by Rohinton Mistry and WoW!!. I am impressed with his style of story telling. It is filled with rich prose and poetry. Though the story starts out slow, it slowly picks up pace and grips you as you get absorbed within the story. The family characters feel so real that they touch your heart and feel like your own family. I was touched everytime anything happy or sad events struck Jehangir, Nariman, Yezad, Jaal, Roxana and the rest. At various points in the story it made me look back at my own family and think how interesting and meaningful all the relationships are. Family matters ....It absolutely matters.The narration is equally done well with the absolutely marvelous voice of Martin Jarvis.This is a story about Parsi families and tradition. It has also wonderful description of Bombay lifestyle and the people who dwell this city. Born and brought up in Bombay, the story feels close to heart. I love it!The only thing I had wished was a happier ending to this wonderful story."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Very well written in simple language. Having read Fine Balance I was searching for resemblances, can't find any. Even though set in the midst of a political turmoil, I think the novel is more about the people. This I think is not a story about the Hindu Muslim riots or about the Shivsainiks. This is about average people who are trying to make a living and their ambitions. The characters are aIl someone I can relate to. I was agonizing and depressed as I read through this."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Mistry plunges us into the lives of members of an extended (and blended) modern Indian family. They could be an Italian or a Chinese family, though, for the problems they face are universal. How, and who, to care for an aging parent. Marital and money stresses. Sibling rivalry. Love in all its forms.What is so remarkable about Mistry as a writer, is his ability to draw your sympathy to one character, then, as he writes from another character's point of view, your sympathy changes. He writes brilliantly in the mind of the old man, the equally well writes in the minds of the two young boys, and everyone in between, presenting a slice of modern life with much pathos. He is just an amazing writer."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Where do I begin?

In Family Matters, Mistry follows a Parsi extended family and their struggles with caring for a disabled father, seeking to make ends meet in modern-day Bombay. In the course of the book's events, we see flashbacks into the father's troubled life and how it shaped the current situation. This engaging family drama isn't quite as wrenching or tragic as A Fine Balance, but it resonates deeply.Although I would have liked to get to know a few of the characters better, many of them are well-developed, fascinating people, motivated the frustrations and fears and angers that resonate with all of us. The patriarch is a kind, well-intentioned man who has made all kinds of mistakes; his son-in-law loves his family but constantly loses his temper at them. These characters feel real, and I wish I knew what happened to them \\"after the novel,\\" always a signal to me that an author has successfully touched me emotionally. (I remember feeling that way about Tom Joad at the end of The Grapes of Wrath.)In the course of this fine novel, Mistry succeeded in angering me, frustrating me, and comforting me. The book didn't draw me in quite as well as A Fine Balance, but the journey was also a little bit less painful."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Holding this book is like holding a human heart in your hand.You can almost feel it living, breathing. You will most certainly feel protective over it, as if it were something valuable to life or to continual survival. Now, what kind of book would inspire such reverence?Only the kind from writers who' ve succeeded in tackling the big issues (Life, Love, Destiny, Death) with this much wisdom, humour and compassion.Yet for all of his depth, Rohinton Mistry writes in amazingly simple, straightforward prose so, a child of twelve stumbling on this book could easily become an accidental fan.But pretty quickly, you'd see what an incisive writer the guy is - how else would he have recognized the truth of things, if there weren't also an incisive mind to him? And truth when it comes, is a shining blade wrapped in the softest velvet."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Rohinton Mistry posits that even in a society in which the government is corrupt and the poverty level in inhumane, small decencies still exist - decencies that promote humor, compassion, and a bittersweet degree of compassion and tenderness.Family Matters is set in Bombay in the 90s. The deterioration of the city is paralleled by the physical condition of an elderly professor with Parkinson's disease. Set against the horrors of overcrowding, family secrets, tensions between the various family members, Mistry fully explores the tightrope walk that constitutes just getting through life for most people in the world - yet he does so with humor, tenderness, and a haunting feeling of love."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Rohinton Mistry's novel has at its heart a very important issue -what when elders are incapacitated and take to bed ? Who cares for them and how? In the course of this,Mistry provides profound insights into human nature and its capacity to deal with exigencies, which as we see in the novel is quite different for each individual . Roxanna's fortitude for example is quite exempelary while Jal though a nice person , feels unable to rise up to the demands of caring for a sick person, and Yezad takes refuge in religion.The canvas cannot be considered to be broad as the entire action unfolds in two flats of suburban Mumbai but the drama of human predicament enacted therein has a universal reach. The loneliness of old age compounded by total incapacity leads Nariman to meander endlessly in the corridors of memories and we come to know of his doomed affair with a non Parsi and an equally doomed marraige with a Parsi girl of his parents' choice entirely through his ramblings . At the same time Yezad and his boss are struggling with Shiv Sena fanatics and their inconsequential demands regarding petty issues . The Parsi sectarianism which is woven intricately into the plot has been cleverely juxtaposed with Hindu fanaticism , implying that intolerence is not exclusive to a particular community . In condemning one Mistry condemns both.It cannot be denied that a sense of loss pervades the novel; a loss which is not merely material ,but goes far beyond and does not even spare memories, and emotions that had once been .Certainly there is hope and that comes in the form of Jehangir and Murad . If the next generation is as sensitive and caring as these two children ,there is always scope to rejoice and reaffirm our belief in the intrinsic goodness of human nature ."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Rohinton Mistry has no equal in writing stories with meaning. Though I am moved greatly by stories from Nicholas Sparks (The Notebook) and Kirk Martin (Shade of the Maple, The Gravel Drive), Mistry writes on a different plane. An exquisite novel to savor."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"A very enjoyable book, full of irony, humor, and social commentary. It offers a picture of middle class life in contemporary India, commentary on the state of religious and ethnic relations there, and the stories of several interesting and well drawn characters. Although it deals with mundane people in rather ordinary circumstances, there were several parts of the book that made my heart race. It's a testament to the author's skill that he can make ordinary moments extraordinary (and it's striking that none of the most overtly dramatic moments are told in the present tense or fleshed out very much). Nonetheless, in my view, the book falls short of Mistry's spectacular A Fine Balance. It just doesn't have that book's scope or impact."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"I LOVE Rohinton Mistry, ever since picking up A Fine Balance on an overseas trip. That novel, along with this one, gave me an insightful glimpse into the everyday workings of Indian people, families, and culture. Having spent two months in India, I was even more intrigued and enchanted.Mistry writes with an eloquence that's unrivaled by most authors today. His prose is simple yet powerful in its delivery, and I find his character development to be among the best out there.When I read this book, I was completely swept up into the lives of the people about whom he writes. Forget that there's hardly any action going on; I was completely enthralled and felt like these families were part of my own.I didn't want this book to end, and wish there were more modern-day writers attempting to do what Mistry has accomplished."},{"Title":"Family Matters","review":"Mistry is a brilliant writer. I have not read any other writing whose whole is as much better than the sum of its parts as Mistry's. His words are so powerful they are absent, and you're left wowed by the sheer beauty of his storytelling and characters. He epitomizes Bombay: the multitude of colorful experiences in a single day in Bombay translate into a multitude of emotions on a single page in Mistry's books. His books are riotous, and as far from the painful and meticulous construction of say an Arundhati Roy as you can get.Family Matters is the third book of his I've read after \\"A Fine Balance\\" and \\"Such a Long Journey\\". I'd put \\"Journey\\" at the top, followed closely by \\"Balance\\", followed closely by \\"Matters\\". The only reasons \\"Matters\\" lags in my opinion is because of the sporadic current-affairs conversations between Yezad and Rane/Kapur which distract from the story (politics is always part of his stories, but here it is not very seamlessly woven in), and his put-down of Germaine Greer's criticism of \\"Balance\\" during one such conversation. He is of course right about Greer, who is nothing but an obtuse and puerile snob, but this is not a medium to air his personal differences. Even so, these are really minor nitpickings... it is still an incredible piece of work.

Dency Kane has a keen eye and a remarkable sense of aesthetics. While one may first think of cool, lush green gardens as the basis of sanctuary, Dency shows how the vibrancy of a tulip or a bird-of-paradise flower-seen up close-can can induce a sense of tranquility or sanctuary as well as the full-blown garden. Her photogrqaphy, juxtaposed with the lyrical text, invites us to explore and celebrate the microcosm that surrounds us.

Yet this is no Grace Metalious soap opera; Western readers will instead find that &quot;Midaq Alley&quot; calls to mind the style of Christopher Isherwood, the plotting of Armistead Maupin, and the characters of Rohinton Mistry. And Trevor La Gassick's superb translation make this a surprisingly fluent, elegant, and humorous yarn.Although filmed in 1995 as &quot;El Callej&oacute;n de los milagros,&quot; a critically acclaimed Mexican film starring Selma Hayek, this novel has never quite reached the audience it deserves. Like &quot;Tales of the City,&quot; &quot;Midaq Alley&quot; follows the interlinking stories of several characters who share little more than aspirations to affluence, romantic entanglements--and an address. The reader is introduced to more than a dozen characters, but the novel spotlights three: the cafe owner Kirsha, a married man who flirts with young men in front of discomfited patrons, neighbors, and friends (not to mention his incensed wife); the fickle, young, beautiful Hamida, who flits from man to man in search of wealth and comfort; and Abbas, who joins the British armed forces to earn enough money to win over Hamida.Yet other eccentrics from the alley are just as memorable: the horrid Zaita, who serves as tyrant over the local beggars he has &quot;fashioned&quot; by unusual means (and whose demeanor and methods are astonishingly similar to Mr. Beggarmaster from Mistry's &quot;A Fine Balance,&quot; written 50 years later); Mrs. Saniya Afifi, a widow who undergoes cut-rate cosmetic dentistry to win over a new husband--and then is horrified by the hush-hush source of her new dentures; and the suave, slick, duplicitous Ibrahim Faraj, a stranger to the alley who spirits Hamida away from her home into a world of extravagance and debauchery she never imagined possible.In the background is World War II, which ironically presents inhabitants of the alleys with the prospect of advancement in the &quot;outside&quot; world--an opportunity that proves both short-lived and elusive. Scratch below the surface, and you'll find a morality tale about the ultimate displeasure that materialism brings to those who worship it. Yet Mahfouz avoids didacticism when presenting his themes, opting instead for a light-hearted objectivity that brings the residents of Midaq Alley to life."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"As a Senior in High School I have read my fair share of novels. The beginning of the novel was a little confusing, but after the first few chapters it became a captivating book based on many people's lives in an alley in Cairo. I have never before read a novel that was written like this one was. It jumps from story to story of the diffent characters, where at first they seem to have nothing to do with any other, but when you reach the end you understand how the stories intertwine. Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I was fascinated by the streets of Cairo from Mahfouz's writing style and descriptions. It makes me want to read more of Mahfouz's works. Also I want to learn more about Cairo's &quot;alleys&quot;. It is a great and fascinating book to read."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"This novel is the perfect distillation of Mafouz' brilliance as a writer. A slice-of-life in Midaq Alley, the characters are carefully wrought and distinct, complete with idiosyncrasies. From Uum Hamida, who brokers a marriage for the well-heeled Mrs. Saniya Afify, to Zaitas the cripple-maker, each has a role in the tapestry of life as lived in the alley.Like the Cairo Trilogy, Mafouz creates his own rhythm and style while adapting the novel format, one not commonly found in Arabic literature when he began writing novels. His plot revolves around the denizens of Midaq Alley and their every day yearnings for happiness, love and prosperity. Whether you are familiar with this author, or this is your first Mafouz novel, it is an excellent example of the unique talent that allows the reader an intimate view of the characters common to this man's vast insight into humanity."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"I had to read this for a world literature class in college and loved it so much, I bought ALL of Mahfouz's books! He is amazing and this book is a great story. I grew up in the Middle East and this book read like some of the Arabic soap operas on TV! Mahfouz is a wonderful story teller and his books provide rich cultural insight into the lives of men and women in Egypt."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"This book is among the best by Mahfouz, one of the world's best authors. There is too much lost in translation, but with just a basic understanding of the Middle East and of Mahfouz, I believe that can be overcome.The main character of this book is really the alley itself. Mahfouz brings togther its inhabitants and weaves an involving tale of love, hope, faith and the effects of Western imperialism. But in the end, life in the alley just goes on, and in this Mahfouz affirms the beauty of life as we live it every day."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"This book was an excellent and not-too-difficult read. I say not too difficult because I read the entire thing on my morning and evening commute over two weeks. The narration really brings the reader into Midaq Alley, to a point where one feels like they too are peering at every character through window shades and evesdropping on conversations in the cafe. The plight of the main female character is reminiscent of Sister Carrie. Like Carrie, she is a character that one can neither like nor detest. I enjoyed this book and I look forward to reading more of Mahfouz's work."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"Naguib Mahfouz's Midaq Alley is a fictional novel which focuses on the lives of the inhabitants of a neighborhood alley in the heart of Cairo during World War II. Told in a soap opera fashion, Mahfouz introduces the readers to nearly 12 main characters with 7 side characters. With so many characters present, it is easily noticeable that the main literary element Mahfouz employs in Midaq Alley is characterization; and thus all of the characters are crucial to the story's plot.The main conflict within the story lies in between a struggle between those who dream of leaving the alley for a \\"more prosperous life\\" and those who are more than content with staying in the alley forever. This is highlighted between Hamida's desire to become rich and powerful and Abbas' desire to marry Hamida. Abbas, who is a poor barber in the alley, wishes to court Hamida; however, she is not interested until he decides to go work for the British Army just to please her, which was very lucrative during World War II. However, Hamida would not remain content for long as her desire for power was too great, this desire and greed would take Hamida down a path that would not only bare consequences for her, but also for those who loved and cared for her. A side struggle which followed along this same motif was between that of Kirsha, the pedophiliac caf&eacute; owner, and his son, Hussein Kirsha. Hussein Kirsha decides to leave his house because of his immense disgust towards the alley in which his father denounces him. Hussein Kirsha believes that the British Army will forever lucratively support him; however, World War II will soon come to an end and the alley beckons.However, Midaq Alley does not just focus on this motif with many side stories constantly emerging throughout the novel. From Salim Alwan, the rich business man who believes that his health will forever last him, to Zaita, the scum who controls the beggars of the Hussein district in Cairo and helps people become crippled, to Dr. Booshy, the dentist who has no real license and suspiciously attains gold dentures at low prices. In the end, Mahfouz ingeniously ties all the stories together for a heart-racing climax. A great work, one that should be in the library of all Mahfouz fans, and those who aren't."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"Having read the other reviews, just wanted to add a mention of Mahfouz's style as one of a unusual music, which may be strenuous to some but is an enchantment if you get into it. Bravo to the translator !"},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"Regardless of the poor translation (the one I read by Trevor Le Gassick) this was still immensely enjoyable, the characters shone through and the scene descriptions are so rich I felt like I was there, it was just written (or translated) in such a stilted way that it felt like English was definitely not the narrator's first language. I had previously read the Cairo trilogy, the story of several generations of a family, Midaq Alley is quite different, a soap opera about the people of the alley set over a short period of time, fast paced and very funny at times despite the bleak lives of the characters.The setting is WWII, a generally prosperous time for the people in this story, some content with life in the alley, and others more ambitious dreaming of nothing but escape. Strong characters with interconnected stories draw the reader into their lives - Kirsha the cafe owner with young male lovers, Hamida who is lured into prostitution, fat Uncle Kamil and his sweet shop, Abbas the barber who joins the army just for money to win a bride, Zaita the beggar and grave robber who performs surgery for a fee to create other beggars, Mrs. Saniya Afifi who will pay anything to a marriage broker to get herself a young husband, and several others with stories of their own to tell.I enjoy books that expose me to totally different cultures and ways human beings adapt to what life throws at them. Midaq Alley was a journey to another time and the other side of the world."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"Readers will sense the \\"darkness\\" that is \\"enclosed like a trap\\" as they turn the pages of Midaq Alley. Mahfouz exploits his characters through vivid descriptions. For instance, Uncle Kamil's \\"legs\\" that are \\"like tree trunks\\" and \\"his behind\\" is \\"rounded like the dome of a mosque\\" not only puts a physical image to the man, but posits him into the Muslim culture. Mahfouz is clever in his depiction of Midaq Alley, a small part of Old Cairo. He juxtaposes the reality of the British occupation in the bigger picture while focusing on the narrative of simple, middle-class Egyptians who struggle for their identity and hope for survival. Hamida desperately tries to escape her cage, claiming that \\"everyone in this alley is half dead;\\" however, she is met with a similar fate when she emerges into the outside world, entrapped into a prison of prostitution. Her \\"yearning for power centered on her love for money\\" and she pays the ultimate price with her dignity in \\"the streets of illicit love.\\" The real genius of Naguib Mahfouz is evident in this novel; it invites the reader into a culture that depicts a social reality of mid 20th century Cairo."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"This book is as satisfying as William Faulkner, Robert Penn Warren, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Herman Melville, Milan Kundera, and so on. A friend very nonchalantly passed a copy along to me. You must read this book if you love great literature."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"In the interests of full disclosure, I should start out by saying that I don't know a thing about the culture or about literary standards of excellence in this author's society. However, &quot;Midaq Alley&quot;, while a pleasant read, wasn't anything to write home about. The characters are lively and the setting fascinating but the author never delves deeply enough into the life of any individual to make you feel as though you fully understand them. The style may have lost something in translation, but it lacked the richness of language and description that I expected to find from an internationally-recognized author.Not bad, but altogether a little disappointing."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"This weekend I saw an adaptation of this book in a movie starring Salma Hayek. From the reviews I have read here, it is very similar, but takes place in Mexico. I was spellbound by the movie, and will therefore try to get the book."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"If I were to choose a book that I could not live without, it would certianly not be this one. I think out of all the books that I read, this must be the most boring one. The main character in this book is Hamida, but this book is composed of many characters who have their own little stories within this book. And she represents Egypt in World War 1. She was tricked into becoming a prostitute for money, makeup, and fancy clothes. If you think about it, Egypt was given the illusion of becoming world power if it were to join the war. When really, all Egypt learned were ... policies. Personally, I did not enjoy this book at all."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"When I take a look at the list of the translated works of Mahfouz from Arabic to English I fell petty. This man, being one of the best (if not the best) Arabic novelists, is not really well appreciated in the West. I am not trying to imply anything here. It just so happens that Maxim Gorky, the greatest Russian Novelist, is also ignored. You cannot, for example, find the complete collection of his short stories translated to English, which really deprives so many readers from his capturing style.When you view the ratings the readers had given to Mahfouz's works, you would find that they have really enjoyed his singular style. It is unique, as a matter of fact. He was actually affected by the Western and Russian giants in his writing style.This story \\"Midaq Alley,\\" with midaq meaning an object being hit, just like an anvil, was written after 6 other literary works. The first one was a collection of fine short stories, and for a starter in literature, I might say they have some elements of genius. Then he went to write three historical novels, evidently affected by Sir Walter Scott, situated in old Egypt. I did not like those three, even though the language (in Arabic) was excellent. Then he started his real career with \\"The New Cairo,\\" which is the name of a quarter in Cairo, followed by \\"Khan Al-Khalili,\\" both being excellent reads.I was disappointed, thus, by seeing this story. It is not all that bad, but I did not see the use of much of the occurrences and the plot could have been reduced to a short story. Do not take me wrong, I enjoyed it after all, but when I compare it to \\"The New Cairo\\" and the \\"Khan Al-Khalili\\" I cannot but give it 3 stars.The story speaks about the life styles of people living in a popular quarter called \\"Al-Midaq Alley,\\" which is a little bigger than an alley itself. So many characters appear in the plot, and Mahfouz has done a great job describing their lives and feelings. The story is actually centered about a girl who is about to leave the alley and start a business in \\"prostitution.\\" She has a lover, and the story is mainly accounting the suffering of her negligence of him and her suffering from poverty.Mahfouz is a popular writer and would always give you the truth, whole truth, and nothing but the truth. He describes in this novel the true feelings of a boys loving caf&eacute; master, an old spinster trying to hunt a husband, and a beggar providing a dentist with golden teeth.If you want to know something about Egypt of the 1940's (like I did), you are more than welcome to read this novel, which, I guarantee, will not bore you."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"Midaq Alley is a 1947 novel by the voluminous Nobel-prize winning Egyptian author Naguib Mahfouz (translated into English in 1966, made into a paperback in 1992 and supposedly the book that won him the Nobel Prize in 1988). I've had a couple of volumes of Mahfouz's work on my shelves but had yet to read them. But the \\"Arab Spring\\" sweeping the Middle East finally tipped my hand to see what the insights from a novelist could tell me about that part of the world. I already knew from the introduction by the translator, Trevor Le Gassick, that novels are not a traditional art form in the Arab world. However, the 20th century changed all that, and Mahfouz was an early part of a larger novelistic movement among Arab and Muslim writers.Commentators on life in the Mid East often talk about what the \\"Arab Street\\" is thinking. This particular work by Mahfouz is literally framed around the Arab Street of its title. It is a traditional alley in a old, poor area of Cairo, where the streets are narrow and close, but it contain whole worlds within it, with, as it's described by Mahfouz, many residents never having left their neighborhood of the alley and being generally ignorant of the world beyond. But even at this early date, the outside world is impinging into this closed society. The novel takes place in World War II while Egypt was under British rule and two of the main characters leave the neighborhood to work for the British. Much sentiment is expressed in favor of Hitler, or at least that he will make the war go on indefinitely and so provide work for Egyptians. One character goes off to Mecca and others are seduced by the vices that the British bring--alcohol and prostitution.It is written in a close third-person POV with many--35--short chapters. The chapters are mostly restricted to one POV and many are self contained enough to read like short stories. Mahfouz does, however, occasionally break out of the one-person POV. For instance, on p. 213: \\"Their faces lit up at the welcome and the courtesies exchanged, their hearts concealing what each really felt.\\"One does get a sense of what life is like in a very conservative, religious society. Yet universal themes are expressed and people are motivated by the same things as elsewhere: jealousy, envy, the desire for security, status, money and so on. Still, the characters rely heavily on prevailing religious attitudes, using many religious statements. \\"If God wills it\\" being one that is often repeated. It is often tied to a sense of fatalism: \\"There is no power or strength except in God.\\" (p. 235)Mahfouz may be writing about a traditional society, but he takes many chances as a writer. He delves into the insides of unreliable characters, indeed, it might be true to say that all of his characters are unreliable. We see their reasoning and we see how often it goes wrong. This is especially true with the character of Hamida, a beautiful young woman who had been adopted as an orphaned child and who over the course of the novel is seduced into prostitution. Before this happens, we see her welcome each new love interest while throwing off the previous interest without a qualm and while justifying her own ends. She also juggles competing passions. \\"She could feel her temper rising, and she longed to dig her fingernails into something, into his neck, for example.\\" (p. 157)Her seduction by the pimp and her transformation come across as completely believable and consistent with her detached and unfeeling nature--despite living in such a conservative society. I can also understand why fundamentalists made an attempt at Mahfouz's life--he brings an unsparing eye to the realities he sees around him.There's a lot of anger in these characters and they often switch back and forth between anger and religious feeling--in this, I suppose, they do provide insight into the human condition; certainly, they are no different from Western characters in this. But at the same time there is something peculiarly Egyptian or Arabic in them--and it's not just the particulars of the surroundings, whether its traditional clothing or activities, such as smoking hashish or water pipes. It's the peculiar logic of a heavily religious people facing modernity. I think I may have to tackle a few more of Mahfouz's works before I get a better handle on exactly what that is though."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"Naguib Mahfouz won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1988, the first writer in Arabic so honored. Before he won the award, I purchased my copy of this book, in 1980, found on one of those old-fashioned, swivel book racks, in a stationary store on Olaya Road, in Riyadh. It was my first book by an Arab author, and I was drawn to this one in particular due to the depiction of Egyptians, so many of whom staffed the shops, and lived above them, on this road. At the time, I found it most insightful and well-done, with a couple of memorable scenes. Re-reading it after 30 years, I am all the more impressed.Mahfouz's novel is a brilliant depiction of lower to lower middle class life in one particular neighborhood in Cairo, called Midaq Alley. It is set during the Second World War, which is a most distant backdrop. The only impact of the war on the residents is the possibility of greatly increasing one's income if one worked for the British. \\"War profiteers\\" in an unlikely way, in an environment in which eating meat is considered a rare luxury.As the novel unfolds, I made comparisons with Carson McCullersThe Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (Oprah's Book Club). Both are stories of a small community of individuals, with the characters incisively and realistically portrayed, and who live at the edge of economic deprivation. It is life before the many distractions of the Internet, TV, Radio et al., when the now famed \\"interconnectivity\\" was accomplished face-to-face, one-on-one. The \\"grand themes\\" of life are only implicit, and subtlety touched upon. Comparisons could also be made with the realistic portrayals of life in England, France and Russia by Dickens, Zola, and Gorky.As with McCullersThe Ballad of the Sad Cafe: and Other Stories, Kirsha's caf&eacute; is the local community center, and it is at a time when the local story teller, much to his dismay, is being replaced by the radio, \\"which all the customers really want.\\" Kirsha's son, Hussain, has gone off to find his fortune with the British, and flaunts his wealth in the neighborhood. His new home even has electricity! The local bakery is run by Husniya. She routinely beats her husband, Jaada. Their tenant, Zaita, is utterly filthy, and lives in an equally filthy small room. He \\"makes\\" beggars and cripples, by deforming those who are healthy, and ask for his services. \\"Sheikh\\" Darwish has turned his back on his middle class existence and now simply wanders, yet people seem to take care of him. Salim Alwan is solidly middle class, runs a business that also profits from the war, has sons who have made the leap into the professional classes, and his own heart becomes a \\"lonely hunter\\" before it fractures. \\"Dr.\\" Booshy is a dentist, with no professional training, who favors extractions. Radwan Hussainy is a sensible and devote Muslim; he often is required to serve as mediator in the neighborhood disputes. Umm Hamida (mother of Hamida) is a marriage broker, who arranges one for 50 year old widow, Mrs. Iffy, with a much younger man. Abbas is a barber, content with his life in the neighborhood, without any driving motivation, until he realizes that he must acquire some, if he is to win the heart of his love, Hamida. Mahfouz brilliantly portrays her cold heart, as she makes the various economic calculations required to leave the poverty of her upbringing, and lead a prosperous life. She meets someone with even a colder heart, Ibrahim Faraj, who is the ultimate corrupter. It is seen as no disgrace for someone from the \\"Alley\\" to go to jail. Mahfouz social themes include pedophilia, hashish addiction, prostitution, the corruption of political life, and even grave robbery, as well as dreams and aspiration, and the dignity of an honorable life. There is a rising crescendo in the dramatic tension of the novel, ending in two chapters that are a perfect juxtaposition of the sublime and the profane, that certainly depicts life in Cairo in particular, but within a universal context. A few reviewers have criticized the novel for being overly \\"melodramatic.\\" Perhaps just a slight bit, but overall, it does seem amazingly realistic, and is an accurate description of the life at the time. There is much that is \\"melodramatic\\" but all too real in American life, as one can deduce from the \\"celebrity culture\\" to the newspapers and magazines in the supermarket checkout line.Trevor Le Gassick has rendered an excellent, readable translation. Perhaps uniquely among translated works, as he indicated in the Introduction, he does not utilize an appendix or footnotes to explain words or concepts that are unique to Egypt or the Islamic world. Instead, he weaves the explanation into the translation, and I think brilliantly. 5-stars, plus."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"Mahfouz is a master storyteller. the characters in the ally come alive in two paragraphs.this is a novel that appeals to everybody as it has many levels. no wonder it is perhaps Mahfouz' most popular.it is local in character but universal in ideas.the ally is a living place with real interesting characters.it is a metaphor for all of Egypt, actually for humanity.the story moves at a fast and exciting pace, yet has depth and meaning. A rare novel that combines all the features of a great classic one."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"Thoreau said that \\"most men lead lives of quiet desperation.\\" This wonderful novel, set in Cairo, Egypt, during WWII, beautifully illustrates that point. Midaq Alley is just what it sounds like, an out of the way alley in a big city where most of the inhabitants are just getting by, or worse. Some accept their fate, accepting it as God's will. Others are very unhappy with their lot in life and are determined to better themselves. Only one of them succeeds, but it is debatable whether the fate of that character, Hamida, whose way out is prostitution, a life style she is at first seduced into but chooses freely, is better than what she left.Midaq Alley has a vibrancy and a sense of community that has all but disappeared in modern urban settings, at least in the US, but probably less so in Egypt. All of its residents know each other and are generally there for each other. All of then live by their wits. One man sells sweets. One is a coffee shop owner and openly homosexual, something I found very surprising in an Islamic society of six and a half decades ago. One woman is a matchmaker. One woman is a landlady. One young man is a barber who goes to work for the British in order to be able to marry the girl he loves, a girl who ultimately proves to be unworthy of him, and is his undoing.One of the reasons fiction is valuable is that it gives us an insight into how societies that we may never otherwise come into contact with function. Midaq Alley is such a book. And, although it is tragic, its ultimate message is that life goes on. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"Made In Hero: The War for SoapMIDAQ ALLEY is a masterpiece of existentialist satire. It has enough greed, lust, envy and delusion to match Jean Paul Sartre's NO EXIT (famous for the line \\"Hell is other people\\"). And this is what makes it such fun.MIDAQ ALLEY works on so many levels that it's easy to be drawn in, yet indecisive about where to settle. The characters share the confusion (maybe even inspire it). After all, that's their role.For starters, they inhabit a crowded strip of a crowded Egyptian city in the midst of the second World War. With an unlikely mix of fondness and derision, this home-sweet-home is dubbed The Alley. It is less than a street, yet no less than a microcosm of the planet.Many humans dwell there. One is a young, humble barber without a trace of ambition. He falls sick with love for a vain young woman who is sick with ambition. Next is the sweetshop owner, the baker's wife, and the wealthy widow--all corpulent. Add the matchmaker, the professional beggar, and the graverobber--all greedy. Not least, there is the businessman, the cripple, and the cafe proprieter--all consumed with lust. There is no shortage of weak men and the shrewish wives who love to pommel them. Tensions are occasionally relieved by the affections of ordinary people for one another, but they are quickly subsumed by layers of resentment and malice--the natural result of people suffocating in close quarters and longing to see the world beyond.On a local level, The Alley is a meager universe yet enriched by its distinctive character and texture. In fact, the place is itself a character--complete with an odor and a pulsing heartbeat. Like many of the cast, The Alley is even portly--threatening to burst at the seams. Moreover, it is a carnival of the bizarre, an invitation to surrender one's sense of reality.The effect is not delight, exactly, although it's hard to say what. In spite of that, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. However, I was more than halfway through it before I realized that I was supposed to be laughing (with us, at us). It's a sad kind of laughter based on recognition--that this is the human lot. But by the time I caught on, it was too late. There was no turning back. Actually, I couldn't wait to turn the pages."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"I have taught this novel many times, and each time I re-read it or teach it, I am amazed at the vividness of the characters, the accuracy of Mahfouz's portrayal of the city of Cairo and the cultural truth at the core of the novel. It is as if every dynamic of Egyptian life has been distilled into this gem of a fictional work. If you only ever read one work by an Arabic language author, this should be the one."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"Midaq Allay is a slice-of-life picture of several months in a small alley in Cairo during World War II. The residents of the alley all have their small dramas, and Mahfouz manages to weave all their stories together to tell an interesting tale of love, lust, greed, selfishness, religious devotion, depravity, and drug addiction. It's an Egyptian soap opera!Mahfouz is an excellent story-teller, and the various characters and their actions come alive and make continued reading a compulsion. Of course, I have no idea if this is a true picture of life in that place and time, or if everything is slightly exaggerated (which seems likely to me).Mahfouz has received the Nobel Prize for Literature, and this is not one of his most acclaimed novels. It is always interesting to perceive how those of another culture think, believe, behave. Plus, Mahfouz tells a darn-good story."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"As World War II rages on (presumably very near, with the North Africa Campaign) the inhabitants of an alley in an old impoverished neighbourhood in Cairo (Egypt was then under semicolonial rule by the British) seems to be living their own peculiar, intertangled lives, detached from the conflict. There is a series of interrelated stories here, the tough guy whose job is to break the bones of those who want to make a living as beggars, the old spinster trying to find a husband, the middle aged guy hitting on a young boy, the men hanging around the cafe all day to trade stories and gossip. But the main story in the book is about Hamima, the pretty, ambitious, somewhat slutty girl of the alley (though this being an Islamic society, presumably also a virgin until the last chapters), who is courted both by a poor guy who is trying to get into the army to escape the alley as well as the old lecherous landlord. Until a seducting pimp comes into the picture. Nobel prize winner Naguib Mahfouz makes here a fine portrayal of the milieu that is called the Arab street.There was a fine movie version of this novel, made in Mexico in the 1990s with Salma Hayek in the role of Hamima. Though Mexico and Egypt seems to be literally worlds apart, the book stories were traslated succesfully into the lower classes of Mexico city."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"Very interesting and different. A good way for a western American to learn about the Middle East during World War II. I also saw the movie made in Mexico trying to simulate the book. It was pretty badly done, but interesting."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"Having spent a year in Cairo during the early 80s, I was recently, belatedly interested to see what this awarded novel has to offer. These interwoven, disparate stories of people living and working on a Cairo neighborhood street give us an unapologetic look at the less-than-saintly motives and methods that lie beneath the thin veneer of civilized culture worn by people everywhere; but these simultaneous stories are decidedly Cairene. If you want a feel-good book, look elsewhere. If you want keen, if somewhat cynical, insight into human nature as it curiously manifests itself in 1940s Egypt, you'll like this book. There seems to be an implied moral lesson, embodied in one of the characters, but not overstated so as to cause our eyes to roll. From the perspective of my own experiences in the same city four decades later, the novel seemed very real indeed."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"Midaq Alley is a look at about a dozen characters living in an alleyway in mid-twentieth century Cairo. The cast of characters includes a barber, a cafe owner, a successful businessman, a beautiful but wild young woman, a holy man, an English teacher, a sweets seller, and many others whose stories intertwine with each other as life in the alley goes through the end of World War II. This is essentially a pessimistic story, with most of the characters coming out of it having lost ground; the fortunate keep what they have, and only one character, the holy man, comes out ahead for his troubles.This story is really a series of vignettes portraying the lives of the alley dwellers over the period of about three months. It is smooth, interesting and well-told. You quickly come to care about the characters and what happens to them and to hope that things will turn out well for them, in spite of warning signs to the contrary. Because the characters are so full of life and interesting, it is possible to follow their adventures with avid interest, although if you let this book sink in too deep it's a depressing experience. Mahfouz is showing off his talents at managing a large cast of characters living under trying circumstances, and he handles it all with apparent ease and high style. If you like Dickens you should like this novel."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"Two years ago, one of my professors from college recommended this book through email after I left school. I started to read it maybe three times since then yet the beginning's convolution lost me. There were too many names, and characters seemed to blend together (ex. mother Umm Hamida and daughter Hamida). In my defense, it wasn't a lack of intelligence--it was that the character's lives were as complex as mine. There was no room for the patience that the book required.When I found that patience this week, I grew as a person--and a reader--more than I could hope. The thoughts and beliefs of the characters are so intimate, so real, that I latched on to their words, actions, feelings . . . with profound empathy . . . hating, loving, rejecting, accepting. As a dialogue, the book speaks to you with maturity.The book challenged me, which is a representation of what it's like to live not just in Midaq Alley, but to live. You cannot run from the hardships of fate, especially within your home or neighborhood. So when the back of the novel purports that it's a soap opera, it's tricking the reader into learning wisdom. :) Today, I feel as if I lived in Midaq Alley. And I've changed for the better."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"Mahfouz is an amazing writer. So it is not surprising that this book is a great story. A brilliant portrayal of Middle eastern and more especially Arab life, Mahfouz succinctly captured in this book the rich and wonderful cultural lives of men and women in Egypt in the first half of the last century. Above all, it tells a story of people in a time when their land is trying to shake off the degrading legacies of colonialism and find a new sense of dignity.A recommended read along with Disciples of Fortune, The day the leader was Killed, The usurper and Other Stories, Triple Agent Double Cross. Mahfouz is my favorite author from North Africa and the Middle East."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"In this novel, Mr Mahfouz chose to show simple characters living in an area similar to that of his own birth. The richly colourful life of these people is carefully drawn and the story crowds with minor charcters depicted with keen perception and great humour. There is Uncle Kamil the sweet seller, Abbas the barber, Kirsha the caf&eacute; owner, \\"Dr\\" Boosh the dentist, Radwan Hussainy the landlord, Sheikh Darwish the former English teacher, Umm Hamida the mariage broker, Salim Alwan the company owner, Husniya and Jaada the bakers, Zaita the cripple maker and Ibrahim Faraj the pimp.We see how they are enticed away from their natural roles by the hopes of material gains chiefly through work with the British Army. The novel examines the problems of behaviour and morality: drug addiction, homosexuality, ambitions and dissatisfactions. Perhaps it is time itself which is the novel's principal character personified by the ageless Alley. The aspirations and tragedies of the inhabitants are witnessed with indifference by Midaq Alley. But in the Alley, as in life itself, there is also a lot of gaiety, colour and excitement to enliven the passing scene."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"Not really a review, I'm sure it's a fine book. The Item is listed on Amazon as being in the English language, but it is in Arabic. Please be aware."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"In a dank back alley of Cairo in the middle of World War II, Uncle Kamil, the bloated and always semi-catatonic sweet-seller pretends to swat flies from his face before he drifts off again. And the sun sets. The cafe just down the street opens, and Midaq alley comes to life, in all of its semi-impoverished glory. Naguib Mahfouz, the only Arab winner of the coveted Nobel Prize in Literature, has brought us here to meet a cast of outre characters and to gasp at their unorthodoxy, to be saddened at their lack of luck, and to envision, finally, the tapestry of their interactions. But he also wants us to think about what it must have been to be poor and Egyptian in a moment of political frustration. His writing lacks subtlety but his themes do not; what results is an involving drama of a back way in Cairo that you probably would not have noticed."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"for something written in the early 1900s, its a charming novel. it gives a great insight on how women can be manipulative, confused, desperate, and yet charming."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"I have to say that Midaq Alley is an interesting, albeit not fabulous read. The characters could use a bit more substance, but overall their motives were described clearly (somewhat). Hamida is really the main character of this novel and almost everyone else in Midaq Alley is connected to her future in one way or another. I consider Midaq Alley to be an interesting book for anyone interested in Middle Eastern womens' rights and struggles."},{"Title":"Midaq Alley","review":"Palace Street was a lot better.Midaq Alley had too many unbelievable paper thin characters and situations...

Initially, the characters seem to be those of television soap operas. Then magically and seamlessly, they become characters of a different state of mind, like a dreamworld. The underlying mystery is thought provoking, especially for those who commit adultery or have multiple sexual partners. The Indian Hodge, mysticism, and spiritual contents of the book gave me feelings similar to those evoked by Carlos Casteneda works. It really surprised me that a native Belgium lady wrote this book. Hilde has a special gift."},{"Title":"Sanctuaries of the Woods","review":"Sanctuaries of the Woods reminds me of a fine textile. At first pleasing to the eye, then upon closer inspection revealing a much more sophisticated interplay between colours, threads and texture. A unique interchange of poetry and prose, I found it to be engaging and thought-provoking and in some ways reminiscent of Paulo Coelho. I look forward to reading more from Ms. Hoefnagels."},{"Title":"The Green River Trail (Trail Drive)","review":"This one is excellent. I felt like the people in the book were my friends. I hope we see more of these people. The book ended to soon. Ralph Compton is one of the best of the western writers. He makes it seem like you have just dropped in for a visit with these folks. The sound effects are excellent and make you feel like you are there. The story covers 4 cowboys that have come out of the gold fields of California to establish a large ranch on the Green River. They are orginally from Texas and they go home to get to buy a herd to take back to the Green River. What happens to them on their ride to the Green River.

Nineteen-year-old Sarah Singer feels betrayed by the man who charmed her into marriage and now pays her scarcely any respect, and defies him to join women's groups and participate in suffrage rallies. Yet when a strike shuts down the town's 300 silk mills, she can no longer keep a tenuous balance between activism and wifely duty - she must choose sides between her Capitalist husband and his dshing Socialist brother, a union leader who is also her best friend's husband. Passion, greed, arrogance, the struggle for equality, romance, and euphoria abound in this immersive saga of the tribulations of yesteryear."},{"Title":"Silk Legacy","review":"Note: This review was originally published at Red Adept Reviews on August 10, 2011.Overall: 5 starsPlot/Storyline: 5 starsGood historical fiction teaches us a bit of history while weaving an interesting story told through the experiences of the story's characters, both real and fictional. The author of Silk Legacy, Richard Brawer, did a bang-up job of taking an event--The Great Silk Strike of 1913--which today is just a footnote of history, and making it come alive.A hundred years ago, the city of Paterson, New Jersey, was the silk-producing capital of the world. More than 300 mills produced vast quantities of silk products from thread to finished fabrics. Workers toiled long hours under wretched conditions for miniscule wages, typical for manufacturing industries of that era. A series of small, poorly-organized strikes failed to bring about change, which ultimately led to the massive strike in 1913. Silk Legacy was an account of the events leading up to that strike and the five months of the strike itself. During the early 20th century, the small local craft and trade unions were giving way to national organizations like the American Federation of Labor (AFL). During the strike, both the AFL and the IWW (International Workers of the World) fought for control of the striking workers. Much of the story involved the bitter clash between the AFL, which aimed to get better working conditions and better pay, and the IWW, which advocated a revolution where the workers would seize the factories and get rid of the bosses and owners (i.e., the Marxist Utopia - if you're read Animal Farm or Atlas Shrugged, you know how that turned out).That's the historical backdrop the story was played out against. The characters included both real and fictional figures. The primary fictional characters were the Bressler family. The relationships between the three Bressler brothers and their families, and their involvement with the strike made for an absorbing page-turner of a novel.Note: I looked up some of the people and events of the 1913 Paterson strike. As obscure as the event is to us today--almost a hundred years later--there's a lot of information online, including photographs of many historical figures and places in the book. Seeing these photos really made the story come alive. While I was reading Silk Legacy, I kept thinking of the similarities to Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, so I wasn't too surprised when Upton Sinclair made a cameo appearance in the story!Characters: 5 starsThe events of the story were told through the eyes of the Bressler family, who, like many of the mill workers, were recent immigrants who came from Europe to America in search of a better life. Abe Bressler, through shrewdness and hard work, had become a jobber of silk thread and eventually a mill owner. His wife, Sarah, was a good wife and mother, and she became involved in the suffrage movement for women's rights, particularly the right to vote. One of Abraham's brothers, Solomon, worked at a mill and was a union activist, which put the two brothers in conflict, which deeply affected the entire family.Although fictional, the Bressler family was made up of flesh-and-blood characters. They laughed, loved, argued, fought, and had adulterous affairs.The majority of the characters, including political leaders, and local, national, and international union leaders, were real people.Writing style: 5 starsThe writing style was as polished and professional-looking as I've seen. Dialogues were realistic and often served to emphasize the enormity of the conflict and the high stakes involved.The author clearly did some serious research into the story, and also did a marvelous job of working the fictional characters into the historical story. One of the most interesting aspects of the story was learning about the manufacturing of silk, beginning with imported silkworm cocoons (a single cocoon may yield up to three thousand feet of silk filaments) and going through the entire process, with the silk fabric being woven on huge looms.A nice touch were the endnotes that gave some historical perspective and tied up some loose historical ends.Editing: 4 1/2 starsThere were a fair number of misspellings (the ubiquitous \\"its/it's\\" and \\"your/you're\\" mix-ups, \\"a field\\" instead of \\"afield,\\" \\"phase\\" instead of \\"faze\\"), but frankly, the story was compelling enough that I hardly noticed them.Silk Legacy has 382 pages (5,857 Kindle locations)."},{"Title":"Silk Legacy","review":"Richard Brawer, in his epic historical Silk Legacy, takes the reader inside a little-known world of the silk industry. Weaving the history by use of a family that is divided between bosses and lay-workers, he does it as skillfully as the looms themselves wove the finest fabrics of the era. He captures not only the feeling of the era, but does it with warmth and affection through a trying love story. His characters are magnificent. I adored them, in spite--or perhaps because--of their shortcomings.

It's one of the most heart-touching stories I have ever read. I haven't just enjoyed this book, I have loved it from the first page 'till the last one. Richard Brawer has written it in a way that makes you feel like you're inside the story, as if you know the characters, as if they are part of your life. Silk Legacy is a book I won't easily forget.\\" Gynette Parker and avid reader"},{"Title":"Silk Legacy","review":"Reviewed by A. J. Cooper for Reader Views (11/06)\\"Silk Legacy\\" is a book based on the production of silk in the early 1900's and the people, rich and poor, involved in the production and ownership of the silk. The book weaves a tale around the main character, Abe, and his family. The silk industry in New Jersey relied completely from immigrants from all over Europe. Needless to say the workers were not paid good wages and worked extremely long hours. For families to survive, even the children were subjected to the long hours and little pay for back-breaking and dangerous work in the factories. Even with all of the family working in the factories families found it extremely difficult to buy even the most basics. A small few were able, like Abe, to make a better life for himself and his family. Abe was able to better himself, by taking the seconds from the factories and reselling the silk in other markets. Abe had previously owned a bar and was very happy with that endeavor until he met a girl named Sarah. Her parents would not let the two marry until he was able to find a different way of making a living.I was not aware that circumstances similar to this book really occurred in New Jersey. Even though \\"Silk Legacy\\" is fictional the book was written so well that I felt all of the characters were real. I could not wait to get to the next chapter to find out what Abe was up to next. He struggled with his brother Solomon who worked in the factory and was fighting for the rights of the factory workers. This book really illustrates the struggles that immigrants had to survive in America. The danger these people faced daily is just horrifying and during this time period in history there was no concern for the worker just the end product the processed and dyed silk. The wealthy made the rules and ran the town, and the immigrants just hoped they could survive another day in the factory without injury or even death. I really felt disappointed when the book was over. I wanted to know all about Abe and Sarah's travels in the world.It would have been fun to see what happened to Abe's family as the silk industry evolved. The book also gives a glimpse of how the immigrants made neighborhoods and communities with immigrants from their own countries and even their own religions. \\"Silk Legacy\\" thought-provoking and offers glimpses into the lives of the rich and poor during this time period. It was very interesting to me and I was really glad that I had the opportunity to read the book. I would recommend this book to any of my friends or family.Book received free of charge."},{"Title":"The Road To CEO","review":"This is a great book, very well written with plenty of examples and practical guidelines as long as you are working through a recruiter. But, not all CEO's are appointed by executive recruiters.It is sad that Sharon missed out on about 40-50% of how CEO's are appointed, internal (within family of subsidiaries etc) promotions or through major corporations' internal HR findings or for that matter through extensive networking!Also, there is very little on how the process works once a recruiter recommends you as a potential CEO to a corporation. What are the different processes, how do the interviews work, what do the companies look for that a recruiter does not, what's to be expected, how long will such a process take etc.Yes, I agree that Sharon could write a sequel &amp; make her research complete. She is such a great writer (I did find 3 errors though)! Once I started reading it I moved on to other things only after I had completed reading from tip to toe.I am being harsh with 3 stars, but &quot;that's the way it is&quot; (as the great Walter Cronkite would say it!)"},{"Title":"The Road To CEO","review":"Putting an Elizabethan costume on Leonardo DiCap*** does not make him a Shakespearean actor. &#65533;Acting the part&#65533; and being oneself as a CEO don&#65533;t necessarily produce the same performance. The author puts leadership presence above all substance arguing that a tall, fit, attractive person in the proper sartorial package wins over headhunters and future employers alike. There&#65533;s no doubt about presentation in a formal setting. Corporate conventions are well established. (A diamond after all is a stone that has found a way to shine.) One&#65533;s taste, however, is not an indication of courage, commitment, conviction, and humility&#65533;the necessities that illuminate the so-called leadership presence. Those who have fine tastes do have one advantage&#65533;ability to communicate their discriminating selection criteria (on staff, options, strategies, etc.) to an equally discriminating audience. When a CEO candidate appreciates the differences between an Armani and a Brioni suit, a Rolex and a Patek Philippe watch, a Cross and a Montblanc fountain pen, etc.; then there may be &#65533;hope&#65533; that he/she can wisely choose between good and excellence. The personal image takes many years of acculturation, study, and passion to the point that these brands project one&#65533;s own philosophy and distinction. If CEO&#65533;s are always on the look out for the next best job while zigzagging across industries as the author claims, what do we say about their commitments to their constituents and their credibility on long-term strategies? The difference between a fortuneteller and a visionary is whether one has to live with the consequences. The author does point out many insightful tips on how the headhunting business works. I think the book would have been more convincing had the author included a broader yet balanced definition on leadership presence; both looks and substance do matter. Ability to lead and inspire often comes from both."},{"Title":"The Road To CEO","review":"The premises of the book are: executive presence is the most important aspect of becoming a CEO, headhunters are the most influential people in the executive placement process (so you better be nice to them), and that poise, good looks, and charm win the day.The book goes through the basics of successful interviewing (CEO level or not), but does not distinguish itself among other books of a similar nature.Author Voros is lucky she will never have to be on the other side of the interview desk. She tries her best to define executive presence, but ends up stating, \\"Like pornography, leadership presence is hard to define.\\" Perhaps so, but analogies to pornography are definitely not appropriate for upcoming CEOs.Later in the book, she presents the leadership presence profile of a successful businesswoman who got herself where she is today by succeeding within the same company for a number of years, not by zig-zagging between companies and functions (also not by working with head hunters). Good thing too, as the profiled Ms. Miller sounds like she would not survive one of author Vero's screening interviews because she \\"looks like a librarian,\\" in sharp contrast to Voro's advice in Chapter 6 \\"How You Look.\\"I am not a CEO, but have reported directly to and worked directly with a number in different industries. Some of the CEOs fit the \\"looks like an airline pilot\\" standard espoused in this book, but they also are the CEOs I watched crash their companies into the ground. The \\"quirky\\" CEOs I have worked with outperformed the \\"airline pilots\\" every time."},{"Title":"The Road To CEO","review":"Sharon needs to write a sequel, Road to the Non-Profit CEO. I was part of a search committee for a non-profit organization looking for a CEO. If I had read Sharon Voros's book last year it would have made my Job much easier. Her writing is clear and gets right to heart of the recruitment process. Leadership is an intangible that is not very easy to find right away in a candidate. Sharon articulates the characteristics of leadership and gives examples. This is a must read for members of search committees."},{"Title":"The Road To CEO","review":"Voros slices, dices and dissects how headhunters assess job candidates in a painfully objective but highly readable style. Her stories about the people who showed up for interviews wearing the wrong kind of clothes or those who ordered the wrong kind of meal at the lunch interview are amusing. It's sobering to realize that how you look, act and talk are being examined so closely by recruiters. It's clearly not just what's between your ears that counts when you're going for C-level positions.Good reading for anyone planning to hunt for an executive job."},{"Title":"The Road To CEO","review":"As someone just about to enter the full-time workforce, I was surprised to learn how important intangible qualities like how you look and how you talk are to career success.

But these are the people who brought us Kenneth Chenault of Enron and George Koslowski of Tyco -- both paragons of executive presence.

The book contains just over 140 pages, the first 54 dedicated to text accompanied with quick sketches depicting Coco Chanel and her fashions; the remainder is filled with glossy photos of Chanel's jewelry creations, most in full color, a few other period stills in black and white. The photos are large, very sharp and show much of the fine detail of her jewelry, often dedicating one page to a single piece.The book includes images of objects from antiquity, which clearly inspired Chanel, some even appear to be direct copies. Chanel's Byzantium crosses are especially intriguing for capturing a look of great antiquity. I found the strong Renaissance and Baroque forms to be equally inspiring.I would have welcomed an even more expansive book that included more photos however this book covers pieces from the 1930's to the 1960's, and some space has been dedicated to all the various styles."},{"Title":"Jewelry by Chanel","review":"Even today, so many years after her birth and the influx of countless couturiers the name Chanel brings to mind exquisite design, classic looks, and innovative fashion. Thanks to the current House of Design we continue to enjoy what this irrepressible woman began, and we find her represented in a multitude of areas - cosmetics, perfumes, clothing and perhaps the most sumptuous area of all - jewelry.Writer, publisher and collector Patrick Mauries brings us a celebration of eighty years of Chanel jewelry from the earliest iconic 1932 designs, which showcased her passion for fabulous stones to the latest designs of comets and stars, plumes and feathers. Yes, Chanel embodied the ultimate in tastefulness with her subdued tailored suits and little black dresses yet she had another side that enjoyed the baroque and statement gems.Jewelry By Chanel is a book to dream on with 272 pages and eye popping illustrations. Sometimes austere, at other times ostentatious Chanel is still a bit of an enigma yet the designs shown in this lush volume remind us of why she remains today a leader in the worlds of elegance and fashion.Enjoy!- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Jewelry by Chanel","review":"Although I enjoyed learning about the high end jewelry of Chanel, was really wanting a book on her line of costume jewelry.

Instead, we get \\"anti-war\\" rallies sponsored by these same butchers....\\"Woah. Obviously this reviewer cheers for libertarian ideology, but these lines really show the way the modern conservative movement has in effect mutated and desecrated the great ideas of classical liberals and libertarians.You must think that the current US foreign policy, militarism, and a national defense centralized in the pentagon protects Christian liberty from totalitarianism, right? And that common private individuals excercising their constitutional rights are unpatriotic stalinist terrorist liberty-haters? Right?In Bourne's words, \\"War is the HEALTH OF THE STATE (emphasis added)\\". The wars governments have waged are the very main inoculator for the expansion of centralized States. Especially in regards to the US, where anti-communism transformed the conservative movement into chickenhawk clones squawking for big government and BIG morality administered by Washington DC.It is the state which must draft civilians, or take their lives to fight for government in a war. Any enemy is suspect by the state, and always enough the very civilians in that government who dissent are some of the biggest \\"enemies\\" of the government in wartime, the \\"butcher\\" war veterans (who have actually seen service), little old ladies and average Americans.War engorges the government to naturally take away the rights of the citizenry. National defense brings with it suppresion of liberty. The above reviewer is with his neoconservative sympathizers apologizing for all totalitarians who wage violence against innocents by that very arrogant, paternalistic badgering against the hated anti-war protestors, some of which are the true conservatives and know what a society of liberty needs: peace (maybe some actual defense too, how about it, Dubya?)Now, to the actual book. A brilliant defense of liberal values from a nation of liberal thinkers, bravely through its history defending the best of the West for the East. Milosz and his dreamlike style should be best read in the original slavic for the full effect (like most foreign books), but its another anti-statist classic if its read in english anyway."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"I only read about half the book, and though it can be tedious, it's worth reading because Milosz exposes us American to the real experience of war and oppression which also should expose to us the hollowness of our courage, and hopefully spur us to a greater understanding of resistance and freedom."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"I purchased this book on the understanding that it was anti-socialist.

Instead, the author complains about make-believe problems like \\"exploitation\\" and seems to think that the only problem with Eastern Europe was that there were not enough labor unions. People who truly are anti-socialist will get annoyed if they read this.John Christmas, author of \\"Democracy Society\\""},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"\\"The Captive Mind\\" is the book written in the 20th Century that inadvertently and metaphorically best explains our present early 21st Century.It is interesting to note that the minds of hundreds of millions were recently controlled by the dialectic materialistic dictates of Socialist Realism. The Socialist Realism paradigm was dominant and then suddenly self-destructed under the weight of its corrupting lies. Such implosion represents a great beacon of hope regarding the current oppressive degrading paradigm of Zionist Realism.I doubt Czeslaw Milosz intended his book to be a guide to understanding the Zionist Realism paradigm under which the United States (and the World) currently suffers but he nevertheless provides great metaphorical guidance to an understanding of our current affliction. It is possible that \\"The Captive Mind\\" may eventually serve greater service to humankind as a liberating guide from Zionist Realism than it ever was for Socialist Realism.The parallels between Socialist Realism and Zionist Realism are astounding. Fictional Murti Bing is now revealed as non-fictional Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors with essentially the same political purpose. Ketman is still popular among journalists hiding in the cracks of their self-preserving lackluster reporting. Intellectuals (pseudo) at all universities are distinguished by their equal avoidance of addressing the obvious white elephants of high Zionist crimes.To read \\"The Captive Mind\\" is to commit a revolutionary act. It may be the equivalent of swallowing the metaphorical \`red pill' or a good first step after doing so."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"Living in Poland and Yugoslavia (where this book is mandatatory reading in gymnasiums, certain type of high schools) during the Iron Curtain period and during the fall of the B. Wall, I disagree that the theory in the book is correct. However, there were persons who could be associated with the certain personality types in the book, but to generalise in this way as Milos did is quite incorrect. For that I give the book two stars.I don't know how the other reviewers could compare reality with what they read in the book; but I guess to see it with your own eyes is the best way to test the things. Well, some say - he got the Nobel Prise so the book must be good picture of reality. To those I say, Henry Kissinger got the Nobel Prise for peace (!?) and it is well documented what kind of criminal person he is."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"Looking at modern day people of the left, I often notice that they have a vision of their ideologies, whether socialist, feminist, multiculturalist, etc. etc. etc., that is utopian in nature and almost impenetrable to negative feedback about the actual consequences of their policies. Exactly what is it in the human psyche that allows some ideologies to hook into someone's consciousness with such tenacity?Czeslaw Milosz had the same questions in his day when communism was in the ascendancy on the world stage and appeared to have the winds of history at its back. He wrote THE CAPTIVE MIND in an attempt to address such issues by telling us the stories of several authors captured by the communist ideal. The result is a classic book still timely to the same issues today as we read of talented individuals willing to sell their talents, and alas their souls, over to an ideal of human perfection while justifying the trail of mass destruction and slaughter that came about instead.In one major way, I am disappointed with the book. One of the more powerful statements that I read about totalitarian ideologies of the past was that there were numerous people outside of the ideological circle screaming their heads off about what was going on. Yet there was some mechanism or mechanisms within the ideology itself which prevented such negative feedback from entering the loop. My own experience with ideologues has demonstrated this time and again. It is just breathtaking to hear the unbelievable verbal gymnastics and mental contortions used to maintain a belief in one's sytem. I was hoping that THE CAPTIVE MIND would explore the pschological infrastructure of the totalitarian mentality far more than it does. Well, I cannot have everything, I suppose.A reader should be aware that THE CAPTIVE MIND can be a tad difficult. Milosz often switches perspectives from his voice to others to hypotheticals and back again without clearly delineating the shifts. This can make a cursory reading ineffective and possibly even misleading. The book is not that hardgoing, so taking one's time is recommended."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"\\"There are occasions when silence no longer suffices, when it may pass as an avowal. Then one must not hesitate. Not only must one deny one's true opinion, but one is commanded to resort to all ruses to deceive one's adversary. One makes all the protestations of faith that can please him, one performs all the rites one recognizes to be the most vain, one falsifies one's own books, one exhausts all possible means of deceit.\\" - Arthur Gobineau, from \`Religions and Philosophies of Central Asia'\\"The Captive Mind,\\" written in the early 1950s immediately after Milosz was awarded political asylum in France, is one of the first attempts to articulate the appeal of Communism (or, more broadly, dialectical materialism) to the intellectuals all over Eastern Europe.Central to the novel are four characters identified by Milosz only as Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma (but who we know enough about to identify as the very real authors Jerzy Andrzejewski, Tadeusz Borowski, Jerzy Putrament, and Konstanty Ildefons Galczynski.) Each of the four has uniquely different relationships to writing, and thinks differently about the way dialectical materialism affects their writing. In Alpha's youth, his far-right politics calls him into writing with the force of \\"moral authority.\\" He later eschews these politics and becomes a Catholic who speaks out against anti-Semitism. After World War II ends, Alpha's writing ideologically aligns itself with the puppet governments that set themselves up on Eastern Europe, and he is later seen only seen as a literary prostitute by his former friends. Beta, a poet who spent two years in Auschwitz and Dachau only to later be released by American soldiers, later swallows the pill of Murti-Bing and writes hard-line ideological defenses of Leninism and Stalinism. The experiences of Delta and Gamma are equally typical accounts of when the mind of an intellectual bumps into an intractable ideological system which inevitably evolves into \\"ketman,\\" meaning an outward acceptance of an idea while still holding on to unspoken reservations. In fact, this word, originally from the Arabic, was imported into English by Arthur Gobineau himself (see the quotation above).The first two chapters are incisive in evoking the spirit of the Communism-addled writer who struggles to balance his \\"priorities.\\" But the middle chapters on the writers seem as untrue - not false in the strict sense, but lacking the clarity of the moral-political-aesthetic themes with which he was trying to deal - as the ideology with which they are struggling. While they are presented as individuated, personal characters, the reader gets the feeling that Milosz is to turn them into archetypes while at other times working deliberately against this, which has an odd way of turning them into alienating abstractions for the reader.Perhaps most of all, this book serves as a tocsin. By now, an entire generation of Europeans has had the ability to write, think, and speak publicly about whatever they wish, the very fact of which possibly renders Milosz's book a peculiar curio from the doldrums of intellectual history. For many Americans, whose questions of freedom are restricted to whether or not one is allowed to burn their draft card or a Koran, or utter a prayer in school, reading \\"The Captive Mind\\" may very well have a stultifying effect. If that happens, the book runs the risk - we all run the risk - of it becoming still even more relevant than it is now."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"Though the less than perfect translation of ideas from one language to another is often a problem, this is quite an insightful view of the transformation of Polish intellectuals and their intellectual life, through war and the failure of their own ideologies, into servants of the Stalinist state. It is really too bad that, with the passing of Communism, that Milosz has slipped somewhat from his place in the pantheon of thinkers and analysts of intellectual life. He, being a poet, brings a poet's sensibilities to the table, which by itself is refreshing but coupled with his melancholy humanism, which is sometimes gentle and sometimes a bit more strident, he deserves to be recognized as one of the great and good men of the intellectual history of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"We'll probably never truly understand how so many millions of people could capitulate to the extreme ideologies of fascism and communism, from the intellectual act of stifling one's own independent thoughts to the emotional act of apologizing for repressive regimes. But this insider's account is a fascinating and disturbing look at the mental suffering of those living under imposed philosophies. While Milosz largely criticizes communism here, don't fall for political simplicity because he also examines fascism (which is not the polar opposite of communism) and extremism in general. Milosz examines the painful coping mechanisms of the thinking person oppressed by ideologies that were not just unyielding but half-baked, with philosophical demands shifting with the winds of politics and history. The book is built around vignettes of four writers Milosz once knew - former independent thinkers who either subsumed their passion in support of the state or fought the power, always with saddening results. Unlike most politically oriented books, Milosz didn't bother with ivory tower theory or stiff erudition, and spoke with the independent mind that was crushed by ruthless ideology. He escaped, but the societies he covered are still to this day buried under the culture of the captive mind.

One of the greatest poets of our time (in my humble opinion)."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"Milosz offers here some of the most damning evidence and useful insights into the workings of the Soviet system in the post-WWII period in Central Europe. His portraits reveal a damaged and psychologically exhausted culture that the USSR ruthlessly appropriated and systematically manipulated.

A necessary book for anyone who wishes to better understand the cultural and social consequences of the Soviet Union, and its inner-workings in depth."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"Great book for fans of Orwell. I've heard Orwell read this Noble winning story prior to writing 1984. The Author's life gave him unique insights into the subject matter, beyond that of these systems's victims."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"This book is outstanding. It's one of the few books I really wish everyone was familiar with. I mean that. A lot of times if a book is really good, I sort of like that I've read it and other people haven't. It gives me sort of a shallow, self absorbed kick. This one is too good for that though.One word to the wise, this book is not simply about how bad communism is/was, though it adresses that in detail. It's also about how any form of totalitarianism, which squelches thre freedom of the human mind is totally awful. So the way to read this is not really to say, \\"hey look this proves that those leftists/rightists I've always hated are totally evil and screwed up.\\" No, it's more to look at any absolutist ideology being peddled a little bit askance. Whether it's right wing radio, or left wing marches led by A.N.S.W.E.R. anyone who thinks they are right %100 of the time is probably a shady character. I didn't make that up, I got it from the quote he used in the front of the book. But I was too lazy to go downstairs and grab the book to get the exact quote. So there you have it. This book is incredible. I'm pretty confident you'll like it. Unless you're some kind of psycho (sorry If I'm hurting your feelings)."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"Without a doubt this book is one of historical perspective. The reason it is important, is that it was written in 1953, by a man who had seen how fascism, dictatorship, genocide, communism and stalinism does not just to people but to a society as a whole.Milosz lived in Poland between the two world wars, and watched how a nation that had been eliminated by three countries, one hundred and thirty years ago; can itself, become a war monger and a destroyer of 'other' cultures in the name of rebirth. He then saw another nation (Hitler's Germany) waste it's people and soul trying to prove that they were superior to everyone else. Lastly, he watched a nation, supposedly in the name of the 'people' destroy other nations and cultures in the name of those same people.Stalin said that the death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions are just statistics. Stalin of course was a great maker of statistics. When the 'People's Democracies' were created in Eastern Europe after WWII, their stated objective was to create a classless society, for the enhancement of the proletariat. Unfortunely, not everyone wanted to be enhanced. But, under the theory that, it is better to imprison twenty innocent people than to miss one criminal, millions were killed, tortured, and dispossessed; in order to create a 'worker's paradise'.Milosz's stories are a warning to those that would collaborate in their own destruction."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"Milosz, the nobel laureate (and my favorite 20th c. poet), here presents a sort of memoir which sets out to define exactly howand why personal freedom are essential. The presentation is engaging the narrator deft in its ablities to convey. For anyone interested in exploring the development of a talented intellect and acute observer of historic and human events, this book proves very gratifying."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"In the forward to this remarkable book Milosz writes that he wants to give the totalitarian point of view &quot;in his own words, from his own point of view.&quot; The result is this ambitious, fascinating tour of the human mind twisted by the lies of the culture that surroundes it. It's a schizophrenic place that resembles the scarier novels of the noir writer Jim Thompson. There's nothing solid to cling to; everything dissolves into fear and loathing. Milosz turns his poetical gifts to the case studies of several Polish intellectuals who became entangled with the Communist party. Milosz doesn't name them but one is clearly Tadeusz Borowski, the author of the Holocaust short story collection &quot;This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen.&quot; The title of that book in Polish was &quot;The Stony World&quot;, which reflected how Borowski, an Auschwitz survivor, came to see the world--as dominated by force, without effective moral constraint. Milosz depicts Borowski as a man who sought shelter under the protection of the strongest earthly power available--the Communists--but was unable finally to justify the price of that loyalty (he committed suicide.) What keeps someone from succumbing to &quot;Ketman&quot; (the two-facedness that Orwell called &quot;double-think?) Milosz implies the answer is religious faith, which allows one to trust in an objective truth beyond the lies and terror of the stony world (he was a devout Catholic.) This book is a must read for anyone who wants to keep the world from stealing his soul."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"Never have I read a more vivid and convincing thesis defending the virtues of intellectual freedom. Though frequently difficult to read--the author (or the translator) shifts frequently from first to second to third person (and back again) in mid paragraph--the work is central to understanding not only the intellectual seductiveness of the &quot;rule of philosophy&quot; but, more importantly and generally, the dangers of intellectual conformity. Milosz's dissection of intellectuals' attraction to leftist social systems becomes a defense of open society in both the intellectual and general communities. We come to understand most fundamentally the concept of intellectual freedom, and how the elimination of it becomes the ultimate goal of authoritarian leftist politics... despite claims otherwise.Many intellectuals believe that their interests are best served by socialism or communism. Milosz explains why they are frequently fooled into believing this, and why many of the very components of socialism and communism that intellectuals most covet--freedom from vulgar market forces and important roles in the administration of society--are the very forces that strip them of their liberty. He illustrates this process with four character examples.Though written in the throes of the Cold War, this work could not be more timely. And though it is written as an attack on Communism (with a big &quot;C&quot;) and is rife with often knee-jerk anti-Russian rhetoric, it's arguements can be easily applied to all forms of totalitarianism, both left and right. Mostly, Milosz is attempting to defend the chaotic human condition from idealogical molding and, considering contemporary encroachments of politics, government, and religion into the lives of human beings, this book is as valid and important today as it was in 1953. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"&quot;It was only toward the middle of the twentieth century that the inhabitants of many European countries came, in general unpleasantly, to the realization that their fate could be influenced directly by intricate and abtruse books of philosophy&quot;. That's how this book begins, and it captures Milosz's major theme: the vast difference between &quot;abtruse books of philosophy&quot; and real human beings. In a series of connected essays, he studies that difference, and the ways in which people respond when they're forced to deny it. Most of the essays tell the stories of writers that Milosz knew in Warsaw before the war, and the different routes they took to becoming instruments of communist propaganda. Of the other essays, the one most powerful to an American reader is &quot;Looking to the West&quot;, which starts with Milosz being asked whether Americans are really stupid. The writing is beautiful and vivid. I highly recommend this book to anybody who dislikes the oversimplifications of ideology. I recommend it even more highly to anybody who doesn't."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"This short volume of essays is one of the finest books I have ever read. It is not for nothing that Milosz was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.

Essential reading for those interested in man's freedom, and in the contrasts between true religion and the false diety of historical &quot;necessity&quot;."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"I often wonder as I read about the horrors committed by the worst regimes in history, how the people that perpetrate crimes against humanity can live with themselves. What is the motive and reasoning of those who praise the slaughter of innocents?The Captive Mind sheds a little bit of light into these darkest corners of the human psyche. It describes the path that leads righeous people on the road to immorality, written by a man who, along with his friends and comerads, traveled that road but took another path before he came to his final destination."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote from the Soviet Union, Vaclav Havel from Czechoslovakia, and Czeslaw Milosz from Poland, but they all lived under the shadow of Communism, and thus they wrote about the same things. Czeslaw Milosz (who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1980) defected from Poland in 1951, and his book \\"The Captive Mind\\" attempts to justify and to explain his defection.\\"The Captive Mind\\" is a description and analysis and critique of Communism's mind-workers, its writers. Milosz starts with an interesting question: given the totalitarian aspects of Communism, why did not all the writers defect to a land when they can write whatever they want? The answer is that Communism, more than the West, respects the word as a power for propaganda, and treats writers very well. In fact, there's hardly any resistance, and it's truly striking how the whole intellectual class was ready and willing to prostitute itself to the demands and directives of the Center in Moscow. Some of this can be blamed on fatigue and disillusionment resulting from World War II, some to opportunism, most to apathy. (Also, the natural human instinct to just get along, rather than to cause friction.) Milosz makes it clear that as a writer his conscience cannot permit him to live in such a state of affairs, and thus he chooses exile.Towards the end of the book, Milosz criticizes Pablo Neruda. As a former Polish translator of Neruda's poetry, Milosz believes that the great poet ought to write what he knows: in other words, he should continue to criticize the oppression of his native land, but shouldn't because of that be too ready and willing to praise the Soviet Union.While Milosz does not overtly praise America, there is always that bias in his writings. Alexis de Tocqueville discusses the difference between America and European dictatorships in his book \\"Democracy in America.\\" The great Frenchman claimed that while European dictatorships may demand your body America demands your soul. Intellectuals living under dictators know all too clearly what's wrong with the system, all engaged in double-think (thinking one way and behaving another), and are guilty of cynicism and opportunism, but not stupidity and ignorance. But what can we say about a culture that happily watches \\"Entertainment Tonight\\" and \\"Family Guy,\\" and believes their civilization to be the height of humanity?The Communist threat to humanity has come and gone, but what's left is a much more nefarious menace."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"This is a very clear presentation of the situation that writers--as well as whole countries--behind the Iron Curtain were facing after WWII. Ceslaw Milosz served as a cultural attach&eacute; in Polish embassies in Western countries. For someone like the author, who later renounced the position he held in the communist government, the question of why you sign up for that in the first place comes up. He gives a very good explanation. In addition to his own case, he tells four other writers' stories, calling them Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. Each has a different course to ultimate disillusionment. The ways the Stalinist doctrines of socialist realism and dialectical materialism are brought to bear on writers and artists are described in very particular, individual ways. This is a disturbing book, possibly in a way the author didn't mean it to be. Some of the forms of pressure that these artists met with will be familiar to those in other settings of intellectual conformity, who have never lived under a communist regime."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"Though written at the end of WWII, the information in this book is a must for those trying to understand, or endeavoring to remain free from, the philosophy of dialectic materialism that fuels the tyranical regimes of today. The author lived through the time in Poland's history when it succumbed to the power of communist Russia; not just their tanks and guns, but the battle for their minds. He offers a critical view of the power and magnetism of this philosophy of history which continues to threaten free and creative thought and life where ever it takes root."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"An excellent read and justifiably a classic. It's certainly a dated piece, as political works usually are, and yet Milosz's insistance on confining his commentary to his own experience and epoch (i.e., Nazi and Soviet occupation) makes it a timeless work of intellectual history. Particularly salient are his observations about the function and psychology of the artist in society. Just read it."},{"Title":"The captive mind","review":"An excellent, if short, book analyzing artisan associates of the author who make conversions, adaptions, and protestations to the Communist regime. Those who don't die by suicide or execution tend to become cynics, knowing they mouth hollow phrases for a corrupt regime and receive undeserved praise for crud they produce because they've either lost the ability to produce deserving work or such work would be reactionary."},{"Title":"I Am An American","review":"In an everchanging world of so-called facts, certain political figureshave felt the freedom to tweak our American History to suit their ownbeliefs, only too ready to toss out the facts that have stood for over 2000 years.The facts that I learned in 7th Grade Civics were good enough for me because the textbooks back then had not been monkeyied with to suit theeditors foul purposes to change the history of America as if a few words on a page after-the-fact could change the course of history.We are now living in days of uncertainty due to the devilment of the times we are living in but no matter how many editors reprint, tweak, and retweak, the facts still remain the same as only those in the ONE TRUE BOOK remains true. If in doubt about the history of the world, check outyour Bible and start reading it.

It is strewn with errors in the formulas and sample problems. Because this book is written in a size 12 font with 1-3 inch margins at the sides and bottom, it is a lot longer than it should be. This format should give the reader a sense of accomplishment while studying (Hey, I've done 10 pages already!), but the sample solutions are so time-consuming to work through that a few simple pages can take an hour. The authors dispense with units on most problems and combine several solution steps into one, leaving the reader to retrace every step to figure out where he got lost. On a PE test, you would be penalized for not referencing your starting equation, not carrying and cancelling units, and other sloppy habits and mistakes committed by the authors.

I passed the exam. When I was solving the problems in the actual exam I knew what I was doing. I was confident that I will pass. The main reason was Chemical Engineering License Review.License review is written by chemical engineers. This book brushed up my chemical engineering knowledge. Review has addressed all areas in PE exam. But the best covered area is Chemical Reaction Engineering. There are lot of questions on reaction engineering (11%). Problem with kinetics is that we do not use it everyday like fluid dynamics or heat transfer. This book will bring you up to the speed for kinetics problems. Kinetics is the area which will make it or break it.Review was great help in plant design and operation section. I found this section very useful during actual examination.Heat transfer chapter has good review of shell and tube exchangers. Fluid dynamics chapter helped me in flow of fluids in pipes and pump calcs most.License review gives extensive coverage for mass transfer. Absorption and distillation are very important sections and this book prepared me well to solve those questions.Book had printing mistakes but these mistakes did not deter me from understanding the principles. There are other reference books/solved problems (Chemical Engineering Reference Manual, NCEES problems) available and they are useful too. While studying I kept this book as a main focus and used other reference material also. Study from more than one source is a must. If one starts early enough and balance fundamentals and problem solving properly then passing in the first attempt is not tough.PE exam tests experience and fundamentals. License Review will clear your fundamentals. It helped me during exam and I am going to keep it as a reference also.I did not have resort to option elimination.

The reader should ignore any review done on earlier editions."},{"Title":"Chemical engineering Licence Review","review":"The 2007 edition of the book is thoroughly revised and includes information not only for the PE examination, but also for doing everyday process engineering calculations. I strongly recommend anyone engaged in process engineering or preparing for P.E. examination to buy this book along with the companion book on Problems and Solutions.This book, comprising twenty chapters, has nearly 800 pages: a voluminous book. The chapters include Units and Dimensions (22 pages), Material Balances (54 pages), Energy Balance and Thermodynamics (53 pages), Fluid Mechanics(78 pages), Heat Transfer(69 pages), Evaporation(14 pages), Filtration (16 pages), Membrane Separation(9 pages), Mass Transfer Fundamentals(52 pages), Distillation(64 pages), Absorption(25 pages), Liquid-Liquid Extraction and Leaching(33 pages), Adsorption(18 pages), Psychrometry, Humidification, and Drying(23 pages), Chemical Reaction Engineering(78 pages), Process Control(25 pages), Corrosion and Materials of Construction(16 pages), Equipment Design(40 Pages), Engineering Economics(24 pages), and Plant Safety and Environmental Consideration(59 pages), Index(16 pages).Each chapter has numerous example problems to illustrate the application. The Introduction of the book, not mentioned above, gives information about how to become a professional engineer, examination structure, the website and telephone number of various State Authorities, and practical hints like what to take to examinations.Chapter 1 discusses the various units including the US Customary unit and SI, and the conversion factors. Chapter 2 starts with material properties, discusses mass balances, phase behavior, ideal and real gases, fuels and combustion. Chapter 3 deals with thermodynamic properties, three laws of thermodynamics, thermo-chemistry, power cycles and refrigeration. Chapter 4 deals with Fluid Mechanics. This is a very strong chapter not only for P.E. examination, but also for regular process design. It deals with fluid mechanics application including parallel and branched systems, compressible fluid, and two-phase flow, the 3-K method of calculating fluid flow resistance, and pump hydraulics. The line-sizing guideline table 4.2 is very handy and demonstrates practical wisdom of the authors.The chapter 5 on heat transfer is another very good chapter. All modes of heat transfer including conduction, convection, and radiation, and unit operations of sublimation, batch heat exchanger design, nonmetallic heat exchangers, extended surface heat exchanger, and effectiveness NTU method have been covered. Chapters 6 and 7 cover both fundamentals and applications through worked out problems in evaporator and filter design. Chapter 8 covers the unit operation of reverse osmosis. The mathematical model for batch reverse osmosis is quite handy. Chapter 9 shows an elaborate treatment of mass transfer fundamentals including molecular diffusion, convective and turbulent mass transfer, inter-phase mass transfer, VLE, and mass transfer in packed beds.Chapter 10 on distillation is a well written chapter covering flash distillation, differential distillation, McCabe-Thiele method, short-cut methods on multi-component distillations etc. Chapter 11 on absorption is very handy with step-by-step procedure of designing an absorption column with a lot of practical tips. Chapter 12 on liquid-liquid extraction and leaching demonstrates an excellent application of right triangular diagram on extraction and determination of minimum reflux ratio, and design of packed column in extraction service. Similar comments apply to Chapter 13 which deals with adsorption and design of fixed bed adsorption. Chapter 14 addresses Psychrometry, Humidification, and Drying. It explains well such terms as humid volume, humid heat capacity, wet and dry bulb temperature, adiabatic saturation temperature, and demonstrate the use of humidity chart very well through examples.Chapter 15 is thorough on Chemical Reaction Engineering, interpretation of kinetic data and the constants of the rate equation, reactor design, mass and energy balance, product distribution and its dependence on temperature, batch reactor, CSTR, packed bed reactor, catalytic reactor, ignition-extinction curve and multiple steady states in heat transfer, and is followed by numerous example problems. Chapter 16 addresses the basic aspects of process control including feedback and feed forward control, application of Laplace transforms, control actions, first and second order systems, and concepts of stability criteria. Chapter 17 outlines the eight forms of corrosion and has good tips on how to avoid corrosion by a good mechanical design. Chapter 18 on Equipment Design has a wealth of practical knowledge not taught in school. I understood for the first time the difference between the design pressure and maximum allowable working pressure as defined in ASME Code. It instructs on how to develop the mechanical design parameters of equipment.Chapter 19 on Engineering Economics deals with time value of money, depreciation calculations, and cost comparison of alternatives, Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index, break-even analysis, optimization, and many solved problems. Chapter 20 on Plant Safety and Environmental Consideration is another chapter full of practical knowledge not taught in many schools. It deals with toxicology and industrial hygiene, fire and explosion issues, hazard and operability studies, environmental considerations including air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution, and noise abatement. It also gives guidelines of sizing emergency relief devices for various over pressure scenarios including runaway reactions per established codes and standards. Finally, it includes a sixteen-page subject index to locate a subject very quickly.There are some areas that the authors should consider to improve. There has been some duplication of efforts. For example, the generalized pressure drop correlation is duplicated in Chapter 10 and Chapter 11, the former having the latest one. There are some errors which the reader can quickly figure out: hopefully they will be eliminated in the next edition. Overall, this is an excellent study book for P.E. Exam, and a book I would like to have as a companion in my chemical engineering career."},{"Title":"Chemical engineering Licence Review","review":"This is an excellent book for refreshing core concepts in chemical engineering, particularly if you've been out of school for a long while.

Although not necessarily recommended, one can actually get by on the numerous example problems in this book alone without having to buy separate books on practice problems.What this books lacks is reference information in the form of tables and charts, etc. It is also skimpy on the many minor topics that invariably get asked on the exam but that are too minor and too numerous for a student to spend much time preparing for. I also wish it were hardbound because the soft cover gets beat up very quickly. For reference information for use during the exam, choose Lindeburg's Chemical Engineering Reference Manual instead. The Das/Prabhudesai and Lindeburg books complement each other perfectly, one mostly for use to get ready for the exam, the other for use during the exam. Lindeburg's book isn't particularly good as an exam prep study guide, but the Das/Prabhudesai books is.My advice for anyone preparing for the chemical PE is to get both books. I passed the Chem E PE on my first attempt this way. The Lindeburg is indispensible as a handy reference during the exam. Read my review on it, too. Yes, you'll have to shell out the money for both sets of books, but doing so is still far cheaper than having to take the exam twice! Use both books to pass the exam.One thing to keep in mind about the PE exam is that it tests for acceptable competence instead of excellence (This generally means answering at least 70% of the questions correctly). One doesn't need to have been an A-caliber student in college to pass it. The passing rate for first-time takers has been over 70% in recent years. The combined pass rate is around 50% because it's dragged down by repeat takers who have only a 40% pass rate."},{"Title":"Chemical engineering Licence Review","review":"This book is a completely useless resource for the Chemical Engineering PE Exam. The format and layout of the book is clumsy and poorly structured. The errors in the text are frequent and in my judgement, completely unacceptable considering that the nature of the subject matter is a review for a professional engineer, which implies high standards and an even higher level of performance. The associated sample exam text proves to be more of a hindrance than a help because it leaves the reader with an inadequate amount of information to solve the sample problems and an even more inadequate reference for solutions to the problems. To date, the most effective use of this text that I have been able to devise is its use as kindling for my fireplace. The was, by far, the biggest waste of money that I have ever suffered."},{"Title":"Chemical engineering Licence Review","review":"FYI: I passed the 4/09 exam on the first try. My other materials were the 6 Minute Solutions, the NCEES Practice Test, and the Lindberg Reference Manual.I bought this book because it was a reasonably-sized (thickness-wise) overall review of a ChE undergrad education... and b/c almost 5 years out of school, I hadn't used one iota of my education, and needed such a book.The Review was often presented in a way I didn't learn -- so while I was frustrated, I was forced to learn and understand more. The book is bad about errors and not defining variables, the practice problems are even worse than 6 Minute Solutions (see my review for that book), and ultimately the book might drive you to insanity, violence, or both.But, I needed an entire undergrad review in one book, one that I could forge through on nights and weekends in 3 months, and this fit the bill. It's designed for the previous generation of PE exam, but still worked for my needs."},{"Title":"Chemical engineering Licence Review","review":"Don't be fooled by the updated cover.

The man is passionate about the sport and is obviously extremely knowledgable. He has spent the last 40 years thinking about the training and the teaching of the game. Whether it has to do with technique, strategy, training, mental game, or state of the game, he has an opinion which is more than backed up with experience and data. Lots of data.The book is a little problematic in that the explanations of the concepts are a little too involved for the beginning coach. But the man is obviously the foremost thinker on the game that the American game has seen in a long time. You may disagree with his conclusions, but his attention to detail and his arguements for his ideas are very strong. He is a great believer in statistics and measuring progress, so a lot of it has to do with measuring athlete accomplishments.If you are looking to get a book to help your kids with their intramural team, forget about this book. If you are out to learn to coach volleyball at a very high level, this could be the one book you need. Keep in mind that he has always dealt with the highest level of athletes and have had the luxury of training six hours a day seven days a week, so some of the offense are way too complicated, even for college teams. But they are good ideas which stimulated even more ideas.I wish he had put in more of his unique training ideas based on the Asian training methodology, but that is quibbling."},{"Title":"Arie Selenger's Power Volleyball","review":"Arie Selinger is a legend among coaches, and this book won't let fans of the former coach of the U.S. Women's Olympic Team down. Whether you want to learn more about Arie's philosophy or to pick up some tips for your own game, this book is worth a read.As a high school coach, I've implemented many of Arie's ideas into the program I took over 3 years ago, a program that had struggled for decades. And this season, I'm proud to say, we posted only the 3rd winning record in school history.

If you need some proof as to the depth of philosophical thought that goes into these essays (most of these supposedly dealing with reality vs apparences, morality, free will) here's a direct quote:\\"You'd have to be out of your mind or at least seriously out to lunch to choose the real world ( is that why Keanu Reeves seems so well cast in the role ?)\\", very insightfull. Later on...\\"The Matrix reveals an adolescent fear of the body as something that can veer out of control. This fantasy suits geeky young males who yearn for autonomy and mental powers\\". This comes from a self titled \\"feminist philosopher\\", a geeky old female I guess. Even better is the following: (Talking about the movie Existenz): The film's vivid scenes of penetration and biomorphic connection show that bodies can be both delightful and disgusting\\".

I really enjoyed it and cant wait to read other Matrix books!"},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"First let me say that I'm a big MATRIX fan. I also have a passion for philosophy. I had high hopes for this book but was soon dissapointed. With each new essay I felt I was starting over. The cave analogy became tiresome and I often found the different essayist going over the same topics. The other writters seem to use the movie to go off on ideas that have little to do with the movie. If you're just starting out in philosophy this might make an o.k. introduction otherwise I would keep looking."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"...If not pick up a real philosophy book.

First, faith in oneself is not necessarily a non-theist position, i.e., you may think you are God. Secondly, being non-theist does not equate to being religion- neutral. Buddhism in many forms is non-theist.On a different note, the &quot;philosophy&quot; expressed by the film more closely resembled Advaita Vedanta (a monistic school of Hinduism) than any of the other views mentioned in the book."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"I ordered the book for a friend, another professor, but Amazon shipped it UPS with signature required.

This book provides me with an \\"in\\" that I can use in order to discuss very important philosophical issues. It is often difficult to make the material \\"come to life\\", especially when teaching a required course. By using this book, it is possible to make the process much more enjoyable for students who would otherwise be disinterested. This book can be used on its own or, being that it is relatively inexpensive, it can be used as a companion piece along with a textbook. For the most part, the writing is lively and engaging. It is both accessible to Intro. students and interesting to graduate students. Anyone who has had an even cursory acquaintance with philosophical writing knows how rare that is. I believe this to be the best book in the series. I am most likely biased; I have what some might call an unhealthy obsession with the film. The other two books, Seinfeld and Philosophy and Simpsons and Philosophy, are excellent, but this book is much better for use in an intro. course for on simple reason: To understand most of the essays in the other two books, the reader will have to be familiar with the series. Seeing a few episodes will not do. With The Matrix, you can watch a two hour movie and be able to understand the references that are made in the book. A few highlights:Ch.1: Computers, Caves, and Oracles: Neo and Socrates- Compares Plato's allegory of the cave to Neo's journey. An excellent discussion of what it means to lead an examined life and seek the truth. Excellent segue into the red pill/blue pill debate.Ch.6: The Machine-Made Ghost: Or, The Philosophy of Mind, Matrix Style- Discusses Artificial Intelligence and the nature of the mind. The author argues against dualism and favors a materialistic view. Leads to a discussion on whether or not it would be theoretically possible for a Matrix to exist and the presuppositions that are present in the movie with regard to the nature of the mind.Ch.8: Fate, Freedom, and Foreknowledge: A discussion of fate, freedom, omniscience and determinism. Even if they escaped the Matrix, would people really be free?Ch.11: Happiness and Cypher's Choice: Is Ignorance Bliss?- My favorite essay in the book. What do we make of Cypher's decision to try to return to the Matrix? Is a decimated reality preferable to an artificial world where you can \\"eat\\" a juicy steak and do not have to worry about Sentinels trying to kill you? The author says that it is, and his argument is very thought-provoking.There are other excellent essays in this book, but these happen to be my favorites. Students, teachers and those who are just interested in philosophy: You should definitely buy this excellent book."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"You know, I never took a single philosophy course in college, and this book still swept me right up. The thinking man has already pondered many of the issues this book brings up, but it examines them in a more analytical way that helps to focus your thinking.The book is essentially a collection of essays connecting \\"The Matrix\\" (and occasionally other films) to the modern school of thinking. As such, it could have used some editing -- the analogy to Descarte's demon allegory is certainly pertinent, but we don't need it explained to us 18 times.The essays generally fall into two categories -- those which use \\"The Matrix\\" as a starting point for serious philosophical debate and those which attempt to apply schools of thought that the filmmakers almost certainly never intended (virtually the entire final segment of the book is like this). The former work very well, the latter do not.For fans of \\"The Matrix\\" who want to examine it as more than just a film but as a question that doesn't really have an answer, this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"I would say this is a must read for those interested in learning more about philosophy or even self taught scholars who are openminded to present day applications of basic theories. Although I do not completely agree with all the analyses and comparisons offered in this book, I cannot argue against the fact that like its predecessors (The Simpsons and Philosophy and Seinfeld and Philosophy) this collection of essays offers a unique opportunity to explain sometimes complex theories of philosophy in a palpable and comprehensible manner that I think anyone can appreciate. I admit that although some of the analysis require time to digest and at times may be a slow read, this book is well worth it if you are interested in learning more about philosophy and do not feel like buying \\"An idiots guide to philosophy\\". I have used the theories that I have found in this book to concentrate on specific philosophers and avenues of thought. Also, it is just more interesting as it makes you think and gives you tangible examples that parallel with your own life experiences. Of course these life experiences may not include the gravity defying martial arts but stranger things have been true so I leave it to you to decide. Which pill will you choose?"},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"In my opinion the Matrix and Philospohy is the best of the three pop culture and philospohy books published by Irwin so far. While the Simpsons and Seinfeld books both drew philospohical analogies from unexpected yet amusing sources, what makes the Matrix piece different is that it addresses the actual questions movie audiences pondered from experiencing the film. The beauty of this book is in not in the conclusions but rather in the debate itslef. If you enjoyed the movie because Neo &quot;saved the day&quot;, then this book isn't for you. But if the wheels in your mind kept churning over whether virtual reality is equal to relaity, then I say take the red pill and see how far this rabbit hole goes. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"This is a collection of essays by philosophy professors ostensibly discussing the philosophical issues raised by The Matrix movie. As a collection, it does not form an organic whole: each essay stands alone without reference to any other. As such, there are endless retellings of Plato's Allegory of the Cave, Descartes' Dream Hypothesis, and other philosophical canons that have a connection to the themes raised by the movie. As a collection of discreet essays, it is not surprising that some essays are much better than others. The better essays stay close to the movie, specifically referencing scenes and themes to philosophical topics. The less engaging essays merely use the movie as a launching pad from which to discuss their own philosophical points. An example of the former type of essay is written by Cynthia Freeland of the University of Houston, who makes an interesting comparison between The Matrix and another 1999 sci-fi thriller: eXistenZ (starring Jude Law). An example of the latter type of essay is Slavoj Zizek's virtually unreadable contribution, \\"The Matrix: Or, The Two Sides of Perversion\\". Here's a line from Dr. Zizek's essay which will illustrate my point: \\"Hegel introduces here three terms: when a screen intervenes between ourselves and the Real, it always generates a notion of what is In-itself, beyond the screen (of the appearance), so that the gap between appearance and the In-itself is always-already 'for us.'\\" .....Whatever. My advice to the reader is to assess each essay by reading the first few paragraphs and then deciding whether reading the whole chapter is worth your time. There are several essays in this book well-worth skipping."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"As a huge fanatic for anything \\"The Matrix\\", I read this book as soon as I learned of its existence. I had high hopes, and I was not disappointed.The book is arranged in essays, contributed by various philosophers from a variety of backgrounds. They are usually well-written, and cover a broad range of material with a healthy amount of quoting and reference back to the movie itself. Some covered similar themes, though each contributor brought something different to the mix.The only thing I found boring was the last essay. It was just not my style, and that is the only reason. This is the reason I did not give it a 5-star rating. I did not agree with some of the conclusions drawn, but I found these well presented and discussed.If you are a Matrix fan with an interest in philosophy, (but daunted by the language used in philosophy, like me), \\"The Matrix and Philosophy\\" is an excellent book. It is a great read, and it kept me hooked almost until the end."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"In his essay in this text Slaboj Zizek states \\"Isn't The Matrix one of those films which functions as a kind of Rorschach task, setting in motion the universalized process of recognition...\\" No thought could better summarize this collection of essays as philosophers celebrate, critique and deconstruct The Matrix. Comparisons are made to Socrates, Descartes, Kant, Bhuddah, and Marx, some almost certainly intended in the film and other likely projected. The Matrix is a philosophical film and the first time I saw it I heard the voices of Descartes and Kant. It was refreshing to have some rigorous guidance for the way down the rabbit hole and the process of making connections between the movie, classical philosophy and current world views. The text is technical but accessible. The essays are more in the rhetorical style of college lecture halls than dining halls and the reader should be prepared for some rigor - but it is well worth it. There is a lot of repetition between chapters and some essays were definitely more interesting than others (Gregory Bassham's The Religion of The Matrix and the Problems of Pluralism and Theodore Schick's Fate, Freedom, and Foreknowledge, in particular, were winners) but that is the advantage of a modular document - the essays stand alone and you can read from cover to cover or sample. A highly recommended text."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"When I first picked up the book, I expected to find the usual correlations between the Matrix and Christianity. You know...Neo being Jesus, Morpheus the Holy Spirit, etc. However, this is not what this book contains. The Matrix and Philosophy is a collection of essays and other writings that compare ideas presented in The Matrix with philosophical writings from throughout history. The entire book is centered around one question; is the world presented in The Matrix a possibility? Throughout the book the &quot;Matrix Possibility&quot; is put up against writings of Descartes, Robert Nozick, and many other philosophical writers. I was very impressed with book overall and would recommend this book to almost any fan of the Matrix that has asked themselves &quot;Is it really possible?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"I just finished reading &quot;One Dimentional Man&quot; by Herbert Marcuse. I thought of the &quot;The Matrix&quot; throughout the reading because it seems like a great metaphor for the basic theme of Marcuse's book&quot;: Industrial [tecnological] society geared towards creating conformity on a totalitarian scale in supposedly &quot;democratic&quot; societies; the Matrix being an extreme example of this--technology becoming predominent to the point of total dominance. So I rushed back to the &quot;Matrix and Philosophy&quot; index but found no trace of Marcuse.The book contains some readable but complex takes on the film. It would be great to have seen a straight foward reading depicting Neo as a hero of the &quot;Great Refusal&quot; Marcuse's term for the few who are aware of the conformist inflicting powers of late industrial society and who rebel against it. But this is just my personal opinion on an otherwise fine book that I'm still reading in a scater-shot way. Perhaps I missed an essay written by someone who has absorbed Marcuse but who felt no need to reference him.Someone in &quot;Time&quot; magazine [who did a huge image-laden but ultimately superficial article on &quot;Reloaded&quot;] poked fun at the &quot;Geeks&quot; who would read this type of book which is exactly what infururiated Marcuse back in '64. He saw even then how the powers-that-be exhort anti-intellectualism as a way of keeping people from questioning the system--to keep people from asking questions like &quot;What is the Matrix?&quot; [Just try critiquing or questioning anything about this society, anywhere except, maybe, in a college classroom, and find out how quickly people refer to you as being &quot;Too negative&quot; or tell you you sound like &quot;Frazier&quot;.]One might say that &quot;The Matrix&quot; calls into question Marcuse's theory because it can be seen as a film that questions contemporary society. But Marcuse felt that Beurocracy is so stiffling that most &quot;negative&quot; critisism in any form is deftly marginalized or co-opted [see &quot;Matrix Reloaded&quot; which is basicly a commercial for &quot;GM&quot; and &quot;Poweraid&quot; and, alas, &quot;Matrix III&quot;...].So Perhaps we live in such a controlled society now that the powers-that-be [dare we call it &quot;Empire&quot;?] know that the majority of work/cell phone/entertainment addled minds won't start a revolution after seeing &quot;The Matrix&quot; or even think past the cool action shots. But some folks are still trying to think and question and this book is a testament to that."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"A few of the essays deal with whether we could be living in the matrix (or some other alternative to the real world). The others use the movie as a springboard to discuss other areas of philosophy, but the connection to the movie is very thin.A few authors tried to argue that we cannot possibly be in the matrix, but I thought their reasons for thinking this were inadequate. I meditated about what I myself believe and came to the following conclusion. A matrix is a logical possibility, but there are plenty of logical possibilities that are not realized in the real world. And how does one choose among numerous logical possibilites? Here's where Occam's Razor applies. The simplest answer is that the world is for the most part what it seems to be. As long as this explanation works and makes sense of things, we might as well prefer it. We gain little by seriously entertaining more complicated possibilities."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"Which will you choose? I chose the pill that was right for me: I bought the book entitled The Matrix and Philosophy in July of 2003. I read this fantastic book from cover to cover with much ease. The author found a very brilliant way to bring an avid fan of the Matrix films closer to the philosophical aspects of the movies and themes.For someone like myself, who is always looking for an excuse to learn something more, I find it much easier to learn about things when they are related to a topic that I care about. I love when new ideas are packaged in a nice soft cover that is intriguing and interesting. After reading countless books that did not have the pace, flow and integrity that this book displays, it was definitely awesome to indulge the content held within The Matrix and Philosophy.This book brings together the best of two worlds, one fantasy and one reality; but who am I to say which one is which? In a very educational, but entertaining way, I became more centered and enlightened. I fully recommend this book to any beginner philosophy scholar, and definitely to any fan of the search down the rabbit hole.The Matrix and Philosophy is like the red pill in a journey that is full of ignorance and bliss. Combining ideas regarding Greek Mythology, Buddhism, Catholicism, wise scholors, and basic morals and principles, while keeping the readers attention.The comparisons and contrasts are easy to relate to, and the language that is portrayed is compelling. Take a look for yourself, the worst that will happen is you might accidentially free your mind!"},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"The Matrix and Philosophy is an outstanding book for someone who basically lives inside their head (as is most of philosophy in general). There is a whole series of these books and three more are in the works. However, I didn't see the book they really need to write, FIGHT CLUB AND PHILOSOPHY. It would be a shame for the authors to overlook publishing a book on that movie. Until then though, there is plenty of brain fodder in Matrix and Philosophy."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"This book contains 20 essays by 20 philosophers covering various parts of the film The Matrix and how they relate to philosophy. The 20 essays are divided into 5 categories. The first group of essays deal with the possibility of the Matrix or some other deceitful reality, the second section includes essays covering implications of The Matrix, the third covers how The Matrix relates to religion and ethics, the fourth section includes the essays covering philosophical themes of The Matrix, and the final section includes essays in which the film is analyzed from different perspectives, including feminism, Marxism, and postmodernism.While almost all of the essays are good, my two favorite essays were #8: \\"Fate, Freedom, and Foreknowledge\\" by Theodore Shick, Jr. and #19: \\"The Matrix Simulation and the Postmodern Age\\" by David Weberman. Both were interesting and thought-provoking.At least two of the essays, though, contain serious flaws. Essay #7: \\"Neo-Materialism and the Death of the Subject\\" by Daniel Barwick is seriously flawed in its critique of reductive materialism. The author quotes a passage from Michael Tye noting the difference between experiencing different colors and merely learning what it's like to experience different colors. This passage and the subsequent discussion of it are relevant neither to reductive materialism or to The Matrix. A more relevant situation would be one in which 2 people perceive what they think is a real tree, but only one of them is actually perceiving a real tree while the other is only receiving computer generated electrical signals that give the false perception of a tree, as what differentiates one's perceptions in reality and The Matrix is not the perceptions themselves, but rather the source of those perceptions. Essay #10: \\"The Religion of The Matrix and the Problems of Pluralism\\" by Gregory Bassham describes the references to religion in The Matrix, and finds the film to be supportive of religious pluralism. While the film does indeed borrow plot and character archetypes from religion, that does not make the film religious or supportive of a view towards religion, such as pluralism or exclusivism. The Wachowskis commented in an interview that the film was about \\"Faith in oneself,\\" which is a non-theist position.It was somewhat annoying how nearly every one of the essayists repeat how The Matrix is similar to Plato's \\"The Cave\\" allegory and how The Matrix is similar to Descartes' malicious demon thought-experiment. Also, in almost every essay the dialogue from the scene in which Cypher is eating the steak while making the deal with Agent Smith is quoted and analyzed. Instead, perhaps, the first 3 essays could have been devoted to 1 of the 3 things exclusively (The first essay is devoted primarily to the \\"The Cave\\" allegory) so they wouldn't have had to be repeated in almost every essay.Also, I was a bit disappointed that none of the essayists noted the more likely, but not nearly as interesting scenario that should, but probably won't, be revealed in the final 3 minutes of the 3rd film: The year is actually 2399, not 2199, and none of the thought to be real events, places, or even people (which no longer exist) are indeed real, and instead everything took place as part of a computer simulation onboard one of the A.I. machines, of what might have happened if the A.I. machines had used human energy to continue their existence on Earth, instead of solar energy that the A.I. machines really use to continue their existence in outer-space, as it floats benignly through space.Overall, though, I enjoyed this book. If you liked the film and are interested in philosophy then I think you'll find this book enjoyable and thought-provoking. If you didn't like The Matrix and are not interested in philosophy or have studied philosophy extensively, then this book probably isn't for you."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"I wanted to say that Dr. Irwin did the best that could possibly be done on this book.

Solipsism, Buddhism, and Christian themes are explored, placing the beloved movie into schemes that all can enjoy.Primarily asking \\"If the matrix could be real?\\" was the main reason why I was interested in this book. Solipsism has always been fascinating to me, and even in my deepest philosophical moments I do consider myself a solipsist. However, I was disappointed with the articles on this subject. Rotten with axiomatic contradictions, I felt that some of the authors were too shallow in their approach to ascertain if our observable world is true.However, I still greatly recommend this book to philosophically minded people."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"For anyone who loved the Matrix. An easy and enjoyable read. Makes philosophy enjoyable and easy to relate to."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"i think this book would be alright for a matrix fan taking their first step into philosophy. but if that is not you, and you expect some kind of growth from a book, i would not suggest reading this."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"The book was strangely pervasive. Chapter by chapter the authors cite the same sources and say the same thing in slightly different ways.About midway through the book, it becomes clear that the chapters have been written by shadow dwellers describing the same shadows that they see from their shackled platonic position in some common academic cave. Perhaps colleagues, wired through some philosopher's conference, brains in brain vats, enjoying the view from a Matrix of their own making...That in itself makes it an interesting read."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"All in all I must say I was entertained by the book and the book did what the author intended to do, spark the reader's interest in philosophy (or in my case respark)What a lot of the negative reviewers seem to miss is the book is not meant to be a serious philosophical work rather it is using the Matrix as a medium to present some major philosophical ideas so the reader can then go out with some information and read some serious philosophical works. Some will say that the candy coating of philosophy goes against the ideals of philosophy, but I disagree.I suggest this book if you enjoyed the Matrix and want to get some reference on some philosophical works that will help you hit the subjects that the Matrix made you think about(whether the creators of this movie intended this or not).On a side note, the only essay I had a problem with is the one by Cynthia Freeland. This essay is the typical Fem-Nazi babble that completely overanalyzes EVERYTHING and puts meanings to items that weren't intended to be perceived that way. Most people who have encountered a Fem-Nazi will know what to expect and unfortunately the sad truth is these Women are hurting their own gender and ultimately this book as well."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"This collection of philosophical essays is a painless introduction to philosophy. Reading it won't necessariy help you ace Philosophy 101 exams, but careful reading will help you see the important points of the movie along with helping you understand basic philosophical concepts.Relating basic philosophical concepts to a popular and enjoyable movie is bound to improve your mind. But don't let that scare you. You'll end up enjoying it immensely.Trust me."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"\\"The Matrix and Philosophy\\" as edited by William Irwin is a comprehensive, detailed and thought-provoking look at philosophy in the digital age, drawing parallels between the \\"Matrix\\" motion picture and older schools of thought, religious dogmas and pragmatic approaches to the way we think and feel. There is far too much information spread out over the 276 pages and 18 chapters to absorb at one time; on the contrary, this book will be with me for many years, as every time I open to a given page, I find something I didn't see before.Based strictly on its technical merit, it is of outstanding literary quality. Who cares if the the reader agrees or disagrees with the arguments and premises. The real genius behind \\"The Matrix and Philosophy\\" is its uncanny ability to get the reader to think beyond the ordinary, to explore deeper regions of consciousness and how the subconscious self is more conscious than we know."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"Of course I bought this book, simply because of the words &quot;The Matrix&quot;, because I am a fan of the movies (well, the first one anyway). I found the philosophy essays in this book, just like in the movies, intriguing and enlightening. They've really helped me in my class and in my life. Of course, such philosophical lessons can also be learned in regular sci-fi and even cyberpunk, such as &quot;Neuromancer&quot; or &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot; or even action-oriented cyberpunk sci-fi like &quot;Darkeye: Cyber Hunter&quot;. All deal with a certain amount of philosophy which is what makes them such good books to own and read. Don't just read what's on the surface of anything fictional, look beneath it."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"I've always been interested in philosophy and was looking for someplace to start. Instead of jumping right in with Plato and the like and finding myself over my head, I decided to try out this book. I like the Matrix and am intrigued by the philisophical questions it raises, so this book seemed like a logical choice.Even though this book had its bad parts--like with the angry feminist expressing her distain for the Matrix because a male is the hero, and her praise for another because the male is &quot;penetrated&quot; in a disturbing way--I think it fulfilled the purpose I had in mind."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"Read into it what you will: \\"The Matrix and Philosophy\\" turns to a gimmicky form by offering a volume on philosophy by employing themes from a blockbuster movie. Is this an effective way to educate the philosophically-anemic culture in the study of ideas? An attempt to disguise boring topics or distract the reader from the fact that they are partaking of deep philosophical notions? Yes and no. For the Matrix films embedded various philosophical and religious themes from a wide range of sources that is both appealing and educational.This engaging volume discusses philosophical themes within the Matrix movies including:- Rationalism V empiricism- Realism V anti-realism- Materialism- Buddhism- Holists- Christianity.This is a fabulous tool to bring the non-philosopher in touch with many of the most important ideas in history. This compilation delivers an easy-to-understand volume that will promote the pondering of life's most important issues.Chapters include:- Neo and Socrates- Seeing and believing- The metaphysics of The Matrix- Philosophy of the Mind- Fate, freedom, and foreknowledge- and numerous other fascinating topics.I enjoyed the movies and this book was a great delight. Today this book can be purchased at a very low cost, yet I'm still glad I bought it and I paid the listing price.The Necessary Existence of God: The Proof of Christianity Through Presuppositional Apologetics"},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"As a rookie to philosophy who thoroughly enjoyed the Batman and Watchmen entries in this Pop Culture and Philosophy series, I found this particular book to be a less enjoyable read, though not so bad that I stopped reading it.The book is a collection of essays, some of which - such as an early one that explores the Matrix and how it relates to Plato's cave - are very good reads, but these are interspersed with essays that are overly technical, boring or that take a tangent and run with it, leaving the movie in the dust.Lovers of philosophy will love this book. Lovers of the movie that aren't philosophy buffs will fall into two camps - they will either hate it or think it's just okay. You can enjoy the movie without thinking too hard about it - not so with this book, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but not necessarily a good thing either."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"I just discovered this series two years ago with Seinfeld and Philosophy and then moved on to The Simpsons and Philosophy. When I heard about the release of The Matrix and Philosophy, I was excited to check it out and it did not disappoint. This series is perfect for those like myself, that have an interest in philosophy but don't know exactly where to start. I'm always looking for sources that can take complex subjects and present them in an informative yet entertaining manner. The Matrix and Philosophy and the others in the series do exactly that by taking scenes from pop culture and helping us understand philosophical dialogue through those scenes. I'm looking forward to whatever this series has coming next."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"If you are looking for a book that details the Philosophy of The Matrix movie, this book isn't for you. I thought that The Matrix raised some unique and interesting philosphical questions that I wanted to see expanded, so I bought this book. While parts of this book are interesting and well-written, most of it relates to how The Matrix interacts with other philosphical models that we are already familiar with. Each chapter is written by a different author, with a different perspective on the movie. Particularly irritating was an essay that should have been entitled \\"Why eXistenZ is a better movie than The Matrix.\\"As I said, parts of this book were interesting, but much of it wasn't. Also, it seemed like each contributor had to reference the scene where Cyber decides to betray his friends to Agent Smith as part of their contract, because it comes up many, many times."},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"It's kind of disrturbing if you are a imaginary kind of person, can't take you to mind trips you donpt need before you go to bed how ever it's a good lecture"},{"Title":"The Matrix and Philosophy","review":"This book looks at 'The Matrix' and philosophical questions in relation to it. It has a collection of essays by various authors and whilst most of these are very readable and clear, I found at least 3 to be poorly written and so 'Up' themselves that they imparted little worthwhile thoughts or insight. The editors essay was especially good as an introduction to the book and if he had written the rest then this could have been a stronger overall package. The essays were also quite repetitive, using the same quotes to justify their points to the extent that it got tedious reading them again and again. There is only so many 'splinter in your mind' and Cyphers ignorance at being plugged back in to the matrix references you can read in any one book, however much a fan of the film you are. Be aware this only covers the first film and I believe that there is another book in the series looking at the sequels, but based on this one I won't be tracking that down any time soon. For huge fans of the film this may be a good read, but for those interested in philosophical question raised by the matrix, any good introduction to philosophy book will serve just as well. If you'd like to explore the philosophical and scientific ideas behind this film more then I'd suggest 'Taking the Red Pill' by Glenn Yeffeth and David Gerrold as it is clearer and much more engaging. An OK book, but not outstanding.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Freehand 10 f/x & Design","review":"This is a book that you wish wouldn't end because each chapter is flush with technical and artistic lessons of enormous practical value. Mr. Rockwell teaches you how to use paths and points in remarkably sophisticated ways to simulate reality. He covers the most complex FreeHand operations and manipulations in a style that is thoughtful, instructive, and easy to follow. How often does one encounter a skillful artist, adept technician, and superior communicator all in the same skin?If you have a serious interest in refining your vector skills, and if you take pleasure in artistic discovery, then get hold of this book and don't let it go until you've read it all. But be forewarned: you may find yourself using FreeHand in ways you never thought imaginable. You may even find yourself preferring paths and points to pixels and paintbrushes!"},{"Title":"Freehand 10 f/x & Design","review":"Finally, a real illustrator who can write too!! This book is packed full of inspiring real world desgins. The author then proceeds to teach us how to produce these top class images using FreeHand.Instead of teaching how to use FreeHand it is an INTERMEDIATE book which shows you how to do cut-out designs, theres a car, a bird, a realistic jewel case, products with labels added and much more. If you go to a bookstore, browse the 32 page color section and you'll be blown away with the quality of the projects contained in this book.There is photorealism, drawing with stylized brushes, wonderful perspective projects, 3D for the web, using envelops and TONS more.This is the book to get if you are already comfortable with FreeHand and want to expand your creative abilities."},{"Title":"The Acoustic Guitar Method, Complete Edition Book (String Letter Publishing) (Acoustic Guitar) (Acoustic Guitar (String Letter))","review":"I love this book and 3-CD set, but everyone learns their own way. What worked for me in this approach was the following: Mr. Hamburger includes a great amount of discussion with each lesson, belaboring how to transition from, say, a particular D chord fingering to a G chord, spelling out which finger to move when and where. There are small but clear photographs showing the appropriate finger position for chords and strumming positions. He anticipates the kinds of problems that you are likely to have, and offers clear suggestions on how to overcome them. He structures the lessons in a way that they build logically on each other. When he illustrates the music on the CD, he plays exactly what is in the lesson -- no embellishments to show his stuff, just clear examples of what you should be playing. He plays each tune at the right speed, and then replays the tune at the slow speed that he expects the student to begin with. It is easy to play along with Mr. Hamburger as you learn. The full course introduces all the usual topics for acoustic guitar, including basic strumming, introductory finger picking and flat picking, pull-offs, hammer-ons, etc. The coverage is not in-depth enough to make you a master, but it is detailed enough to get you a first-year level of understanding by the time you complete the third book.The music used throughout is traditional American music, \\"folk,\\" if you will. If you are anxious to start your own garage rock band, this may not be the music of choice for you. If you do choose to learn guitar playing from this, you should supplement the text with some music theory....I cannot think of anything in the lesson book that I thought was inappropriate. You aren't likely to find everything you would ever want to know about guitar in one place. But if you do, this book will be \\"volume one\\" of that library."},{"Title":"The Acoustic Guitar Method, Complete Edition Book (String Letter Publishing) (Acoustic Guitar) (Acoustic Guitar (String Letter))","review":"I recommend this book for anyone who is picking up a guitar for the first time, but already has some basic knowledge of music notation. It gets you up to speed right away playing simple roots and folk songs, and emphasizes beginner drills, such as switching back and forth between two chords over and over until you can do it smoothly.This book might also be nice for a beginner who has some guitar experience and is looking for a colletion of folk-style songs to learn and practice"},{"Title":"The Acoustic Guitar Method, Complete Edition Book (String Letter Publishing) (Acoustic Guitar) (Acoustic Guitar (String Letter))","review":"Hamburger does a good job of pacing things for beginners. Enough songs to keep you interested & focused on mastering basic skills, but not so much that you get overwhelmed. A good instroduction to the basic elements that define various folk styles. Also, as another reviewer points out, there are many practice tracks on the CDs, at least one for each exercise leading up to the featured songs and including recordings of simple SLOW strumming of each chord as it's introduced. This might seem like overkill to some, but for anyone who's new to learning to play an instrument, the first great lesson to learn is PRACTICE SLOWLY. Hamburger demonstrates this principle well! Also, playing along with the tracks helps develop solid timing and it's a little more interesting than strumming along to your metronome. If the flatpicking version of Sally Goodin is simple, well, that's because it's for BEGINNING players. Once I mastered Hamburger's simple arrangement, I was able to HEAR better when listening to other recordings of the tune and understand how fiddlers and guitarists and others have embellished and expanded it through improv over generations. It didn't take long before I started experimenting with adding to the arrangement myself--but you have to start at the bottom. He also does a good job of emphasizing the need to learn clear chord changes, something that's best learned a few chords at a time and that can save you a lot of frustration down the road if you focus on it from the start. I appreciate the emphasis on quality of sound in the early stages rather than on pages of chord diagrams.The layout of the book itself is very clean and easy to read--something many other methods could improve on. My only \\"complaint\\" is the stiff binding--spiral would have been nice.There's not much theory here, but I had theory from other sources before I started learning the guitar. I'm not sure how this method would look to someone who doesn't know music basics already. It's been so long since I had my first do-re-mi lesson that I can't quite picture the world without solfege anymore. As a general intro to folk guitar, this one's as good as the best I've seen."},{"Title":"The Acoustic Guitar Method, Complete Edition Book (String Letter Publishing) (Acoustic Guitar) (Acoustic Guitar (String Letter))","review":"David Hamburger has put together a wonderful beginning course for those that want to learn to play the acoustic guitar. I have the book and the DVD set. Each, on their own, is a VERY good resource. Together they are fantastic. Everything positive that is said about this course in the other reviews is absolutely true. Whether you read the book or watch the video, Hamburger comes off as someone who has thought about the best way to communicate to a new learner. The extras on essential listening and other information just make this superb instructional material that much better.If you are thinking about buying this material don't hesitate. Get it today. You'll be glad that you did."},{"Title":"The Acoustic Guitar Method, Complete Edition Book (String Letter Publishing) (Acoustic Guitar) (Acoustic Guitar (String Letter))","review":"I've strummed my acoustic guitar since the heyday of the Kingston Trio, briefly taking lessons, and plowing through Lord knows how many \\"easy guitar method\\" books.But only after I stumbled onto Hamburger's book did I really begin to play. His common sense explanations, practice exercises and recorded examples--played a tempo and then slow--have given me confidence. While his lessons are basic, the text is rooted in serious musicianship and musical theory, and does not insult my intelligence as an experienced choral singer.I've learned more from Hamburger's book in a a few weeks than I had in40 years."},{"Title":"The Acoustic Guitar Method, Complete Edition Book (String Letter Publishing) (Acoustic Guitar) (Acoustic Guitar (String Letter))","review":"About a year ago I got a wild hair and decided to buy a guitar. I ended up getting a used Taylor Big Baby. First and only instrument I've really tried to learn how to play. Since I can't afford lessons, I got this book. I'm most of the way through it and am quite happy with the instruction I've received so far. I'm not sure that an intermediate guitarist would get a lot from this book that they couldn't get from better sources, but for a beginner I think it's great.Unlike another book/CD combo I got, Hamburger has you immediately start playing songs. Very simple songs, granted, but songs nonetheless, which is very satisfying as a rank beginner who isn't sure they want to put the effort into really learning how to play guitar (and it does take A LOT of effort). He teaches how to play some really wonderful old folk songs, mostly American, but also at least one English. I've learned how to play quite a few of them so far, including two of my favorites, Scarborough Fair and House of the Rising Sun. I've also learned a bunch of chords and some strumming and finger-picking patterns, and how to read tablature (I'm afraid I skipped the notation reading part). Am I ready to go on the road? Hardly. But I feel like Hamburger has given me a solid foundation on which to build more advanced skills. I've even been able to jam (sort of) with a friend who's been playing for many years.I would definitely have liked more strumming patterns. He shows you a couple, but I wish there were more. Learning different strumming patterns from my friend and from websites really added new life to the songs I learned from Hamburger's book. He might also have briefly shown more complex versions of some of the songs. He wouldn't have to break it down step by step like he does with the basic versions, but a taste of what is possible would have been nice. He does at least offer suggestions for albums to buy if you want to hear the professionals play the songs he teaches you---hearing Ralph Stanley sing Man of Constant Sorrow was definitely inspiring.For a total beginner, I highly recommend this book. It's a lot of fun. I've not only learned how to play guitar, I've learned a lot about American folk music. I definitely plan on checking out his other books once I'm finished with this one."},{"Title":"The Acoustic Guitar Method, Complete Edition Book (String Letter Publishing) (Acoustic Guitar) (Acoustic Guitar (String Letter))","review":"This is an excellent resource for a beginning guitarist. I've been playing off and on for more than 25 years, but when my 11-year-old expressed an interest in playing guitar, I wasn't sure where to start (after teaching him \\"Wild Thing\\" of course). I needed a well structured, engaging instructional set that we could work through together. I headed to the library and a couple of book and music stores to page through everything they had. This was the only book/CD method that really fit the bill. It assumes no prior knowledge of the instrument, has clear, concise lessons that build naturally upon one another, uses real songs rather than just chords and scales and -- as an added bonus -- is based on the styles of music I generally play (blues & bluegrass), so it's pretty familiar territory.It is working out wonderfully. My son likes the pace and the songs (mostly), I have a good roadmap for teaching him and we're having a great time going through it together.This would not be a great method for a kid wanting to learn on his own or someone who wasn't into roots music. If you have any prior knowledge of the guitar, the pace is excruciatingly slow, but it is perfect for a total beginner. The only real downside is the binding. It's hard to keep the book open while reviewing the lessons. Spiral binding would have made the book much easier to use."},{"Title":"The Acoustic Guitar Method, Complete Edition Book (String Letter Publishing) (Acoustic Guitar) (Acoustic Guitar (String Letter))","review":"This book is excellent for beginning to intermediate acoustic guitarists 10 yrs. old and up.

The author has no regard for film writing let alone proper use of the English language.The most interesting part of the book is the selection of \\"top\\"s lists but the rest of the book is nonsensical and completely out of step with most current thinking on film noir and much of cinema in general.

Fortunately for the reader, this is a feat O'Daly has accomplished in all his translations of Neruda's posthumous poetry. Compare this work to Ben Belitt's butcherous acts of translation in his &quot;Five Decades&quot; and you will know what a treasure O'Daly's work truly is. Anyone with any knowledge of the Spanish language will see what twisted mutations Belitt has given birth to in his translations. By comparison O'Daly preserves the tone and wonder of Neruda's incantations to life and love. For anyone seeking a start to Neruda, O'Daly's translations by Copper Canyon Press are indispensable gifts.

I can't speak of the quality of the translations but the poems are superb. Written after being diagnosed with cancer, these poems offer a certain decision to live (\\"Now and then, I am happy!\\"), and a certain freedom. There is a poem of the Ostrogodo family that \\"spoke so often of the dead ... that a strange thing happened\\"., of \\"a naked man who lived for many long years\\", \\"a poem of lightening and of disasters of raining ash\\", of \\"dismantled Cervantes\\", and a life in the suburbs.

It is easy to see why he would be jealous...Indigenous Americans had the most advanced civilizations in the world as of 1519.The largest city in the world was Mexico-Tenochtitlan. The Mexica had the largest library in the world with information on more subjects than any other civilization. (Soustelle) They were also more advanced in medicine than Europeans. (Soustelle) The Aztec/Mayan calendars are still the most accurate calendars in the world. (Mann) Ancient Mexicans genetically engineered maize in man's first and greatest feat of genetic engineering. (Mann) Mayans invented the concept of 0 before any other civilization on Earth...Europeans did not understand it until recently. (Mann) They were also the greatest mathematicians the world has ever seen. The Olmecs knew that the Earth was round thousands of years before it was accepted in Europe. The Aztec pyramids are the largest in the world. Caral, in South America, will probably be proven to be the oldest of Earth's civilizations. The pyramids at Caral are older than any in Egypt.

I looked forward to reading it, because the book topics are all close to my heart and are applications I use multiple times daily. The one hyperlink (to \\"citations\\") doesn't work. The formatting of the article is bad and makes it difficult to read--headings are not bolded, spacing is poor, no bullets in the very long list of \\"resources\\". And there are no hyperlinks to ANY of the web sites, products or companies listed in the extensive list at the end.The article's content is mundane at best. Nothing new, and written in a very pedantic style that treats the reader as if they know nothing of the technologies being discussed. \\"While the iPod is currently the market leader, there are many more digital music players.\\" Some of the thought leaders on the named topics are not even cited. The article is touted to be 3,800+ words long...but 1/3 of those words are simply a list of \\"resources\\", under difficult to find headings, with no hyperlinks. Anyone publishing an \\"E\\" document these days must do better than that. There's very little value. I requested a refund. If the book is published in the same style/format as the article, then save your money--unless you have never read anything on P2P, genX gaming, and IM. If you have been living under a rock for the past 10 years, this book is for you."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"This book is mostly interesting, from a historical perspective, as it looks into our post- 9/11 mindset. I strongly suspect that Maher would write an entirely different book on the topic today, in hindsight. I can' t imagine he remains comfortable with his attitude about profiling, as just one example. Parts of it were actually uncomfortable to read as we approach the 11 year Anniversary of the attack."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"While there were some rants that I didn't agree with, for the most part, I found myself agreeing to alot of what Maher had to say here. Written not long after 9/11 he has some great points about terrorism, national security and the way forward which, sadly, still ring true today (we've made a stunning lack of progress). It made me realize just how far we have to go.I recently read and reviewed America Alone (another book I really enjoyed, by conservative author Mark Steyn), which makes some of the same points that Maher, a liberal writer and pundit, makes in this book (which is to say the over-arching theme that too many Americans claim not to \\"do politics\\"). But both authors argue it's not (solely) about politics. It's about waking up, not believing everything you're sold in the media, doing your own fact-checking and becoming an educated citizen of the world. It's an obligation, not a demand on your free-time.Some crass remarks and language, but otherwise recommended."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I've enjoyed watching Bill Mahar on his various TV shows, and while I don't always agree with his politics, he can make be both laugh and think. I was intrigued by the premise of this book, a collection of \\"propaganda\\" posters modelled after those produced during WWII, to show the American people what they can do to contribute to the War on Terrorism. Beginning in the months right after the September 11th attacks, I've believed that the messages we were hering and the choices we were making seemed to be at odds with being at war. We moved on, almost as if nothing had happened, no one was asked to make any sacrifices. It seemed like (actually, still seems like) a strange way to fight a war.This book is full of Mahar's characteristic sarcasm and biting irony, and his fans are sure to love it. But even thoughtful people who disagree with him should find this book of interest. If you look beyond the attempts at humor, there are a number of issues here that merit debate, a debate that we have, thus far, largely avoided. Whether Mahar is right or not, a public debate on these issues would be healthy for the country, and might actually help us improve security in meaningful ways while also reducing the need for it. While the book may have been rushed to the presses in order to prevent it from being overtaken by events, it has weathered the passage of time well, and still remains pretty relevant to current conditions."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Someone once said that he has never met a smart man as funny or a funny man as smart as Bill Maher. \\"Politically Incorrect\\" was on of the most brilliant programs on TV. It gave a forum for political discussion with a comic twist. It was disappointing that ABC and everyone else misunderstood what he said about the 9/11 terrorists. This book does an excellent job telling the American people exactly what the government should be telling us (as the title suggests it does). Bill Maher's views are liberal, but thats just what this country needs."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Although this book has its share of problems, it is a must read because it is wildly entertaining and because it raises all the right questions about what Americans can really do to win the 'War on Terrorism'. Bill Maher uses language and imagery to contrast the current 'War on Terrorism' against the backdrop of the two world wars and the Cold War and to argue that unlike the present situation, Americans actually got involved back then and did something that is inconceivable today'they made sacrifices. Maher's book is divided into a series of brief, humorous essays (no more than three pages in length) each of which is illustrated with vintage style war posters that contain messages and slogans about the 'War on Terrorism'.Some of Maher's more trenchant arguments are:MAKE SACRIFICESWars are won by uniting and making sacrifices, so why not carpool as civilians did during WW II (hence the title of this book) instead of driving alone? Also, why not give up SUVs and other idiotic vanity vehicles in favor of fuel efficient ones that will reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern oil, which is one of Al Quaeda's prime sources of revenue.PROTECT THE CITIZENSIf the president gets a secret service, why can't we? Put real security in our airports like Israel does.PERFORM INTELLIGENT SEARCHESAt the risk of being offensive, search likely suspects at airports, not random people including old women and children.THE 'WAR ON DRUGS' IS REALLY STUPIDWhy are we investing billions of dollars and lots of resources making sure cancer victims can't smoke pot when we could be directing all of that money and resources toward protecting civilians at home? Besides, it doesn't work and it simply makes more people hate us.UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE HATEDPeople are attacking us for a reason. Try to understand what that reason is, don't just resort to comfort and clich&eacute;s.Maher's book also contains its share of flaws. I completely agree with Maher's criticism of politically correct ideology and agree with him that replacing common sense with sensitivity does not solve any problems. In some cases however, Maher misses the boat not because his arguments are insensitive but simply because they are ignorant. Here are a few examples:THOSE ...MOSLEMS!Maher argues that there is nothing wrong with criticizing Islam since among other things it is brutally repressive toward women. What he fails to consider is that there is no monolithic Islam that doles out the same repressive behavior the world over. The Taliban, the Saudi royal family, and Bin Laden are followers of Wahhabism, a virulent, fundamentalist sect in Islam. They have been frequently criticized by high ranking Suni and Shiite clerics who, among other things, condemned their treatment of women as unislamic. To equate all of Islam with the behavior of the Taliban (as Maher does) is to ignore this fact.IT'S A CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONSMaher, like Samuel Huntington, argues that we are experiencing a clash of civilizations and that the 'War on Terrorism' is a struggle between two conflicting cultures, the West and Islam. As Tariq Ali, Edward Said, and Howard Zinn aptly point out, religion does play an important ideological role in this conflict, but it is essentially a political one. Sure, the 9/11 terrorist were religiously motivated to sacrifice their lives, but their targets (the centers of finance, military planning and probably of government) were political ones. Similarly, while Bin Laden uses Islam as his rallying cry and justification, his goals are flagrantly political as evidenced by his statement that America would know security at home when the people of the Middle East knew security in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Palestine.TAKE SADDAM OUTMaher indicates that since Saddam Hussein is developing nuclear weapons and must be stopped this is no time for sensitivity. He would probably do well to read the reports of the highly insensitive and highly informed Scott Ridder, which argue that Iraq was thoroughly disarmed and posses no threat. (Ridder is a marine veteran and former intelligence officer who played a leading role in disarming Iraq after the Gulf War. He is a Republican who voted for George W. Bush in 2000 and believes war with Iraq is unwarranted.)The strength of this book lies not so much in the fact that it provides all of the right answers but that it asks all of the right questions. Despite its flaws this book is intelligent, wildly funny and definitely worth reading. I strongly recommend however, that you read this book intelligently and skeptically, not with total acceptance. Maher would probably be the first to agree with this suggestion."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"It is refreshing to read Bill Maher, a USA citizen saying to the fine, caring and patriotic people of the USA what the rest of us, who hurt with you in the pain of 9/11, can't say with authority...The real world is not a nice place! Everywhere outside of the USA is not created just to be a thene park for the USA.Ouch.. Bill is poking stuff that hurts..I have many friends from the US. They are my loyalist and closest friends, much more loyal than my local friends, but as a culture, get some perspective from someone on the inside who knows!Onya Bill!"},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Scathing, politically incorrect, insightful, blasphemous, inspiring! What a great book. Bill Maher pulls no punches and you will not agree with everything he has to say. BUT HE IS NOT AFRAID TO SAY IT in order to start the much-needed debate. The ability to dissent and voice opinions publicly is what makes America great and what we all need to be defending. I'm planning to give this book as a Christmas gift to all my friends who are frustrated by their inability to actively participate in the War on Terrorism."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Who else but Bill Maher would have the guts to publish a book like this? Very few...Whether you love him or hate him, I highly encourage you to get this very provacative book.

Not only is WHEN YOU RIDE ALONE available in hardcover, but it's also available on audio...so I've been able to read and listen to my favorite pundit. I love the way he makes me think...and his views should become a rally cry for each and every one of us during these horrendous times. The posters are amazing. They are destined to become true classics!"},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I enjoyed this book. Bill Maher speaks with common sense, and total frankness; total unpolitical bluntness.Example: \\"Does anyone care if we trade with Cuba?Using great examples, such as JFK stating, the U.S. had the goal of putting a man on the moon, at the end of the decade; so should the Bush Administration have a goal to end the U.S.'s dependence on foreign Oil. ( Great idea Bill)Bill's title explains the obvious we see everyday. The majority of Americans, would rather see 200,000 American soldiers, and an equal number of Iraq Soldiers, ( or civilians); die, so they could have cheap gas.Yes, I know---that is a horrible statement; but I have to agree with Bill Maher on this. Most Americans are too used to the luxery; especially the present, \\"I\\" generation, that they refuse to make any personal sacrifices that could avert a war.Americans are giving; but ONLY TO A POINT; as one philosopher in the book stated, If most Wealthy Americans had to choose between letting a child starve, or their Mercedes; they'd choose their Mercedes. ( Actually, in the broad scheme of things; it is my opinion, that is happening now!)One has to wonder, if people living in other countries feel this way about Americans!This book is a short read, I found it politically nuetral, as far as endorsing or 'bashing' either party.I feel it is well worth the time reading it."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I find it extremely amusing that the very political correctness that Bill Maher writes about in his book are used to determine the content of customer reviews on this site. In my review I made a non-spiteful remark about Arabs and had it removed from the final version, while on the same page my review appears on, another customer makes a derogatory remark about \\"liberal Jews\\". I think Bill Maher would find this ironic as it epitomizes the political correctness that has infested our society. Is it in your opinion ok to defame one group while protecting another? If you insist upon being politically correct, please apply it equally to all.Maher does an excellent job of saying what everybody else is thinking, or should be thinking that is. He is right on by critcizing the way our government and our people have responded in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks.He points out that we as Americans are not nearly as angry as we should be and are way too concerned with being polite and afraid to hurt anyones feelings than with dealing with the real issues. We know who our enemies are, so let's face it and go after them. If more people would listen to Bill and get rid of those SUV's we might actually be winning this war and not supporting the ... every time we fill up our cars with their oil!Keep telling the truth Bill, hopefully enough people will listen and we may actually win this war!The only problem I had with this book was that it was too short! I would have given it 5 stars if it were longer!"},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"This book is a collection of essays illustrated with posters that are take-offs on WWII-era posters. Maher challenges us to think about how we have not been asked to sacrifice or step forward in the war on terrorism as citizens were in other wars in our country's past. He also challenges the administration's actions (or lack thereof) on several fronts.I didn't agree with every essay, but I did find each one thought-provoking. Wouldn't it be grand if such a book could spur discussion and action on levels from local to international?"},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Maher shows no hesitation in proclaiming his constitutional right to criticize our government and policies in the exercise of genuine patriotism. In so many words he is yelling at the American frogs to stop being so stupid and complacent and to jump out of the pot as the heat is clearly increasing and we clearly risk being boiled alive.The historical allusions, metaphors, and ironies of this collection of essays are creative and brilliant. Throughout them he lampoons the empty promises of the government and corporate sector (aren't they one?), the deliberately misleading finger pointing, and its baldly obvious lies designed to promote corporate wealth and to divert attention from the real causes of the world's rage against the United States. However, he doesn't just take shots at the government and industry, he lays the blame appropriately on our compliance in a vapid, self centered culture which chooses to remain blind to the ramifications of gross overconsumption of fossil fuels, and our military policies to keep them cheap for our convenience. He points out our obliviousness to our disproportionate domination and waste of many of the world's other resources while people starve, freeze, and die of poor health.However, Maher's rant is alleviated, and his love of country and patriotism are illustrated by his noting the hypocracy of much of the rest of the first world's criticism of the US domination over things such as alleged \\"cultural imperialism\\", which he accurately dismisses as inaccurate as well as emanating from clear jealousy. He observes how the US chooses in its own, perhaps inconsistent way, to act as a more humane imperial power than the other nations that over history have held this distinction. He also notes, that much of the hate for the US by the first as well as third world is largely due to our self absorption, and complete disinterest in other peoples.This is a strong dose of truth, \\"sweetened\\" by Maher's scathing but delightful sardonic wit. However, it will surely only appeal to those who already agree with his position."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"We can only hope that the tile \\"When You Ride Alone You Ride with Bin Laden\\" becomes famous. It perfectly reminds us in a pithy and most accurate manner how Osama bin Ladin obtains most of his funding. Bill Maher's well thought out opinions should not be simply dismissed as that of someone representing the left wing of the political spectrum. Indeed, the man is not always kind to his fellow Liberals. So much so, that I wonder how the author got radical Leftist Michael Moore to endorse this book. How can they even be on pleasant speaking terms? I am a neo-Conservative who is appalled by the indifference of those unwilling to think seriously about the fuel efficiency of the vehicles they drive. Our enemies are indeed greatly helped every time we foolishly waste oil products. Since when did Americans feel it unnecessary to make sacrifices during wartime? And yes, where is the sense of community spirit that should be the norm in times such as these? Maher is also right to criticize our nation's ludicrous \\"war on drugs\\" and question the politically correct premises of our airport security officials who hesitate to search those who are more likely to commit terrorist acts.Sadly, however, Bill Maher does not give due respect to great scholars like Bernard Lewis. He wishes to explore the reasons why our enemies hate us, but this is virtually impossible unless one reads Lewis' perspicacious \\"What Went Wrong.\\" The blame America first crowd totally misunderstands the true reasons motivating the terrorists. These Muslim fascists are not particularly enraged because of any past actions of the United States government. Heck, they are the last people desiring to form a secular and democratic cultural milieu. They are instead embittered that the Islamic world has lost its preeminence in the arts, sciences, and political power. In other words, they are on the losing side of history. The very existence of a successfully Jewish governed Israel demolishes their bigoted feelings of racial and theological superiority. Maher has written a thought provoking work that should not be ignored. You should pick up a copy. I also hope he returns to TV in the very near future."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"It's good to see Bill Maher back in action after his excellent show was unjustly cancelled by ... ABC. It's a sad commentary on our society when a unique and intelligent show like Politically Incorrect is pushed aside while the airwaves are saturated with cheesy reality shows, [bad] sit-coms, Jerry Springer-like talk shows, and dumbed down newscasts. If you never watched Politically Incorrect you should definitely get this book, because Bill Maher knows his stuff and he says things you won't hear in the mainstream media. And his opinions aren't tainted by a strict liberal or conservative viewpoint. He looks at each issue individually and takes a stand. One of the important points he makes is that the terrorists are funded primarily through the sale of oil, and the more oil we use the stronger they become. It's obvious that SUVs aren't helping anyone, but listen to this: It takes eleven gallons of oil to burn one 75-watt light bulb for a year. In how many American homes, and especially businesses, are the lights left on when nobody's in the room? My only criticism of this book is that it's too short, and the chapters don't go into enough detail about the particular issues they discuss. You can tell by the way the book is laid out that they really tried to stretch it."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"This is one funny book to read, especially the posters. You're unlikely to agree with everything Maher said in the book but it's guaranteed to make you think and hopefully it will also make you alter some of your behaviors that will at the end make this a stronger nation."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I sat down on Christmas evening to read this book and could not tear myself away from it. Maher hits it on the nose. Whether it's our American inclination toward excess or the government's pseudo-attempts to increase national security (on the buget plan, ofcourse). Like Maher, I love my country, which is why I'm not interested in ignoring it's problems.I enjoyed Maher's ABC program, Politically Incorrect, (I no longer watch ABC since they didn't have the back bone to stand up for him) and I look forward to seeing him on television again. By the way, anyone who thinks Maher actually called American pilots &quot;cowards&quot; obviously did not see the show and have not bothered to double check the rumors they've heard. NOW excuse me while I order the rest of his books."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Maher is a comedian and a social critic. So why is he criticised for being critical and funny?Two issues initially drew me to this book: First, the book is endorsed by extremists on both sides, including arch-enemies Al Franken and Ann Coulter.Second, the critics often bring out absurd attacks against the author himself (his friendships with Hugh Hefner or Michael Moore, or personal dislikes of the author). This is often the mark of a good book, as critics can't take him so well on specific issues, so they just use personal attacks.Maher probably has personal issues. But this is to review his book, not his existence. His libertarian ideas are refreshing.One piece of advice: books by comedians like Franken and Maher gain a lot with delivery. Consider getting the audio."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"When reading this book I thought Maher was extactly right when speaking about religion and the war. He points out that religion has everything to do with terror. As a liberal I found his \\"I don't respect religion\\" comments to be right on. Fairy tales and myths along with circular logic have doomed the world and American politics. The extreme right with their politics dictated by their interpretation of nonsense have taken control of the adminstration. Maher's next book should examine the role of Religion in America in his own special way.Great book"},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Like the WWII posters he espouses, Bill Maher's latest book is short, sweet and to the point. I'm glad someone has finally brought to light the pure irony of the disgustingly naive and useless act of driving around in a Selfish-Utility-Vehicle plastered with old glory. Overall, It's pretty light fair. Unfortunatley, that's the only way to get the vast majority to take notice. I'm give copies to my lazy apolitical family for Christmas.Understanding the famously short attention span of most Americans, Bill Maher shoots from the hip but his aim is true."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Please keep in mind, my review of this book is just over 10 years after 911 happened. I usually agree wholeheartedly with Maher's point of view but given time to reevaluate 911 with greater hindsight, I would think that even Maher would want a rewrite of this book."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Maher's book was very eye-opening for me, especiallythe section on \\"Why They Hate Us\\". Suggestions for fightingterrorism by conserving gas and other sources of energy,as well as thinking twice before buying diamonds, issomething that all Americans should seriously consider. The patriotism and \\"who is a hero\\" is interesting as well.I didn't like Maher straying into the drug issue (although I agree with his points), and at times he is overly-critical of America, trying to cover EVERYTHING that is wrong with our country in one short book.The format of putting his most provocative statement from each chapter in large print at the end of the chapter was plain laughable. It suggests the reader isn't actually reading the full content.Although I just gave it 3 stars (it's almost a four), I think it is overall a good reality check for Americans."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"You know what I like about Bill Maher? He's never afraid to say what's on his mind. Racial profiling a good thing? According to Bill, in some cases it is. He also rants about crummy airport security, wasting money on 'the war on drugs', & how 9/11 was politically motivated, not religiously motivated. (Bin Laden doesn't really care about Islam?)Well worth it if you're a fan. If not, don't bother. You either 'get him' or you don't. And if you like politically incorrect views, you may also like these other books, \\"No One's Even Bleeding\\" & \\"Delano\\"."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I'll admit to sorely missing Maher's show, not because I agree with all or even most of what was stated, but rather because the show brings up topics that *need* discussion. This book is a nice summary of many of the points presented on the show - agree with them or not, I don't care; what I *do* care is that we all *think* about what we read about in the news. Engage our brains.Today, we are buried in &quot;reality&quot; shows that are anything *but* (set up a totally unrealistic situation that blatantly caters to the lowest attributes of people, pitting them against each other - not in a purer sense of athletics or academics, but in a nasty, backstabbing way - and then shove a camera up front and close). If you enjoy mindless drivel - Survivor, Bachelor, Mole, Big Brother, ..., ... - then stay in your stupor, feeling better about yourself through the travails of others. If you want to actually engage your mind, reading this book is one of many things you can constructively do.Every time we talk about a tough problem, we move toward a solution."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Every American should read this, helps us understand more about why opther countries view us the way they do, and what he says is true, just think about it."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I found this in a bookshop at Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport. The cover did it's job by reminding me of WW2 patriotic posters, and I found myself almost reading the whole thing before I even bought it. Good sense (and an impending departure) prevailed, and I devoured it on my flight to Allentown.For those who never saw his program \\"Politically Incorrect\\", you missed a gem of a show. This book is your opportunity to make up for what you've lost. I doubt that you, no more than I, will agree with everything in the book. My advice: Take three ideas for action from this book and make them your goal to achieve them and so defeat the terrorist threats to western civilization."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"It does not matter whether you completely agree with Maher or not, this book is a must read for 2003. The best book I have read this year! He may not always hit a home run, but he sure gets you thinking, and that's the point. It's time to get off the couch, away from wrestling and football, and strt thinking about what kind of government we really want and what we are going to do to make it happen. This book would make a great text for High School Civics, if they still teach that. Quit letting others make the rules by which we live -- let's get involved!"},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"This is an incredibly good book! Bill Maher says what many people are afraid to say and most of us don't want to hear. This is an honest and frank look at America and the world. Unfortunately, many who read this book will not change their actions which perpetuate misery in the world, from being gluttonous and insensitive to not speaking out against religions that give sanction to mistreating people. While I don't agree with everything he says, Bill Maher is the kind of honest, intelligent person that we need leading this country. Unfortunately, honesty and intelligence appear to be detriments to getting elected in the US."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I listened to the audiobook version of Bill Maher's book (three cassettes, unabridged) and found it to be both thoughtful and very entertaining. Maher reads aloud the essays from his book in an energetic and engaging manner that makes you forget he's reading a prepared text at all. The nature of the book- lots of short essays on a variety of topics- reminded me a bit of Dennis Miller's various &quot;Rants&quot; books, but here the emphasis is less on comedy and more on making interesting points about various aspects of the post-911 world. But don't worry, the heavy topics are definitely balanced with some laugh-out-loud humor; in fact, Maher usually uses that humor to punctuate and underline his most serious points. In any event, this is definitely a painless way to expose yourself to some of the difficult issues we need to think about these days."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"There's one thing I admire about Bill Maher--he's not afraid to speak his mind, and in this book, he let's it all hang out. I don't agree with all of his points, but that's what it means to live in a free country--the freedom to have your own beliefs. Basically, Maher makes some important points. For example, Americans love empty gestures, but don't do anything to solve the problem. Like putting a flag on their SUV, when it would be more helpful if they traded-in their SUV for a sub-compact. As you can tell from the title, most of the issues he discusses deal with the issue of terrorism.One of the great points of this book is that it is illustrated with full color posters done in the style of World War II posters. These really drive home the message. I've had friends who refused to accept some of the ideas in this book, but once they saw the poster illustrating that point, they admitted some truth to the point. A picture really is worth a thousand words. I give this book my highest recommendation. Please read it and see for yourself."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I don't watch Maher's show. I saw his book in the Cornell Alum magazine (he is a Cornell Grad). I enjoyed reading through, but that may be because I agree with many of his opinions. But even if you disagree with what he says it is worth thinking about. He can't be pigeon-holed into either conservative or liberal. He argues that profiling makes sense (why are searching white-haired grandmas in Airports instead of focusing on members of groups who are more likely to be terrorists). He argues for energy conservation (along the lines of the Sierra Club). He is for legalizing marijuana (and other non-victim crimes like prostitusion, he could be a libertarian). He believes that self-sacrifice is healthy, but that no politician would push us for it. He believes America is a great country, but argues for how we could be better. Overall a worthwhile read, and maybe I will tune in to his show now."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Bill Maher has an incredible and valid view on what's wrong in the U.S today, he has a very interesting outlook and in my opinion a very truthful view on topics ranging from oil, cars, patriotism, world issues, the drug war, and much more. I am a fan of his, and I think he could open many peoples eyes to changes that need to be made to stop all the negativity that is present in the U.S, and towards the U.S from other countries."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I often passionately disagreed with Bill Maher's arguments on \\"Politically Incorrect.\\" However, I often agreed with him, too. This book follows suit. Some of the things he writes really make me dislike him. But then I turn the page and find myself nodding my head the other way. Overall, I found this book to be a devastatingly accurate criticism of contemporary American society, and a timely warning that we should not and indeed cannot go on living the way we currently live."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"This collection of 33 WWII-ish posters range in subject matter from terrorism to the drug war and America's love affair with (big) cars. Each is accompanied by a one- or three-page Maher rant and often by a reprint of an inspirational vintage poster.I found the posters themselves as well as the commentary quite moving and Maher, often strident and sometimes bullying, nevertheless reveals a heart that loves America."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"There is less to this book than there appears to be. Virtually every other page is a modernized version of the World War II era posters like Rosie the Riveter. Some of them are good, but many of them are just dumb.Likewise, Maher makes some highly cogent arguments. He skewers political correctness, advocating profiling instead. Certainly this is a much more logical approach to finding terrorists than wasting resources searching the 75-year-woman with a walker.He also attacks the failure of the war on drugs, our oil-greedy society and those whose egocentrism fails to allow them to understand some of the reasons America is hated.It's a good read, but lacking in supportive evidence, relying mainly on anecdotes and sarcasm. Certainly it's not intended as a scholarly epistle, but it would be nice to see more verifiably accurate content.It's sort of like reading Dennis Miller's rants back when Dennis Miller didn't [stink] and was occasionally funny. Though it does lack the overwrought and obscure pop culture references."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"It's encouraging that a book like this (or any book expressing the Constitutional right of free speech) can still be published under the Bush administration. Hopefully the administration's hold over the networks will not seize the publishers as well, and we can look forward to alternative views in the material we read.Congratulations to Bill Maher on an excellent book, and for standing up for what he believes in. That's what being an American is all about."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"If you're a Christian, read this book. Oh, you won't like some of the things it says, and you certainly won't some of the language nor the imagery. But you might find yourself challenged over whether you are really living out Jesus' program, or if you've gotten caught up in the modern Western values of comfort, materialism, and bigotry. It sure is a challenge to whether or not I'm living out the full tenents of my Christian faith--particularly about taking care of the marginalized and helpless, and doing without a few things--to the best of my ability.If you're not a Christian, but you care about morality, ethics, or the United States of America, read this book. I'm not saying believe everything he says; I don't. But consider where he is saying things we desperately need to hear--and what too many people are afraid to think about, let alone say.Maher's book is sure fascinating, challenging, and provocative!"},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Such a great idea to use 40's style propaganda and apply it to today. The only complaint I have is how the book is a bit short on substance outside of the art work. Fans of Maher will notice some re-hashed stuff spread throughout. None the less, it's a keeper."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"What a brilliant, plain-spoken summary of things that brought 9/11, things we've refused to do since, and what we OUGHT to be doing if we really want to win this \\"War on Terror.\\"Maher tells it like it is--painfully so for a lot of people--and nowhere does his unbiased take hit home more forcefully than when confronting the whole post 9/11 America.The context of the book is fascinating--many of the chapters are based on WWII U.S. propaganda posters urging citizens to conserve, be alert and contribute to the war effort. Amazingly, most of them are just as appropriate today, in 2003. Sadly, as Maher points out, Americans today aren't exactly as motivated to actually make the sacrifices necessary to win the war.And of course, there's a few laughs to be had--although this book is pretty straightforward, not to be considered the usual fare by say, George Carlin or even Michael Moore. It is not a comedy book, but rather a brilliant step back and examination of where we're REALLY at, post-9/11.Absolutely recommended. The only caveat is that this book is SHORT--all said, it's probably about 60 actual pages (although it's coffee table sized). I finished it in two sittings. Keep that in mind if you can get it used/in paperback.Bottom line: if you want to pack ammo for the barroom/office/coffee shop debates about America's post 9/11 direction, this is your bible."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"This is merely another diatribe from a Hollywood elitist who thinks his celebrity status validates his opinion on anything and everything.Recall that Mr. Maher called US Pilots cowardly for bombing from 50,000 feet, while he never risked his life for his country. You will then understand everything this useless book has to offer."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"This is an over-priced, over-sized edition of some of Bill's philosophy. I love his philosophy, but with the \\"poster pages,\\" it comes across like an over-priced comic book.His comments are \\"right on,\\" ... Thus the 2 stars. There's no bang for the buck."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Maher says that it's only right for people to be scrutinized at airports because they're Muslim. But Bill, how can you tell? I'm Lebanese and I'm Christian. My uncle's mother-in-law is Arab and she's Jewish. Christian Palestinians do exist. Shock and awe! You can't tell someone's religion by seeing what country they're from. And I have news that may surprise the perspicacious author - not all Muslims are misogynistic killers. Knowledge does win - and I know Bill Maher is very knowledgeable - but I don't think he should have published this book without being more informed."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"BILL MAHERS'S MASTERWORK IS ONE OF UNEQUELLED INSIGHT,HUMOR,AND PATRIOTISM.EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL SHOULD READ THIS.IT COULD ,IN FACT, MAKE AMERICA SMARTER,STRONGER AND LESS DEPENDANT ON OUR ENEMIES.AS FUNNY AS IT IS BRILLIANT,IT ALSO SHOULD BE READ BY EVERY AMERICAN BECAUSE AGREE OR DISAGREE...THIS BOOK MAKES YOU THINK.BRILLIANT,BRILLIANT BRILLIANT."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"There are some good thoughts here, but he spoils them with unnecessary sarcasm. A few of the posters are quite catchy; some even reasonably original."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"While I remain a fan of Bill Maher, \\"When You Ride Alone You Still Ride with Bin Laden\\" disappointed me. It was hard, if not impossible at times, to distinguish Bill from a Bush-supporter vs a Bush-basher. His arguments and allegiances seemed to be all over the place in this...very easy to read...book. Definitely not his best piece of work."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Tell it like it is Phil...errr. I mean BillHey, Dr. Phil isn't the only one who tells it like it is. Bill Maher pulls no punches and says it all with wit and humor. I love the way he trashes todays climate in light of these nutty terrorists. ..."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"This book almost completely lacks any reasoned political analysis. It is completely pitched at the cartoon strip level of political comprehension. Don't worry you'll be able to flick through it while eating a large burger without any indigestion. Maher's main point is that a small number of vested interest elites dominate economic home and foreign policy. That isn't a revelation to any educated European, and it strains belief that contrary is the case in the US. Ever since C.Wright Mills' Power Elite in the sixties (which analysed the influences of the military industrial networks growing under Eisenhower) this point has been made and remade. Maher makes the point again but without the erudition or the data. He preaches on the need for change but invokes formulae that never rise above sloganising.The other aspect of this book that really got on my goat was the relative absence of the 'rest of the world' in the various polemical pieces. While criticising the US for inwardness, he falls into the same trap by never presenting any reasoned external perspective on US policy.Sure you can agree with some of what he trots out as relevant, but most of his material is close to puerile. Much of it would passs for thoughts from a teenage pool hall where angst rules the night hours.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone genuinely interested in political analysis and commentary. However, if you are interested in maintaining a superfical analysis of US policies this is probably the book for you."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Maher hits on almost as many points as he misses--not unlike his very politically correct Politically Incorrect television show. The man has a brain, but he's just mixed up. His book is overloaded with the usual leftist silliness he shares with Michael Moore et al, but he also strikes a cord of common sense from time to time. Is it worth [the price]? No, but it is worth a read both for the small portions of common sense it occasionally doles out and for the insight it provides into the minds of emotional thinkers."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I will preface this review with the fact that I come from a perspective extremely critical of U.S. foreign policy and of its constant wars (\\"low-intensity\\" conflict, the \\"war on drugs,\\" the wars on oil-containing nations, and the War o[f] Terrorism). Now you know where I'm coming from. That said:It appears Mr. Maher was stung quite painfully when Ari Fleischer, Bush's then-press-secretary, singled him out for denunciation after Maher said on his talk show, Politically Incorrect, that, whatever the 9/11 hijackers were, they were not cowards. As a result, the stricken Mr. Maher lost his show.He appears to have decided to respond to this downturn with a frothing-at-the-mouth, wrapped-in-the-flag nationalist rant, curiously intermingled with a platterful of liberal (and sometimes even radical) argumentation in regard to the injustices and inanities in U.S. foreign and domestic policy. Inbetween his rants, he makes excellent points in terms of \\"why they hate us,\\" and in our (the people's) complicity with the crimes of empire. But, without fail, he returns to anti-enemies-of-the-state and anti-Islam polemics, eerily reminiscent of the \\"Hate Week\\" histrionics against Goldstein, Orwell's official enemy of the state in _1984_.It is apparent that he is trying to vindicate himself by criticizing the \\"war on terrorism\\" from an ardent pro-war and pro-empire position.But Maher, in this book, did not just fall into line in response to his chastening. He decided to attempt to be one of the ideological drill instructors of the punditry, calling for his critics (and, of course, the rest of us) to fall into line as well -- but be nicer about it. In essence, it seems as if he is trying to bark as loudly as his avowedly-right-wing counterparts as he co-opts their position.It's an extremely ambivalent book -- he makes many excellent points and raises many important issues not raised by mainstream pundits (as other reviewers here have indicated). I recognize this, and it is indeed good. But, the problem is that the overall message undermines these arguments and smothers them in soothing generalities that, in turn, smother critical thought.In his conclusion, he denounces all critics of American foreign policy and empire, self-righteously reaffirming the conservative line that America's is the gentlest bloody-handed empire (my not-so-complimentary interpretation) in history, and therefore is praiseworthy. Of course, Chileans, Nicaraguans, Salvadorans, Vietnamese, Haitians, Iraqis, Venezuelans, Grenadans, Cubans, the Timorese, and so on, would disagree. His quasi-historical concluding polemic, naturally, fails to substantiate itself, but rather speaks in sweeping, comfortable generalizations that pamper our traditional self-image and, in effect, reaffirm the conservative line. In the end, he becomes one of the best assets the neoconservatives could ask for -- an impassioned \\"liberal\\" who, in effect, argues their case but merely whines about methodology. A splendid example of false consciousness in action.(Incidentally, this friendliness to the conservative worldview is confirmed by the praise received from self-avowed \\"conservatives\\" and rightists in these reviews, and from none other than Ann Coulter in her glowing comment quoted on the back cover of the book. If you ever hear conservatives call someone a \\"reasonable liberal,\\" that should raise some flags.)When it comes down to it, he is a privileged member of the upper echelons of the corporate media establishment, and he responded hysterically to an outright threat to his ability to stay there. Rather pathetic to observe, really. However, the neocons and \\"regular\\" cons can surely enjoy the thrust of his book."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Seeing that Maher thinks he's hilarious, I thought he would at least write a book that was mildly humorous. Not so.His attempt at humor is lacking in originality and does not spring from a very deep well. This book does not grab you, compel you, make you look at issues differently, or use humor as a tool to change your perspective on current events. He fails at his primary mission to be funny, and his secondary mission to provide insightful commentary in today's most important issues. Clearly he thought he was being cute and witty in writing this book - too bad it's as flat as yesterday's diet coke.True, the points he is trying to make are good ones, and kudos for the attempt, but as far as political humorists go, this guy is at the bottom of the list."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Bill Maher is a living national treasure. I mean it absolutely seriously. Everybody should read this book."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Bill Maher is very funny but also very intelligent and politically astute. I always enjoyed his show on ABC and I currently love his show on HBO. He's one of those people that conservatives hate only because he TELLS IT LIKE IT IS. This is a good, thought-provoking book."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I have always thought Bill Maher was nothing short of brilliant. I have disagreed with him on past issues, (Most notably his comments regarding the September 11 attacks) the man still has his facts straight, knows what he's talking about, and has the quick wit to bring home his points.When You Ride Alone proves that Maher, while most-likely misunderstood, is still a brilliant humorist (I hate to use comedian just because it doesn't seem to give him the credibility he deserves) who has his finger on the American Political System much moreso than other political writers (this guy could run circles around Ann Coulter when it comes to breaking down the American Political Machine.This book is definitely a must purchase. Just be sure to write your name and address in it, because if you loan it out, you will want it back!"},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Bill Maher's new book sounds like an alarm clock waking us from a comfortable but dangerous sleep. In brief, hard-hitting chapters, he exposes why the U.S. government would rather strip away your privacy than stand up to big oil or ruffle the political feathers of foreign leaders. He also holds up an unflattering mirror to all those who fly American flags while driving alone in those gas-guzzling SUVs. Real patriotism, argues Maher, requires more than a PR campaign. It means moving away from mindless consumerism, mindless politics, mindless citizenship. Only the current Bush Administration, with its far-right agenda and distate for civil liberties, can say with a straight face that a near-police state is the way to \\"defend freedom.\\" America was not attacked on September 11th because we have too much freedom. The attack was launched because we too often support foreign regimes that deny their own people freedom. The attack succeeded because of failures in American intelligence which have still not been thoroughly investigated. If none of this has to do with the American people having \\"too much freedom,\\" why then is the Bush Administration's knee-jerk response to strip away our privacy and curb our traditional freedoms? (While at the same time fattening the budgets of those who failed to safeguard America on 9-11?)Also recommended: \\"Speaking of Sex: Funny, Wicked & Joyful Remarks About Almost Everybody's Favorite Subject\\" by John-Paul Sousa. This book is a brilliant send-up of a society where sex is sinful, criminal, scandalous - everything but natural!"},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I come from the political right and I wasnt unhappy when Mr. Mahers show was yanked. But this book is simply wonderful. Mr. Maher quickly hits at the jugular of what we need to do to fight the war on terror. He understand that airport security should not be PC, and that a 20 year old arab has more chance of being a terrorist then a 80 year old caucasian grandmother.Mr. Maher is correct in his critique of the war on drugs. We are the ones doing all the cocaine, we should fight the war against drugs here in America, not waste time in Columbia.Mr. Maher also points out the important fact that America and our western way of life and our freedoms are better then Islam. Mr. Maher hits the nail on the head in his several essays on why we need to beleive in ourselves and that we need to condemn islam for its dictatorships and for its treatment of women. He makes a great point that the hippie stoner is less dangerous then the stones thrown by islamic fundamentalists. Mr. Maher also understands that Islams violent invasion of europe does not make it a 'religion of peace', he understands that many Islamic countries live in the dark ages and that we americans should not be afraid to be 'cultural imperialists'. Maher points out 'your telling me they are mad at us because they have to eat our crappy fast food'. Good point. Well siad.Definetly the most enlightening paragraph is when Mr. Maher shows how if a woman in Syria, Iran or Pakistan called the police and siad her husband was beating her the police would say 'and your point is?'. Maher condemns the backwardness of these Islamic societies and rightfully so.A wonderful book, it redeems Mr. Maher and brings him back into our media culture, his is an IMPORTANT VOICE for america and for freedom and for condemning moral reltavism."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"\\"When You Ride Alone,\\" is exactly what you'd expect from comedian Bill Maher: it is crude, funny, irreverent and thought-provoking. Maher's book is deliberately intended to parallel the calls to sacrifice and resolve that were evident during World War II. Artists have has reworked famous WWII posters and slogans (\\"Loose Lips Sink Ships,\\" \\"I Want YOU!\\" and the title poster that substitutes Osama for Hitler) to give the war on terror the same significance and urgency that citizens were urged to feel when faced with fascist aggression.Unfortunately, many of the issues that Maher raised are still relevant today, 3 years after the the September 2001 terror attacks. Americans have not been asked to sacrifice. Other than a few thousand soldiers killed or wounded, most Americans continue in the same habits of mind and body that feed the terror networks. We know little about the culture of the Islamic world. We still buy oil-guzzling SUVs and we still burn electricity with reckless abandon, regardless of how these habits indirectly help finance oil-producing nations, which (in case one isn't aware of it) bred the fanatics who attacked us. We are still satisfied with slogans and posturing (placing flag decals on our cars rather than voting) that have no effect on our preparedness.It's frightening how Maher's snapshot of our national security has hardly changed in 3 years. Security at our airports, ports and borders is still dangerously porous. Other than pre-emption, our leaders have offered no new vision of independence from our enemies. We greedily accept tax breaks rather than beefing up the emergency services that saved us on September 11. Not that I am on board with all of Maher's thought. He comes across as anti-religious, though his real problem (rightly enough) is that a literal reading of scriptures (anyone's scriptures!) is dangerous. He also seems a bit too fond of racial and ethnic profiling to protect us from terrorists. (If we stop frisking grandmothers at airports, won't terrorist just dress as grandmas?)The book's subtitle, \\"What the Government SHOULD Be Telling Us to Help Fight the War on Terrorism\\" is still apt in late 2004. That makes this book prophetic, but it also ought to scare the wits out of anyone who loves freedom and security."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Well, I won't lie, I agree 100% with Bill! It's almost like a lot of people don't want freedom of speech in this day &amp; age! This book reminds me that it is our duty to question &amp; consider all sides, blind patriotism leads to erosion of freedoms. We the people cannot stand united with such an arrogant &amp; incompetent man in power here at home!"},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I really liked this. I don't agree with everything Bill says, but I sure like the way he says everything. (Makes a good point about profiling, though I'm against it.) He's funny. This book is, too, and that's why I buy books... to laugh. Yes, some of the diatribes are rehashed from his t.v. show. But who cares? If you like him, this is a great investment. If you don't, buy &quot;Savage Nation&quot;.Another very funny book I recently enjoyed (and you may, too) is &quot;No One's Even Bleeding.&quot;"},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"This book is required reading for a post-9/11 USA, and not because Bill Maher has all the right answers to our troubled nation's problem (in more than a few instances I couldn't disagree more). However, in &quot;When You Ride Alone...&quot; Bill Maher has given us something much more valuable: all the right questions.This is where Maher has succeeded at one of his primary goals of spurring intelligent unity in writing this book. How else could a book jacket carry endorsements from such a sweeping cross-section of the political spectrum (it's probably the one place on Earth where you'll see Ann Coulter and Michael Moore agreeing with each other).Cast aside whatever side of the political line you may tie yourself to (blurred as that line is these days), and buy this book."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I read this book in just 2 or 3 days and I must admit that it keeps you reading it more and more. Bill goes on to demonstrate that today's gov't is more preoccupied with usual politics and profit making, rather than truly getting citizens involved in helping this country win the war on terrorism.- He shows the importance of oil independence and its role in our current war and general world affairs- He illustrates that our heroes are not given any respect, contrary to what gov't says- He shows our ignorance as Americans of others in the world- And he creates guidelines for what really needs to be to help the country recover from 9/11 and move onHis sense of humor and satirical nature gives this book an even more lucrative content, however I didnt give it 5 stars as it featured small amt. of facts and stats and etc. to back up his claims and opinions. Although I do agree with almost 100% of what he says."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Being an avid \\"Politically Incorrect\\" viewer for many, many years, I've seen and heard Bill Maher say some really incredible things, and some incredibly stupid things. Many misguided people will believe that, after the September 11th attacks, Bill was being stupid, unpatriotic, and unfeeling when hrefered to our military efforts \\"cowardly\\". It's something that Bill really wan't able to explain to people while his show was on the air. Well, consider this his retribution... he proves in this book that, not only is he EXTREMELY patriotic, but he also has an EXTREMELY great grasp on politics, and is still EXTREMELY funny.Bill is tired of politcal correctness and other such practices that keep our country from being everything that it can be. He dwells on various topics ranging from oil consumption (in terms of automobiles and liht bulbs), truly coming together as a country and making REAL sacrifices, religion, the futile and meaningless drug war, airport security, freedom of speech, American arrogance to anything foreign, and national security.All 132 pages are filled with intellectual and amusing observations and recommendations by Maher. His comic relief in the midst of some hardcore political discussion will definitely catch you off gaurd (I found myself laughing out loud many times), and when you have finished the book, you will sit back and think: \\"Damn, that was so funny... but damn, he is SO RIGHT.\\" This is why many people love the likes of Bill Maher and Al Franken... they are funny, but they are also serious about everything they say.The reason I did not give this book a perfect 5 stars is that it is a bit short (lots of illustrations, white space, and large lettering), but in some cases, it makes it even better. I finished it in 2 hours... you could buy it and keep it in the bathroom and still learn alot from this book!"},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"9/11, Millions cared for three thousand. Next time, it might be the other way around. This is one of the captions below a picture depicting the possibility of a nuclear terrorist attack on American soil, and is one of over thirty pictures and topics covered in this book. Bill Maher's voice may be the equivalent of listening to fingernails scratching the surface of a chalkboard to some, but the common sense behind those words cannot be denied. \\"When You Ride Alone\\" is pretty much standard Bill Maher affair, with him writing things and making connections between what we are doing at home, and how we, as an American civilization, have not answered the bell in response to the attack on September 11, 2001.Through an assortment of well thought out drawings that harken back to WWII propaganda Bill tackles numerous topics on how we, the people of this nation, should and could have responded, as well as some very astute observations pertaining to the role of the government.Now, this book in not for PC's. Racial profiling is one of the many questionable programs that Bill gives the thumbs up to, though the reasoning behind his arguments cannot be denied as anything less than sound. This along with SUVs, the drug war, assisted suicide, political passivism, and living in a wasteful nation, are among the topics covered.Whether you agree with him or not, the book raises serious issues and brings to light a unique perspective on what is going on in our nation. As stated, every American of age 18 should take the time to read this book and reflect on their own lives and contributions they might be making to those who flew planes into our buildings."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Bill Maher has a serious temper tantrum in this short and cartoonish diatribe. But it is fun, and he makes some good points. Heck, he has blurbs on the back of the book from Al Franken and Ann Coulter - talk about appealing to everybody.The book is much like Bill's show, very opinionated but the ideas are never really fleshed out. A lot of points get made in a hurry here, but they are darned good points - and they get the reader thinking after he finishes laughing.The reader reviews here aren't totally friendly, and I think it may be because Bill manages to annoy everybody at some point or other. Or maybe folks were looking for Calvin or Marxian depth. But taken as a whole the book is like a very good political comedy routine - you'll chuckle, you'll be insulted, and you'll learn something. That's Maher's schtick on stage, and that's his style here.Listen, his show got on my nerves - I've never been a fan of his. But I enjoyed this book, and credit Maher for taking on the government and shallow patriots for their reaction to 9/11. And it's nice to see that Maher appreciates his country and what it represents while he faults its leaders and many of its people.By the way, what this book lacks in depth it makes up in height. If your bookshelf is less than 16 inches tall you better wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I both love and hate this book at the same time. I imagine Maher brings out this response from many people. I do agree with many of Maher's libertarian views, despite being \\"liberal.\\" But still, he's got some ideas that he can't back up with facts.One of my major beefs is that Maher seems to believe that we are at war with Islam -- all of Islam. Such views are not helpful. They only make matters worse by putting everyone in the same category. If we judged Christians as being all like Jerry Falwell no one who believed in Christ would look good either.Maher's support of profiling Arabs also doesn't make sense. There are tons of scenerios in which an old lady, a child, or a love struck 20 something could accidentally bring a bomb on board a plane. It's not about knowledge or intent, it's about manipulation. I want the old ladies frisked, including my mother! Why? Because some people are too trusting and just might make a mistake.There are other views expressed or, unfortunately, outright ignored. In one poster he highlights the stoning of Muslim women while at the same time ignoring the rape and brutualities towards women here in the US. In another essay he demands more funding for the Pentagon, the agency that gets more than 50 percent of the discretionary budget and was judged by the GAO as being the most mismanaged federal agency in the entire US government. Please! In another poster & essay he supports the reporting of suspicious activities to the government. On its face, that might make sense. But then remember how many idiots there are out there and how many people have an axe to grind with someone else.The good posters and essays, on the other hand, hit dead center. The \\"why they hate\\" us posters are great as is Maher's support for better pay and respect for firefighters, soldiers and police officers. The pages focusing on our over consumption of oil are perhaps the best, most notably the one on the front cover.Despite these criticisms, Maher brings a lot of ideas to the table. God knows we need more of that right now when so many people are so quick to throw the \\"un-American\\" label at those who dissent. Which brings me to one of the better posters & essays in the book: Speaking out IS an act of patriotism. I'll grant that to Maher, even if I disagree with half of what he says."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Do you know about any of the sacrifices for freedom, made during World War II? Bill Maher uses examples of these sacrifices, plus updated versions of World War II posters, to give historical context to the war against terrorism. He is not afraid to challenge established viewpoints, and he has lots of evidence to back up his views. ...my thanks to Bill for making my Christmas shopping easier!!!"},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"The latest book from television talk show host, writer, and generally funny, cynical guy Bill Maher was inspired by U.S. government World War II posters which showed how ordinary citizens could help the allied war effort. The title itself is a take on the poster, \\"When You Ride Alone, You Ride With Hitler\\", designed to encourage Americans to conserve oil needed for the war. This is essentially the premise of Maher's, \\"When You Ride Alone...\\"; to tell us how we as citizens can help the U.S. war on terrorism (though he also discusses a number of related and unrelated topics).Maher typically spends 2-4 pages discussing a different issue in each of the 30 or so chapters. At his best, Maher's arguments are articulate and convincing. In particular, his argument that both political leaders and citizens complicitly perpetuate terrorism: The citizens' gluttonous consumption of gas and oil (and everything else for that matter) perpetuates terrorism by funding oil producing countries like Saudi Arabia who fund terrorist organizations. Politicians are also responsible for refusing to ask voters for any kind of conservation or sacrifice (for fear of losing votes). It's difficult to disagree with Maher's reasoning, and with his general assertion that most Americans have become lazy, ignorant, and spoiled children. Despite his censure, Maher is true patriot who criticizes because he cares.\\"When You Ride Alone...\\" is more useful to those aren't familiar with Maher than to those of us who watched Politically Incorrect regularly. At least 3/4 of the topics covered Maher has already discussed ad nauseam on his cancelled TV show. There really isn't anything new here, and that's disappointing after Maher's extended media absence. While I agree with his perspective on many issues, Maher's over generalizations and occasionally funny approach makes it sometimes difficult to take him all that seriously (this was also a problem after his show moved to ABC).In the end, \\"When You Ride Alone...\\" is an entertaining, but politically scrawny little book. This is unfortunate because Maher has the intelligence and wit to produce something much more substantial. [Those looking for a more thorough discussion of the issues would probably be best served to look elsewhere.] \\"When You Ride Alone...\\" is a fairly enjoyable, but mostly forgettable read."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I was irritated when Maher's show was canceled, but he has certainly turned the controversy into an opportunity. Here he characteristically uses his insights and wit to stir up our psyches about our views on war -- in an historical sense (alluding to previous wars fought by our country via spoofs of war propaganda), and a current one as well.The visual references force one to think about causes and contexts of past wars in order to make sense of current policy and situations overseas. It is a highly entertaining and thought provoking project, one that may surprise you, as it did me, with the substance underneath its cleverness."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":".......but he gives an honest, straightforward, and thoughtful expression of his opinions. I was even surprised to find that I agreed with most of it. FAIR WARNING: there's a reason his show was called &quot;Politically Incorrect.&quot; He doesn't mince words. His chapter on religion is pretty extreme (that was the one chapter I was uncomfortable with). He actually does address (in one paragraph) the issue of his comment that lost him the show. It starts to feel like all he has to say about this country is negative, but keep going, because at the end he says what he thinks is RIGHT about this country. He's arrogant, outspoken, doesn't worry about hurting feelings, and may go to far at times. He'd make a lousy politician because he'd alienate people and many people don't want to hear brutal, honest truth. But if these kinds of statements stimulate discussions, then that's good--that's what our right of free speech is supposed to do. You don't have to agree with everything a commentator says to find the person worth listening to &amp; the commentary worth thinking about. Sift it; save the wheat &amp; throw away the chaff. I borrowed this book from the library to check it out first; now I'm going to buy it &amp; put it right next to my Andy Rooney books, as salient commentary that I might want to refer back to some day."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"It says something about this book that Michael Moore and Ariana Huffington both have blurbs on the back cover.Maher's strength is that he hews to no particular party line. On one page he agrees with conservative right-wingers and a page later he's letting loose with a rant from the liberal playbook. The great thing about him is that he has an opinion, and he states it, and he doesn't worry about what box it all should be filed in. As such, he's a great antidote to the intellectual laziness of most of our pundits.Given, that, you can expect that at least once in this book, you'll shake your head and think, &quot;No, that's just not right&quot; and on some other page you'll think, &quot;Dang-- that's exactly it.&quot; Maher cuts through a lot of the fuzz, smoke and mirrors of the post-9/11 political landscape , and even if you have to think a bit to figure out why you disagree with him, that's certainly more than any political figure has done in the last year.Maher is not polite or nice, but every society needs someone who's willing to tell the fat girl that she shouldn't wear spandex. A good timely book well worth reading."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"First, I must take exception to reviewer: Peter Labriola from Oakland, Ca. His comment \\"Only in Hollywood could a liberal jew like Bill Maher -- the very epitome of politically correctness -- be passed off as \\"politically incorrect\\" not only shows him to be bigoted, but suggests ignorance as well. Mr. Maher's mother was Jewish, but he was raised Catholic. He now does not declare any stated religion. I do wonder if the reviewer read the book.While I did not agree with everything Mr. Maher said in this book, I found his arguments fresh and interesting, and his wit as good in book form as it is on his (sadly canceled) show. This is the type of book to read and discuss - don't expect to agree with everything, but expect to come away with a different mind set on some subjects."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I admire the guts it took to say these things in modern America, a land where political correctness stifles free expression as surely as McCarthyism ever did. And how soon Americans are forgetting September 11, 2001! It floors me how so many people think it is now just a sad day from a history book. More and worse is probably coming, folks, and Bill Maher is honest enough to say so in a message that caters to neither the right nor the left, simply dishes up (in a loud voice) pragmatic commentary on how we are messing up and what we should be doing to fix it. In this semi-survival manual, a collection of topical essays combined with WWII-style political posters updated for our times, some things get said that desperately needed saying. Yes, we Americans can do more to make ourselves safer. Yes, we Americans have a partially-deserved PR problem on the world stage, and yes, our enemies overseas are waiting patiently in a state of extreme motivation, to strike us again. I recommend this book to anyone, but especially those who are too timid to wake up to the reality that we are in a watershed moment in world history, a time in which the culture of enlightenment and freedom is under direct attack by a Medieval-minded foe who would have us descend into repression and totalitarianism. Actually, wait. I'll correct that. Our foe wants the repression and totalitarianism for himself. For us he wants an irradiated wasteland from sea to shining sea. So read this book. It's frequently funny, it's thought-provoking, and it says a lot that stands in contrast to the patriotic but empty drivel that passes for our national dialogue in 2006."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Maher tells us what we should do to help win the war on terror, opining that the politicians won't ask us to make any sacrifices because they are afraid that it will hurt their chances of getting re-elected. He rails against the pervasive political correctness which seems to win out over common sense, and the self-indulgent attitude of Americans in general. Illustrated with lots of specially created posters by various artists, and some war-effort posters used during WWII. You don't have to agree with everything Maher says to enjoy this book. It had me laughing out loud."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"It's starting to appear on best seller lists and may do some good in the world. It uses modern versions of the kind of posters the government issued during World Wars I and II to whip us up to do our patriotic duty. Maher uses them to express opinions like: profiling is a good idea when all the guys making trouble are all young, Muslim males. The best thing is that the colorful posters, brief text, and large print let it get through to Americans who don't read books with, like, a lot of words in them. Oh, did I mention that Maher is funny?This is a great gift book. Funny, a good converstation starter, and pointed enough to meke even couch potatoes think."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"If only Bill Maher could turn his perceptive political insights into useful prescriptions for change, rather than cranky rants. Or in other words &#8211; great ideas, poor execution. Maher's basic concept in this book is that he wishes to compare the real sacrifices that Americans were proud to make in the World Wars with the completely empty gestures and false jingoism which are all Americans are willing to do in the current war on terror. For example, in the old days people actually tried to conserve food and fuel for the war effort. Nowadays, \\"patriots\\" continue our dependence on Middle Eastern dictators by buying gas-guzzling SUVs, then slap a cheap fake magnetic ribbon on the bumper and actually think they're helping win the war. Instead of a strong president who encourages us to make personal sacrifices and serve the nation, we have one who tells us to keep shopping and consuming, thus strengthening nobody but the corporations that make campaign contributions.Bill Maher is great at finding ironies and disconnections like these in modern American politics. But after making such excellent insights, Maher doesn't know how to make his ideas useful at more than a basic oppositional level. It's not really necessary to review this book based on one's agreement with Maher's political stance. I happen to agree with much of it and disagree with some of it. But the main problem here is that Maher first addresses a problem usefully, but then goes on a tirade of self-righteous complaining, while writing as if he has the answers to all those problems. This is a real concern given his attitudes toward Islam, and his know-it-all prescriptions for military strategies. Maher's philosophy can also be very inconsistent and contradictory, especially when it comes to cultural tolerance and political correctness. Bill Maher's insightful mind finds some real breakthroughs here, but then his cynicism takes control and brings us back to regular old finger-pointing and condescending American politics.

Speaking what's on his mind, Maher is nearly always on target. His show Politically Incorrect was one of the best on TV.I miss hearing his on-the-mark commentary. If you're open minded and can take the truth - buy this book!"},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I bought this as a Christmas present for someone else and couldn't put it down. Now I must get a copy of my own. While I don't always agree with the author, his is a refreshingly strong, witty, opinionated voice in the oh-so-boring world of political talk. He repeatedly &quot;drives home&quot; --no pun intended-- the idea that if Americans are REALLY SERIOUS about the war on terriorism, the government and the people would do an abrupt about-face and wean ourselves from forgein oil. This book is very funny and at the same time is full of hard truths we'd like to forget. Bill Mahr challenges our nation --the president and the guy next door-- to think globally, nationally, about the family of man and NOT about me, me, me. After reading this, and &quot;Nickle and Dimed&quot; and &quot;Rich White Men,&quot; I think we need to form a new political party in the U.S. -- any suggestions? Great posters, great fun, great ideas!"},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"An easy read and the chapters are very distinguishable. The humor in the book is just OK, but the information given is very worthwhile. I originally picked up this book for the posters - I am very disappointed that said posters were not in color though."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Bill Maher is a comedian, but this book definitely is not meant to be comedy. Rather its a very serious political commentary sprinkled with his unique sarcastic wit. For those with short attention spans you need not worry. Bill doesn't mince words here and it doesn't read like a technical manual or a James Michener novel so you should be able to finish the book within a few hours. Each separate point he makes is illustrated with art that is reminiscent of World War II propaganda posters and is remarkably effective at conveying the message.Put away your own personal biases when reading this book, because the opinions voiced in it cross the boundaries of liberalism or conservativism. It is a book aimed at the social pragmatist, a person who realizes that you can't pigeonhole whats right and wrong into only 2 idealogical camps. Read this book."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"The basic argument here is that we lack leadership, that we have to create leaders, that we have to demand true leadership and call out those who don't provide it. We have to demand that someone take an unpopular stand (such as saying that we should divorce ourselves from foreign oil in ten years) and support them when they do it.It's all so unlikely and that's the part of the book that isn't funny. We are, as Maher puts it, sheep.But the book is funny. It's very funny and it kept me going for the couple hours it took to finish it. Get it and read it, then write a letter to the White House, the House, the Senate, the Mayor, or whoever you need to direct. If this book gets three people involved in politics other than tacking a damn flag to their Hummer, then it will be worth the paper it was printed on."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"This is a very inspiring read, Bill Maher is trying to bring back some of the values that past generations shared - like sacrifice! I love the posters, they are both funny and make a very serious point.

Superb read, buy the book and the posters..."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Bill Maher is entertaining, I'll give him that. However, as many liberals, (he claims he's libertarian)-- he has some facts correct, others incorrect.

However, he gets too much credit for that. Where he lives and hangs out-- in Hollywood-- this IS the majority opinion.

Historians have, across the board, termed this \\"sword\\" claim as a \\"debunked hypothesis\\" (See Philip K. Hitti's, A Short History of the Arabs 1973:59). An analysis of the adoption of Islamic names reveals that over a century and a half after the \\"conquests\\", less than 10% of the population of those areas was Muslim. This suggests that the masses accepted Islam much later and not as a result of the conquest (see Albert Hourani's, A History of the Arab Peoples (1991), page 46-47). Prominent Western historians (like Edward Gibbon) have called this \\"sword\\" propaganda a myth. Why are you perpetuating a myth that has been debunked by experts who scientifically analyze the evidence?The author's silence about \\"Holy Violence\\" in the Torah, and the explicit racism of the Old Testament that has been translated into the present day apartheid regime of modern Israel, shows dishonesty and insincerity. He claim that U.S Foreign Policy cannot be criticized by today's Muslims because Muslims who lived 1400 years back allegedly had a \\"conquering to convert\\" foreign policy is not only absurd, it reeks of the Israeli claim that since their ancestors allegedly inhabited Palestine 2000 years back, they are justified today in stealing the entire area from its indigenous Arab population.It is a almost non-researched, agenda driven \\"picture\\" book."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Hello!

Once again the truth the America is almost too-civilized to win a fight against a foe that has a fighting spirit. I hope the author writes again!"},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Bill Maher is getting a pretty sweet deal out of our society. Before September 11, all he knew how to do was utterly failing to be funny, and it seemed that in time he would be duly forgotten. But now, he realizes that all he has to do is claim that a gang of terrorists are actually the world's greatest heroes, and the mainstream media goes berserk, actually believing he poses a deadly threat to America, and he gains a legion of adoring groupies that believe the refutation of his ludicrous diatribes that follows easily from the most basic reasoning proves that he must be a genius oppressed because of his utter brilliance.However, one thing must be made clear: I will not accuse Bill Maher of being a terrorist. I say this because Maher's entire routine since September 11 has been a pitifully obvious attempt to grab for attention by inciting people to accuse him of being a terrorist. I want to show that if he wants to dictate the way I react to him, he will have to do better than that tired old scam. I will, however, point out that there are people who look at he events of September 11 and say \\"What can I do to help?\\", and then there are people who say \\"How can I make a quick buck out of this?\\", and Bill Maher decidedly belongs in the latter group. I suspect Maher would be surprised to find out that rather than reflexively screaming \\"He is a terrorist\\", I attack his positions (or lack thereof) with a coherent discussion. In fact, I dare say, he would probably be quite offended.Finally, we come to Bill Maher's supposed opposition. He and his groupies insist adamantly that Maher is the only one enlightened enough to realize the truth, and is oppressed by an omnipresent yet strangely impotent conspiracy that seeks only to silence him but somehow never succeeds, regardless of how much power and influence it supposedly has (a classic paranoid fantasy that might make a passable arcade game, but tends to fail as a political position.) The fact is that when people become angry at Bill Maher, it has nothing to do with conspiracies or brainwashing. People become angry at Bill Maher because he persistently bludgeons them with his belief that the best way to make people laugh is to tell them that the systematic murder of their friends, parents, and relatives on September 11 was actually a beautiful, heroic act, and I fail to see why being angry at him is supposed to be an illogical reaction.If you want some really cutting social commentary, look into George Carlin's and Carl Hiaasen's work sometime. There, instead of a pathetic six-foot infant screaming at the world \\"Lick me, I'm edgy\\", you will find a truly hilarious and insightful perspective on the world, from people who seriously think about the situation they live in rather than mindlessly provoking a reaction. Otherwise, this book would be ideal for the sort of person who has a sticker in the back window of their truck of Calvin urinating on the logo of the company that actually made the truck. They seem to think it marks them as being on a different level of intelligence from the rest of us. How right they are."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Bill Maher TV show should have been called Politically Correct. Maher is a lefty stooge who spends some of his time hanging out at the Playboy mansion with Hef. The good news is Hef's \\"empire\\" is losing money hand over fist so Maher will eventually have to go out and find his own whores.Maher constantly parroted the Democratic Party line on his incredibly lame TV show. This book is another DNC cut & paste job. Maher fails to address the Clinton open border policy & the uncontrolled immigration policies which was a primary cause of 9-11.Mr. Atta, 9-11 terrorist leader, laughed at the joke security & INS polocies at Miami airport. During the same period of time, the Clinton's INS devoted a huge amount of resources to catch Elian Gonzalez. Meanwhile, Atta was slipping in and out of the U.S. through Miami airport & laughing his head off.In addition, Maher fails to address why Clinton failed to do anything after we were bombed 6 times and ambushed once by Al Qeada. Clinton sent Louis Freeh's corrupt FBI to investigate and did nothing else. Clinton felt bombing Kosovo for 70 days would get Monica off the front page. Tackling Al Qeada or a real threat might hurt Clinton poll numbers.Bill Maher never addresses why 9-11 & Bin Laden happened, he just make more excuses for Bill Clinton and blames SUV drivers.Avoid this garbage. Maher proves in his tome that he really is a sleazy character."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"Ignorance is interesting...thus an extra star.While you are all busy attempting to find some kernel of truth with one another, Bill Maher is probably off cavorting with Hugh Hefner and his little bunnies. Maher's association with Hefner is telling on many levels. Among them are: his affinity for the 'cool' and dedication to the depthless; his lack of meaningful personal relationships, the seed from which sprouts his warped view of society; and the maniacal influence that seems to pervade so many of his thoughts. All of that said I think that people should view Maher(and read him so that his comments can be considered naked, without the veil of cuteness). He is an example to behold. Of what? The case for ignorance is strong here. People like Maher love to ignore facts, the U.S. purchases only a small fraction of its oil from the middle east...the overwhelming majority comes from our neighbors and allies: North American nations, South American nations, European, Asian, and African nations. And, yes a solid portion does come from the middle east, but certainly not as much as the activists would like you to believe. Check the import numbers for yourself and see."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I have never been a big fan of Bill Maher...However,...I hurriedly grabbed the book off the shelf and dashed out of the store.

This book should be required reading for anyone who flips on the CNN at least once in their day. The final three pages of the book sum up everything that I have been preaching to anyone who would listen for years.Read this book and live by its teachings. Oh thank you wise Mr. Maher."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. I'm not familiar with most of Bill Maher's work, but it's hard to deny that he brings a fresh perspective and a high degree of personal honesty: He says exactly what he thinks, doesn't hedge his bets, and frankly doesn't care a whit if you're shocked or offended. In that respect, I wish we had more pundits like him: Unconcerned about political correctness or left- or right-wing &quot;party lines,&quot; and perfectly willing to call 'em as they see 'em.On the other hand... this book simply isn't very funny. Idealism aside, I bought this book because I thought it was political humor. I expected to see a clich&eacute;s lampooned, a few of the dumbest political plays of the last few years exposed, a few sacred cows tipped. This book contains all of those things, but it just isn't funny. Bill Maher's acerbic wit makes some cutting observations, but out of the entire hundred-odd pages, I only found one or two moments of real humor-- certainly not enough to justify the book's price tag. If you want to laugh at some of the more fatuous moments of the post-9/11 world, this book simply isn't for you."},{"Title":"When You Ride Alone You Ride with bin Laden","review":"If you are interested in a Sane, Honest, Funny, Common Sense &quot;Take&quot; on the World We Are Living In Today - post 9/11 - READ THIS BOOK! jwm 11/13/02&quot;Bill Maher has the courage to speak his mind - no matter what the consequences - something you can't say about most people these days.

There are a lot things I agree and disagree with him on (I do agree with him that John McCain would had been a better president than Bush).

Maher writes very short essays (in big print) on a wide variety of terrorism-related topics, calling for real lifestyle changes and honesty in an attempt to shake us out of our everything's-changed-but-how-I-live slumber, interspersing them with WWII-style posters mocking our politicians and our misconceptions. At least one of them is guaranteed to offend - notably the one about the silliness of codified religions.Though the essays are generally smart, funny and incisive, they're too short, scattershot, and the posters get considerably less inspired as the book goes on. There's simply not enough written material: it can be read easily in an evening. One gets the feeling that if Maher had the drive, he could be a modern-day Voltaire. Instead the essays, pungent and entertaining as they are, just scratch the surface of his topics and are at best loosely held together by the theme of sacrifice in a new world - something which he seems to go a bit overboard with, even if you agree with him on oil and diamonds.Hopefully, he'll find the inspiration someday to settle down and write a real \\"serious\\" 300-pager.

The Soviets are out to conquer the world but first they must take out the United States. The United States of course does everything in its power to make itself the perfect unaware and vulnerable target. The only hope is a couple of heroes behind the scenes in both the US and Russia who are trying to stop the plot.The backdrop to the story is an environmental catastrophe that heats up the Antarctic shelf allowing an absolutely enormous sheet of ice to float into the open seas. The Russians want to use the ice sheet as a device to conquer the US. I can't tell you more with out giving away the plot completely.A pretty decent yarn. I found myself not liking the characters much but enjoying the story over all. I am not a scientist so I do not know what the plausibility of the environmental catastrophe is but it didn't sound all that believable. I was able to suspend my disbelief and enjoy the novel for what it was. A good, once read book for a lazy summer afternoon. Borrow it from a friend or library and enjoy."},{"Title":"Cold Sea Rising","review":"I picked the book up because I wanted to see if the author could pull this story off in a believable way. I think he missed the mark, at least with me. The characters where out of a bad 1950's B movie and this lack of character depth plus the far fetched story did not get enough credibility with me. There are many other books out there that a much better, reread a Clancy if you can find nothing else."},{"Title":"The Edison Schools: Corporate Schooling and the Assault on Public Education (Positions: Education, Politics, and Culture)","review":"The role of public schools in a democratic society is undergoing scrutiny on a scale never before seen in this country. Do schools exist primarily to educate thinking voters or to provide docile workers for multinational corporations? Kenneth J. Saltman reveals the real motives of neoliberals who are behind the carefully orchestrated campaign to privatize all schools under the guise of helping children. It's a true story that contains all the elements of a thriller movie. And the author tells it exceedingly well, using the Edison Schools as the focal point. Concerned citizens need to read \\"The Edison Schools\\" in conjunction with the excellent \\"Why Is Corporate America Bashing Our Public Schools?\\" by Kathy Emery and Susan Ohanian. Both books describe how corporations are hijacking American education. While Saltman confines his case to the Edison Schools, Emery and Ohanian go beyond one company in delivering a compelling manifesto.Walt Gardner taught for 28 years in the Los Angeles Unified School District and was a lecturer in the UCLA Graduate School of Education."},{"Title":"The Edison Schools: Corporate Schooling and the Assault on Public Education (Positions: Education, Politics, and Culture)","review":"Saltman has left no stone unturned in his examination of Edison Schools. From the business practices and economic theory behind the very idea of privatizing schools to the curricular and pedagogical theory that drive the schools' daily activities, he covers every aspect of Edison and of Chris Whittle's mission. Saltman's writing is detailed and thorough, defending and proving his arguments with ample evidence and providing ideas for the future of schooling in America.Very readable (even if you don't like non-fiction), well-organized and absolutely indispensible in the discussion of school privatization."},{"Title":"Statistical Mechanics: An Introduction","review":"This book is an absolute gem that is not very well known on the North American side of the Atlantic due to the \\"cult\\" of Reif (either his introductory book in the Berkeley series, which is now out of print, or his advanced book, Statistical and Thermal Physics, which is still in print) from whom most of us learned our statistical physics. I found Reif's explanations quite poor, and struggled to learn the subject as an undergraduate. (This is backed up by others if you read the reviews of Reif's book). Trevena's book, on the other hand, is beautifully and elegantly written and is not too wordy. After a short historical summary, Trevena clearly outlines the basic principles in a way that opens the door to the subject. He then covers the Boltzmann distribution and simple gases before launching into more advanced subjects such as Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein gases. These advanced concepts are made much clearer than they are in Reif's advanced book (and they aren't even covered in his simple book). Trevena then finishes with discussions of liquids, solids, and related topics.I highly reccomend Trevena's book to anyone who wants to supplement a required text or do self study in this area. One warning, it still requires a lot of thought on the part of the reader, since this subject is not trivial."},{"Title":"Good Medicine: Emergency!

Once there, she quickly falls for Silas Keefer, the community's traditional healer, with whom she is able to work comfortably despite the differences in their approaches to helping people.The downside (and it's a major one): Jordan has neglected to tell Silas (or anyone else) that she is still married. So when her deranged husband shows up, everything inevitably falls to pieces.Then, after resolving major childhood issues with their fathers (both had felt abandoned as children) Silas and Jordan get back together.This story has a sort of split personality; on the one hand, it really bothered me that Jordan got involved with Silas while she was still married (this is more than just a little \\"technicality,\\" as one minor character terms it), and Silas also came off as a bit self-righteous at times. The ending was also weaker than I'd expected. But the setting and cultural information were detailed and fascinating, and the story just also seemed very hopeful."},{"Title":"Good Medicine: Emergency!

Definitely kept my interest and worth the read."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"Once again I was grossly disappointed to find bad biology in fiction. IT ISN'T THAT HARD TO DO YOUR RESEARCH! The authors obviously know their physics, but when it came to biology and evolution (the chapter dealing with mutant super-heros), they had NO CLUE. They were even putting words into C. Darwin's mouth - as if he ever uttered the word \\"mutation.\\" And another thing, the theory of evolution wasn't Darwin's alone. The theory was formulated at the same time by both Darwin and Alfred Wallace, Darwin had more supporting evidence, had more money, and could publish sooner. Gresh and Weinberg apparently can spend numerous chapters about the life of a star, but that can't get that one little fact correct.Also, G&W; use the \\"hopeful monster\\" theory of evolution (without using that little title) which is grossly outdated. They get vast quantities of their assumptions wrong (i.e. \\"most mutations are beneficial\\" when if fact, any biologist could tell you the truth, that most mutations are deleterious to the organism).I could go on and on, but I've wasted enough time complaining.Overall, I enjoyed the book, but their gross simplification, and outright incorrectness ruined my reading enjoyment. If they write a sequel, I'd be happy to help them out with the biology prior to publishing."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"Doesn't leave a lot of room for imagination. Of course we know a lot of these characters are impossible, that's what's fun.

A great way to beentertained, while learning various interesting science and technology."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"Less than half the book discuss the science behind the superheroes they talk about. Rather they go into lengthy history lessons about the origins of the characters when two sentences saying these are this person's powers, this is how they got them, would be enough. Then you could go into an indepth treatment saying whether or not the powers have at least some grounding in reality then compare them with some current technology that may be close to duplicating some of these powers.They talk about the Fantastic Four only in the contect of how they got their powers, say they are too silly to even discuss, and move on to re-write the Hulk's origin in a more realistic way. Why not talk about invisibility? What are the links with current technology? There was a guy on Guiness book of world records that can stretch his skin A LOT so why not mention something like that and try to make a link about how you could control it. For example, recent studies with Octopi have shown that they actually walk on the sea floor using two of their tentacles. They fill these with water making them more rigid and thats how they can support some of their weight without the need for a skelatal structure.I thought the X-men chapter would be good, but instead I got a lecture on Creationism and Evolution. I expected examining Superman's powers in depth and all I got was 10 pages of discussing whether aliens could exist. Not to mention the fact that having Krypton's gravity stronger DOES NOT explain super-strength. He was not born on Krypton, therefore never experienced higher gravity. Being able to withstand a higher gravitational field would NOT be a genetic trait either. Even if he was used to the higher gravitational field, you would eventually become used to the lower one and the super abilities would go away.Not a very good book in my opinion and the sequal &quot;The Science of Super Villains&quot; looks equally as bad."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"I enjoyed how this book examined the different superheroes from a scientific perspective and broke down the components of their particular powers, but, c'mon, all of them are proven absolutely scientifically impossible? Remember, there was a time when people thought that a world that wasn't flat was scientifically impossible too. Sure they break all sorts of scientific laws, but new theories and breakthroughs are being created all the time in an era where human cloning's being debated and even the theory of relativity is starting to be challenged. I agree with an earlier poster, that I would have liked to have seen more of the heroes approached like the Hulk--in terms of seeing how they, or their powers, could POSSIBLY be real."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"I have never felt as compelled to write an online review of a product as I do right now...First of all, the very title of this book is blatantly misleading. And I believe this was intentional. This isn't the science OF superheroes, this is the science AGAINST superheroes. (Well, it is against all of them except the X-Men, but we'll get into that one in a bit.) What the authors have done here is taken what could have potentially been a fun little ride through the land of superheroes, and turned it into a mean spirited trek through your most boring physics class.After reading the title, you might expect to see a book describing the scientific aspects of how superheroes exist and function. But you would be wrong. Instead, the authors go well out of their way to disprove any notion that superheroes could exist. I believe this was intentionally given a misleading title because they knew someone interested in superheroes would not be buying a book saying they are impossible. I mean, come on... we all know they are impossible, be we would like to see science that shows what might be possible. But this book does none of that. This book is only about ripping the superhero genre to shreds.Not only is the book 99% negative, but it is written in a way that is very degrading to fans of superhero based comic books. Like other reviewers have said, it is as though the authors are just trying to bash comic books and fans of them. Reading this book gives you the feeling that they would just love to tell us \\"Are you stupid? Don't you realise this is impossible?!?\\"The science isn't entirely accurate either. For all of the looking down their noses at us that they do, these two enlightened people don't exactly have all their facts straight. For example, in the chapter about Henry Pym, they describe how a person that is getting larger would actually become weaker with size, so that eventually he would not even be able to support his own weight. So that means that my 36 year old body is impossible because I am alot bigger than I was when I was 5. But yet, here I am. Heck, maybe I'm a superhero... I guess dinosaurs were impossible too, because they were pretty doggone big. The authors also say that Pym shrinking down to ant size would increase his relative strength tremendously. If this would be the case, at 5'-11\\" I can lift my own weight so that would mean that a person significantly smaller than me, such as a midget, should be able to lift many time his/her own weight. I don't think so....Now, the famous X-Men chapter... As a believer in the Bible, I am deeply offended by this chapter. Not one single scientific fact was made about the X-Men. NOT A SINGLE ONE. Instead, the authors used this chapter as a soapbox to deliver a long tirade about how they think Creationists are trying to deceive the world about our origins. They go on to say that everyone who believes in Creationism thinks that the world was created on October 22, 4004 BCE!!! Let me tell you, I believe that God created the Universe, but I have never heard this mess about October 22, 4004 BCE. Through this entire chapter, they do nothing but ridicule and insult people who believe in God and Creation. Then to top it all off, they end the chapter by saying the X-Men are not only possible, but probable in our future!!!! So, we get to look forward to guys shooting lasers our of their eyes, people controlling the weather with their minds, people who can morph into perfect copies of other people, not to mention others who can walk through walls, freeze moisture in the air, shoot fire from their hands, etc... Hey, the authors said all this is probably going to happen in our future!! (sigh) This chapter alone was enough to make me stop reading this book. It was not a very enjoyable read to begin with, but once I got to the end of the X-Men chapter I had enough. And from other reviews, I see that the authors think Donald Duck is the shining example of a good scientific comic book. As one other reviewer said... Talking Ducks....To sum it all up, I don't see that there is any market for this book. People wanting to know the science behind their favorite superhero are not going to enjoy this book because they will find out that nothing supports their favorite character, unless that character just happens to be blue and can teleport with a BAMF sound, which in that case the authors say that is entirely probable. People who are not interested in superheroes are not going to buy this book for obvious reasons. So who does that leave as the target audience of this book??No one.And that is exactly who I would recommend this book to."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"I haven't done this in awhile, but I don't think I could review this piece any better than the other reviews I've read about it.

Y'know, if you're looking for abject realism in comic books, a medium literally--LITERALLY--built ENTIRELY and WHOLLY on the notion that a pair of hornrimmed glasses is an effective disguise, you really ought to go find some other pool to pee in. A book contrasting Einsteinian physics with the delightful fantasy magic of super-hero derring-do actually sounded as if it'd be fun to read, but I was taken aback that the last two sentences of every chapter might as well have been, \\"So, in conclusion, super-heroes are...well...just stupid. Aren't you glad you know that now?\\" THE SCIENCE OF SUPERHEROES leeches all the charm and sense of wonder out of these adolescent-fantasy characters without offering in place any qualities equally (or even remotely) as uplifting or imaginative, and reading it is like listening to someone try to sound entertaining by explaining a joke.

Second, the criticism read here in some reviews that is does not detail the [pro] 'science of super heroes' is little off...as if the book should show how everything the Fantastic Four do is possible. Anyway, my criticism,and it has been touched on here, is that each chapter starts with a few stories of a Super Hero (or Villian in other book), and then the writers spend the rest of the chapter on that aspect of possible/impossible science they wish to lecture on. (There can't be \\"infinite worlds...\\"[mathematics] ...Flash can't go faster than light...ignoring all the more obvious anti-science wonders of the super heroes (Flash's 'vibrating molecules ability').

This classic and original book still beats all of the other imitations that followed it.It is great reading."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"I wasn't very impressed with this book. The writer is full of himself. Gresh and Weinberg use the opportunity to demolish the science in fiction behind superheroes rather than offer alternative theories for superhero origins that are palatable. It seems as if the main purpose of the book is to affirm the authors are a scientific authority. To make matters worst on pages 133 through 142 the writers go on a tirade against Creationism and not just in the pages of comic books but in general, offering no justification as to why the topic is included let alone covered in a book that by title leads one to think of a work highly objective and honest in investigation. Fortunately the writers do not include in their study superhero powers normally considered \`outside' the realm of science such as the \`Power Cosmic' (Marvel Comics/Galactus, Silver Surfer, etc.,) and the Supernatural (Thor, Dr. Strange, Shazam/Captain Marvel, The Spectre). It's just as well for both are clearly beyond the limited scope of this book, philosophically to say the least.The only good thing that I can say about The Science of Superheroes is that it's an excellent resource for writers contemplating new superheroes who want to avoid highly publicized mistakes made by writers before them."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"If you read Dean Koontz' introduction and the blurbs on the back, you'd be expecting a hilarious romp through real-world science as compoared to the world of mainstream superheroes. While the book does treat the matter with some humor, most of it is actually a quite serious, well-research, and well-thought examination of the subject, comparing what the comic books say about such iconic characters as Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, and the Hulk with what's actually possible in the real world. The authors are even gracious enough to allow for science that just isn't known yet, only addressing something as \\"false\\" if it clearly contradicts what's known.The best moment in the book is near the end of the chapter on the Hulk, where the authors give the character a re-imagining based on real science -- and the result is not only brilliant, but could work for storytelling just as well the original.The worst moment, unfortunately, comes in most of Chapter 9, which discusses the X-Men. If the authors had followed the brilliance of the first eight chapters, they would have discussed genetic mutations and speciation as they've been observed in the real world -- and there have been many examples, as proven most clearly by the existence of domestic sheep, cattle, cats, and dogs that affect our lives daily. Instead, they wander off into a discussion on Evolution versus Creation, which has little to do with the X-Men story (and while they make some valid points, they also make some specious ones and make several remarks that specifically belittle faithful Christians).Rather than let one poorly-done chapter ruin the entire book, however, I recommend the reader simply skip that one chapter and enjoy the rest. The idea that superhero stories and real-world science can coexist is one whose time is well overdue."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"I had very high hopes for this book, sadly I was very disappointed.The only reason I finished the book was to give it as thorough and un-biased review as possible. The first couple of chapters were quite enjoyable, but the rest of the book just kept me wishing that it was going to get better.What bothered me the most about this book was the frequent use of the word \\"impossible\\". The closed minded approach to the science they addressed is reminiscent of somebody saying the world is flat, that the earth is the center of the universe, that submarines were works of only inventive writers or that the sound barrier can not be broken. The book states that traveling past the speed of light is impossible (the chapter about the Flash), but in a later chapter it goes on to say that time travel is possible. Combine this with the book contradicting itself in the same chapter (the chapter about Spider-Man) and you end up wanting to throttle the authors for their inconsistency.Then there is the completely irrelevant discussion of creationism in the chapter that was supposed to be about the X-men and evolution. The discussion took up most of the chapter and had nothing to do with mutation.It is obvious by the end of the book that the authors have done little to zero research on any comic book written since the 80's. Their belief seems to be that Donald Duck was the best comic book ever and that there are no strong super heroines.Do not waste your time or hard earned money on this book. It has a few (very few) shinning moments of good writing. But they do not offset the obvious dislike of comic books and those who work in the comic book industry."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"Despite the negative words of a previous poster, this book is not mean spirited or nasty. It takes a humorous and friendly look at superhero origin stories and points out how ridiculous they are. From there, the authors point out how the origins could have been written, using common science knowledge, to make the stories more believable. For example, they point out that having the Hulk created by high-level radiation is impossible - such a massive dose of radiation would destroy human tissues. Instead the authors demonstrate that by using steroids and gene research a believable Hulk origin could be written. This book points out that good science and good comics can work together. Until the comic book writers learn this lesson, their work will always be considered juvenile kid stuff. It's time for comic book writers, editors and publishers to enter the 21st century and stop copying the mistakes of the 1950's and 1960's. If you want to see where comics are heading in the future, this is a book you have to buy!"},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"...I hoped a lot, too, but didn't get what I had hoped for.As you can imagine, this book's chosen task is to examine superheroic powers from the standpoint of present-day science and try to figure out how the whole strong-fast-fly thing might work. Instead, all the authors do is fill a book with explanations of how such things might never be. Imagine attending Billy Graham's funeral - with the elegy pronounced by Madalyn Murray O'Hair.Examples? Superman couldn't straighten a falling building, it would fall apart around him. He couldn't fly, because we can't figure out how it would be done. He couldn't have come from Krypton, because such a planet would be too far away. On page 18 they wrap up the original superhero with \\"As we've shown, visitors from other planets are possible. Superman's not.\\"What if you want to \\"make mine Marvel!\\"? Simple. \\"We can't fix the Fantastic Four. Their powers are too bizarre to explain, no matter what their origin\\" (page 29).Man, there's a whole 200 pages of this pooh-poohing, cranky-old-maid kind of stuff!What made me the angriest was the chapter that was supposedly about Marvel's X-Men. In a 15-page chapter titled \\"Good, Evil, and Indifferent Mutants,\\" about half of the chapter is about the comic-book characters. The other half is a rather obvious rant preaching the \\"Gospel of Evolution.\\" Gresh and Weinberg evidently feel that you can't have \\"X-men type\\" mutations without the whole nine yards of the Theory of Evolution as baggage. That's fine with me, except ...Their idea of showing how scientifically viable Evolution is, is by calling those who disagree with them STUPID. They set up a Straw Man of \\"what all Creationists believe\\" and then knock the stuffings out of it. Supposedly, anybody who believes God created humanity as a separate species also believes that He did it in 4004 BC, etc ... the kinds of dogmas held at the Scopes Monkey Trial.But the authors have created a hypothetical rope-a-dope \\"Christian.\\" On pp 137-8 they say, \\"If God created everything at one time (4004 B.C.E.) and God created man in his own image, man is already as perfect as God intended. Mutations in humans would demonstrate that man wasn't perfect when he was created.\\"Well, DUH. How could these smart folks know so much about Christianity without knowing its central premise? Which says something like, \\"We were created perfect, but chose to do something wrong. That's why Jesus came in the first place, to re-connect us with our Creator.\\"So yes, we might have been created perfect, but we sure ain't perfect no more! Besides, how could God have created everything at one time when my grand-daughter Jazra is only a couple of months old? Evidently the authors' understanding of \\"Christian\\" beliefs is meager at best.That's what really gripes me - Gresh and Weinstein spend time making fun of their make-believe Christian but don't spend any space talking about the X-Men! For example, could you really replace somebody's skeleton with Adamantium without the body trying to reject the foreign matter? Could the melanin in someone's body actually change enough to enable one person to look like another? Does the human body contain enough energy to project heat, or cold? Are there any known wavelengths that have the property of freezing something, for that matter?No, you don't get that. All you get is a book full of, \\"It can't be done, and this is why.\\" I keep thinking of Frank Edward's image when he wrote about the old chestnut of \\"the impossible bumblebee.\\" Supposedly the bumblebee is aerodynamically impossible, its wings are too short, etc. But since the bumblebee hasn't read the physics books, it just keeps flying.This book won't set your imagination flying. It'll tie your imagination to an anvil and throw it into Lake Michigan. Don't do what I did when I spent money on it."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"Perhaps movie director Kevin Smith said it best when he commented that it was a touch of the impossible that makes superheroes so appealing: \\"Nobody's built like superheroes are in the comics, women or men. If you were really as ripped as The Hulk, you couldn't leap from building to building -you'd barely be able to stretch enough to put on your socks.\\"Gresh and Weinberg address this and many other blatant impossibilities in an absorbing collection of real-world science lessons that dissect, piece by piece, some of the central plotlines of most superhero comic book stories. Beginning with the \\"is there intelligent life on other planets?\\" question that revolves around Superman's origins, the book points out the many and varied examples of \\"pseudo-science\\" and assorted technobabble that form many a backstory.Each chapter begins with a well-known superhero's origins, along with a brief history of the storyline and developments along the course of that character's emergence as a popular genre icon. After this summary, a thorough (and merciless) scientific or technical debunking follows. The true nature of cosmic radiation and gamma radiation (the supposed genesis of Marvel's Fantastic Four and the Incredible Hulk) are explained. A brief history of the legend of Atlantis and some basic marine biology follows (erasing the likelihood of characters such as Aquaman and the Sub-Mariner). A lesson on arachnid physiology and behavior is examined, making Spider-Man's powers seem pretty far-fetched. A few fundamental premises about mass-energy conservation are reviewed, putting the idea of fifty-story giants or microbe-sized superheroes firmly outside the realm of believability, as well as the premise of high-speed heroes such as The Flash and The Avengers' Quicksilver.Other elements of the superhero universe, however, are given a touch more credibility -the notion of containing the energies of a black hole is hypothesized, lending a faint respectability to the premise behind Green Lantern's abilities. Likewise the varied (and occasionally opposing) theories of human evolution and mutation are addressed, which at least provides some tangible groundwork to the recurring central theme of the X-Men. Of course some of the X-Men's individual superhuman powers remain strictly fictional, such as emitting high-energy plasma from one's eyes (Cyclops) or the ability to transform one's own skin into metal alloy (Colossus). Nonetheless some other gifts, most of which revolve around the phenomenon of psychokinesis (as with Storm) or telepathy (as with Professor X or his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Jean Grey), are examined and a number of inadequately-explained medical cases presented.In only one chapter do the authors relent and admit that one superhero premise is entirely possible in today's world: the story of Batman. Part of that particular title's long-lasting appeal has to do with the fact that its hero has no superhuman abilities -apart from his obsessive drive and lightning-fast powers of deductive reasoning. There is nothing substantially part of Bruce Wayne's night vigilantism that isn't truly beyond the realm of possibility. Even the once-fantastic miniature crimefighting devices attached to Batman's ubiquitous \\"utility belt\\" are today a fairly standard and unremarkable collection of equipment that could be found in any cop or detective's vest pocket or glove compartment (\\"buildering\\" cable, miniature camera, fingerprint kit, lockpick, smoke/gas capsule, oxyacetylene torch, infrared goggles, wireless surveillance gear, etc). To quote Kevin Smith again: \\"With a lifetime of training, you could be Batman. You'd need an assload of bank for the cool cave and the car, but you could do it if you were really committed.\\"The upshot of Gresh and Weinberg's collection of science refreshers isn't so much to let the wind out of the collective sails of comic book fans and superhero aficionados, so much as it is to reaffirm the superhero's unique position in contemporary culture. As with Star Wars, Harry Potter, and other popular fiction, our enjoyment of these amazing characters' exploits has little to do with scientific plausibility or how believable their powers are; it is something more primal that causes them to endure and reinvent themselves generation after generation. In the authors' words, \\"these are characters that we want to be real.\\""},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"In &quot;The Science of Superheroes&quot; authors Lois H. Gresh and Robert Weinberg put together a full out assault on the willing suspension of disbelief that allows us to enjoy comic book superheroes from Superman to the X-Men. You probably knew in the back of your mind that the Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man, Green Lantern, and Aquaman could never exist in the real world. Well you were right. But Gresh and Weinberg are here to explain to you in terms of science, which means that when it comes to proving that Henry Pym turning into Goliath would be a bad thing or that the Flash could not possibly run that fast, they actually do the math (at which point I nod my head and move on, because if you think I am going to double-check their calculations you are sadly mistaken).After a preface that looks at how superhero comic books came about, an introduction by Dean Koontz entitled &quot;Men of Steel, Feathers of Fury,&quot; Gresh and Weinberg devote chapters to the cream of the superhero crop. First up, of course, is Superman, which spends a lot of time examining the math on alien visitors before disproving the idea that the difference in the gravity on Krypton and Earth accounts for Superman's powers (I wonder what they make of the current living solar battery idea). Chapters are then devoted to the Fantastic Four and the Incredible Hulk, Batman, Aquaman and Sub-Mariner, Spider-Man, the Green Lanterns, Ant Man and the Atom, the Flash, the X-Men, science fiction superheroes, and Donald Duck. The last chapter is actually an encomium to Carl Barks, who used science and technology during the golden age of Disney comics.I picked up this book because I teach Spider-Man in my Popular Culture class and so that chapter alone justified the price of the book for me. I should be able to impress my students by pointing out that of Peter Parker's physical spider powers only his spider grip is actually associated with a real type of spider (the hunting spider). In the past I have just shared with my students &quot;The Daily Onion&quot; fake headline that talks about how Peter Parker died of Leukemia after being bit by a radioactive spider, so this should give me some more credibility (but I am still going to use the joke).Ironically it is where Gresh and Weinberg can show that the creators of a particular superhero were at least in the ballpark, such as when they come up with an alternative and more plausible explanation for the Hulk, that &quot;The Science of Superheroes&quot; is most interesting. Sections where they get into things like fluid breathing and talking to fish are tangentially interesting, but when you get into topics like the Square Cubed Law or the origin of black holes it comes across as overkill. If while reading this book you suddenly hear a small voice in your head warning &quot;Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain,&quot; you will not be alone. This is definitely not a book to sit down and read all at once, because chapter after chapter exposing the holes in the scientific rationales for your favorite superheroes can wear you down after a while. But there is enough here of interest for most comic book fans. The authors may be a couple of science geeks, but they are the type that were weaned on comic books and their criticisms are done with affection, even if its hard to get back to anything close to square one on the aforementioned willing suspension of disbelief by the time you finish this volume (at least there is not an exam).The back of &quot;The Science of Superheroes&quot; includes a couple of appendixes, the first explaining &quot;Who Missed the Cut?&quot; (neither super villains nor characters with supernatural origins made it) and the second where comic book creators (including Len Wein and Max Allan Collins) answer some questions about science and comic books today. Both of these added sections allow the authors to flesh out their overall thesis a bit more and show how comic book creators today pay attention to science in a different way than those in the Golden Age and Silver Age of comics. I did not even take biology in high school, so everything that Gresh and Weinberg come up with is way over my head, but they do a good job of communicating their points so that even somebody like me can understand their basic arguments."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"I can only echo what the 2stars or lower reviewers said:This is a lazily-written book that craps all over an interesting premise. Too much time on origin stories (apparently to bloat the page-count), when 95% of the target audience knows all this stuff.If you're a comics fan who wants to know what's possible, impossible and if there's \\"any way these things could happen,\\" you'll come away very dissapointed. The only part that rises above itself is the alternative, more plausible explanation for the Hulk's origins.The X-Men chapter is awful (for an evolution vs creatonism 'debate,' google it, and any random piece will be better written).Even the science is off, or at least not followed through. While the Square-Cubed Law is touched on (why Ant Men and Giant Ants will never happen), the same rules/restrictions are not factored into the issue of super-strength. I know why Spider-Man has almost nothign to do with a \\"six foot spider\\". But tell me why he (or any human sized living creature) is prohibited from \\"pressing 10 tons\\" (Marvel Universe stat). Or are they?Too much of this book is about why all this is \\"impossible\\", using 9th grade physics. But none of it, or virtually none of it, exlores how it _could be_.How strong could an Iron Man be in reality? If we could somehow alter the genes to strength bones/muscle, how powerful could a Spider-Man type be? Is there any way to circumvent Sqaure-Cube Law, or the restrictions of size-scaling? THAT'S what I wanted to hear about.Buy it if it's avaialable used for a buck or two, but otherwise you'll be really dissapointed."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"I really wanted to like this book, as I have a fondness for the writing of Robert Weinberg. However, I found this book to be tedious, lacking in charm, badly researched and wildy inaccurate in some areas.While it's clear that the authors (or at least one of them) love comic books, it's also clear that they haven't done much reading of them since the early 80's. The book spends much of its length deriding the lack of scientific thought behind superheroes, ignoring the efforts of modern writers to make their characters at least slightly more realistic. Frequently, the characters that they dissect are the 1950's versions, while in the comic books those characters have moved on considerably.Also, I found the whole direction of the book disappointing. Sure, there's a good deal of accurate science here, but there's also some spurious material, and when it appears it's almost always used to disprove a \\"superheroic\\" possibility. In fact, the entire book seems designed to show us how superheroes are impossible, which seems to carry with it the message that science is boring. It would have been far more engaging to show how certain superheroes (or approximations of them) might be scientifically possible.Compare and contrast this book to the far more interesting and engaging \\"The Science of Superman\\" by Mark Wolverton and Roger Stern. Sure, it's less scientifically rigourous, but it's also much more interesting and more likely to encourage the reader to delve more into the subject. The sub-text of this book appears to be \\"superheroes are impossible, and you're stupid for reading about them.\\"That said, there are some interesting sections. The science is, for the most part, good, if a little out-dated. Just don't rely on this book for an idea of what modern superheroes are about."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"Superhero stories are used to introduce discussions of various scientific questions -- Superman for the possibility of alien life, the Hulk for gamma rays, Batman for devices like those he has in his utility belt, and so on. There's also a chapter on the EC science fiction comics -- although it sounds as though it's more accurate to describe them as science-less morality tales -- and DC's STRANGE ADVENTURES and MYSTERY IN SPACE.The last chapter praises the \\"one comic book writer [who] never cheated his audience\\" because \\"he used real science and real technology in his stories.\\" Surprisingly, they're talking about Carl Barks writing Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge. There are also two appendices: The first mentions material that wasn't covered in the book and why it was left out. The second is a collection of brief interviews with creators, including Len Wein, Mark Wheatley, Brett Booth, and Max Allan Collins.The book is written in clear, direct prose that lays out everything you need to know, whether it's the laws of science or the history of a particular superhero. I found the origin sections enjoyable to read even thought I already knew most of them. For example, the Superman chapter begins with a history of the character from a social and cultural perspective before pointing out some of the scientific problems, like how Superman can lift a building without it falling apart.The authors conclude that Marvel's characters were more likely to be based on inaccurate science than DC's, because DC's writers were more familiar with popular science theories and science fiction. In contrast to that theory, though, the Atom comes in for the biggest roasting, perhaps because his comic tried so hard to be plausible by using scientific technobabble.One of the shorter chapters is the one covering the Hulk and the Fantastic Four, since instead of becoming transformed, if treated scientifically, the heroes should have died. To fill out the section, the authors give us a more plausible (given what we know now) origin for the Hulk, involving steroids and fluorescent gene modification. I would have liked to have seen similar treatments for other characters, since I appreciated the imagination and realism that went into their rewrite.Overall, the book has just the right tone -- straightforward, educational, but not too stuffy or serious. They aren't making fun of superheroes or poking holes in the stories, but using them as springboards to teach readers more about the principles behind the concepts. At the same time, they aren't bending over backwards to make the heroes \\"realistic\\" or believable; they understand that some things are done for the sake of interesting or exciting stories.(PS if the \\"mwaid\\" above is Mark Waid, comic book writer, I'm surprised that someone who's written humorous superhero stories in the past would react so badly to a fun read that appreciates the genre without taking it too seriously.)"},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"This is an excellent book for those who are not obsessed with superheros but find things like their origins of some interest. For the full on superhero fans who know every episode inside and out of their favourite comic book character I do not think this book would suffice though. It just doesn't go to those depths of research to satisfy them and they would probably know all the stuff inside here anyway. For people like me who have read one or two comics and seen the odd television show as a kid this book more than meets our needs.An excellent introduction by Dean Koontz starts this book and then the reader is taken to specific chapters on specific superheros which also makes this an easy to use reference book for assignments or something. There are sections on Superman, the Incredible Hulk, Fantastic Four, Batman, Aquaman, Sub-Mariner, Spiderman, Green Lantern, Ant Man, The Flash, The X-Men and for some reason Donald Duck. Time travel, doomsday, super science and other major parts of superhero comics also have their own chapter. Like I said this book will not satisfy full on fans of guys who wear their underwear over the outside of their pants but for those with a slight interest in the subject this will more than satisfy."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"It's incredibly rare for me to not finish a book once I start reading; I feel that I at least owe it to the author to get to the end.Couldn't do it on this one. Way to boring.I was excited about reading this as I had read \\"Science of Star Trek\\" (no idea if it's the same author or not) and found that book to be very good. The author states on the page for the Superhero book that he is on a mission to write one book for every year alive. He is turning into a book writing machine and it shows.Too much detail about things that don't need to be explained, e.g. I do not care about the history of comic books.Boring writing style.I really wanted to give this book five stars because these type of books make science entertaining and fun to learn about."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"This was a fun read - but it had several problems. When the man (Dean Koontz in this case) writing the introduction says he doesn't read comics, I began to get worried. It would seem to spell trouble if a book on comics couldn't get an intro writer who was at least knowledgeable about the subject matter.Second - the section on Mutants talks about mutation in general, but never really applies it to actual mutant powers in the comic books - there is no attempt to talk about the plausibility or implausability of mutations causing super powers.Then, that same chapter ditches science for an all out attack on creation scientists. Now, creation scientists deserve most of what was said here, but this book seemed an odd soapbox for that attack. I was expecting yet another brief, amazingly general and popular explanation of science as it relates to another comic book concept - and instead we get a \\"Creationists [are bad]...\\" diatribe. It was out of place and inappropriate.Overall, it's an okay book, but I doubt it will ever be a classic."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"Lois Gresh and Robert Weinberg have set up an interesting project for themselves in The Science of Superheores. They take a look at certain characters (Superman, Fantastic Four, Spiderman, Batman, Atom and Ant-Man, Hulk, X-mutants, Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman and Sub-Mariner) and examine particular aspects of their origin or powers in light of what is known about science. The book could have a light-hearted debunking romp but the science sections are very series and weighty, perhaps too much. As a former (?) comic nerd who never reached uber-nerd status by combining that love with a love of science, it was interesting to see these two authors take one love to attack another, particularly as they digress into science topics that are clearly their favourites. The chapter that is the most fascinating, though, is the loving one on Donald Duck comics at the end of the book. An interesting look at science in a quick and easy read that will be scooped up by comic fans."},{"Title":"The Science of Superheroes","review":"I found this book entertaining and a quick, easy read. Gresh &amp; Weinberg clearly &amp; simply explain what could be complex scientific concepts about most of my favorite superheroes. But you have to be flexible about perceiving the content, though, as their science isn't friendly to all comic heroes. They are balanced (Batman, X-Men could happen, Superman, Spiderman, Flash, the science doesn't hold). They are pro-comic, I thought, and you'd have to be: only comicbook lovers will like this book. I found &quot;Science&quot; a chance to laugh about the heroes I still love and that mean so much to me, and they shed some light on writing in this genre. Good summer beach reading."},{"Title":"Ball Lightning: An Unsolved Problem in Atmospheric Physics","review":"Ball lightning obviously is an extremely rare event. As in the case of other rare phenomena, the investigator is dependent on reports of casual witnesses, because systematic observing programs are not possible. The reports collected over many years include reliable as well as doubtful information. Stenhoff gives a good sample of reports, photos and descriptions. These clearly show the range of observed phenomena and the questions which remain open. The summary of sightings and the review of theories to explain the variety of observations makes the book very valuable, particularly as there is no comparable recent publication on this topic. I also appreciate the list of references (up to 1998 publications) which allows to look for details regarding reports as well as theoretical papers. All together: highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ball Lightning: An Unsolved Problem in Atmospheric Physics","review":"This book is by far presents the best un-bias scientific analysis of ball lightning since the 1900's.

And believe me I have a lot of books on Nutrition. If you want to understand nutrition, especially the science of nutrition, as well as its practical application, this is the book for you. Written in an extremely student-friendly way, the authors of this book really do take difficult biochemical concepts and present them in terms and graphics that are very easy to understand, even for someone who has no science background or has not taken a course in Anatomy and Physiology.One of the authors was recognized with a National award for Excellence in College and University teaching in the Food and Agricultural Sciences by the USDA, and another author has special expertise in communicating complicated physiological processes with easily understood graphical presentations. While I have a more holistic approach to nutrition than authors of this book and do not necessarily agree with some of the statements made in the book about the safety of GM foods or no need for dietary supplements, this does not detract one bit from my opinion of the the overall excellence of this nutrition textbook. if someone wants to really learn about the science of nutrition and is looking for a student-friendly book that is easy to understand, and/or is struggling to understand the science concepts in other nutrition texts, look no further.

I myself am a literalist, in that I feel the Bible is a literal message of God to us written throughout Genesis through Revelation. But I am humble enough to admit that even I get lost in the shuffle of books that surround me, especially those dealing with the Old Testament. That is why I wish to tell anyone and everyone that if you need one book on Genesis, this book by Kline is the best one out there IMO (I would also suggest How to Read Genesis, which is also an A+ book, but should be read after Kline's). Kline goes into detail not in terms of whether or not it was 24 hours, or whatnot, but instead explores the meaning and the theology and (redemptive) history behind Genesis. You could say that Kline helps one to look at it through the eyes of the entire Bible, along with the culture at the time of Moses' writings of Genesis and the other books that make up the Torah. We must realize that the Bible was not written to battle Evolution, which I believe is false but that is beside the point, nor was it written in the eyes of how we today in the 21st century view historical writing. Instead, you might say, Kline helps you study and understand Genesis in such a way that you are given the understanding (and much much more) of Genesis through the eyes of those that Moses would have read it to, along with later generations of those Jews who would hold faith in God, leading up to Jesus Christ, the very image of God. If you want a better understanding of Genesis, if you want something that will help you through seminary studies and in the long run, you must find this book and keep it and treasure it."},{"Title":"Kingdom prologue","review":"Although this book is available for free online in .pdf format, books are forever. Meredith Kline's understanding of the Bible includes his Fiat/fulfillment theory, which has greatly increased my understanding of many aspects of theology, and not just creation. Buy this book if you want to learn."},{"Title":"Kingdom prologue","review":"How grateful I am to see that Dr. Kline finally got his works published. I had him as a hermeneutics professor 20 years ago in Seminary, and am extremely gratified to find the manuscript texts I lost some years back (during a move between cities), here.Kline's best work came with the first 6 chapters of Genesis. Even in 1988, he had spent some 30 years of his life studying the first chapters of Genesis in great detail--in the original ancient Hebrew (etc).Though his wording can be thick and \\"theologically stilted\\" (ie. tough to wade through and brainy), it also provides an illuminating view of the foundational truths of the one, living, Creator-God, and His dealings with His Creation--especially man.While some have posted negative reviews, it is unlikely that they have spent 30-50 years of their lives studying such texts in their original languages, and teaching in so much depth--as Kline did. Nor have they known his instruction first-hand, as I have.Kline is a true conservative, and strictly orthodox in his approach to Scripture. Some here, have accused him of fitting his interpretation of Scripture to his own mental framework (eisegesis), rather than building a framework from his deep knowledge of the original texts (exegesis). They'd be wrong.[Geerhardus Vos, himself, called Kline: \\"The Prince of Exegetes\\" (and that's no small thing), but Kline played such things down, pouring himself, instead, into God's Word.]I can't say that I agree(d) with Dr. Kline in all respects, but I did always respect him. He made me think, and question what I believe in relation to the text--God's words. So, I am glad to purchase this this text, and wade through it again.When I knew him, his best & favorite work (by his own admission) had been through Genesis chapter 6, though his treatment through Abram/Abraham is also thought-provoking.So, if you're up to wading through some thick, but thought-provoking material, have a go at this. Your time won't be wasted.[Oh, and the thought that Kline was not reformed or a Calvinist (or even a heretic, as proposed by some leaving reviews) is laughable. Kline was so reformed/such a Calvinist, he squeeked.]"},{"Title":"Kingdom prologue","review":"This book by Kline is a wonderful commentary on the first chanpters of Genesis. Kline's background in Ancient Near Eastern Studies gives him special insight into the meaning of many of the peculiar phrasings in Genesis. Read this book if you want to be edified in your faith, or just want to learn more about the God of the Bible."},{"Title":"Kingdom prologue","review":"Kline's understanding of biblical theology is top. Get ready for a volume that is packed with helpful insight into the covenantal structure of Genesis - and beyond. Be warned, however, if you are expecting a simple introduction to covenant theology, Kline's vocabulary and grasp are very extensive and specialized. For a wonderful introduction, check out Chris Caughey's \\"A Tale of Two Adams\\", which is a great distillation of much of Kline's work.While the subtitle of Kingdom Prologue - \\"Genesis foundations for a covenantal worldview\\" - suggests a limited scope of Genesis, the reader will find out that Kline explores the whole canon, from Genesis to Revelation, to help paint the picture of the unity of history and Scripture by God's divinely administered covenants."},{"Title":"Kingdom prologue","review":"Both as a book on biblical theology and covenant theology this is indispensable. It is one of the best exegetical treatments of covenant around and also demonstrates lucidly that Genesis 1-12 provides a real seed bed for the rest of the Bible's story line."},{"Title":"Kingdom prologue","review":"Without a doubt, this book is one of the best (if not the best) books I have read on Genesis. If you're planning on preaching or teaching through Genesis, you cannot afford to be ignorant of Kline's work. You'll find vast amounts of material here not even touched in other commentaries of equal or larger size. Kline doesn't waste your time with giving you information that is accessible elsewhere. Instead, he blazes trails that others don't even think of going down. His conclusions are creative (but orthodox!), to say the least.If you're planning on preaching through Genesis and looking for suggestions for other commentaries, the following should be helpful:1. Preaching Christ from Genesis by Sydney Greidanus (my personal favorite)2. Unlocking Genesis 1-3 with the Christ of Eschatology by J.V. Fesko (Only covers the first 3 chapters, but is immensely helpful)3. Creation and Blessing by Allen Ross (Good, solid commentary that gets straight to the point)4. Genesis 1-17 in the NICNT by Victor Hamilton (painfully dry but good information)5. Kingdom Prologue by Meredith Kline6. Images of the Spirit by Meredith Kline (this book is frequently referred to in Kingdom Prologue, and often goes into more detail)If you're on a tight budget, this book is actually available as a pdf file on Monergism's website (just google \\"monergism classic resources\\" and search there). If you don't have a lot of time, then Hamilton, Fesko, and Greidanus should get the job done pretty easily."},{"Title":"Kingdom prologue","review":"Meredith Kline is at times difficult to understand and difficult to follow. This work would have benefited from an editor or coauthor. With that said, if you take the time to understand Meredith Kline then you will be rewarded for your effort. Many of the idea's that you encounter in this work you will also find validated in more recent works. One recent example of this is G. K. Beale's A New Testament Biblical Theology. While not following Kline on every point it would be difficult to miss Kline's influence.There are many good resources available for free on the internet that aide in better understanding the thought of Meredith Kline. For those beginning to approach Biblical Theology I recommend Lee Iron's Introduction to Kline mp3 series that can be accessed The Upper Register.Many readers will perhaps be turned off my Kline's Framework approach to Genesis 1. This approach doesn't discount the possibility of a six day creation but instead focuses on the theological and literary meaning of the text. Kline's use of comparative ANE studies sets an example for those who desire to understand the Old Testament in its original context. This isn't some novel concept. A similar approach is taken in New Testament studies when second temple literature is analyzed in order to understand the conceptual thought world of the day. While these works are not equal to scripture they are invaluable in helping us understand the competing ideas that would set themselves up against God's revelation. When you understand some of the ideas that existed in regards to creation in the ancient Near East you see with greater clarity the theological claims made in not only Genesis 1 but the rest of Genesis.The author is a reformed and covenantal theologian. This will be strange to many readers, both those unfamiliar with reformed theology and those unfamiliar with Covenant theology. The benefit of the covenantal approach is that it weds systematic to biblical theology. Reformed theology that is abstracted from God's unfolding covenantal relation is a hard thing.Kline takes \\"the unfolding of God's Covenantal Kingdom\\" as his approach to the grand theme of scripture. This is a helpful approach and will need to be incorporated in any future attempt to discern questions of central storyline."},{"Title":"Kingdom prologue","review":"As a person who is fond of Calvin, Turretin, Bavinck, Murray, Lloyd-Jones, C.S. Lewis, Schaeffer, Poythress, et. al, I found Kline is only one step to heresy.For example,\\"Let us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness...\\" (Gen. 1:26)Who are \\"us\\" here? Kline says \\"angels\\" (see also p.242 in The Genesis Debate, ISBN-13: 978-0970224507)This is directly against the next verse, Gen. 1:27, \\"So God created man in his own image, in the image of GOD he created him, male and female he created them.\\"There are numerous other instances that Kline shows his tendency to New Age instead of Biblical, Christian, and Reformed Thoughts. Kline is wordy and equivocating. His arguments are circular, tricky, and frequently self-contradictory. Although this book is filled with \\"orthodox\\" terminologies, its incoherence reduces his arguments to worthless words.If you want to empty your church, read Kline!"},{"Title":"Kingdom prologue","review":"Waste of money if you buy it;Waste of time if you read it;A perfect example of \\"eisgesis\\": Kline read-in his theological presupposition into biblical texts, instead of read-out (exegesis) what the Bible teaches.Preposterous: Kline is full of inconsistencies in his writing and argument. He writes something first, and then nullifies what he just said in the next paragraph or page.Very bad arguments: Kline does not know how to argue consistently; he frequently changes subject during argument. (Fallacy pointed out by Aristotle)Confusing: Kline uses many Christian and theological terminologies, but he add his own definitions/interpretations to them. For example, he says that it is God's \\"judgments\\" when God 'saw' it was very good (Genesis 1). The book is full of this kind of confusion. Should we confuse 'see' with 'judge'? Should we say God is 'judging' Jesus Christ when he \\"says\\" 'this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased'? Should we say Jesus Christ is 'judging' God when he \\"says\\" 'God alone is good'?Overloads biblical texts: This is a typical book of the \\"Emperor's New Cloth.\\" While some celebrate Kline's \\"creative\\" thinking, the fact is that he overloads the biblical texts without warrant.A responsible reader should say, \\"STOP! This is NOT biblical exegesis! This is personal eisgesis. The emperor has no cloth on!\\""},{"Title":"Jesus Goes to Hollywood: The Alternative Theories About Christ","review":"I especially enjoyed the combination of research and factual information about Jesus alternating with a fictional account of a Messiah figure who appears on Earth for a Second Coming. There is an element of mystery in these alternate chapters which kept me interested in turning the pages. I enjoyed William Bramley's first book The Gods of Eden, and I found this book even more interesting."},{"Title":"Jesus Goes to Hollywood: The Alternative Theories About Christ","review":"Jesus Goes To Hollywood: The Alternative Theories About Christ is a compilation of iconoclastic theories about Jesus drawn from scholarly inquiries, metaphysical sources, and the theological clashes between orthodoxy and heresies. This methodical survey about \\"everything you never wanted to know about Christ, or were afraid to ask\\" covers such topics as the angels alleged to be in contact with Christ, whether Jesus visited other continents including North America, what unusual religious such as Gnosticism have to say about Jesus Christ and the afterlife, how hallucinogens affect Christianity, and much more. Written in plain terms, with a smattering of Hollywood-style pastiche to jocularly introduce different topics, Jesus Goes To Hollywood is entertaining yet ultimately a serious- minded weighing of ideas, beliefs, and theological arguments. Highly recommended especially for lay readers with a budding interest in alternative theology."},{"Title":"Jesus Goes to Hollywood: The Alternative Theories About Christ","review":"This book is really different from Bramley's first except in his courage to talk about evidence that many people won't. It is an exhaustive encyclopedia of Jesus Theories that I enjoyed on many levels, and it was far more comprehensive than I expected. Bramley presents all of the theories, not just the ones he believes in, and he has insights about Jesus that I've never read before. Some of the theories can be shocking, but Bramley takes the time to document everything. I think that the title and packaging of this book does it a disservice. Although the title is clever with a nice cover, this is a serious book with university-level scholarship. It's the kind of book you expect to find in libraries and assigned to college students. I give it two thumbs way up."},{"Title":"Jesus Goes to Hollywood: The Alternative Theories About Christ","review":"This is an entertaining book. It isn't bad. The author, who also wrote \\"The Gods of Eden\\" (which I found much more entertaining), weaves a fictional story of a \\"returned\\" possible Christ who is subjected to the doubts and schemes of a Hollywood agent, with a slightly more scholarly set of investigations into varied historical explanations and understandings of the possibly less fictional Christ (but that issue too is briefly addressed). Some ideas were a little more fully developed than others...the \\"homosexual\\" Christ for example...well, afterall it is Hollywood. I wished at times, that the scope would have been more encompassing...there are a lot more ideas out there that didn't make the cut. But of course, if Bramley would have included everything, well...we's probably be having to read several sequels. For those wanting a general overview of the various understandings of the Christ character, this might not be a bad place to start. The book is an easy and quick read, and not too intellectually demanding. It's probably better for those who don't have a hard and fast model of Christ...I can picture this book flying across many a fundy's room."},{"Title":"Jesus Goes to Hollywood: The Alternative Theories About Christ","review":"I do have to say that William Bramley is one of the most balanced and well researched authors that I have ever read. The groundshaking evidence which he offers in support or contradiction of traditional beliefs is nothing less than astounding. This is only the second book of his that I know about, but I do wish that he would write more."},{"Title":"Jesus Goes to Hollywood: The Alternative Theories About Christ","review":"When I first started reading the book, I thought it was just a group of unrelated theories about Jesus. By the time I got to the end, a total picture of Jesus emerged that was mind-blowing. It kind of sneaks up on you as you read: you start by looking at the trees, and by the time you finish, you see the whole forest. Kudos to Bramley for writing the most interesting book about Jesus that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Jesus Goes to Hollywood: The Alternative Theories About Christ","review":"Jesus' real identity is an historical puzzle, and countless theories, from the most plausible to the most outlandish and outrageous have been purported to explain His enduring charisma.

I read most of it in one night and finished it the next day. After coming home from vacation, I loaned it to a friend who speaks some Navajo, and I can't wait to discuss it with him.This book is part autobiography and part epic poem. Blackhorse Mitchell describes a life that every child dreams of living - but may not appreciate the reality of. He leads us through a generation of dramatic change in the Navajo lifestyle, revealing things in his beautiful poetic meter that often appear to come through right between the words. Mr Mitchell has stripped his soul bare for his reader and yet, as a young man, appears to be unaware of it.Currently having secured the rights (he never recieved any royalties!!!), Mr. Mitchell is currently working on a revised edition to be published by the University of Arizona. Godspeed, Blackhorse Mitchell, godspeed."},{"Title":"Miracle Hill: The Story of a Navaho Boy","review":"The writing discloses a sensitive, shy, intelligent boy facing many of the same issues all children face as they grow older; learning about life outside of the family unit, going to school, facing the death of their grandparents. I didn't always follow everything he wrote, but I did learn that at heart he is a poet, that he yearns to know things beyond the horizon and that the written word enabled him to reach beyond that horizon. The poem \\"The Drifting Lonely Seed\\" that was included in the forward will hang forever on my walls. Reading it first allowed me to more fully appreciate every upturned glance at the sky, reference to the passing wind and snuggle with a lamb that he mentions in his book. This book is a great tribute to the power of the written word that allows us to share a glimpse of the life of a Navaho lad in the 1960s. I'm very glad I read it."},{"Title":"WHY ABSTRACT","review":"As a continuum to Henry Miller's chapter about Hilaire Hillel in The Air-Conditioned Nightmare he makes a brilliantly articulate contribution to this book in letter form. His analyses of Hilaire Hillel's murals and paintings in San Francisco is strong as a literary achievement and art criticism. Saroyan's essay is equally as staggering with its prose like quality, and when these two twentieth century greats are stacked beside the painter himself a full compositional portrait is made."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Weight Training Journal","review":"The Ultimate Weight Training Journal is the best log book for weight training that I have seen.

It is huge and has essays dealing with many subjects written by some of the most influential criminologists in England and abroad."},{"Title":"David Goes To School","review":"I reviewed the originalNo David!several months ago, when I proudly awarded it zero stars. I will be only slightly less caustic here, allowing for the fact that (most) schools no longer tolerate corporal punishment, and at the end of the day, it is still Mom and Dad's responsibility to raise a well-adjusted child. Lazy parents cannot expect a teacher to do their job, although sadly many take this opt-out approach.So it's no surprise to see David acting out in class just like he did at home. Chewing gum, cutting the lunch line, physically accosting classmates, and generally causing mayhem. Why? Because his low self-esteem compels him to crave attention, even if that is negative attention.After cleaning all the desks with a sponge and a bucket of soapy water--perhaps scrubbing the toilets with a toothbrush might have taught a more lasting lesson--David earns a star from his teacher in much the same way as a puppy might be rewarded for *not* pooping on the floor, and he is finally allowed to go home. Do his parents wonder why he is so late, or is he in detention so often that it is has become routine?To the extent that problem children *do* exist, and that your child may very well have one in his or her classroom, David Goes to School might provide useful validation. But like the original, innumerable opportunities are missed to actually teach David why his behavior is antisocial and unacceptable. I still think these books glorify poor behavior, and for that reason, it gets the lowest possible rating from me.First Scholastic paperback printing, September 2001"},{"Title":"David Goes To School","review":"I was left with a multitude of feelings after reading this book, if you can call it a book. It is VERY VERY short, too short to even keep a kindergartener interested. One whole page the text is \\"no david no\\" .The moral message of this book is horrible, its funny that this child mis-behaves? Real junk. The only talent is the artist. Skip this one, there are tons of GREAT books out there, with a GREAT moral story and are amusing and interesting."},{"Title":"David Goes To School","review":"The book is a fun read, but I am not sure about the \\"message\\" of the book.David (the main character) is very disobedient and bratty. For 24 pages, David disobeys the teacher, pulls gum out of his mouth, starts (?) a food fight, paints his desk, etc. In the final 5 pages he is finally scolded by the teacher and has to stay after class.The book is fun, but maybe not the type of book you may want to show your kid.I am sorry to say that I did not like David as a character :("},{"Title":"David Goes To School","review":"My 5 year old was bored with this book......it's just too short!

I could almost cry. The illustrations are fantastic, the situations are realistic (sadly mischievous and adventurous David is trapped in a very traditional school). It is the ending that I cannot stand! SPOILER ALERT: David surprises his teacher by cleaning all of the desks, and is given words of praise and a shiny gold star. ICK! As a new early years teacher (and a former elementary student myself!) I have learned so much about the detriments of external rewards for desired behaviour. Why couldn't his teacher have thanked him for cleaning the desks (his act of restitution) and possibly given him a hug or a smile instead of the sticker? David Shannon, I love your David, and pity him all the more for his early years school experiences. It's really a shame about the external reward; I'd have loved to have used this book as a class read-aloud.

I think it is the wrong message & promotes nothing worthwhile to a child about school. And to see the teacher giving David a gold star at the end is plainly disgusting. We received it as part of a gift & it is being recycled. Nothing like a good bribe to finish the day. I am shocked at the amount of positive reviews. I find it appalling that there are more \\"no\\" david titles. Thought it was just a single book. I suppose it fits the public school model, behave or else. I would act out too if all I ever heard was no, no, no, don't. So many wonderful kids books out there and this one has a following. Sad. Not in my house. And if my kid was that kid in that school, I find a new school fast. The book had been in my donate box, my daughter found it today & insisted on reading it.

The illustrations are fun and keep the child interested. But, for the money you're paying for the book, I would like to have more content presented. The story is cute, but less than imaginative. I purchased the story based on Newsweek's recommendation. I do not concur. This is a waste of money to purchase. Check it out from the library.

It doesn't help that David is a disobedient brat a good portion of the time. All in all, I am glad that we only checked this book out from the library and didn't buy it.

David, a young, energetic student, has a hard time understanding the rules of the classroom. I recommend this book to young children, or any child who feels imperfect.This book takes place in David's elementary school. David's teacher is frustrated and is struggling to keep David under control. For example, \\"No, David! No yelling! No pushing! No running in the halls!\\" is all David hears every day. I believe that the teacher has a very important part in the story. Nevertheless, I think David should talk more in the story a little bit more.The theme is something every child goes through- maturing. David learns that there is a time for playing, and a time for being serious. The way the author presents this theme is very creative.The reason David Shannon wrote this book is very unique. His mother sent him a book that he wrote when he was little. \\"No, David!\\" was all that was in it, because that's all he knew how to spell! He changed it a little bit, and then got it published!I think young children would really enjoy this book. Read this book to children who don't think they are perfect.

The illustrations are again funny: slightly gross at times in a way that will appeal to kids, but not enough to turn off grown-ups.

In the real world, no young child is perfect like some adults want them to be, and just because they act out or don't listen at school doesn't necessarily mean they're a brat. David is obviously young and is simply learning about the world on his own without his parents holding his hand in the \\"big boy\\" setting of school.

We checked it out from the library after she fell in love with \\"No, David.\\" She has been asking for it since we returned it to the library. She memorized the words on each page, and could \\"read\\" it to her friend.To those who complain that this book is poorly drawn, that is the point! It is based on a book that David Shannon wrote when he was a little boy. It is supposed to look like a kid drew it. My daughter likes David's teeth, and his round head. She even kisses him sometimes. It's cute!I also don't think this book encourages bad behavior. David doesn't get away with what he is doing. If you talk to your kids about what they are reading, this should not be an issue. For example, you could discuss WHY the things David is doing are bad.I think kids can relate to David because he is not perfect."},{"Title":"David Goes To School","review":"We read this book every night to our 6yr old, 4yr old, and 3yr old. Not only do they love it, the two younges tcan read it! It's the first book they've really shown an interest in. No matter how many books we read them each night, they ask or us to read this one before bed. I got online looking for more books by David Shannon as this is the first one we've gotten. I intend to purchase them some for Christmas. As for the reviewers who said this book could teach bad habits, I disagree. If anything, it shows them the things they aren't supposed to do at school.Anywho, we love and so do the kids. Thanks Mr. Shannon for a great book!"},{"Title":"David Goes To School","review":"If there was a rating of O I would have chosen that. This book is just plain awful. Anyone putting this in the hands of a child will certainly have no right to complain when thier kid starts acting like this creepy David. If you laugh at this book, and think what this brat is doing is cute, then you can expect your child to start exhibiting the behavior also, and won't he be suprised when you reprimand him for behaving just like this kid, but when reading it you laughed and thought it was oh so cute. Confusing for your kid dont you think?Its horrible that this kid does so many wrong things, basically gets no discipline except a tiny bit at the end and never seems to have to apologize. This would be a slap in the face to any child who maybe did get in trouble, and a slap in the face of the parents of a child who got in trouble, as if its not bad enough they may have gotton in trouble so now they have to be reminded of it?This David child is an undisciplined spoiled brat and I have no idea why some paretns feel its ok to let thier kids read this. Would they let thier kid hang out with a child like David? I doubt it. Why let them read about it and think its funny? Its not funny at all the way this kid acts in any of these books. His behavior is unruly, disorderly, ill mannered, rude, gross, and completely undisciplined and some parents praise that by buying these books?? Disgusting."},{"Title":"David Goes To School","review":"First of all, I was forced to pick a star rating for this when it shouldnt recieve any. This book is a horrible thing to put in the hands of child. This book is supposed to have been based on the life of an actual person??? Anybody who would consider buying this book must not care about influencing their children with negative behavior, negative feelings and only prefer them to forcibly and completely understand the meaning of no, picking out their faults and how most to come down on children wrecking thier self esteem, rather than praise them and show them alternative choices. This book is about nothing but a bratty pain in the butt kid who does nothing but get in trouble and cause problems. Its crap. I dont think he's funny at all and I actually find him disturbing. It seems to me, David is ADHD, or needs to be in a special programs class. He hurts peoples feelings, is rude and disrespectful, destroys things, does things that are totally gross, and is never told how to correct his behavior. Sure he does his punishment at the end of the book, but then, is never made to aplogize for anything he did. The only positive page is when the last page says \\"good job\\" I prefer to read positive, uplifting, nice, educatonal books to my children. He grosses people out, has no manners, and is a discipline nightmare. And I certainly wouldnt be proud to write about it if it were my child, or if it was myself portrayed as a child. I wouldnt be happy if a kid like this was in my son's class(and definitely wouldnt be laughing about it since kids of this nature take time away from the kids who actually want to learn) and certaily wouldnt be proud and laughing if it were my child who was acting this way. We recieved this book as a gift for our son, and like other children, sure he has gotton in trouble at school. He is in kindegarten and he was hanging out with the troublemaker (the real David) and they both got in trouble. This was his only time getting in trouble. He has since steered clear of him and has had no problems. He recieved this book about three weeks after getting in trouble and he was crushed, like he should constantly be reminded he got in trouble. He absolutely hated it and the thought the pictures were ugly and even my three year old daughter said \\"those pictures are freaking me out.\\" Unfortuneatley it was written in when we recieved it and now cannot return or exhcange it which is disappointing since its going to end up in the trash since I dont want it ending up in the hands of any other children. After reading it through once, I was appalled at the amount of negativity, and my husband said the only place that book should be is in the fireplace, and he was amazed any sane, loving, caring, person would buy this self esteem stripping negative book for a child. I have seen another one in the series and it too, is nothign but negative. These little minds we read to are SO impressionable. So if you are so inclined to introduce your children to how to do everything absolutely wrong, get picked on all the time about doing wrong things, and then never have to aplogize for thier behavior, then by all means buy the book. All this says is people think its funny that this kid acts this way, then we have a bunch of little kids acting this way with them thinking its funny when in the real world doesnt think so. And only have to do one small task to make up for a whole day or week of acting like a undisciplined primate. And any parent who gets this book, who may have a kid who acts this way, may feel its a personal stab at them, along with the child thinking bad about himself as well. One page of telling a kid \\"good job\\" doesnt stick in the mind of a child. Pages and pages of wrong and people laughing about it thinkig its funny, will. So if you truly care about your children, and prefer them to grow up praised and loved and with a feeling of security and them feeling they doing the right things, rather than continually pointing out the wrong things, then dont buy it. Its a waste of money when you could be buying something so much more uplifting and postitve and certainly more educational. There are hundreds of thousands of childrens books out there. Pass this up because Im sure there is something much better for your children to be filing away in their litlte minds."},{"Title":"David Goes To School","review":"This book is simply written and wonderfully illustrated.

This book is geared towards first time school goers who are learning good behaviors in school. With minimal lines, Shannon shows excitement, sorrow, and anxiety in David's emotions that is familiar in all children. The wonderful and wacky illustrations are drawn from a young child's point of view. The illustrations are vibrant and eye popping. There's not a lot of text, but the pictures tell the story. The words are simple enough for young children to read. Furthermore, the repetition of the words in the story is great for the young readers. This laugh-out-loud funny story catches all children in the elementary that can relate to young David. My students love this book. They love to look at the pictures and see what David does in school. They can relate to is misbaviors. We use this book at the beginning of the school year to discuss good and bad behaviors. It is a book that all teachers should have in their collection."},{"Title":"David Goes To School","review":"My son LOVES all of the books in David Shannon's David series. This was the only one we were missing, and he is very happy to have it. We read it every night."},{"Title":"David Goes To School","review":"David Goes To School is absolutely a wonderful book to share with your children. My day care children love this book. I have been able to read this to them and teach the simple basic rules of when you are in school what is expected of you. My day care children 2-5 yrs old ask so many questions while I am reading this book. They always ask about the star the teacher is giving to David. I have all of the David books, and they are with out a doubt among our favorites in my day care. David Shannon has successfully written his David books to a child, in the style of a child writing it himself. I love the art work in this book, it is colorful and large with little clutter. We look forward to reading this book each day and it generates so many discussions about why David should not do the things he does. A great book for enjoyment and teaching young children the consequences of behavior. My favorite saying to the children is, \\"David, David, David, you've done it again.\\" Many times in the day care when one of the small children do something wrong the other one says, \\"NO DAVID!\\" David Goes To School, is on my book shelf in my day care so all the children may reach it, open it, and read it to me in their own memory and words by simply looking at the pictures."},{"Title":"David Goes To School","review":"I am surprised at the great number of rather poor reveiws for this delightful book. First of all, the book is geared towards first time school-goers who are just learning the ropes of good behavior in a school setting(and may be having a hard time of it!). Many children find it difficult to behave properly in school - not all children are perfect little angels in the behavior department. As a former teacher and currently a classroom volunteer, I have noticed many young students getting scolded for the many things depicted in this story - things such as not raising you hand before speaking, not paying attention to the teacher, etc. If your child is acting up in class, I think this book might be helpful in demonstrating what is and is not acceptable at school. At the conclusion of the story, David finally learns how to behave properly and is rewarded with praise. I think this is a positive lesson! If your child does not have any behavior issues, you may not relate to this book as much as the parent/teacher who is trying to reach a disobedient child. The pictures are bright and colorful and despite some of the previous reveiwers' comments, I don't think that children reading this book wuld assume that the bad behaviors depicted in this book are something to imitate. I think the message is clear: You will be scolded for bad behavior, praised for good."},{"Title":"David Goes To School","review":"When I picked this one off the shelf at our book fair, I about fell over laughing. Simplistic? Absolutely. But dead-on. I have at least one new &quot;David&quot; in my Firt grade class each year, and this is the book I'll be dragging out every September as a kick-off to our discussion on what appropriate behavior entails. With one line of text per page, don't expect a reading workout for your child, unless they are at a very early stage in reading. But plot is not the purpose here. We're talking humor and reassurance. My six year olds can personally relate to David's flaws, and they can appreciate the message that comes at the end: we love you anyway."},{"Title":"David Goes To School","review":"Have you ever told yourself, &quot;There's got to be a better way!&quot;? Perhaps you have met many Davids and Davitras during your professional educator experiences. Read David Goes to School and I'm sure that you will find a better way for students in your classroom to take ownership of your classroom and school rules. David is a happy and energetic student. He moves through a typical day of school activities seemingly without regards to how his behavior affects those around him. David's teacher guides him firmly through the day while keeping his positive self-esteem in tact.Teacher Note: This story affords teachers the opportunity to build vocabulary, develop classroom rules and consequences, discuss the need for both class community/school community rules and practice conflict resolution skills. Let's remember as educators to dwell on the positive and not on the negative exhibitions of our students.

They start laughing on the first page, and are delighted all the way through. This second book just isn't funny for this age group, with the exception of just one or two pages. I think that my children, who thoroughly enjoy the naughty antics in &quot;No! David!&quot;, and probably relate to them, just don't understand what David is up to in his &quot;big kid in school&quot; setting (arriving after the bell, cutting in the lunch line, having to use the rest room repeatedly, etc). If possible, borrow the book from the library and see if your child appreciates David's new situations before purchasing the book. For an older child, it may be one to read over and over."},{"Title":"David Goes To School","review":"I mainly bought this book because my little son is named David, but it quickly became a favorite in our family.

David is back only he is now getting into trouble at school. The first book showed my kids proper manners or suffer the consequences for lack of them. It also depicted love at the end. This story follows the same type of storyline. This time he is creating havoc at school! Children should be familiar with the word, \\"NO!\\" and find this story very funny! I love the David Shannon illustrations. Kids love it because it is from their perspective on life! It shows that the teacher cares no matter how much she yells at David.

Anne meets some great people gets many proposals and accepts one. A wonderful book."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This book is my personal favourite of all the Anne books. I usually see the first three in the series as a trilogy, because they're the best of the 8 books, with the exception of &quot;Anne's House of Dreams.&quot; I was impressed with this book because it managed to go beyond just Avonlea and Green Gables. It put Anne in a new setting and showed how she managed there, with new friends and a home away from home. I admit that one of the best things about this book is the not-quite romance between Gilbert and Anne. Any readers who have been dying to see their romance fulfilled finally get a bit of what they're looking for. However, Montgomery manages to bring in the romance while retaining Anne's free spirit. This diminished in the later books, only to be reincarnated at the end in &quot;Rilla of Ingleside.&quot; I recommend this book to anyone who loves a romance, but also loves creative characters like Anne."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Anne of the Island is one of my all-time favorite books. It is romantic but realistic. It isn't one of those books where they see each other in some impossibly easy place and swoon over each other the rest of the book.

The book is topped off with a bone-tingling ending you'll want to read again and again!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This book contains one of my favorite characters from any &quot;Anne&quot; book.

Having just completed two years of teaching in Avonlea, Anne, along with friends Gilbert and Charlie, is ready to leave the Island and make her way to Redmond College. Her four years there offer quaint-seeming insights into college life a hundred years ago. After spending her freshman year in a boarding house, Anne and chums Priscilla, Stella, and Philippa move into a little house called Patty's Place. Even though they are committed to their studies, life is never dull. Anne has no lack of suitors, turning down no fewer than five proposals during the course of the story. And her summers are full of adventure, whether it's back in dear Avonlea or teaching as a country schoolmarm.I've read Anne of the Island each year I've been in college, and as I finished it this time, I couldn't help but relate to Anne's excitement for the future, mingled with regretful nostalgia about the college life she was leaving behind. College is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Having attended a small Christian university, I relate to Anne's old-fashioned values and the safe, wholesome environment of Redmond.Montgomery has such a pungent writing voice, alive to the quirks of human nature and the beauties of outdoor nature. She brings spice, optimism, and a touch of cynicism to the story and the characters. Anne's most personal experiences are recounted with poignancy, and are rooted in reality, although they may seem whimsical to modern readers. The ending is sweet and satisfying. I just love Anne, and especially this tale of her college experiences. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I thought this book was SO wonderful. The delightful Anne Shirley is bombarded with marriage proposals, in which she acts accordingly. In this book, you see once again Anne's true character. In Anne's dream world, her Prince Charming comes riding on his white horse to sweep her off her feet. There is no hesitation, nothing to mar that picturesque world. In reality, however, everything is helter-skelter. We follow Anne to Redmond with all her friends, Phil, Aunt Jamesina, Priscilla, and Stella, along with Rusty the cat. There is so much excitement going on; so much drama that I soon got wrapped up in all of Anne Shirley's doings. Every scene in the park and every room at Patty's Place becomes crystal clear. You see a red-haired girl coming slowly into womanhood, not the bold text of the book. Anne of the Island is a remarkable read."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Anne of the Island is one of the better of the Anne books. Anne goes off to college, where she learns not only English, mathematics, Greek, and various other subjects, but also lessons about love and life.

She visits the town where she was born and makes lots of new friends. Then she meets her ideal - the dark, melancholy and handsome Roy Gardner. But is her ideal all that idyllic without a good sense of humour?"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This third installment in the Anne of Green Gables series is a lot of fun to read because it focuses on Anne's college years. Many readers remark that this book is their favorite in the Anne series, but I think it is difficult to assign one book that honor. All of the books fit so well together. I would have liked more detail. There were too many friends and not enough story line to justify so many people in her life. I love Patty's Place and Anne's life at Redmond, but I actually wanted more time devoted to her life in Redmond. I guess this is a sign of a true fan to want more. More time could have been spent developing the friends and friendships. I think Montgomery grew tired of writing the Anne series and rushed it along from time to time."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Gave as a gift and the recipient love the book.

I love the flowery descriptions of the surroundings, the characters and the little slip of sentimentality weaved into the story.The story got me desperately hoping that Gilbert and Anne will get together up till the very end. I knew that everything will finish well, but I couldn't help getting emotional and worked-up at certain parts of the scenes. A wicked piece of writing by Montgomery, indeed!The best of the series. And I seriously think it should have ended here, wrapping up the 'trilogy' as a reviewer has mentioned below me. As Anne would say, there would be more 'scope of imagination' if Montgomery had just left the series hanging there. (Minus the talk about Gilbert going for a medical course and Anne waiting for 3 years to be married, of course. That just ruins everything)"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"When I read Anne of the Island I instantly knew it is the best of the Anne books (though Anne's house of Dreams is pretty close) and probally the best book I have ever read. I have read the book so often my copy of it is litterally falling apart. I as a teenage girl can relate to Anne. L.M. Montgomery writes the book so clearly. I can visualize exactly what Kingsport, Green Gables, and Patty's Place looks like. I think in this book Anne finally becomes an adult. She relizes that Gilbert is the person she should be with. I think any teenage girl who did not read any of the Anne books is really missing something."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This is probably my favorite Anne book (but I love them all). You should read the first two before you begin this one, so you can get to know Anne. The characters are wonderful and I love the way L.M.M made you feel like you were at Patty's Place and laugh along with the college girls. I have read this book so many times and really I think that is the biggest compliment to a book."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I love this book best of all among the 'Anne' books, though 'Rilla of Ingleside' is lovely, too! Anne of the Island shows her as a young woman venturing from the home she made for herself at Green Gables. She meets new friends, handles the challenges of college life and learns what love is all about. Anne changes and grows, but stays the same in so many important ways. This book (&amp; the others) always cheers me up! I can't wait to introduce them to my five-year old daughter!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"\\"Anne of the Island\\" is the third novel in Lucy Maud Montgomery's superb \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" series. After two years teaching school at Avonlea, the 18-year old red-haired orphan Anne Shirley is finally off to college. She will be joined by Queens Academy classmates Priscilla Grant, Stella Maynard, Charlie Sloane, and Gilbert Blythe.Redmond College in Kingsport will be a big adjustment for Anne. Fortunately, vivacious new friend Phillippa Gordon will fill out a foursome for the girls to rent cozy Patty's Cottage as a home base for studies and an active social life.The once awkward Anne has grown into an attractive, passionate, and caring young woman who excels at her studies and her many friendships. She will receive several offers of marriage. At least two proposals will pose tough choices. Anne's relationship with longtime friend and admirer Gilbert Blythe is complicated. Anne is attracted to Gilbert and cherishes their friendship, but she is not prepared to see her childhood chum as a romantic leading man. When Gilbert makes clear he wants more from Anne than her friendship, she makes an anguished refusal of his proposal.Wealthy, charming and worldly fellow student Roy Gardner will seem to embody Anne's notion of romance. Anne will ignore some warning signs, not least her continuing feelings for Gilbert, during their two year courtship. Roy's expected marriage proposal will force Anne to face the potential consequences of a choice: a comfortable life with a wealthy man who is not a kindred spirit, a lonely spinsterhood of good works, or, perhaps, a second chance with the man who completes her.\\"Anne of the Island\\" is very highly recommended to \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" fans as a moving and emotionally decisive chapter in her life."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I love all the Anne books...and I'm almost 70 years old! They were \\"old fashioned\\" when I was a child, and perhaps even more so now, but they take me back to a simpler, sweeter time, and when I am done reading them on my \\"every decade or so\\" re-reading binge, I hate to leave that time behind. I was missing this one from my \\"collection\\" of them, and enjoyed catching up on Anne again."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I have loved these books since Jr. High, when I identified with bookish, clumsy, often absentminded Anne. I, too, walked around with my head in the clouds! Although I never bought hair dye from a traveling gypsy, nor dyed my nose blue in an attempt to rid it of freckles, I have dumped an entire pan of cake batter into the oven while daydreaming about my future husband (at age 13!), spilled a full container of quick cook oatmeal while imagining I was adopted by my parents (I was really a princess!), and nearly scared my mother to death when at the age of 8 I decided I was old enough to cook and nearly set the house on fire! If you are a dreamy, headstrong girl full of life and mischief, yet loving and full of joy (or know a girl like this), these are the books for you! They are wonderfully written, you can almost smell the flowers and the ocean air, see Anne, and her friends, and wish you could go back in time! If only..."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Anne of the Island is the third installment of the smash Anne of Green Gables series. The book begins with Anne leaving for college to further her education the second time. When she arrives, she encounters a slew of minor domestic problems, a new group of friends, and Love. All of which she deals with using that famous atypical personality of a \\"Kindred spirit\\"Although the book deals with more serious subject matter than the preceding books, as a reflection upon Anne's growing older, the book starts with the lighthearted catchy fun that made Anne famous in her prequels. Most of this fun is centered on the Anne's encounters with her roommate cats Rusty, Joseph, and Sarah-Cat. Anne's exclamations of fear at being stalked by the docile house cats is classic Anne and delicious fun.The Book also dives into more serious matter, with Lets be friends-Lets be more than friends-Lets be friends-I hate you-Marry me! Gilbert abandoning his indecisiveness and aggressively courting Anne. Although this relation is of little interest to male readers, it is made a key plot element, most likely because it is attractive to the books target demographic, pre-teen girls. Luckily, most of the content on Anne's romance does nothing to affect other parts of the story much and as a result are harmless to skip when they become drab.Anne of the Island is a solid installment in the Anne series. Although not equaling or surpassing Anne of Green Gables, \\"Of the Island\\" leaves little to be desired besides not having a near constant usage of the word \\"eh\\". If you an Anne fan, pick up her third book. Eh."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"The story of Anne continues with this work and the author stays true to her style, story line and character developement. This, like the other books in this series, have a rather timeless nature about them and a comforting charm. The reader, of course, must remember the time they were written and the style and syntax used at that time. From my own point of view, this is great. I enjoy this type of writing and certainly enjoy Ms. Montgomery's story telling abilities. In this work, Anne goes off to Redman College and her adventure continues. Recommend these books for readers of all ages. Wish there were more works out there like it."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"this is one of the best of the Anne of Green Gables books. from what Anne thought of Gibert Blythe then to what she thinks at the end of the book! You can\`t put the book down once you get into it! There\`s alot of funny things in the book, like when Phil says \`lets go get drunk\`. I better stop before i tell you about Pattys Place, Davey and Dora, and Roy......"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I think that this is my favorite Anne book. I have read it over a hundred times to myself and soon I will need to order a new copy. It tells the ongoing story of Anne Shirley and chronicles her adventures in higher education, friendship, love, and of course WRITING! This is not a childrens' book as some might think. It is very easy to read, but it is for people of all ages. Of course, it features the same Gilbert Blythe who we all know and love as Anne's constant admirer and the irredeemably Sloanish Charlie. She also has Priscilla Grant at her side. She also makes a new friend, Phillippa Gordon, who makes Anne's freshman year wonderful and may someday prove to be quite sensible. In the course of the book, Anne will gain friends and admirers as well as continue to matchmake and write (of Course). She will have her share of joy, tears, loss, and love and ultimately set her course for her life beyond the bend in the road. I learned an important life lesson from this book,you never value what you have until you have lost it. I loved the characterization of all the new characters especially Phillipa, I think that we all know someone like her who attracts men without knowing how or wanting to. I can relate to Anne in this book. This book is thoroughly enjoyable and you not regret reading it. If you still want more Anne after reading this book,you should read all of the other Anne books (the next is Anne of Windy Poplars) and the Chronicles of Avonlea(it includes several stories which include Anne in them: The Hurring of Ludovic, The Winning of Lucinda, etc.) I hope that you will love it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This is a fantastic book, I couldn't put it down.It's about Anne going to Redmond College and meeting a load of new friends.

It was histerical. I loved the part where Anne read the letter from Davy to her freinds. There was always a certain line that a certain someone said. Davy always said. &quot;I wanna know Anne&quot; I don't understand why she didn't understand she lover gilbert. Good book!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I thought this book was one of the best Anne books I've read so far. It revealed how Anne could manage friends,school,and quite a bit of romance outside of Avonlea. I believe the best scenes in the book are when Gilbert proposes the first time, and when they walk in Hester Grey's garden. Throughout the whole book Anne looks for her ideal man, but comes to find it in an old friend."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"All I have to say is WOW!This book is more heart warming than Anne of Greem Gables,funnier than Anne of Avonlea,and the most romantic of the Anne series.You should buy this book.I only bought this book two days ago and it is now worn out from being read too many times.This book will hold a special place in my heart and book collection. At first i hated all love mush stories but this is an example that people can change.Personally this is my favorite of the Anne series."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This is anoteher book in the delightfull Anne series.

This book is about the wonderful times they have there."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I liked this book a lot. My favorite part was at the end, when Gilbert proposed to Anne, and they were walking and talking in Hester Gray's garden.

The only thing from Avonlea that will be at Redmond, is dear old chum Gilbert Blythe. The question is, will Anne & Gilbert finally get together, or will Anne continue to maintain her \\"only friends\\" status? Montgomery teases the reader with little incidents, and hope is created, that this couple we love will get together at last.Amazing in Montgomery's writing is the discovery of how much and how little college years of L.M.Montgomery's time compare with those of our modern day. Though times are surely more old fashioned-where gentleman callers visit during certain hours, and no dorms are co-ed, some things never seem to change. When Anne achieves a certain accomplishment, her friend calls out..\\"Let's go get drunk!\\" Anne of the Island takes an entertaining look at Anne leaving her childhood years behind and enjoying those life changing 4 years that college brings. You'll meet her new college friends and the charming house she lives in, Patty's Place, and see Anne through as she begins life in her twenties."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This Anne book is my favorite one of the series. Anne's romances make the story so spellbinding. All throughout the book, I was hoping Anne would wind up with Gilbert. Her romance with Roy adds a twist to the story. All of the Anne books are wonderful but this one holds a special place in my heart."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Anne of the Island is the third novel in the Anne of Green Gables series. The story was ver predictable at times, but was extremely addictive. I felt like I was right there besides Anne, and almost cried at some parts because I felt so attached to her! Throughout this book, along with the others, Anne is growing up and noticeably changing as the story progresses.After spending a few years teaching at the Avonlea School, Anne leaves her beloved Avonlea and Prince Edward Island to attend Redmond College in Kingsport. Attending Redmond with Anne would be her old friends Gilbert Blythe, Charlie Sloan, and Priscilla. Anne and Priscilla soon meet another girl, who they find talkative and funny.During her college years, Anne received a few marriage proposals from very unexpected men. She met her \\"Prince Charming\\" one day out in the rain, but realized that she could not marry him when it was almost too late. Confused, Anne almost entirely gave up hope about marrying anybody.While back in her beloved Avonlea for the summer, Anne reveals her true feelings for a dear friend before she loses him forever.

It's a great story that you can't help but love. Read It!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"It was ok, although I thought it could have been much much better. Anne goes through a lot as far as self-realization, especially at the end. My favorite part is when she goes back to her birthplace and discovers the home her parents lived in, in Bolingbrook. Gilbert's character needed more developing, just like it does in all the other Anne books. I think he's a real bore, but wouldn't be if she would just develope him more.I wanted more of a finale too.....more of them talking, etc. It was just too predictable....that she would fall out of love with Roy and go back to Gilbert. I wish she would endeavor more to be ambitious and she and Gilbert would discuss that.There are other Anne books that are better, such as Rilla of Ingleside."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"In this third volume of Anne Shirley&#65533;s life, Anne goes off to college, gets a marriage proposal, and loses a friend. With everything that happened to her while at college, I just couldn&#65533;t put it down. Anne is growing up and having to deal with the trials of being a young adult. Anne has problems of love and I couldn&#65533;t stop reading until I found out what happened.

And I loved it."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"If you like the Anne of Green Gables series this is the best one in the whole thing! Anne of the Island has something for everyone! Anne Shirley leaves the small town of Avonlea to attend Redmond collage.. There the novel introduces you to a character who is extremely funny named Pricella! (Hope I spelled her name right). In this novel Anne falls in love with a fellow school mate, while her long time friend Gilbert Blythe finds a love interest as well! Do they end up together at last? Read the book and find out!

These writings sent me on a trip to Prince Edward Island with my husband and two grown daughters."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I love all the Anne of Green Gables books, and this may be one of my favorites. I couldn't put it down once I started reading. So well written and full of colorful characters and exciting adventures."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I first read the \\"Anne\\" series when I was a child and have read them several times since and thoroughly enjoyed them every time, reading them most recently at the age of 41, a couple of months back. They always make me laugh and cry as much as they did the first time I read them, possibly even more so now, because I can now relate to a lot of the experiences she has as she grows up into a woman and mother.Many readers are aware of the 6 original Anne books by Lucy Maud Montgomery - Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Avonlea, Anne of the Island, Anne of Windy Willows, Anne's House of Dreams and Anne of Ingleside (all beautifully written and thoroughly enjoyable books), but there are two further books by Lucy Maud, which may or may not be in print now, called Rainbow Valley and Rilla of Inglside. These final two books in the series tell more of Anne's story through the exploits of her 6 children and are well worth a read - both made me laugh and cry in equal measure.All of these books leave you wanting more from Anne and I believe that is the mark of a truly fabulous book! :)"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This is the last good book featuring Anne. After the initial 'Anne' books, a sequel was squeezed in between this book and \\"Anne's House of Dreams\\". I think LMM was under pressure to write sequels, so after this the books are either average or poor, excepting \\"Rilla of Ingleside\\". In this book, Anne is more mature. She leaves Prince Edward and heads to Redmond college. There, tension arises between her and Gilbert--one wants friendship, the other love. Anne is getting a taste of living truly independent, away from home, but she has wonderfully amusing new friends to help her. Love, humor, and drama make this a very satisfying book indeed."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I have loved the Anne of Green Gables books for a long time, and had purchased a few of them at a local thrift shop.

Thanks Amazon for allowing me to buy this great book!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Ever since I was eleven when I first read the Anne books I have found a true kindred spirit in Anne Shirley. I find my self relating to her in so many ways. Whether it be in temper or making mistakes or having a nack for getting in trouble. This book inperticular is filled with romance. I love how Anne slowly relizes that Gilbert is for her. I love Anne Shirley. Claudia Ann without an e"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This is definitely one of those books that I would pick up and read at least once a year because it has the perfect mix of innocence and idealism. I've read this over 10 times and it still makes me go puppy eyed when my favorite couple are together~ Hands down, this is one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I love Anne! She was, at times, my greatest friend in the world. I am now in my mid 20's, but I still cherish the memories of the moments Anne and I spent together when I was a child, and regularly revisit her. If someone asked me which Anne book I liked least, I couldn't answer. I loved each and every one more than the next.Anne of the Island is no less wonderful than the books preceeding it or following it. Like all the books, it has a blend of humour and poignancy; joy and sorrow. The key drawcards of the Anne books are the characters. They are lovable, good, kind, wholesome folk who make you care about them and want to know what happens next. Incredibly vivid characters, it was no exaggeration to say that Anne was my childhood best friend - she was as real to me as any person I knew.The cast includes all kinds of interesting guests including the wonderful Miss Patty and Maria with their china dogs, Miss Ada and her cushions, Mrs Skinner and her romance (&quot;Jog along, black mare&quot;)... the list goes on. Best of all, our old friends are back - Anne, Gilbert, Pricilla, Diana, Davy and Dora, Marilla and Mrs Lynde, Charlie Sloane, and all those we knew and loved in earlier books. There are also some fabulous new additions to the circle of friends - Stella, Aunt Jimsie and the irrepressible Philippa Gordon.Anne of the Island takes us away from Avonlea to Kingsport, where Anne is attending Redmond College. This new setting doesn't mean that we miss out on Green Gables altogether, as Anne does return home for vactions, but it does give one a sense of moving on. Never again will Anne be a child living under Marilla's roof - she is an adult, and in this book she is beginning to break away from Green Gables in preparation for the next chapter in her life. Many of the events in this book shape Anne for the rest of her life, and it is an important book for those wishing to read the whole series.If you aren't familiar with Anne, please go back and read Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea before embarking on Anne of the Island - you'll know the characters so much better if you do. If you've read them and are wondering if this book lives up to the earlier ones - it does. L.M. Montgomery kept Anne consistant throughout the entire series, and there are few authors who have done so successfully. While Anne does grow and mature throughout, she is always the Anne we knew and loved."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I love alll of the Anne of Green Gables series. They are so vividly written you find yourself wishing that you were born as Anne a hundered years ago on PE Island. I would have happily endured all her hardships for all the wonderful moments in her life, and the fact she married Gilbert Blythe! It's so well written that you actually feel that you know Gilbert and I actually found my self falling in love with him! I've read the series 2 times. The first time I couldn't stop thinking about Anne. I read Anne, I tried to live like Anne and I dreamt Anne. Anyway, although I love all 8 books almost equally Anne of the Island is just a little better. And although it's romantic it's definitely not just a romance. Anne of the island includes wit and humour that makes it an all-round perfect book. If you're an Anne fan you havvvvvve to read this. I could not describe how wonderful it is in 1000 words. Anne of the Island is truly a book you CANNOT put down. After reading this I recommend you read all the rest of the Anne of Green Gables series (there are 5 more book,) although you'll probably be rushing to buy them anyway."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"&quot;Anne of the Island&quot; is the third of Lucy Maud Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables novels, and completes what we can see as being a trilogy simply becomes Anne finally realizes what everybody in Avonlea has known from early in the first book, which is that Anne Shirley and Gilbert Blythe were made for each other. Having spent time as the teacher at the Avonlea Schools in &quot;Anne of Avonlea,&quot; the Anne girl leaves Prince Edward Island for four years of college (hence, she is now &quot;Anne of the Island&quot;). The theme of this story is Anne dealing with &quot;How horrible it is that people have to grow up,&quot; as she confronts how her whole world is changing.Ironically, what makes &quot;Anne of the Island&quot; so romantic is the way it challenges romanticism. Even as a young woman Anne creates a romantic fantasy around the world in which she lives, just like she did at Green Gables where there was the old Snow Queen at the window, the Dryad's Bubble, the Haunted Wood, Lover's Lane and all those &quot;dear spots where memories of the old years bided.&quot; Now Anne and Priscilla, her school chum from Redmond, are renting rooms in Patty's Place, and making the home of Miss Patty and Miss Maria into their own. Meanwhile, after a thousand romantic drams and enduring both Diana Barry's wedding and the rejection of Gilbert Blythe's proposal (her second actually), Anne finally meets her Prince Charming, Royal Gardner.He is handsome and rich, in short, everything that Anne ever dreamed that she wanted in a husband. Then comes the fateful moment when Roy proposes and Anne opens her lips to say her faithful yes. But this is but a false dawn in Anne's life and there is a fateful Book of Revelation that Anne has to endure before love takes up the glass of time. There is romanticism and then there is that which is romantic and Montgomery shows the difference. There is a reason that this character and these books are enduring classics of (supposedly) juvenille literature.As usual this book is also filled with interesting and colorful characters, such as young Paul and the Rock People, John Douglas who finally speaks at last, and Anne's friend Phillippa Gordon, who also has her eyes opened to the what true love really means. For those who are familiar with the delightful Kevin Sullivan &quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot; sequel there is also the whole episode of &quot;Averil's Atonement&quot; as well as the entire end game with Gilbert. That is the most important part because at long last the final line of Montgomery's original &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; novel rings true for our Anne girl."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I had just begun to read the first Anne book in the beginning of January, and now, as the month has already come to a close, I've just finished my third. If nothing else, the book will sure keep you entertained. Even though I knew how the end of Anne of the Island would turn out, I still waited in suspense 'til the very last page. It's an excellent read, and I'm going to try to force myself not to go onto the fourth book because I really need to start reading other materials. It's written beautifully, and I found myself trying to speak as flowery as Anne but could never pull it off. It's really a blessing to find a book that you truly can't put down. The story was wholesome and simple, but it was indeed a classic to me. Take my advice, bibliophiles, read Anne--and give yourself some &quot;scope for imagination.&quot;"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This book is about how Anne went to Redmond Collage which is a very rare thing for people in Avonlea. She really enjoyed this as well as making knew friends. Anne also loved a small white cottage that was near Redmond.Threw the last three years of her stay at Redmond she spent the semesters at &quot;Pattys Place&quot;, the white collage. She of course went back to Avonlea during vacations/breaks. She really enjoyed this. She went through many proposals, but she had to say no to everyone of them.

She realized this when Gilbert was deathly ill."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"this book never gets old. i've had it for so long and now i'm off to college and i still enjoy reading it cover to cover. anne is a great character, one who is easy to love and who explains herself well. the other characters are also quirky. something about this book is very universal, which i think explains why even in this century i still find myself being able to relate to Anne. the plot, while essentially a love story, is not overly sappy. and while most people would probably expect the ending, the twists and turns throughout the novel keep you entertained and engaged."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I first read this book in middle school after reading Anne of Green Gables. When I first got to college, I was having a hard time adjusting and rediscovering this book made it so much more bearable to be away from home. L. M. Montgomery captures the feelings of homesickness and confusion so beautifully. Every time I need a pick me up, I just go back to the novel."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This is my absolute favorite book in the whole entire world. It is the best out of the whole entire series! I have read and re-read it so many times, I know it practically by heart. The book is about Anne's four years at Redmond college with the introduction of Patty's Place featuring beloved characters from previous books including Gilbert Blythe, Priscilla Grant, goggle-eyed Charlie, the grown-up Diana, Ruby Gillis, Stella Maynard, the critical Mrs. Lynde, Marilla and of course the twins, Dora and Davy who just always happens to run into trouble. Many new friends emerge such as the unfogettable Phil (short for Phillipa) who can't dream of marrying a man who isn't rich, romantic Roy Gardener and the sweet Anut Jamesina. The book also includes the publishing of one of Anne's stories. It is definetly worth reading at least once."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"i love the anne series... that seems a bit cliche to say, but man, does it ring true. each of these books hold a very special place in my heart, and each of them sits on my shelf with the tattered, well-worn pages of a book that has endured the loving hands of one who reads far too much. as i have read in the below reviews, many people focus on the romance of this book. while it is an underlying theme, tossing this book off as a romance novel would be a travesty. this is an enduring book filled with so many timeless issues, romance being only one of them. i do recommend this book, as well as the others, with a clear conscience and hopeful anticipation on your behalf. you will not be dissapointed. do be sure to read the other books in this series, as your experience would not be complete in reading just one. beautiful prose and thrilling imagery. what a treasure."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"\\"Anne of the Island\\" is my favorite Anne book, and the last chapters of my copy are worn and torn because I have read it so many times. I loved it as a young girl, and I loved it again when I read it from my college dorm room (in fact, I think it's time for another rereading!). Plus, of course, a college education makes many of the literary references more relevant than they were at age 11.Anne fans already know how wonderful are these chapters of Anne's life. This book outlines an important epoch in the series and answers the all important question of whether they will or they won't--a turning point on which the next five books hinge. And since you must start at \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" to appreciate any of it, this review cannot convince to you read just book three. It is just one more love letter to \\"Anne of the Island\\" added to this review panel."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This book is a satisfactory installment in the Anne of Green Gables series. Anne continues growing up and continuing her education (you can see this as an continuation of Anne of Avonlea) but like in books 1 and 2, Anne is still a very loveable and spirited character, and her maturity doesn't change that, so honestly, Anne Shirley is as much of a loveable character as ever. The story picks up in Anne of Windy Poplars (Book 4) but this volume is still a good one and definitely worth reading!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Anne of the Island is book 3 in L.M. Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables series. It is a continuation of the story of Anne Shirley as she goes away to school at Redmond College in Kingsport. Some of Anne's old chums from Avonlea are also at Redmond - Charlie Sloane and Gilbert Blythe, but Montgomery also introduces new and interesting characters. L.M. Montgomery certainly has a way with characters! She writes people that are really believable. These are people you will wish were in your life - as you follow them on their journey, they become your friends as well.Anne of the Island is the book that finally sees some serious development in the Gilbert/Anne dynamic, and for this reason it seems to be the favorite of the series for a lot of Montgomery fans. While I enjoyed the story just as much as the previous two books, I wouldn't say it would be my favorite - my heart will always belong to the little orphan girl from Anne of Green Gables. She becomes a remarkable young woman over the course of the years, but some of my favorite Anne-escapades take place in the first book.As always, L.M. Montgomery is a master of the literary form. Her descriptions are well-formed and breathtaking in their scope - not a single word could be omitted:\\"The sea was roaring hollowly in the distance, the fields were bare and sere, scarfed with golden rod, the brook valley below Green Gables overflowed with asters of ethereal purple, and The Lake of Shining Waters was blue-blue-blue; not the changeful blue of spring, nor the pale azure of summer, but a clear, steadfast, serene blue, as if the water were past all moods and tenses of emotion and had settled down to a tranquility unbroken by fickle dreams.\\"Isn't that fantastic!? Drink in the beauty...These are wonderful books for all ages and there is a little something for everyone here: adventure, romance, drama, suspense, and comedy. If you give Anne a chance, you'll have a bosom friend for life!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Every summer, my daughter, Amber, who has cerebral palsy, has me read Anne of Green Gables to her. It's tradition. And, this sequel is just as good as the first two. This author, L.M. Montgomery, was so skillful, it's as if she poured out a beautiful soul onto the pages, fully alive and full of wonder, inviting us, her kindred spirits, to join her in her imaginings and adventures.We're halfway through Anne of Avonlea now, and can't wait to start Anne of the Island next. Nobody wrote characters more real. There is no way to fully experience the richness of these works except by reading them, or hearing them read. Movies can never do them justice, as good as they can be.Yes, Anne still delivers thrills, scrapes and wonders after all of these years, and they're just as fresh now as they ever were."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This third book of the series (Anne of Green Gables) is as good as the first and better than the second."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"If you like Anne of Green Gables in any way, you have to read the other books in order to see her grow up. She stills continue to get in trouble, romance with Gilbert continues, just about anything that can happen, happens. These books fulfill everything that you could ever want out of a book."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I agree with the rest of the reviewers that this book is a page turner, suspenseful, fun, romantic, and all those other fine things.But what I come back to is that this is a story of a bunch of country girls going to COLLEGE in the 1880s. Not twenty years before we had the March girls in &quot;Little Women&quot; who never seemed to seriously consider college as a womens' venue. Yet here we have an actively coed college a few hundred miles north of Concord in Nova Scotia. Montgomery alludes to the presence of at least one professor who disapproved of coeds, but they were clearly an accepted part of the community.And it's funny to see both how much and how little college life has changed. Colleges don't have a coed's dressing room any more, and you rarely see ball gowns, or balls for that matter. But there are still lots of students like Anne attending on a shoestring from one year to the next, relying on a summer teaching job this year, a scholarship the next, and a surprise inheritance after that. Coeds (a long forgotten word) still juggle schoolwork and and social schedules, and have surprise visitors drop in when they're least prepared. When Anne announces she's made money selling an article, her roomie replies, &quot;Let's go get drunk!&quot; I suppose that's the most subversive line I've seen in a Montgomery work, but it also shows how little campus life has changed. And it also leaves me wondering what Anne might have been like after a few glasses of wine.This may also be the most quotable Montgomery book. I cited the &quot;I can't keep secrets -- it's no use to try&quot; in a recent publication of my own, and that's a pretty pale example. Real gems include &quot;Sometimes I sits and thinks and sometimes I jest sits,&quot; or the immortal &quot;Facts are stubborn things, but not half so stubborn as fallacies.&quot;This would make a terrific film. You don't need a Megan Follows for this, you need someone else. For all her good work in other episodes, she was never quite tall enough nor whimsical enough in style to play this sort of Anne."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This is a wonderful book. The story is about a girl, not an earthshaker, and yet Maud Montgomery makes the book very suspenseful. Right up until the last chapters I found myself on the edge of my seat, wondering who Anne would marry. A very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This is my favorite book in the series because it is the most romantic but it still contains wit, humor and a little bit of every emotion you can imagine! It gets right in Anne's sole just like the others but in a different way. You get to understand her fellings about Gillbert and her new and old friends that she has with her at Redmond collage. Misunderstandings are all understood in the end of this Romantic humorous classic that brings you back to its time!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Anne and Gilbert finally arrive in Redmond college, and start a new stage in their lives, and a new stage in their relationship. Anne must decide if she's ready for love, and when she is - would Gilbert still be available?Anne, as usual, manages to get into scrapes - adopt an unexpected cat, have an unexpected room mate join her, and have lots and lots of romance, Anne Shierly style! Of course, many of her childhood dreams of the &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; stage are left behind when faced with reality, but she manages to build new ones. much lovelier than those - especially as for her future love with her beloved one."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I love alll of the Anne of Green Gables series. They are so vividly written you find yourself wishing that you were born as Anne a hundered years ago on PE Island. I would have happily endured all her hardships for all the wonderful moments in her life, and the fact she married Gilbert Blythe! It's so well written that you actually feel that you know Gilbert and I actually found my self falling in love with him! I've read the series 2 times. The first time I couldn't stop thinking about Anne. I read Anne, I tried to live like Anne and I dreamt Anne. Anyway, this book comes after Anne of Avonlea and Anne is about 18 when it starts. She comes to Redmond college with friends from Avonlea- Gilbert Blythe and Charlie Sloane. She finds herself lonely at first and homesick but she meets new friends such as Phil and lives with 4 other friends in a place called 'Patty's Place.' This book is soooooooo well written you almost find yourself in Patty's Palace surrounded by Anne and her friends. Gilbert Blythe proposes in this book (my favorite chapter) but Anne. . .well you'll have to read and find out. In the end Anne realizes she loves Gilbert and life wouldn't be worth living without him. The end is so beautiful. Although I love all 8 books almost equally Anne of the Island is just a little better. And although it's romantic it's definitely not just a romance. Anne of the island includes wit, humour and a lot of other things that makes it an all-round perfect book. If you're an Anne fan you havvvvvve to read this. I could not describe how wonderful it is in 1000 words. Anne of the Island is truly a book you CANNOT put down. After I read the series I didn't have the appetite to read anything that didn't include Anne and all the PE folk Anne was familiar with. After reading this I recommend you read all the rest of the Anne of Green Gables series (there are 5 more books,) although you'll probably be rushing to buy them anyway."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"its a beautiful book, atleast i was in paradise. it shows the ways of life and the power of love. its definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Anne Of The Island is a great book. It is about a girl with dark strawberry-blonde hair. She goes off to college with her friends: Charlie, Gilbert, and Diana. She makes some new friends and one of them, Priscila which is Pris for short, they meet in the graveyard across from the college. She meets many men she thinks she is in love with, including Gilbert, but when the propose to her she finds out she really doesn't love them that much. She even turns down the man of her dreams. So, it is partially a love story. She was adopted when she was young by Marilla. Now they have taken in twins when their mother died and their only relative can't take care of them. The younger one is Davy, who is always asking questions and getting in to mischief. He especially likes to bother his twin sister, Dora. She is always quiet and quite lady-like. They all live on Prince Edward Island in Canada. If you want to know the rest, you can read the book for yourself. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This book wasn't very romantic in my opinion. I don't think Ruby Gillis was treated very nice in the beginning half of the book. It should have gotten more in about Avonlea, it was too much about college and was kind of boring."},{"Title":"The Journal of Augustus Pelletier: The Lewis and Clark Expedition, 1804 (My Name is America)","review":"This book was very exciting and what was good, I enjoyed.However, there was one thing that I really didn't appreciate.The use of four-letter words is very abundant in this book. Aside from the fact that I hate that anyway, it's not very accurate. To use words like that in those days, even in a journal, meant a severe punishment if you were caught! I don't think that an author would dare take the risk.This is supposed to be a kid's book, but I guess its gotten so course nowadays that bad language can even be used there and not be taken offensively.Parents beware, if you have a no-tolerance policy on language, you might want to read this first before giving it to your children!"},{"Title":"The Journal of Augustus Pelletier: The Lewis and Clark Expedition, 1804 (My Name is America)","review":"First of all, the entire \\"Dear America/My Name is America\\" series is based on historical journals from a fictional child. To critisize this book because Augustus did not exsist is unfounded. For the past three years, I have read this book aloud to my students to accompany our Lewis & Clark unit. Every class I have read Augustus to, love it! My students have never walked away confused about Lewis & Clark. I recommend Augustus to all children interested in Lewis & Clark!"},{"Title":"The Journal of Augustus Pelletier: The Lewis and Clark Expedition, 1804 (My Name is America)","review":"This was a pretty good book about the Lewis and Clark expedition in a young boy's view. However at times the book was a little bit boring because I think the author went in too vivid of detail on things many kids can't understand like me. However I think the adventures they had on the trip was very real like the encounter with the grizzly be Augustus. I recommend this book because it will teach you a lot about the Lewis and Clark Expedition but there will be places that will be hard to understand."},{"Title":"The Journal of Augustus Pelletier: The Lewis and Clark Expedition, 1804 (My Name is America)","review":"Love the book and received in the time alotted however there were two pages missing and a picture cut out of the book.

She writes the journal from Augustus Pelletier's point of view which is not always so positive but interesting detailed account of the long journey.For those who are interested in the Lewis and Clark expedition, they will find this edition in the series to be superior with regards to description and details about the land, nature, and the history. I enjoyed the Sacajaweja's detailed accounts of Augustus's recollection in his journal.The journal covers a very detailed and descriptive amount of information regarding the travels including illnesses, deaths, and the discoveries along the way. Even though there was a lot of sadness with regards to the losses of the men, there is still this optimism from Augustus's point of view.When you finish the book, you just want to share in his optimism of the discoveries made along the travels of Lewis and Clark even in the worst and most difficult times. I was surprised by how long the journey was for them in 1804."},{"Title":"The Journal of Augustus Pelletier: The Lewis and Clark Expedition, 1804 (My Name is America)","review":"I found the book a fun read.

I was looking forward to more history, but instead was shown a lot of scenery. After reading this book, I felt like I walked away only reading half of his diary. The beginning started out very good, but by the end, it was as if Lasky didn't know what to write anymore, and decided to stretch it out. The epilogue was also a disappointment. Not even good for beginner learners of this time in history. I do not recommend."},{"Title":"The Journal of Augustus Pelletier: The Lewis and Clark Expedition, 1804 (My Name is America)","review":"Wouldn't it be cool to get to name waterfalls? Well, that's mostly what they did in the Lewis and Clark expedition, besides having a young crewmember with a step dad that punished him by cutting off his ear!This book is a great book. It's part of the Dear America series and has so much action! In this book they travel with a Navajo girl named Sacajawea who wishes to travel back to her homelands on the way and sure enough they stopped there, but Sacajewea couldn't go in! In the expedition they're traveling along the Mississippi river. Now here's the action packed summary of the story!Traveling along the riverside going from Indian camp to Indian camp. Scavenging for food trying to hide. Gus a 14-year-old boy was keeping close to a kettle boat with Lewis and Clark aboard. He brought up the courage to expose himself to Lewis. Lewis didn't seem to care at all, he just told him to mark down the length and width of the river after Lewis measured it. When Lewis brought Gus aboard everyone was surprised. As Gus journeyed through to the shining sea he became a part of the permanent party - the party that travels to the shining sea.I liked this book because it starts out with the main character avoiding being seen and trying to stay alive. There are some things that I didn't like though, for example, there was so much walking. I mean practically to whole book was walking. Another thing I didn't like was that some passages were confusing and I didn't understand.

Where history is known, it should be respected. The opportunity for the historical fiction author should be to fill in the blanks with supposition and to tie together events for the flow of the story. Or, if the work is really a fiction, loosely tied to a real event, that should be made PERFECTLY CLEAR to the reader. This book fails to accomplish either of these goals. There was no person by the name of Augustus Pelltier who accompanied the Corps of Discovery to the Pacific and back. Too many children will wind up with a strangely warped view of this American saga. The tale is so full of adventure and excitement that it easily stands on its own. If the author desired the viewpoint of a young person as the main character, she could have used George Shannon, Sacagawea or Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, the youngest REAL members of the expedition. Reader beware!!!"},{"Title":"Breaking soul ties and generational curses","review":"I loved this book great approach and I couldn't put it down. It challenged me to change and move past the generational curses excuses. A must have in your library."},{"Title":"Paris and Elsewhere (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"This collection of Cobb's essays is another book in the NYRB series which I did not want to finish reading. These essays are about more than Paris or Normandy or even Europe; here is a record left by an Englishman who passionately loved a place, a bi-cultural historian and writer who grew his soul between the rare archived records of France and the living streets he loved.Richard Cobb has shown me that writing a memoir of place is a sensory experience. His essays are so rich in textured intimacy that I feel \\"le Cobb\\" is living still. One can find him strolling down an avenue observing every alteration of the weather, every change in the pavement, in the passersby, their clothing and language. I imagine Cobb still sitting in his favorite haunt, the late night and early morning caf?, sipping the 4:00 a.m. calvados, or apple brandy, as he watches the barges come up the river. From his youth, to his late travels, Cobb had found that one cannot write history without knowing the living. Le Cobb called himself a \\"prisoner of habit\\" (301), and this, I believe, is the key to the depth of detail in his writing. He frequented the same places, the same towns, kept in touch with the same French and Belgian friends. But there is also something exquisitely lonely about Cobb, the solitary observer, that appeals to the wounded romantic in every traveler.I'm concerned that the general reader will not pick up this book; the density of language in Paris and Elsewhere appears to be for the intimate specialist only. But the essays are about desire for a place, about human interaction in that space, how people create each other's lives, and the anger and grief one feels when a beloved city or village is altered forever--phenomena and feelings which anyone can apply to anyplace in the world. I highly recommend this book for people involved in city planning, the New Urbanists, any reader wondering why the French no longer wear berets, or any reader looking for a context or background as to how or why the recent riots and rebellions occurred across France in the past year.Cobb loved France enough to criticize the French particularly in the decades from the Baron Haussman in the mid 19th-century to Georges Pompidou in the 1970s when so much destruction was visited upon Paris in the name of \`architecture.' Cobb shows that Brussels and Paris sustained more damage after World War II than before: \\"The damage which has been inflicted on these two cities is not, then, the result of enemy--or Allied--action\\" (200). In Paris distinctive neighborhoods were destroyed by the French themselves with no concern for how people's lives were being altered or the monoculture being created. Well, Monsieur Cobb, this vandalism to intimate dwellings, social settings, tiny restaurants, private gardens, the homes and boulevards of experience, is now a global condition. Thank you so much, Professor Cobb, for such beautiful writing on such a bittersweet topic."},{"Title":"Paris and Elsewhere (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"Apparently, Paris was perfect when the author was young (in the 1930s to 50s), but has steadily gone downhill ever since. Admittedly, book was written at a Paris low point, at least architecturally, the 1960s, but it is VERY curmudgeonly, if still making a point about the ravages of gentrification. But this business of the picturesqueness of the old Paris types--he never asks how these people really lived, and in many cases, I'm sure it was a very hard life, if nice for author to experience from his point of view."},{"Title":"The Book of Heat","review":"I picked this book up used in Ithaca, NY, in 1992 or so, with the intention of giving it as a gift, but fell in love with it, not just for all the great information on how to run a wood stove efficiently, but for the charming digressions, the stories, the line and ink illustrations, the New Englandy feel of it all, and for the warm brotherly tone of the writing. The tragedy is that in the 10 years between buying it and installing my first wood stove, I lost the book. The redemption is that I've found a used copy here for under $5!Any one of the digressions alone is enough to justify purchase of this book: there are discussion on how to get timber out of the forest, when to buy firewood, what a wood fired zamboni is like, etc. etc. etc.Buy a copy of this book while it's still available, even if you don't have a wood stove.

The technology and tactics presented in the book is what US done to Iraq in the first Gulf War.

In a sense it represents an absolute \\"bottom line\\" conflict between the Soviet Union & NATO. No nuclear weapons. No chemical weapons. No significant warfare outside of Europe and the North Atlantic (though there are some hints at naval warfare in the Indian Ocean).There are a few problems with the novel but not enough to detract from my five star rating. It would've been nice to get some kind of timeline for the conflict to get a better sense of it as well as some idea of the death toll that such a conflict would leave. Personally, I've estimated that even such a few weeks long, no WMD conflict would kill roughly THREE MILLION people at minimum.The main complaints about the novel seem to be the performance of various weapons systems. Most notably the antimissile AEGIS system in the first large naval battle. But, I've run the numbers and estimated how many Standard II SAMs were available to the NATO force versus the number of Soviet cruise missiles and Clancy's estimates do appear quite reasonable.The other complaint is the U.S. \\"F-19\\" stealth figher (attack) having no resemblance to the actual F-117A being built by the U.S. that time and its different capabilities. What critics ignore is that there were more than 50 F-117As in service at the time the novel came out rather than just 12 F-19s so naturally the attack early in the war would look somewhat different.All in all a great novel."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I read this book in the '80's when it came out, and recently re-read it.

I've read it three times over the years and it still entertains."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is a great book and keeps you glued all the way. Why does the publisher restrict the kindle download version only for the USA I wonder, do they think if it gets outside the USA it will start a war or something. The paperback has been available worldwide in English for decades - just plain daft!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book is so realistic for it's time is is frightening! This book is the first public mention of the Stealth program. That alone is frightening since we know what we know now. Since I cannot give a view from any other than Air Force, I can't vouch for the rest. But from my memory, everything here is as accurate as can be, even with inside info."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This was the first of Tom Clancy's books I had read, and thought it was brilliant, if somewhat dated. Though it is very long, and often confusing when you have to remember which character is which, the amount of action packed into the last 600 pages has far more entertainment value than Dale Brown's over-rated thrillers."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This was the second Tom Clancy book that I had ever read. Clancy displayed very adequate know- ledge of modern military weapons that The United States now has at it's disposal. Some of the military tactics that were presented in this book were also impressive. This was a well written military book that certainly made for interesting reading."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I was alittle skeptical about this book. I had not read Clancy before, and I'm normally a reader of SF and Fantasy. I have to say however, that I was completely blown away by this book on every level. The plot involves a Soviet oil disaster which forces the Soviet government to attack NATO to recover their oil. The war that ensues is amazingly told by Clancy. One note I feel should be made is that the book was written in the mid 80s, and so is a bit dated, considering the &quot;Soviet&quot; government is not there anymore, but it's easy to read around that :)"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This has become one of my most favorite books that I have ever read. This is by far the best &quot;War&quot; novel I have ever read and was the fastest 725 pages of my life. A must read for all."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This has to be Clancy's best! It's packed with nothing but military action. If you want to read a novel about war, without all the political, economic, or technological commentary (as in some of his other books), read this one! My favorite!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is my first Tom Clancy novel, and I gotta tell you, I have never read a more detailed book on the clash of the two superpowers (NATO and the Warsaw Pact) than this! Brilliantly written, but sometimes it got just a little too boring. The information was little weak in this novel, for example, Mig-29's were shot down like they were Mig-21's. In real life, it would be real hard to shoot a Mig-29 down because of its superior agility. Most of all the book didn't include that much Soviet carrier operations against the west. But anyhow, this was written in 1985, when information on the Mig-29 and Soviet carriers was really scarce."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"A truly great book and definetly Clancy's best. Remember this book was written in 1985. So some things no longer apply. The F-19 for example is really the then top secret F-117. And if you remember from Desert Storm our weapons proved more than capable of leveling T-72 tanks."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is my all time favorite book, ever! I loved how in the end, it spoke about how the codes to the nuclear warheads couldn't be found after the death of the kgb chairman. Plus tons more! It was soooooooo awesome!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"...but, regretably, a disappointment. The real stars in this book, indeed this genre, are the hard, cold mechanisms and bloody, detailed carnage while the characters meander throughout stereotypically automated, from time to time illustrating, almost emphatically, some emotion to convince the reader they are human afterall, androgynous background to explosions and esoteric borax. This is as much an escapist, guilty pleasure for the armchair soldier as Harlequin books are for SOME housewives. What this book does it does well-give a cheap thrill."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Most anyone who wants to read a 700 page techno thriller will enjoy this. It jumps around a lot and really has no one character that you can latch on to. Some of the jargon is made-up stuff, but who is going to know? For me, most every scene could have been cut in half and 350 pages would have been just fine. In that Clancy is a polished writer, I give this a 4 star while a true fan would love the full 700 pages and give it the full five star treatment."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Characters are kind of shallow the love interest part of the plot is pure corn syrup, but the strategy and fighting parts of this book are second to none. One of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Clancy's writing is amazing! So descriptive I feel that I am in the scene living it with the characters. So hard to keep up with the changing battlefields, details and characters. I love how my brain goes into overload while reading page after page. In this genra, there is no better author or book!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I work away from home 6+ months a year so to help pass my free time time I read a lot. I've always been fascinated with the Cold War Era since I grew up during this time period and was serving in the US Army when the Berlin Wall came down. Red Storm Rising is my favorite fiction read of this time period. I have it in paperback and have read it several times. I just had to have a first edition hardcover copy for my personal library. Clancy's best work IMHO."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising is one of Tom Clancy's better novels. Yes, it's technical, and yes, there are contrived instances. Overall, the book is well paced and engaging."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"First off, this is really a great read. You won't be able to put it down......just what you expect from this guy, right? My only gripe and the reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the number of redundant submarine battles that he goes through. If I have to read through one of these one more time I'm gonna jump in front of the next torpedo I see and commit Hare Kare! This book is really long and could have probably been trimmed down a bit and this is one place I would start. Red october didn't have this much redundancy to it.Still it's an excellent read and gives really good insight into modern warfare. Check it out at your local paperback trader!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book should have given pause to everyone alive in the 1980's as to how precarious relations between the Warsaw Pact and NATO was. My own blood chilled the first time I read it as a 7th grader, especially since my father was an Army officer. The materiel, tactics and strategy was treated so intricately that no detail was missed, yet the suspense was not drowned out."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Every time I read this book, I wonder why they couldn't make it into a multi-week series, like \\"Lonesome Dove\\" or \\"Gettysburg.\\" I think the Hollywood movies on Tom Clancy's books (not including Hunt for Red October) have gotten ridiculously far from the plotlines, and I don't even bother with them. But something made as a series would work. \\"Without Remorse\\" would beanother great one for that format.This is an excellent book, it's a non-Jack Ryan book, and it moves right along. I wish it were another 200 pages longer. It's that good."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is one of the great ones. Too big to be made into a movie that could adequately capture all that the book encompasses, this is the only place you will catch a glimpse into WW III, Clancy-style. Clancy has done it all, covering politics, naval warfare (surface, submarines, and aviation), land warfare, air warfare and intelligence; there is no aspect of modern warfare that is unexamined in this book. And as we have come to expect, Clancy has woven all of these components together flawlessly as only he can. Surprisingly, this was Clancys' 2nd book; when I read it, it read more like the pinnacle of a masterful career as opposed to only his second book out of the chute. I can't recommend this book highly enough; great work, Mr. Clancy."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Still one of the best military thrillers out there. In my opinion, this novel is Clancy at his best!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"In 1996 I read this as a 7th grader, not really understanding what it meant, not really understanding the horror of war. I had to get books and read about all of the military policies and geopolitical intricacies of the USA-USSR and NATO-Warpac conflict (Commitment to Purpose by Kugler is a good companion book although nonfiction).Like Elton John's masterpiece discovered at the same time, \\"Live in Australia,\\" I turn to it again and again.I have read this book about 20 times in the past 8 years.Like the previous reviewers said, \\"It's almost like being there.\\" Only Team Yankee, a more-in-depth look at the front lines, is an equivalent. The Third World War, August 1985, is more encompassing (A previous reviewer complained RSR didn't talk about the failed currencies and riots and hunger. TWW does that, and talks about the worldwide impact). Team Yankee is a microcosm of TWW. RSR seems more like a Larry Bond book, \\"Red Phoenix,\\" a fictional tale of the 2nd Korean War (still likely today!)Some of the fact changes in this book are marginal but not really crucial to the book's plot:1) Aegis cruisers CG 47-51 carried 88 missiles in 2 racks of 44, not 96 as mentioned. VLS (122 missiles) came with CG 52 Bunker Hill and later. Remember, DDG 51 class hadn't been developed yet so Kidd DDG 996 was the most advanced destroyer at the time.2) The M-1s mentioned had 105mm guns, although the A1 might not have been readied yet for CENTAG or NORTHAG by summer 1985.3) MiG-29 Fulcrums died in mass amounts in the air battle over Iceland. Like a previous reviewer said, they were not easy kills like -21 Fishbeds.4) Was the T-80 operational by summer 1985 anyway? I remember people telling me in ROTC (I am a college student) that the -64 was the main tank for a long time. -72s were acquired by Poland and Eastern Bloc countries and were made by a different manufacturer.5) There is no definite statement that the 688 class subs were able to dive \\"only\\" to 950 feet. A submariner said the exact diving depth is classified. Although the Alfa did dive to 1900 ft or so...6) The description of the FFG-7 class was very realistic, especially about the Mk 13 single-arm launcher. The book had a fictional \\"Seahawk-Foxtrot\\" model. Most of them were B models, and had 2 on board instead of one F, which was a prototype.Interesting parts about the book. A lot of foreshadowing:1) The activation of the Battleships to retake Iceland (BB-61, Iowa). This was repeated in the Persian Gulf War.2) The launching of DOOLITTLE. Doolittle was the first operation that used Tomahawks to knock out airfields. Up until that point the Tom hadn't been used and the traditional way was to go in with a large strike force. The Soviets had obviously prepared for this, but not for cruise missiles. Again, this operation foreshadowed the Persian Gulf War. The loss of 7 airfields changed the whole war at that point.3) The F-19 Dreamstar. I remember the glow-in-the-dark Testors frisbee-shaped aircraft with rounded ailerons at the leading and trailing edges. This was in reality, the F-117A stealth.4) The use of mobility in FM-100.5 and AirLandBattle to beat the Sovs. Alekseyev talks about the mobility of the American forces, when he says, \\"...two men and a jeep (he used the American term for it) pop up fire and vanish...reappear again down the road and attack...\\"5) The luck factor with NATO. Soviet insistence on using what they had, and not being adaptable. In the end of the book it mentions two Category-A units in South Ukraine. Luckily, for SACEUR, they aren't used and B-units are coming instead.6) The goalkeeper (an Aegis cruiser). It would make more sense for the US to have TWO Aegis cruisers protecting Nimitz, not just one. Although at the time there were only 5 (Bunker Hill being commissioned 9-20-86).7) The neat combat tactics. Blackout of EMCON and tricking the Bear into searching and having fighters knock him down before he alerted the Backfires. Also the hard astern, full steam splitting manuever by Battleaxe and Reuben James to draw missile bait away from the convoys.8) The use of the VCR to track vehicle movement and positioning.9) The final discovery from Toland from the downed MiG pilot. It's all about the oil.The end of the book seemed forced. The Russians could have won had they used category-A units in Ukraine instead of CinC-West being stubborn and refusing to accede to Alekseyev and Sergetov's hints. That helped NATO immensely.Betting Western Europe on a pair of fives was a risk, but somehow, SACEUR won yet again."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This was the first book of his I read and it had me hooked to the novel. now i like his novels."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I thought that the book Red Storm Rising was and amazing book.Its starts off with middle eastern men lighting oil factorinies off in Russia. Tom Clancy shows how well WWIII could eaasily happen in his story.This is a story about the russian governmant declared war on the middle east and NATO. It shows how one coutry can be defeated so easily. Tom Clancy also shows how our world that we live in is so dependent on oil and gas, and how if one thing goes wrong countries attack each other.Overall, this was a great book about the trigger affect. That if one thing happens it will set of a chain reaction. It also shows th main character Bob Toland and hes fight on Iceland to retreat the Russians. This was a great book about modern day war."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"6 stars isnt even enough for this book. Probably the most best Book ever written. This is a must-read. I enjoyed this book more that any other. No other book can be compared to this book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book fails as a novel because it can't make up its mind. It tries to be both a &quot;techno-thriller&quot; (a phrase invented for Clancy) and a traditional novel. Clancy is trying to portray a major European war in 1986, yet half the book is spent describing the budding romance of an Air Force lieutenant and an Icelandic maiden on the run. When a hackneyed and contrived romance gets far more scope than combat between NATO and the Soviets, you know the author has lost his sense of his strengths. This is a disjointed book. I would have much preferred that Clancy had the guts to write an 800 page novel that explored in depth what a NATO=Warsaw Pact war would have been like. Instead, we get a preposterous plot about the Russians invading Germany to create a diversion to later invade the Middle East to mitigate the destruction of a single oil refinery. Not only that, we get about 400 pages of the soap opera on Iceland. Before the howls of protest begin, let me say I am a closet Clancy fan. I also am a military historian and Navy buff. This is a topic that, I suspect, Clancy could have handled much better had he stuck to the war and left the dime store romances to others."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"First, I would like to point out one thing for those who have not yet read this book. This book is not a Jack Ryan novel. It was written just after \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" and just before \\"The Cardinal of the Kremlin (both of which are Jack Ryan books) but this one has nothing about Jack Ryan in it. I started reading it expecting a Jack Ryan book, and while I wasn't actually disappointed, it was surprising.This book is a pretty good book, but it has a few problems. It is only Clancy's second military fiction book, and his inexpierience in writing seems to show up in some places. In quite a few passages, I found some seemingly unneeded information, and at times he started rambling on about a person's thoughts, even going for a few pages on information that for the most part seemed unneeded. Other times, the content just seemed to be a bit amateurish or unrealistic. There was also some American invincibility/superiority implied in some parts.All in all, the plot was good, and the development constantly surprises you. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody wanting a good military fiction read, especially Clancy fans."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I have not yet read the entire book, though I do quite enjoy what I have read, this edition of the novel suffers from some very severe printing errors. Namely, the first 3 chapters or so are out of sync with the rest of the book. The first page of the book is page 16, and there seems to be fragments of a forward and an author's note printed throughout this section. The rest of the book appears okay, though."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I am a fan of Tom Clancy and have read a number of his books. I had not read this, however, which is one of his first, being written just after \\"The Hunt for Red October.\\" I picked it up and was not disappointed.Essentially this book is reading a war game played out between the USSR vs. NATO. It is a \\"what if\\" scenario taking into account myriad factors according to Mr. Clancy's idea of what would occur. It is light on character development but heavy with what Clancy is known for: technically accurate, modern military action. The plot moves quickly, and every page I felt like I was learning some new fact about military hardware or doctrine. The characters are stereotypical American military men who nearly always seem to make the right decisions, as is often the case with Clancy. In his later books you start to see American characters that are less moral, but the line between good and evil is always clearly drawn.As the reader, you are also keenly aware of Mr. Clancy's political and religious stance as he pulls no punches in proclaiming America as the world's greatest country, or Christianity's virtues. He is at times a little heavy handed with it, which can be a good or bad thing depending on the reader's own beliefs, but for me it never detracted from the story to the point where it was annoying as I found to be the case in some of his later books where he preaches to the reader through his characters.One aspect of this book that I really enjoyed was the way in which Clancy humanizes the Russian Characters. At times, I found myself pulling for some of them which is the mark of a good writer in my mind. In many of his later books, the antagonists are purely evil with no redeeming characteristics. This detracts from the story in my opinion as they become symbols for ideas rather than actual people.An interesting aspect of reading this book now after having read all of Clany's more recent books with his famous Jack Ryan character, is seeing how the enemy in the books has changed over time. Then it was the Russians, and now in later books it has gone from extremist Muslims to the Chinese. The story remains largely the same in these books, only the enemies change. The plot in this book is incredibly similar to that of \\"The Bear and the Dragon,\\" only now that the Russians are no longer communists, they are our allies and not our enemies.On the whole, if you like action and military technology, this will be a great book for you. If those subjects hold little interest for you, you won't find much to like here. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"What would have a war between the Soviet Union and NATO been like? This is the question that Tom Clancy attempts to answer in his techno-thriller \\"Red Storm Rising.\\" After an attack on a massive oil refinery by Muslim nationalists the Soviet Union is facing a gas shortage of epic proportions. Faced with the prospect of their entire economy grinding to a halt the ruling counsel of the Soviet Union decides that war is the answer. They plan a lightning strike to the west to neutralize NATO before they invade the Persian Gulf to take what oil supplies they need. The Soviets begin the war with a fabricated threat from West Germany and a program of diplomatic deceit. The Soviets believe they can knock West Germany, France and England quickly out of the war and close the Atlantic with submarines to prevent American reinforcements from reaching Europe. Initially this strategy goes according to plan but soon the Soviet offensive bogs down and they are faced with complications.This book was written in 1987 so obviously the scenario of war with the Soviet Union is dated. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 rendered this type of war impossible. (Additionally, the fall of the Soviets showed the West that their supposed unstoppable military had been deteriorating over the last several years.0 However, it is interesting to see what we in the West believed the Soviet Union was capable of even at the end of the Cold War - the Soviet forces meet the NATO forces on equal terms and for awhile it looks like they will triumph. Despite the fact that the premise of the book has grown dated, Clancy has still written an interesting and fast moving novel. There is a character viewpoint to cover every aspect of the war and most of these are well developed and interesting.I have found that when I read books with Russian names I have difficultly with the names; for some reason they all begin to look alike to me. The same thing happened to me with this book. In a few places I had difficultly distinguishing between two characters because their names appeared to be very similar. I also found the Soviet Union's decision not to use nuclear weapons to be slightly implausible - we won't use them because there will be political fall out and then NATO will use theirs? I just don't think the idea of using nuclear weapons would have been dismissed so quickly from the battle plans. While the idea does come up again at the end of the story it is seen more as a move of desperation then an actually strategy.While Clancy's thriller has become dated because of the fall of the Soviet Union it is still a quick read and an interesting story."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Very early Tom Clancy, and it tends to read a little too much like a video game. Once Clancy found his main character and actually had a character to work the story around his work dramatically improved."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book is full of technical information but is written in a manner that is easy to understand and holds your interest throughout the entire book. I enjoyed it very much and was hard to put down."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"The book Red Storm Rising by Tom Clancy is a phenomanol book. It is a book about the Russian government and how they start a war with Germany. One of the main characters in the book is a man named Alekseyev. After a group of Muslims destroy the Russian's oil supply, the Russian party decides that Alekseyev should lead the war with Germany so they can get more oil.Then on the other side of the war is Germany and their allies the Americans. As the Americans and Russians send out more submarines to destroy each other, the war became more heated. One thing fueled the fire for the Americans, the Americans had to win or be killed by the Russians, and they didn't like being killed.The book Red Storm Rising is a very good book with a surprise around every turn. The book kept me reading with the suspense, and the battles of life and death on land, sea, and in the air. The way that Tom Clancy writes this book he makes you feel as if you were right their in the submarine waiting for the enemy to fire their torpedo at you. Although the book is very good there is one challenge, the reading. The book is very hard to read with a lot of Russian names, but if you want a very good, suspenseful book you should read Red Storm Rising."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I have read 5 of Tom Clancy's novels, and have to agree that this one follows in the footsteps of such great ones like Rainbow Six (my personal favorite), Patriot Games, and The Hunt for Red October. This is definitely a must read for all Clancy readers."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising is an awesome book, i loved it so much, i couldnt put it down.

We read books and wach movies to expirience what we want to expirience. In the reald world III world war would last for decades, without the nuclear weapons. And at last there would be no winners."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I would like to let every one who are reading this to know I believe Tom Clancy's is one of the best techno thrillers author of our time(also Dale Brown).I read op-center and was slightly dissapointed but then I read this long epic!!!called Red Storm rising. The book start out with a exciting plot that perfectly reels the reader into the novel with an explosion of an Russian Oil Refinery at first I thouht to my self how real Tom clancy is at making well formed plots at the very begining of the novel. He properly introduce to us, each character and thier background and motives, and also their &quot;beloved weapons of destuction&quot;(AK47 automatic assualt rifles) but then when the chapter is finish. I start to realize to my self the weak story and where it's leading to, I asked my self why would the soviet union blow up thier oil complex that produces 30% of the nation's oil. This was only one of the weak plots on the this long &quot;Un-clancy like novel&quot; then the soviet union would then take out 4 colonels and properly make it look like a terrorist agent working for west germany intelligence agency did it,when the americans have him as prisoner at langley virginia(C.I.A headquaters) (questioning him) was very confusing. Then Russia in thier supposed time of crisis feel that they should open up diplomatic ties with Nato and the United States is very unlikley of a real world war 3 senario.(why would russia think the U.s and Natto would fall for it when they have eyes every where) I would give Clancy credit in a real world War 3 situation, I believe the Russian would have their eyes set on Iceland because of it's strategic position they could use in closing off the american-Europe trade route.If i was writing a techno thriller (although im only 17) I would have the &quot;Russian mafia&quot; behind the action of blowing up the oil complex in which the money was being funnel to them through politicians in order to bring on a new war era in Soviet Union.Well Tom Clancy im sure you would probably right a better novel than I would.Red storm also go wrong in the submarines battles i cant not figure out why sonarman are always calling out &quot;bearings&quot; anyone reading this please answer my question? well back to the novel the ending wasnt so spectacular either but still a some what solid book by Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Tom Clancy's reputation had me expecting a little more from his first project. He did demonstrate a mastery of military technology, procedures and jargon. Thank God WWIII never happened in this way, this book will make you count your blessings. One of the things this book seemed to be missing was the human side of war, the only exception was the activity in Iceland which was excellent in that regard. The book was very entertaining and there was a lot of heart-pumping ACTION. For my next Clancy I'm going to try Without Remorse which is supposed to be a little more character-driven. Many writers strike it big on their first try and subsequent efforts seem to miss the mark, my gut feeling tells me that Clancy's work only got better with time and practice."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This story lacks passion, character development, and most of all, an interesting plotlines. Their is no crucial conflict, no culmination, no threat that either side may win or lose. The story lacked intensity, and made of for it with it's exceptional reality. However, reality may work for some fiction, it did not for this one. Overall, I think this story used mediocrity as it's paradigm"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is a very clever book, as far as I could make out, but very overrated. There were a few good, suspenseful scenes, but the military action was awfully repetitious. Perhaps the action is accurate and realistic, and it could potentially make an exciting movie, but it does not make good reading.The basic premise, that the Soviet Union starts World War III in order to get oil, was ironic, given that President Bush has repeatedly been accused of attacking Iraq for the same reason. In both cases, I found the reasoning unconvincing.Clancy's writing is pretty odinary, and often sloppy. I was particularly annoyed by the continual use of unexplained acronyms - I tried looking them up some of them in a book containing thousands of acronyms and could only find about half of them - and the military jargon was similarly confusing. Sometimes he would use a term extensively and then 30 pages later he'd explain what it meant. I suppose it would be all right for someone with more military background than I have, but a lot of the time I had no idea what was going on. I was also put off by the continual change of scene - I counted 17 scene changes in one chapter, and there are 43 chapters.The military strategy and tactics are fascinating, but the plot of the novel is pretty basic. The characterisation is virtually non-existent - most of the characters sound the same.This is the first Tom Clancy book I have read, and it makes me wonder how he manages to out-sell so many superior writers."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"this has to be the greatest book ive read its a little long but all and all it is the best."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Although 17 years have passed since Tom Clancy's second novel was published and the Soviet Union is no more, Red Storm Rising is still one of my favorite adventure novels. It is always a challenge for writers to top a blockbuster hit like The Hunt For Red October, but Clancy and his co-author Larry Bond (Red Phoenix, Vortex) gave us an E-ticket ride with this tale of World War III. If Hunt's chase of a defecting Typhoon-class sub was impressive in its scope and believability, Red Storm Rising is even more impressive in scale and ambitious plotting. While the familiar aspects of U.S.-Soviet confrontation are back, this time the Soviets are not simply after a runaway submarine but the oil fields of the Persian Gulf. After Islamic radicals sabotage a large oil production complex in Siberia, the Politburo decides that the West will not let the USSR purchase oil to make up for the shortfall. Deluded by their own propaganda and by KGB reports written by a faction which sees war as the quickest solution to the problem, the hardliners decide they must invade Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. 'If we cannot purchase oil,' declares one minister, 'then we must take it.' But the operation can't take place, the Soviets decide, if NATO and the United States intervene. Following the maxim that the best defense is always a good offense, the move south on the oil fields is put on hold until another operation, a strike against the West, takes place. So begins a complicated series of operations centered on a Third Battle of the Atlantic. While Soviet ground and air forces invade West Germany, the Red Fleet uses its surface, submarine and naval air forces to sever the sea lanes between America and her NATO allies in Europe. Clancy's canvas is large and vivid, taking us from the secret meetings of the Politburo, to the attack center of a Los Angeles-class SSN, to the lonely trek of a small group of Americans trapped on Soviet-occupied Iceland, and the bloody battlefields of West Germany. Clancy and Bond create a wonderful cast of characters who, even 17 years after they were created, still capture the imagination.Also recommended: Executive Orders, by Tom Clancy; Red Phoenix, by Larry Bond; Debt of Honor, by Tom Clancy"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"\\"Red Storm Rising\\" was already hailed a blockbuster when it was released, but time hasn't dulled its edge. When a sudden petro crisis threatens to grind the Soviet industrial base to a halt (in a grim foreshadowing of the post cold-war era, Azeri separatists sabotage a major petroleum refinery in Siberia; damage from the resulting inferno is exacerbated by a combination of shoddy Soviet safety practices and corrupt cronyism) the Kremlin's leadership and military reaches for the only reasonable response. Believing the west will surely exploit the Soviets' crippled state should the situation become known (the Soviets reveal the loss, but play it down), the Russian leadership mobilizes for war. Their plan: a brilliant pre-emptive strike, one designed to anticipate an imminent assault from the west, and head it off. With Russian armor stabbing into Central Europe, a Soviet amphibious assault force on Iceland and Soviet subs prowling in packs in the North Atlantic, the west is besieged. The plot of \\"Red Storm\\" follows individuals on both sides in Iceland, under the Atlantic and in central Europe as the war grinds on.Though written years ago, nobody has yet matched this book's epic scope. For a book this big and far reaching, it's obviously impossible for Clancy to provide substantive characters for every epic scene. Unfortunately, this results in many scenes in which the only real character is a ship or a plane. Though few of the characters will leap out at you, and some of the dialog may be laughable now (when asked by his Russian prisoners the reason they are being executed, the heroic American officer responds \\"for Afghanistan\\".) you'll remember more of what works and remains fresh than what doesn't. As for the techno, few writers were as willing as Clancy to tangle with such spanking new hardware as the MiG-29 and the \\"Stealth\\" fighter. (Clancy's stealth fighter was only a conceptual model of what the plane turned out to be, largely inspired by a Testor's model kit based on educated guesses; although the real thing turned out to quite distinct from the concept model, Clancy designs his fighter underlining and revealing so much of the science of stealth and electronic warfare that its substance isn't measurably diminished by the real thing.) What really raises \\"Red\\" over most other books is the shear exhaustion suffered by the main characters. This is hardly the heroic wish-fulfillment that critics assume it to be."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This just might be Tom Clancy's most memorable novel. Invoking his vast knowledge and understanding of the military hardware of both the United States as well as the former Soviet Union, Clancy presents to us a believable novel. The story details a conventional World War III between the two Superpowers.What comes to the forefront in the book is the authentic nature of the strategies imposed by both sides in the war. The deployment and use of sundry weapons is very logical, and Clancy's thorough familiarity with the aresnals form a solid foundation on which to wager which weapons system would win out when each is set against the counterpart of its adversary.The battle scenes (of which there are many) are well written and hold the reader's attention with their gripping detail of the action. While not as graphic as other war novels I've read, the diction is nonetheless sufficiently gory to remind the reader of what serious business war is - in any age.If you're interested in a credible book on what a conventional WWIII would look like, I doubt if there's a better novel out there than this one. Everything from descriptions of the battle landscapes to the disturbing thoughts by the Soviets to go ahead &amp; use their nuclear missiles is all finely and meticulously crafted. It's Clancy at his very best."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising is an action packed book with a knack for small detail. Tom Clancy clearly shows that he has done an enormous amount of research in the writing of this book. In Red Storm Rising, Clancy gives us an insight as to what might take place if terrorists were to strategically bomb major oil rigs in Russia.I was very entertained by Red Storm Rising and Clancy's writing keeps my attention very well. I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in action books involving events that are not largely farfetched. When Clancy writes, he uses a style that makes you feel like you are watching a movie. There is a lot of dialogue and he reveals most of the plot through character communication. To make his story even better, he employs the use of metaphors in an attempt to bring to scale the situation at hand in the book. For example, in Red Storm Rising, when he refers to the terrorist attack on the oil rig he brings it into a better view by using metaphors so an uninformed reader can get an idea of the seriousness of the situation. He also uses allusions when he writes which shows off his broad knowledge of different countries' militaries and governments. Clancy also utilizes extremely precise details when he writes to paint a picture in your mind of exactly what is going on, otherwise known as imagery. If an explosion has occurred, he will tell you exactly what the scene is like, right down to the last victim. All these elements joined together make you feel like you are an expert on terrorism and weapons just by reading it. He mixes them together powerfully to make his book very poignant. The book overall is about the astronomical domino effect that one act of terrorism has on the world. Three terrorists sabotage a key oil rig in Russia to disrupt the countries economy. The terrorists are successful in their attack and they limit Russia's oil production and supply to 50% of its normal rate. They no longer have enough oil, diesel, or gas to run their country for the next couple of years. After delegations and government meetings, Russia decides that their only way out of the situation is to take control of major oil producing Middle Eastern countries. To do this though, Russia must go through NATO, which includes America and all of her allies. It is a view as to what World War III might be like in the future."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"There are some CD's that always seem to make their way back into your CD player, no matter how many times you've listened to them, or how many other CD's you've bought since. The same is true of books - there are some books that you periodicaly have the urge to reread because they're that good - sometimes, you'll just pick it up after remembering a favorite bit and wanting to reread just that part. Dune by Frank Herbert is such a book, and so is Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising.In all of Clancy's other books, he's at his best when he's describing actual combat. What sets Red Storm Rising apart from the rest of his books, I think, is that he's depicting actual combat during virtually the entire 700+ pages. Just as importantly, though, is that the story portrayed in RSR, and the characters contained within, are more sophisticated and better developed than their counterparts in most of Clancy's other books.In Red Storm Rising, we follow several major characters - a U.S. army sargeant in command of an M1 main battle tank in Germany, a stealth fighter pilot, the Soviet general who is second in command of their army, the General's aide who is the son of a politburo member and thus very important to his general, Bob Tolland, a US Naval intellegence officer who is ultimately responsible for the US learning the true reasons for the Russions starting the war, Dan McCaffrey, captain of the attack sub USS Chicago, Lieutenant Edwards, a U.S. Air Force meteorologist who is trapped in Iceland when the Soviets invade and becomes a covert spotter for the alies monitoring Soviet activities there, and a US firgate captain who has his first ship torpedoed out from under him and must some how cope with the loss and regain his confidence so that he can command effectively again.In the context of the year 2000, 14 years or so after this book was written, RSR stands the test of time with two caveats. First, the book was written before the US acknowledged the existince of the F-117 stealth fighter, and so Clancy refers to the F-19 (as it was speculated to have been called before this) and assigns attributes to the F-19 reminiscent of popular speculation before the F-117 was announced. Second, of course, is the colapse of the eastern block and with it the day to day reality of the cold war, which sort of destroys the premise of the book to a degree. None the less, in every other way Red Storm Rising is a classic, and IMHO probably Clancy's best."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is the best Clacy book I've read yet! It has everything: dog fights, naval and sub battles, and land battles. The characters are believable as are the plots and sub-plots. Very detailed and accurrate. It is a long novel, but it never drags and I couldn't put it down. I cannot remember a weak moment in the book. This is a strong novel, and the ending will surprise you, and leave you wanting more of Clancy's work!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book starts out at a break neck pace. If you want a book that covers what could of happen if the USSR and the USA during the cold war (especially in the 80s) went to war, this is it. It is almost scary at times. Great action and military tragedy in a fiction novel. Very detailed. The only negative I have with this 725 page book is that there are about 100 million chartacters and different places to keep track off. Great reading, lots of fun. If you liked playing war with G.I. Joe guys when you were a kid, this is the book for you. One warning I have with this book is it is not intended to be read three pages at a time before you fall asleep at night. One should devote an hour a day or more for the best possible effect. Great book!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Certinly one of my favorites.Warld War III.So real that after reading I was affraid it will hapened any moment(I live in Poland).Shows many sides of war :airforce,tanks,recon,navy.Shos technical side of war, from single soldier point of view.Like &quot;Firefox&quot;-by Craigh Thomas or &quot;Flight of the old dog&quot; - by Dale Bown. One of my dreams is that somebody will write book like this set in year 2000. Imagine all new technologies and ideas"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This masterpiece that Tom Clancy has created is so thrilling, I suggest you sit down while reading it. It starts when an old Soviet oil refinery is blown up by Islamic terrorists, but doesn't end there. Not a chance. This random act of terror engulfs the entire world, when the Soviets decide they must take oil from the Middle East. They first must cripple NATO, and start the worst, non-nuclear war imaginable . . . RED STORM"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Tom Clancy shows just how possible World War III is, and how it would be done without nuclear weapons.It has many sub-plots that weave themselves together, in typical Tom Clancy fashion. His realistic descriptions of battles and strategies form an excellent mental image of what is going on.Along with the easy-to-write battle and action sequences, there are also a few sub-plots that have to do with the morality of war and the actions of the individuals thrown into situations beyond normal reason.If this book were made into a movie, (and that movie was true to the book) Red Storm Rising would be a war epic that would challenge \\"Midway\\", \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\", and \\"In Harm's Way\\". In order to keep the kind of depth that Clancy places into this story, we're talking the 3-hour length as well!Overall, a very enjoyable story that takes you away from everything else that might be on your mind (as any good book should). Just be careful, you'll be staying up until 3am trying to get through the last part of the book, because once the final action starts, you won't be able to put it down"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I will not discuss the plot here. I just believe that this novel is Clancy's best. If you like to read about Soviet vs NATO conflicts (both strategical and battlefield scenarios), here is THE book... The plot is so good and so well written that you will not be able to put this book down even after you have finished reading it."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"A few years ago, for reasons I couldn't remember if my life depended on it, I bought a book that didn't have to do with sports. It was Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising. At the time I didn't have any knowledge whatsoever of military happenings in the world. I remembered the Gulf War as a nuissance that the news had aired for a month instead of sports (gasp!). Until RSR, I hadn't read a book that was longer than 300 pages. Sound familiar? I'm writing this review for those of you who are like I was.The first time I read Red Storm Rising, it took me about a week. I don't remember why (I have a terrible memory, don't I?), but I loved it, even though I didn't understand most of the jargon and tactics. I then embarked on a week of net-surfing to learn everything I could about the weapon systems Clancy described. I even borrowed a book from the library about the Cold War, and this is at age fifteen (my friends thought I was nuts). Then I read my new favorite book again, and I actually understood a lot of the air, land, and sea combat sequences.Anyway, one book doesn't make an addiction, so the next trip to the bookstore I bought &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;. Take a look at its reviews and guess how I reacted to it. I was officially hooked on techno-thrillers.Today, I have every book in the Tom Clancy collection (except for the Net Forces and Powerplays), and I loved every one to one degree or another. I also have all or nearly all of Larry Bond's (who was a co-writer with Clancy on Red Storm Rising) and Stephen Coonts' books. These writers, along with Clancy, do their homework when writing their books. I haven't detected a single error in their military jargonizing (I may be wrong), and they spend a lot of time (couple hundred pages) developing the story, instead of just saying, &quot;stuff happened, now let's get to the action!&quot;. There are also a bunch of new authors who have this skill (ie. - Patrick Robinson, James Cobb) who you should check out if you like Clancy, Coonts and Bond.P.S. - If you really liked Red Storm Rising and you want more Cold War era NATO-USSR war books, be forewarned; there aren't many good ones. If you see one called &quot;WWIII&quot; by Ian Slater, don't touch it with a ten foot pole. It's a series of books, and he evidently has no knowledge at all about military hardware and international politics. Check out his reviews (I've never seen so many 1 stars)."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I had originally picked this book up right at the beginning of Desert Shield. Being in the Army and working on a post where we were processing soldiers/units to go to the desert and working very long hours. It took a couple days to get through the first 150 pages or so. On the day that I reached the chapter where you're sitting in cockpit with the pilot of a stealth fighter and he's going in on an attack run, I couldn't put it down from there. This was and is the best World War III scenario ever written. If you've not purchased and read this book, do so immediately! Thank you to Tom Clancy and Larry Bond for one hell of a book!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is the second book written by Tom Clancy which establishes him as a powerful storyteller, a global tactician of power politics and of military technology. Did he have a crystal ball with which to read the future? It seems he zoned in on the possible effects of Muslim terrorism *way* before the \\"real world\\" woke up to the truth ...An Ajzerbaijani Muslim student received special treatment at the Moscow University for his loyalty due to his good standing in the Communist Party. After 15 years in the Party, he attained the respect of his comrades, a good salary, an automobile and an above average position in his chosen field of study ... but beneath the suface ... he was seathing with anger ... plotting revenge on the very people who provided him the opportunities for success. He blew up the largest oil producing field in the Soviet Union ... crippling the Soviet economy. The Politburo met to deal with the consequences - the possible collapse of the Soviet Union. US satellite intelligence picked up the seismic event and discovered the oil field was destroyed. Another noteworthy discovery was: a shortage of car and truck batteries. At the same time, the Soviets were engaging in Peace Talks in Vienna, Austria. The Foreign Minister gave a press conference where he spoke of \\"deeds not words\\" as he described the Soviet's committment to reduce and destroy nuclear weapons. This included a deadline of three years and site verification. Plus the Sovietsproposed all signatories, USA, France, China, and the UK join in the negotiations. The \\"maskirovka 1\\" by the KGB had begun (masquerade 1). Another suspicious intelligence discovery made by the USA was four colonels in the Soviet Army were executed for falsifying \\"readiness\\" reports. Not long afterwards, an unusual bombing incident occcured in the Kremlin, exactly before the Politburo was to meet. Innocent children died ... the incident was attributed to terrorists, in an odd twist of fate a CNN cameraman caught the explosion on film, right when it happened. Also, US intelligence gathered information showing the Soviet submarines were maneuvering ... allegedly practicing tactics. The combined findings of these intelligence reports could lead to no other conclusion but the invevitable: the Soviet Union was planning World War III. The reasons were self-evident ... they faced economic disaster by losing their fundamental source of energy, their largest oil field.In this novel, Clancy keeps the reader spell-bound, hanging on every word, wanting to know what happens next. There are three major battlefields: on land in Germany, in submarines under the ocean near Norway, and in the air in Iceland, which becomes the homebase of the Soviet Airforce. It is an exciting experience reading about the events and outcomes of the different battlefields in a fictional World War III. The scenarios are highly probable. The characters are realistic and very human. Most intriguing is the weatherman, a survivor of the battle for the US airfield in Keflavik, who becomes a guerrila soldier in the mountains of the region, providing very significant information via a radio on untraceable frequencies to intelligence operatives based in Scotlan. This is the quintessential \\"best\\" of Tom Clancy's novels. It is a most highly recommended contemporary novel. Erika Borsos (erikab93)"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising By Tom ClancyRed Storm Rising is Clancy's second book and also on of the best. Even thought it was the second book he published, it is the last book in the series I have read. The main plot concerns World War Three. It occurs after the majority of Russia's fossil fuels are destroyed in a refinery fire set off by Muslim terrorists. With the fear of letting the West see them weak, the Russian leaders decide to seize the Middle East. To do this, however, the must distract NATO by attacking Germany. The war is more realistic than some of the battles and wars waged in his other books. Most of those battles have been entirely lopsided for the Americans. In Red Storm Rising however, he shows a much more realistic side of what the war might have been like. He has both NATO and Russia winning major battles and trading punch for punch. The many subplots surrounding the fighting gives you an in-depth look into the war. The war is fought in three major places. The fist part is in Iceland, the second part is in Germany, and the third part is in the Atlantic Ocean. The fighting in Iceland starts of the war. The Russians invade and take over NATO's base on the island. The second part in Germany is the major offensive by the Russians. The third part in the water deals with Soviet submarines destroying supply ships that come from America. That tactic almost won the war for Russia, but some supplies were able to get through and repel the invaders. The book was very good and extremely interesting. There were many different subplots, which let you see the war through people on both sides. It does not portray one side on barbarians, but shows both sides equally. The book was also very interesting because of the different information. He has accurate information about a plane that the Air Force did not officially recognize it had until years after the book was written. It also had a very interesting and unexpected ending that is repeated in another of Clancy's stories."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Let me make it clear that I am reviewing both the hard cover version of this book and the abridged audio cassette version. For long action novels, I often find the condensed version on an audio cassette preferable to the original. Red Storm Rising is the exception. The novel is much better and more enjoyable than the abridgement. This is also my favorite of the Tom Clancy novels, being slightly better than The Hunt for Red October in its story line and realistic plot details.The book opens with a terrorist attack that cripples the economy of the Soviet Union. The leadership there chooses to believe that the West will devour the Soviets during this period of vulnerability, and the party leaders choose to launch an invasion of Europe. The real objective is to neutralize NATO so that the Middle East can be seized as a source of oil. Think of this as the 1980s update of the Japanese thinking during the 1930s about the importance of having assured supplies of raw materials and energy.During the Cold War, published articles often focused on three primary risks that had to be overcome:(1) That a weakened Soviet Union would decide to launch an offensive war to gain resources that its economic system could not provide.(2) That a threatened Soviet Union would launch a first-strike nuclear attack.(3) That the KGB and the Soviet Army would abuse their power and use war against the West to gain even more influence.With the passing of time, we now know that although these were all potential risks, they were low-probability ones. The Soviets were not nearly as strong as the press and our government led us to believe in the United States. Also, they were more frightened of war, if anything, than the West was.When this book came out in the mid-1980s, it provided valuable perspectives about whether or not the Western high-technology capabilities could counter much of the manpower strength of the Soviet Union, and the likelihood that there were reasonable people who opposed war in both the Soviet Union and in the West. Both perspectives turned out to have a great deal of truth in them. But they came as refreshing boosts for everyone's hopes for peace at the time.Since there no longer is a Soviet Union, nor a Cold War, why should you read this book? I think the best reason is to understand the importance of placing limits on the power of those who can set war in motion. Also, one's enemies can be deterred by the risk they run by attacking you as much as by a real attack, as long as the risks to them are known. So appropriate levels of strength create the potential for diplomats to do their work.For those who like battle stories, this one is quite interesting as in develops along the lines of what conventional war in Europe might have looked like in the mid 1980s. Several of the scenarios, such as an attack by the Soviets on Iceland will intrigue you and change your perceptions of geo-politics.The technology side of the story is even more compelling and interesting than in The Hunt for Red October. You will witness potential uses of many of the weapons and systems that proved to be very important during the Gulf War, such as Stealth fighters, cruise missiles, and AWACs controllers.After you finish reading this story, I suspect it would be a useful thing to try to come up with ways that the Cold War could have been ended sooner. What were both sides missing? How could the mutual distrust and misunderstanding have been dispelled sooner? The resources that went into weapons that were never used (thank goodness!) could have been far better employed in other ways.May the peaceful intentions of the peace-lovers always be apparent and encouraging to all!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"_Red Storm Rising_ is undoubtably Tom Clancy's finest book. It depicts an all-out war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact in the mid-'80s. While the political reasoning behind the Soviet invasion is a bit far-fetched, the description of modern-day land, sea, and air combat is riveting. In contrast to some of the one-dimensional characters in Clancy's other work, this book features two unforgettable ones: Lieutenant Mike Edwards, codenamed &quot;Doghouse&quot;, an unlikely hero who leads a squad of Marines trapped in Soviet-occupied territory, and General &quot;Pasha&quot; Alekseyev, who commands the Red Army with brilliance and courage in spite of his own mixed feelings.If you like Clancy's other books, you will love this one. And if you have found some of his more recent stuff to be tedious and overly political, give _Red Storm Rising_ a try so you can see him at his best. My mom and I have very different literary tastes, but even she really enjoyed it after I convinced her to give it a shot._Red Storm Rising_ has no rivals in its description of modern naval combat. And only _Red Army_, by Ralph Peters, surpasses its incredible look at World War III on the ground. I just purchased the hardcover version to replaced my overused paperback. Its a classic that will be enjoyed by readers of all tastes."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"The big question of the 70s and 80s - what would happen if WWIII broke out? Tom Clancy and Larry Bond posed this question with one qualifier - strategic nuclear weapons would not be used.To best understand and enjoy this book you need to know a couple things, one of which is the aforementioned purpose. You will also need a good map of Iceland and if you don't know your Atlantic Ocean and European geography you probably will want a general map of the area as well.Clancy (along with Bond) has to solve the following problems to make the agreed-upon scenario work:1. How do we have a war in the 80s with no nukes?2. How can a war start without a nuclear retaliation?3. What new technology would make a difference, and how much?4. In a more modern war, how much does human judgment, ingenuity, emotion, and error play a part in the outcome?Sure, the story is dated. Some have complained about that, but isn't any war novel dated after just a few years? Anyway, Clancy answers the questions brilliantly, and relatively quickly. The last part - how does the human factor come into play since there are no nukes - is played out throughout the book.I reveiewed \\"Without Remorse\\" earlier, and I must inject a statement I made then as well. If you haven't experienced some of the things Mike Edwards had in his past (this will become clear upon reading the book) then you might consider some of his internal monologue to be contrived or unrealistic. I personally found the whole \\"Iceland sequence\\" to be a terrific internal story.The character development is for a purpose in this book. Sometimes Clancy will have us know a character well and then he will die suddenly, and never look back - his way of relating one of the great horrors of war, and brilliant writing. I found myself wanting to yell at the book, \\"That's not fair!\\" when such an incident occurred, then I looked back in retrospect and realized that having that response was entirely Clancy's doing. He wants the reader to know that some things are beyond your control. He shows that little victories, even those of individuals, can turn the tide of an entire war. He wants you to understand that the bad guys can be tactically brilliant as well as the good guys. And, most of all, he is able to have the reader identify with characters from both sides and see their point of view.I still can't put this one down. I loaned it to a friend, and he liked it so much that AFTER he read it and returned it, I bought it for him for his birthday, and he appreciated the gift! I have reread it many times and you know, I have a couple hours right now... This is Clancy's best, followed closely by \\"Without Remorse.\\" Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising is one of the best Clancy books that I've read. He does a magnificent job of showcasing a show down between the old Soviet Union and NATO. I thought that the reason to go to war (oil) was quite plausible, especially in retrospect from current events. I especially liked that he took the time to explain why the war was happening, not just because they needed more oil, but because the Soviets needed supplies from the West that they couldn't get for several years. I thought that it highlighted the distrust between the Soviets and NATO very well. It isn't just a great overall how WWIII would be fought, it also has a human side to it, switching between the war in Europe and a group of people stranded on Iceland. I loved the tactical detail of taking Iceland and using it to close shipping in the Atlantic, just shear brilliance! The attention to detail on the battlefield and the intricate plot make this book a must read. It is a bit long, but not as long as some of his other novels. I find that the length allows the plot to be fully developed and details to be used. A must buy!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"...then &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; was the hook that converted interested readers into die-hard Tom Clancy fans back in the mid-1980s.In this, Clancy's second book, he really hits his stride as the master author of military techno-thrillers. Clancy uses a layered story-telling approach in his version of WWIII; Warsaw Pact and NATO forces face off in western Europe and in the Atlantic while the USSR makes a bold bid to solve an energy crisis precipitated by terrorists.The story unfolds quickly, and the ride doesn't slow down until the last page of the book. The reader is taken along for action on and under the Atlantic, on the ground in Iceland and the European mainland, and in the air, as Soviet and NATO military machines try to outfox and outfight each other.This is story-telling on a global scale. If you've never read a Tom Clancy novel this is a great one to try first.If you're looking for a grand adventure, I highly recommend this book!5 stars all the way!If you like this Clancy book, you will probably also enjoy some of his others...&quot;The Hunt for Red October,&quot; &quot;Debt of Honor,&quot; and &quot;Executive Decision&quot; being the most likely candidates.If you are more into political intruige I recommend that you try &quot;Patriot Games&quot; and &quot;Clear and Present Danger.&quot;Happy reading!Alan Holyoak"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I thought that Red Storm Rising was a really incredible tale of modern warfair. The detail that was used in this story was amazing. It seemed like Tom Clancy took in to account all of the factors that would go in to a modern war situation between two super powers like Russia and the NATO countries. I have read a few other pieces by Clancy including The Hunt For Red October which i also thought was very good. I really enjoyed reading Red Storm Rising, just like i have enjoyed other Tom Clancys. I love the way that Tom writes. All of the story lines are so interesting to me. I cant wait until I have the opportunity to be able to read his newest piece The Teeth and the Tiger. All in all i felt that Red Storm Rising was an excellent piece that I feel any war junkie like myself should read. It really gives insight to a world that I was prevously not familier with. I would defienatly give this book a 5 out of 5 stars. I highly recomened this book to people of all ages. ENJOY!!!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"What if the US and USSR had gone toe to toe militarily in the 1980's? In &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, Tom Clancy takes a hard look at a frighteningly plausible scenario for just such a Third World War. Including combat by land, sea, air, and even space, this is an action packed scenario that looks at two superpowers locked in combat. Mixed in with the exquisite technical detail are many plot threads, with excellent story-telling and narration that help make &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; a non-stop pageturner.Although dated now, almost some twenty years after its publication, this is still a great look back at a very unstable point in our history. Luckily a confrontation like this one was avoided, but at the time the threat was very real, and Clancy clearly did his homework before writing this thriller."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"When Tom and Larry got together on this one, someone should have vidieotaped the first meeting.

I have read this book at least 50 times since 1986. Mabye more."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I've read all of Tom Clancy's books of fiction, and this is one of his best. Even though it is terribly long, nothing is unecessary. When writing a book about World War III, I would have to say that including a little too much information and spelling things out is preferable to making the reader assume why actions happened.Despite the fact that almost every action taken by NATO and the Soviets is spelled out clearly, I've still talked to several people who don't understand why the Soviets attacked. The Soviets did not attack NATO to take over Western Europe or to spread Leninism around the globe. After a terrorist attack on their main oil production plant, the USSR faces a depletion of all oil reserves in approximately one year. The Red Army invades West Germany to force Germany to seek a seperate peace and to split the NATO Alliance. After that, they can invade and take over the vast oilfields in the Middle East without worrying about interference from Europe. Iceland is attacked to split the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom line of sonar nets. Without this sonar line, Soviet submarines can more easily attack convoys from the US and Soviet based there can attack US Navy ships in the Atlantic.This book encompasses everything: war, strategy, geo-politics, love, terrorism, personal triumph, bravery, honor, and wicked technological explanations. Everything is obviously well researched and clearly explained. Authentic tactics and weapons are laid out and the horror of a modern mechanized war in Europe is also spelled out very well. Although the threat of this type of war is pretty much nonexistant anymore, it's still a very fine book, especially if you only want to buy one book to read all summer."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I can't imagine being Tom Clancy when the Cold War ended\\"Damn, what am I going to write about now?\\"Seriously though. His best work (\\"Hunt for Red October\\", \\"Cardinal of the Kremlin\\") was written during the Cold War when the Soviet Union was still our #1 existiential threat.But the first chapter of \\"Red Storm Rising\\" is eerily topical. Hint: It involves Islamic fundamentalists blowing something up and triggering a crisis.Highly recommend this book and anything written by Clancy except those horrible Op-Center books."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Islamic radicals destroy a Soviet oil refinery to the point that an oil shortage threatens the Soviet economy. The USSR attacks NATO as a ploy to distract them from a planned attack on the Middle East and thus begins WWIII.While I enjoyed this book very much it was quite depressing until NATO began to gain the upper hand, which wasn't until the last third of the book. I also found myself consulting a map frequently to better understand what was going on. As seems to be a trademark of Clancy books, there are nearly a dozen significant characters to keep track of, plus a couple dozen minor characters, many of whom are Russian and have very long names as well as nicknames. With all the names and places and military terminology it becomes a bit confusing to keep the story straight.Perhaps my biggest complaint with the book is it's narrow focus on what was happening militarily. It never really tells you how the world is reacting to the events. Adding to the confusion is the fact that there's no timeline (I'd have guessed it was over in less than three months).But none of that really keeps this book from being a very enjoyable read. The action is fast-paced and the characters are developed well enough that you can relate to them (once you remember who they are!). And the ending was very well done. Overall I'd give it 3.5 to 4 stars."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I really liked this book. I also noticed the verbiage that Mr. Clancy put up front about how it was a collaborative effort with Larry Bond, etc. Some time after I read Red Storm Rising, I read Red Phoenix, which had Larry Bond's name on the cover, and inside he mentioned a Pat Larkin in a similar vein as above. What struck me as interesting was that the writing style and plot development (not the story line) for Red Storm Rising (Clancy/Bond) was almost a twin of Red Phoenix (Bond/Larkin), which led me to the inescapable conclusion that whoever wrote Red Phoenix also wrote Red Storm rising. In other words, I think the bulk of Red Storm Rising (maybe all of it) was actually written by either Larry Bond or Pat Larkin. So I will leave off with a question, which is, who actually wrote Red Storm Rising? I don't think it was Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I vaguely recall years ago, mid 91' I believe, picking this book up at a store. I remember taking it home and finding the first 100 pages or so a bit tedious, albeit not uninteresting. And when I got past that first 100 pages the book didn't just kick in, it grabbed me with claws and pulled me in with it!The plot has been described in previous posts, so I won't waste time going over it, except to say that it is one of the most gripping stories I've ever read. The action takes place in varous locales from Moscow's Politburo chambers to Washington DC, to the pilothouse of an ASW frigate hunting Soviet subs, to the barren rocky fields of Iceland.It is written so compellingly well that you will swear you are there, as I did when I witnessed the Russian tank charge across the German landscape, or as I watched a crippled B-52 plow into the craggy ground of Iceland as a bewildered Air Force Lieutenant and his Marine comrades watch in awe. You'll find yourself dumbstruck watching A-10 Warthogs make strafing runs on columns of T-80 tanks and you'll almost be able to smell the fumes from the rocket propellant of the dozens of anti-aircraft missiles chasing them.And if you're a red-blooded American as I am, you'll cheer out loud as Tomahawk cruise missiles streak in to airstrips on the Kola peninsula, and cry when you witness the sinking of a submarine who's crew you knew somehow by spending so much time with them.I don't know how much time passed before I finished this book. I know that I got no sleep while I read it, clenched and trembling hands rapidly shooting through pages as I devoured every detail I could.It is a long book, as too many other posters here have mentioned, but really if you're looking for a good short read, go visit the Dr. Seuss section. Think on this though. The suspense, the feeling of euphoria that you experience while reading it will last that much longer. Maybe the book should have been longer indeed. I certainly wouldn't have complained. Not one bit."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"My husband, son, and I have read and reread this Clancy classic so often that our paperback has worn out! We devour Clancy novels like the proverbial peanuts, yet this is still our collective favorite - a total of 15 readthroughs at last count! I'm purchasing the hardcover today!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"The novel &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; by Tom Clancy, is a novel of war that incorporates suspense and excellent characterization, as well as all kinds of fascinating battles. Submarine battles, air raids, politics, and tank skirmishes make this book endlessly engrossing. A terrorist attack on the leading Soviet oil plant causes a series of events that begins a new war between NATO and the Soviet Union. The thrilling war epic is so realistic you will be sad when you finish it. Even if you do not read very often, this book is sure to grab your attention and imagination and keep it till the last pages. It is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Books that make me run out into the garden and start digging a deep! hole have my everlasting respect!! My employer on the other hand is not exited about this book at all! Every time I read it (and I do that often) I tend to be absent minded at work. Well, too bad!!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Helluva book. One of the best I have ever read. It is already a classic, and will be loved for many years."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"From the forests of Iceland to the deck of a mighty aircraft carrier, the reader follows the characters through their perilous encounters with the enemy. I was very satisfied with the conclusion of this superbly written, soon-to-be-classic novel by this world-renowned author."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is one of the few books ever written that can be read time and again and still keep you totally riveted each time. I have read all of Clancy's books and this is by far the best."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I think that this book iis great. It never was plain out boaring but the book was long!! I recommend it to anyone who likes Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Quite simply the best book I've ever read. Completely brilliant!!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book starts out with a Muslim terrorist group attacking, and destroying, 30% of The Siviet Union's oil supply. They all ready have a horrible economy. The oil loose will probably comepletely destroy their country. There descion is to attack the countries in the Middle East. The UN defends them and the whole thing turns literally into World War III. There are mainy stories going on throughout the book. All are expertily written. This book is, in my opnion, Clancy's best."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is my favorite Clancy book. After a terrorist attack leaves the Soviet Union vulnerable they plan to take desperate action against the West and the wealthy nations of the Middle East."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is an exelent book. It manages to refrain from the flag waving that has affected Clancy's latest books. If you like this book I recomend that you read the books writen by Clancy's co-author, Larry Bond and play the computer game Harpoon."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is undoubtably the most chilling example of how close the world was to complete destruction if WW3 had ever broken out. With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end (?) of the Comunist USSR, it isn't as hard-hitting as it was when it first came out in the high-tension atmosphere of the Cold War, but this does not distract from what is a bloody good read. If people sight any other Clancy book as being his best, they haven't read this book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Lets be honest here - this book is the benchmark which all World War 3/Future war novels are rated against. The action is non-stop, the plot is complex yet enthralling, and the scenario all too real and possible. While many authors make the mistake of either concentrating too much on the battles and not enough on the plot, or vice versa, Tom Clancy has produced a masterpiece that combines all the elements perfectly. I'm not going to run out the same old cliche &quot;you can almost smell the smoke...&quot; etc etc - it would be more precise to say that &quot;you could be reading about this tomorrow in the papers, and then drafted to fight in it a week later&quot;. Superb."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book was incredible. It could've been used as a blueprint for the third World War. This book grabs you and does not let go. A few particular chapters that in my opinion are the most engrossing of all time; The Frisibees of Dreamland. Pick this book out now."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"this has got to be one of the best tom clancy novels ever this is stuff thatcould really happen in addition i think the addition of f murray abraham reading it added something"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is my favorite Clancy novel. I'm also happy to say that hollywood has yet to water it down on film. There is action and suspense going on all the time, in many areas. Regardless of what some critics write, I found it a plausible scenario. I don't know a lot about the technicalities of modern warfare, but Clancy has a good track record and after Desert Storm I'm not about to underestimate the capibilities of the U.S. forces."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is my all-time favorite book! After four times, I never get bored of this engrossing story. What I love about his books is that he can show how a single incident effects everything. Don't be afraid of his long books, they are wonderful! This is a must read for all!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I Couldn't put this book down. It was nonstop suspense and action. I highly recommend this book to the action thriller enthusiasts or enyone else who enjoys a good read. It had a perfect mix of land, sea and air battles."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"An excellent novel. Fascinating millitary technology, strategic and tactical warfare at its finest, twisting and turning political plots, and hi-tech espionage. Warfare on land, at sea, in the air, and in the mind, this incredible book has it all."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"THIS BOOK WAS EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!!!! i Strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a book they can read that is simply a hell of a page turner and you reluctnatly put it down because sleep is a good thing...heheheh GREAT JOB TOMMY BOY!!!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I like it because it's not like other Tom Clancy's books which are conected (Op Centre, books with Jack Ryan...). It's clear that Clancy is navy man, as ground battles are not described as detailed as naval (air battles are a bit more detailed, but not much). Don't you think, that with US involved in Europe some other state would try achieve it's goals (remember how worried US were when involved in Kosovo)? Maybe Koreans would do something. But all in all, it's good book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"The page turning suspence pulls me into the book and the descriptive work is some of the best i've seen. Reading it again and again is not uncommon for me. exellent book"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book was not one of my favorite Clancy novels. The techno-warfare is accurate and well-researched, and there are a number of exciting parts, but there are also some parts that are slow-reading, drawn out sections that I found boring and/or tedious. I think too much writing was spent on character development for the Clancy fan who is looking for an exciting adventure story that moves at a good clip. The contrast between The Hunt for Red October, which reads at a much faster pace, and Red Storm Rising is vast. I think this book is worth reading but one should be prepared to spend a disproportionate amount of time reading the story."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"In Red Storm Rising Tom Clancy writes one of the best World War III scenarios I have ever come across. The details he gives about the different weapons and the people are spactacular and will keep a person glued to the book, I know I couldn't take my hands off it. Clancy outdoes himself with the details of the F-19 stealth fighter. Somehow he found out about the F-117A stealth fighter and to prove he wasn't just guessing also gave the exact number of aircraft that we possessed at the books writing. I reccomend this book to anyone that likes the genre, garunteed to be a good read."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I have read all of Tom Clany's fiction and non-fiction books, and have found that Red Storm Rising is by far the best integration of modern military warfare, story telling and realism that I have yet to find in the shelves of stores. I strongly recommend this book for anyone entering into the joys of reading scifi-tech oriented novels."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book shows you what Tom Clancy does best. He integrates modern military technology with a good story. Great follow up to Hunt for Red October."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This was the very first Tom Clancy book I read. I found it very easy to read, and quite enjoyable. Ever since I read this, I have read nearly all of Clancy's novels. This, in my opinion, is right up there with &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (5 stars) and &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; (5 stars). I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Outstanding account of the transition from peaceful tranquility to all out war in our modern age. Although currently dated with the close of the &quot;cold war&quot;, it's realism and potential scenario present a very relevent and feasible situation. It also demonstrates that war often finds hero's among common people thrust into unbelievable and/or extraordinary circumstances."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Chilling WWIII scenario from before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Very well done. So far, the only Clancy novel to be written outside the Jack Ryan/John Clark universe."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This was the first Clancy book I ever read and I couldn't put it down. Clancy clearly draws out a very believable scenario for WWIII. The book perfectly covers into all the points of battle being air, sea, and land. It is just amazing how Tom can put together very believable global situations and then create a war out of them."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This was the first Clancy book I ever read. From the first time I picked it up to when I finished it, I could not put it down! It is a MUST read for ALL MILITARY FANS! Though the book is a little old and some of it might confuse people today (i.e. F-19, it is actually today's F-117) It is a magnificently written book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"It seemed impossible to dethrone &quot;Red October&quot; as the best Clancy's, but this one just did it! After having read these two novels I am afraid of going further, it seems impossible to create something more chilling, real-sounding, breathtakingly accurate. Tom Clancy should revise this book every 5 years or so and add new weapons systems and up-to-date military stuff. The plot really deserves it! And when is the super-movie scheduled for?"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"After reading in 6th grade The Hunt For Red October in 3 days, I grabbed a paperback copy of Red Storm Rising and began to tear through it. I finished it in 2 1/2 weeks. The book was packed with brilliant descriptions of the weapons and battles of World War III, and was hard to put down. A must read for Clancy fans."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Tom Clancy's gripping and uncannily realistic thriller. Communist Russia, facing a crippling fuel shortage, uses political cunning to force NATO into war so as to be able to 'liberate' middle- east oil facilities. Excelent characters on both sides. This book not quite as good as 'Red October' but deserves all five of its stars"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I am ten years old. Red Storm Rising was reccomended to me by my mom and dad when I told them I was sick of books with treehouses etc... My dad is a Tom clancy reader and so is my mom and RED STORM RISING was their favorite novel by Tom Clancy. I got my hands on the hardcover addition in two days and read one-hundred pages in three days and I couldn't stop reading. It is deafinatly worth reading if you like weapons, soldiers, and planes. It contains every type of lethal weapon in the world. The description is great. READ IT!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book is one of my favorite clancy books. It is fast paced and detailed. I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is the first Clancy book I've read and even though I'm no military expert I found it perfectly readable and enjoyable. I just hope that Clancy's other books can produce like this one. A great read that is a real page-turner."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising is definately one of my favorite books. I have read it three times, and I still find myself unable to put it down. The world is faced with a situation, that the Soviets were in fact fully capable of winning. The book gives an excellent view of modern warfare through the eyes of the two greatest superpowers the world has known. I would recommend this book for anyone. Thank you Tom Clancy!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book is fantastic. Ive read it twice because once isn' enough"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Having just read this book again it just shows what Clancy can do when faced with such a potentially complex subject. The book fascinates from start to finish and leaves the reader breathlesly wondering if this could ever really have happened. The level of detail and planning are used to great effect. An absolutely gripping tale throughout of the former Soviet Unions attempt to alleviate its oil crisis by attacking the West before invading the Arab oil Fields....."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising is a good book, but it could have been better. I enjoy a good war novel, however, there were many acronyms which were either unexplained or explained much later. Too many characters are described in depth, only for the reader to find out that after reading a 2 page description of &quot;whoever&quot; that they won't ever hear about him again. The Hunt for Red October was much better, but the best Clancy is Without Remorse."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"No kidding, whenever I thumb past this book in my bookcase, I mentally hear John Fogerty's voice. But seriously, my most recent reading of this book has me wondering why he never did a non-series book after this one. There's the Jack Ryan series. There's the developing Mr. Clark series (which is a spinoff from the Ryan books). There's the Op Center series. And there's the new Net Force series (yep, I guess there's a second one of those--haven't found it yet). Maybe the World War III scenario with the Russians is a dated concept, but there are lots of subjects that Mr. Clancy's fertile mind could base another one-shot book on. I love series reading, don't get me wrong, but there's something to be said about a one-book story."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I have many, many, many different war books, fiction and non-fiction, but this is the best that has ever been written. I will read 2-3 of my other books and then pick this one back up to re-read it. I love this book and wish he would come out with a newer version with today's military hardware, global politics, and the world economic situation. It would be very interesting to see just how well Clancy could put a 2009 storyline together in the same magnitude of Red Storm Rising!!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Though this isn't one of Mr Clancy's well-known Jack Ryan stories, it might just be his best novel. The story starts off with a bang, then slowly (but not TOO slowly) builds into one of the most exciting war novels I have ever had the pleasure to read. The plot device of sharing several points of view of a given incident is enlightening and fuels the book's lightning pace. This one should have been made into a blockbuster movie, but I suppose the scope of the thing precludes that possibility. Too bad. One of my personal all-time favorites."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I first read this book way back when I was 15 and to be totally honest I gave up reading it after a while ( I was more into girls and Iron Maiden at the Time). Now 36 (still into Iron Maiden and my wife ;)I gave it a shot back to Mr. Clamcy's RED STORM RISING.By far the book it's impressive, fast and furious. Although the world had changed a lot since the publication of this fine war book the big WHAT IF!!! REMAINS.Soviet Union finds itself on the brink of disaster when a small group of terrorist blew out of the map one of their most important oil refineries. Short on fuel, food and winter knocking on \\"Ivan's\\" doorsteps they make an outrageous move, KILL NATO and get what they need by force. I wont go into plot details, enough saying that NATO and the Soviet Union unleash hell all over the world, \\"kissing\\" each other with non-nuclear weapons.....scary stuff.What is great about this book is that you don't need to be a soldier or someone literate on army, navy and air force stuff to get the point. Mr. Clancy uses this kind of language perfectly balanced so the common reader (that will be me) who don't know the first thing about weapons or aircraft, tanks, SAMS, submarines wont get bored.Different characters in different situations on both sides. RED STORM RISING is a great fast and thrilling war book. I recommend this one for sure.Cheers!!!!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is Clancy's only novel that does not reflect the Ryan-verse of his other novels. This one follows mostly one soldier in Iceland. When Russia overwhelms Europe to create the third world war.This novel was a very easy read and is very well written. After reading the book, I felt like i should take a visit to Iceland. He did a good job describing Iceland.With Russia hurting for oil, after a terrorist attack on their oil supplies, Russia strikes Europe in order to gain back what they lost, oil. The story is a good reminder as to why a country should not fight for oil, because oil maybe the very thing that defeats them."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"The first thing you will notice about Red Storm rising is that it is a cold war era book. However, that does not take away from the great story telling that goes into it and describing both the main story and the numerous back stories that surround this book. The book is a great read for people who love military, Suspense or Tom Clancy novel but if you cringe at war then dont buy this book. The only reason i gave it a four was becasue of the age of the book. Had it been made in a more current time it would have gotten a five. Other than that for anyone who loves these books this is anexcellent addition to anyone's collection or Library."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I've read all of the fiction books that Tom Clancy has written. Although I loved them all, this is the best in my opinion."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Though it has been some ten years since I first read Red Storm Rising, I still remember nearly every aspect of the book; a testament to the ability of this story to grab you and not let go. It is an incredible writing, so full of action and humanity that it almost makes you think you are reading a documentary about World War III. It starts fast and doesn't slow down from there. I have probably read the book 30 times, and each time I read it, it's as new as the first time. I love Clancy novels and this one is hands down the best he has ever done. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Although the book is a bit dated, it is still a fun book to read. I thought he presented a somewhat plausible initial scenario to explain the reason for the war. Too often in wartime books the \\"why\\" aspect is completely ignored in favor of excessive heroics and impossible scenarios. What was nice about this book is that the initial \\"why\\" played a pivotal role throughout the story. It wasn't a war just for the sake of war.It was also good for bringing back the old cold-war jingoistic feelings. During some of the more intense parts of the book I couldn't help but think \\"U-S-A, U-S-A!\\"Additionally, the \\"bad guys\\" aren't simply bad guys. There is a sense of humanity on both sides of this conflict that made it more interesting than just a plain war book. I've read it more than once and one day when I'm bored I will probably pick it up again.It's a great airplane/vacation book. It's broken up enough that you can pick it up and put it down often, without losing what is going on in the story. And it's long enough that you won't finish it on one plane flight."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I bought this book right after I reported to Germany in 1987. Wow, what a read. Like a few others said, it did start a little slow but it didn't take long to cause me sleepless nights getting through it. Never strayee from my mind when I was pulling duty up on the East German border or reacting to an alert, going to the ammo point and drawing a combat load of ammo for who nknew what?? Riveting book, made me feel like I was in it. Old school combat for us old school soldiers. Buy it now, maggot! Then drop and give me 20 pages!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising by Tom Clancy was published by Barkley Publishing Group in 1986. The genre that this book falls into would definitely be suspense. This book is 725 pages of twists and turns. The book deals with the U.S. and the Soviet Union during the cold war era.The book takes place in Eastern Europe where most of the fighting occurs. The protagonist would be NATO and the antagonist would be the Soviet Union. After a large oil field is destroyed by terrorists, the Soviet Union decides that if they have any chance of surviving, then they must fight back. By staging an explosion and blaming it on Germany they have all they need to start the war. The Soviet Union had prepared its troops before hand so they had hoped to have surprise on their side. Unfortunately for the Soviets they lose the element of surprise in a bizarre twist of fate. To find out who will win the war you should read the book yourself.I thought that the book was exciting and intense. It kept me at the edge of my seat after every chapter. This is an extremely realistic war novel that surpasses any book I've read before. If you are a fan of Tom Clancy or you want to read something exciting and suspenseful then I definitely recommend reading this book; you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"His best book I have read it several timesYou just can\`t put it downYou want to know what will happen next"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Early Clancy just reaching the height of his craft.

Bought the Kindle book because my original hard copy was lost in a flood."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is one of Clancy's first books. Therefore it belongs to a time when he was worth reading. The best part is the plausible way in which he describes how world war III would happen if it could occur without Nuclear Weapons. As usual, Clancy delivers an action packed book and is a master in telling a great story. His command of military technology is unique. The flaw lies on the caracthers. They are flat and borderline cliche. Clancy has no grasp on what makes humans, well, humans."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I've read the book, which I enjoy more than any of his other works. I used to own the audio version on cassette, which I bought for about $20 long ago. I went to look how much the cd would be, and dear God in Heaven, $70+ dollars??? Are you kidding me for a 2 hour abridged version of the story?

I was in the army serving in a MASH unit. It convinced me Russia would roll over us in a ground war in Europe. My focus completely changed on the second reading. In both instances the story was compelling, accurate, and suspenseful. The threat from Russia is just a memory now, but this reminds me of just how bad it could have been. I'll bet I read it again someday!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"A fast-paced, action-packed page-turner of high voltage excitement! A stunning combination of technology, politics and modern military strategy. The ultimate war scenario between the Cold War titans! I will admit that the story-line is not entirely sober, that it is altogether rather unlikely, but engrossing nonetheless. This was my first Tom Clancy, and it plunged me headlong into his awesome and sophisticated world. This is truly a magnificent book!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Most of Clancy's books deal with Jack Ryan. Following the career of this remarkable man gives the books some much-needed human interest. For this reason, in the past I've neglected books like Red Storm Rising that have nothing to do with Ryan and what a mistake that was! This book examines the motives for, and course of, a possible Third World War, from the points of view of a collection of characters in various branches of the armed forces, American and Russian. Without a map it can be quite difficult to follow, but it really is gripping from start to finish."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising Tom ClancyRed Storm Rising is a fast paced and exciting science fiction novel authored by Tom Clancy. Although not noted on the cover or title page, Larry Bond also contributed a great deal to the story making the story more realistic from a military perspective. About the collapse of the Soviet Union and Russia's attempt to over take the Atlantic so they can launch an offensive against the United States of America and other NATO countries such as Britain and Germany. First, terrorists attack a large power plant in Russia. The Russians make it seem as if someone from the \\"outside\\" attacked them so they can \\"counterattack\\". They invade part of Germany and Iceland. Taking Iceland is an important step because this allows the Russians to reach farther into the Atlantic and possibly into North America with their aircraft. This also disrupts the anti-submarine line that the Americans have across the North Atlantic. When the Russians attack Iceland, that starts a war that the Russians start so they can obtain more territory and more materials for more war campaigns. The Russians' greed causes them a great deal throughout and after the war. This book is interesting, especially if one likes wars, battles and suspense. This book is unique because the story is told through many different eyes. Tom Clancy tells the story through the eyes of the Russians and the NATO. Under these divisions, he also goes into the lives of different people in the war i.e. he tells the story through the eyes of many naval captains in both surface and underwater boats, through the Commander in Chief of the Atlantic (American), and through the Politburo (Russian, like cabinet of the president). Some of the vocabulary is hard to understand e.g. titles of names: CINC-West, Commander in Chief-West, however; after reading on, the reader can figure out what they mean. There are some Russian words whose meanings can only be guessed. Most of the many characters are very believable. Although there are many characters and the story is told from multiple points of view, one can figure out most of the characters attitudes and descriptions throughout the book. Red Storm Rising is a science fiction book about the dangers of greediness and war. Since the Russians are greedy and want more land and materials such as oil and coal, they become desperate and end up loosing, since they are already in need of many things before the war, they are even more needy because of the war. Although the book is long, I enjoyed it because of the war scenes and suspense of not knowing \`what will happen next'."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I found this book exciting and easy to read, though it is not the type of book that would bring much pleasure with repeated readings. It's a good book to read on a lazy weekend or a long plane flight."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"For a &quot;techno-thriller&quot;, this is as good as it gets. But for a Tom Clancy novel, it lacks his usual plot twists and interesting characters. This book is really limited to those readers who are fascinated by descriptions of future large scale conflicts."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"The big difference between Red Storm Rising, and many of Clancy's later works is the absence of Jack Ryan.RSR is a sweeping novel of Russia's invasion of Europe and the NATO response to the potential World War III situation.My personal favorite part of the book is the use of the High-tension eletric wire corridors as emergency roads for the tanks. I had not previously considered that possibility, but even today, I sometimes look at high-tension wires and think how a highway would fit in that space, let alone a column of tanks.This is a very good novel."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"A wise general once noted &quot;It is a good thing war is such a horrible thing, least we grow too fond of it.&quot; Clancy takes the excitement and intrigue of the battle field to our minds in Red Storm Rising. Middle Eastern terrorists destroy a major Russian oil complex. In the quest to replace the oil, the U.S.S.R. turns its eyes towards the oil fields in the Middle East. The only thing standing in the way is NATO. The battle for domination covers Europe, Iceland, and under the sea. Clancy amis high with Red Storm Rising, and he hits the mark exactly with his best book to date"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Hunt for Red October was great, but I still think this is Clancy's best work to date. It's a huge novel, but a dramatic page turning great read! I re-read it at least once a year because it really is that good."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Written long before 9/11/01, the opening scenes describes how Muslim extremists infiltrate and destroy a major Soviet oil refinery... the rest is history... World War III history, that is. Of course it never happend, but it was eerie to read that opening scene again. I am writing this review (more comment) after my second reading of the book (the first was years ago). The scene makes me wonder what would have happended if the events of 9/11 occurred at the height of the Cuban missle crisis, or other tense moments of the cold war.As other reviews state, this is a fast pace action book that is not big on character development, but I think that is actually a plus... in real war, how many combatants really get to know each other? I am not big on action war stories that spend half the book developing characters that die as soon as the war breaks out. When I want character development, I'll read Tolkien and Jordan... different genre, but NOBODY does character development better, and if/when their character die, it is at the end of the book, leaving you teary eyed and wanting more. Red Storm Rising leaves you exhausted (as if participating in the War Room w/o sleep) and pondering \\"What if?\\""},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Look, if a guy who reads mostly sci-fi and fantasy can understand this book, just about anybody should be able to--technical jibberish and all. Unless you've been living in a cave for the past 10 years. Yes, I did find the book's size intimidating, but once you start reading about the oil rig, things really start to heat up. After that, the book is a series of ups and downs. It starts to get boring, and just before you want to toss it aside, it starts to get interesting. You feel like you're riding a sine wave on an oscilloscope. This book could have used a condensing job. But considering it was Clancy's second book, it wasn't that bad. I prefered Hunt for Red October and Cardinal of the Kremlin. If you are a hard-core Clancy fan, then you must read this, if not, you might want to give it a try anyway."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Although it may not be fun if you read this book at the present time-it was great when I read it back in 1990. At that time, the Cold War had not ended. This books writes about a full fledged Conventional War between Nato and the Soviet Union. Only Clancy could have written about such a scenario. Great writer Clancy. Lucky whatever he wrote here didnt come true, unlike some of his other books."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I really liked this book. It's been a while since I read it, but it was very well thought-out and entirely believable. From the events that spark the conflict to the actual troop movements, Clancy did his homework on this one. Although it is a bit dated, it is still a great story; all in all, it's very entertaining.There are some people who just don't get Clancy, and this book won't be any better for them than any other, but for fans of the genre, this is a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book was fast paced and techno, but most of the action lay in dialogue between commanders so that the book could fit twenty battles where most would fit one, and despite the amount of dialogue between commanders I could never get to love the people enough to get emotional over the events. It was rather more like history to me. So and so won a battle, and so and so then got shot in the head because of another so and so's conspiracy, and then the other so and so lost a battle. But if you like books that are techno military without much emotion and with a bird's eye view of a hundred battle scenes buy this book; it's probably Tom Clancy's best. Else wise I would really recommend a book named: Cain by James Byron Huggins."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I had to see why I read this one in a week and a half. It was because he collaborated with Larry Bond on this edge of your seast thriller. A masterpiece! Undownputable! I high;ly recommend this one highly.

I found the book to be great."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"RSR (Red Storm Rising) is the story of an war launched by the Soviet Union against the West after a Muslim terrorist attack on a Soviet oil depot. 700 pages later the Ruskies loose (of course)The picture painted of the Kremlin and the Russian military seems plausible enough to a western reader, as does the buildup to the war and the deceptions used by the Russians to keep the West off its guard. In classical action fiction style, it has several strands that intertwine and we have three heroes to guide us along - a Naval Intelligence guy, a US submarine commander and an U.S.Air Force weather forecaster in Iceland. The aircraft carrier Nimitz is bombed, Iceland is invaded and a fierce land war wages in Germany. We jump from front to front witnessing the action including rather too much time spent (for my taste) at sea and underwater. The pace is good but the book is too long. There's only a taste of romance, and that's in Iceland. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is one of Clancy's finest work. Rainbow Six is also very excellent. He vividly describes the showdown of the two major military superpowers struggling for ultimate supremacy over the world. He blends raw human emotion with his techological wizardry he is renowned for, to make an intriguing story. Only Tom Clancy can write such a captivating story with such realistic detail. If you read only one book by Clancy, this is the one to read."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Tom Clancy's vision in this book utilizes the lastest advancements in military technology to set the stage for a battle between the world's superpowers. The story unfolds across land, sea and air in an ultimate global fury as both sides seek ultimate global control. The concept is chilling and suspenseful with every page. By far this is one of Clancy's most brilliant works. It has lot's of action and hard-hitting truth about modern military confrontation that is frighteningly real. This book pulls no punches, and paints no romantic picture of the advances of warfare on this planet. It leaves one with the awareness that the outcome of such a clash is not always a foregone conclusion as to who will be the victor, or whether such advances in technology can ever give any nation a sense of absolute security or defense. Despite all the technology, Clancy lays out for the reader the human element is the ultimate determining factor in this ambitious portrait of warfare. This is a story that is not easy to forget, which to me makes it a gem. I found it to be a frightening, macabre vision of the potential of a world breaking down international communication leading to a hot-tempered hostile global engagement and proceeding down the terrifying path of possible apocalyptic finality for us all. Clancy takes the reader to the edge in this book, where it almost goes out of control and you get a sense of having been suddenly rescued by a miracle of fortune from falling over a cliff into the inevitable. I enjoyed this book tremendously."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"First of all, I can't figure out all the people who say this book has too much jargon to read. I first read it when I was 14 and it quickly became one of my favorites. Judging from some of the other reviews, I am not the only one to have grasped it at such a young age. Yes, it is a bit dated, and some of the details are not realistic. But Desert Storm (and subsequent conflicts) have borne out Clancy's faith in stealth aircraft, M-1 tanks, Tomahawk missiles, etc. Thank God we never found out for sure, but the scenario &amp; outcome he presents for the war are plausible, once you get past his premise for starting the war (he had to pick something, didn't he?) Spellbinding action, real characters, a minimum of politics... I liked this one."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book is great! Even if you don't like war books, you could still love this book. Tom Clancy has his best work in this book. He goes into great detail about everything, and it's all accurate too! READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I love this book, but it's a far better experience in print than in the Kindle edition. The book appears to have been transferred to electronic form with OCR and poorly proofread. Many of the alpha-numeric abbreviations are mangled and throughout the book you find tell-tale errors, like \\"c\\" for \\"e,\\" which leave you looking at nonsense words. Worst of all, in this case, are the myriad \\"m\\" for \\"rn\\" errors which turn almost every nautical use of \\"stern\\" into \\"stem,\\" which carries the opposite meaning and is truly confusing."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising is an amzing book that takes place in WWIII. It happens when the USSR declares war on the middle east and NATO after they were attacked by easterners that lit their gas and oil plants on fire.The USSR is now taking control of the war and trying to fight the USA. The final battle takes place in Iceland with the main character Bob Toland who leads the attack which finally make the Russians retreat. This then ends WWIII.Tom Clancy is an amazing writer. He shows you this by showing what are societys real problems are. Such as, are dependecy on oil form the midlle east. This book is a must read."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is early Clancy novel presented in a Larry Bond-type format. This plot involved an entirely different set of characters than the Jack Ryan series. These characters were developed and quite believable. I am disappointed that Mr. Clancy hasn't brought back the Air Force Lieutenant and his Icelandic damsel for a Jack Ryan novel."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I've read the majority of Clancy's books in the past year and i find him great one of the best authors. Up there with Dean Koontz, Stephen King, Robert Magammon and Micheal Chricton. Now the best book madeby Tom was Rainbow Six and this came in a close second place. I had buht the book and then idn't expect that it would be that great because it's basd on WW3 and its 725 pg's long so i didn't ed it for the longest time. That was my mistake i should have read it right away. It took me under a week to read it was so good. He describes the war so well and the battle seens he wrote it was like i was there. He made the war even and not lop-sided (like he did in SSN) he made both sides win the battles. For some reason though i wanted the Russians to in this book i guess i'm just sick of always seeing the Yankee's win (there so full of themselves when it comes to war movies or books. They think there the best). Any way this is a must read for everyone unless you hate war."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"My first ever Clancy book is brilliant. It's probably not very realistic but who cares. There is plenty of Action and suspense and story.Now why couldn't Clancy stick to this type of writing instead of boring the pants off of us, with tedious, long winding plots"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This novel is very long and boring.When Clancy describes the submarine battles,the text results heavy and very difficult to follow.In fact,the novel contains too many technical details about the weapons.The book would be better if it contained more references about the persons.And I have to say that I think that this novel has a excess of 400 pages.(The Spanish edition of Plaza y Janes has almost 1000 pages in small format)"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising is a book about the Soviet Union and Russia's attempt to overtake the Atlantic so they can launch an offensive against the United States of America and maybe other NATO countries such as England and Germany. The story begins in 1980 at a very productive but old, Soviet oil refinery in Nizhnevartovsk. The refinery is blown up by Islamic terrorists that hope to be 'heard' by their God Allah by commiting this violent action. The devestation of the refinery leads Russia into chaos with a much smaller supply of oil. The story escalates as the Russian army makes a push on Iraq to gain control over the precious oil fields to setup refineries and also an attack on Iceland. Conquering Iceland is an important step because this allows the Russians to reach farther into the Atlantic and possibly into North America with their aircraft. The Russian's greed for land control is immense and they are desperate for more resources and materials to manage more war campaigns. The Soviet Union soon decides that to gain ultimate power, Russian military must first cripple NATO and start the worst non-nuclear war imaginable. This book is unique because the story is told through many different character's points of view. Tom Clancy tells the story through eyes of NATO and Russian naval captains who command both surface and underwater boats. Most of the character's actions would seem reasonable at time of war, making the story realistic. Almost every chapter in the book takes place in a different location during the war, on both the Russian and NATO fronts of battle. At the end of the book the Russians are defeated because they are severly outnumbered by NATO forces and are desperatly low on munitions, thus forcing them to retreat out of the countries they have occupied and return to their Soviet Union. Although the book is a long read, I enjoyed it because of the struggles between the two greatest military superpowers: the United States and Russia."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Well, first of all, I have no respect for anyone who attends fundraising dinners for Oliver North, but I gave this book a try since &quot;The Hunt For Red October&quot; was pretty entertaining. I've tried three times get through this book, but to no avail. The plot is quite interesting, and there are some good moments, but the whole thing is bogged down by endless, redundant battle scenes that do absolutely nothing to move the story along. This book would have been great if a couple hundred pages (no exaggeration) were edited out. Tom Clancy could use some pointers from Frederick Forsyth, Jeffrey Archer and Joseph Finder. They do this stuff much better."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"The product is sub-par. There was no quality control, no review of the text. There were numerous errors, especially spelling errors. Just because you can run a spell check and get it to pass does not mean that the words are correct. Poor, poor quality. If you won't spend the money and time to produce a good product, I won't be spending my money on Amazon books in the future."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I bought this to re-read and the book was very well used. It was readable but began to fall apart before I completed it."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"By far, the BEST book written by Tom Clancy. I have read many of his books and this one is the best. Never any chapters or areas that drop off or put you to sleep. It is a non stop action book based on the what if scenario of WWWIII. The opening chapter starts with radical Islamist terrorism in Siberia and the action never stops. Clancy's use of military technological weapons and tactics is superb. The research used in putting this thriller together was extensive. The progress of the book is extremely realistic and is very relevant for TODAY even though the book is now eleven years old.Weapons on both sides, east and west have improved beyond the book but with the global changes brought on by the terrorist attacks of 9/11, it will always have a current place for readers, and offer a place a revelance to our times and beyond."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I read this book in the early 1990s. Since then I have re-read it several times. Simply the best World War III depiction of the 80s and 90s. A great read even today, even if the Cold War is long over. The introduction hardly lasts 70 pages, and then its unfettered war, war and war. Brilliant!Unfortunately, Clancy's work has deteroriated in recent years. His latest sponsored work, EndWar was a huge disappointment of an old man stuck in a Cold War past. Fortunately the pool of creativity is endless and new authors are replacing old has-beens. \\"War against Islam\\" by George P. Robertson is the Red Storm Rising of 2008. Another great book is Caliphate by Tom Kratzman..."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Probably one of the best of Clancy's books, before he went into mass production of hyper-chauvinistic fantasy pulp fiction."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book is amazing! I absolutely loved it and was very suspenseful. I got this done in about a month. The first 200 pages were pretty boring but after that, it's nonstop action. People had said that before and i figured \\"yeah right\\" [people had said that about Hunt for Red October and there was barely any] but it was true, the action is nonstop. There aren't too many characters to get confused with like there was in Hunt for Red October, although that wasn't extremely confusing.The first chapter in this story is probably the best first chapter i have ever read in any book. It starts with three men who destroy a huge Russian oil facility and then that leads to World War III: NATO vs. Russia.Truly a fascinating story. All 725 pages was worth it. This one kept me reading way up into the night, sometimes not wanting to put it down but at the same time, too tired to keep my eyes open. Now that wasn't the case with Hunt for Red October although many people said it was.If you want a great read, pick this book up. I haven't read many Clancy novels but out of the ones i have, this is easily one of the best. Near the end, i was just a little disappointed with the characters because quite a few, they don't explain what happens with them.This was a nice break away from Jack Ryan. If you r debating whether or not to get it, i say YES! Try and sweat out the first 200 pages and then you'll be glad u did."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book is about a possible scenario of World War 3 between the Soviet Union and NATO.

They must do something drastic to save their country from a long economic depression.The members of the Soviet politburo propose a plan to invade NATO in Europe and take over the oil fields in the Middle East. A plan is reached to bomb a Soviet grade school and blame the attack on Germany. With that the first shots of World War 3 were fired.It was a very exciting book and i learned a lot about modern warfare. There was extremely realistic storytelling. Tom Clancy did an excellent job.

Clancy's scenario of how the the whole world is sucked into war is so scary because of how plausible and realistic it is (all because a couple of Islamo-fascists decide to blow up an oil factory). This is THE best Clancy book, by far."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book while lengthy is very well organized in the multiple plot lines. There is humor and suspense at every turn. The novel is based on the US Dept. of Defense analysis of the invasion of the Western part of Europe by the Soviet Union. This was a real assessment that was turned into a book. \\"Red Storm Rising\\" is Clancy's finest non-Ryan work. This book really doesn't fit with any other of his books so there is no need to worry the order to read this book. Some may not like the length; it is not quick read, but it will keep you interested throughout. I had a hard time putting it down even when I was dead tired and my eyes hurt. This work is fabulous and very realistic for the time period (early to mid 1980's)."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"\\"Red Storm Rising\\" and \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" are Tom Clancy's first two novels. They established Tom Clancy as a great writer. \\"Red Storm Rising\\" was published back in 1983, over twenty years ago, and so it is a bit dated, for example there is no longer a USSR. But the story is very well written, and very entertaining.The book is long, over 700 pages, but it is packed with details. There is no fluff. Every page has a ton of information and action. Tom Clancy has done his research.The basic story is what might happen during World War III. The story is told from several points of view, so we get to see what is happening on the ground through the eyes a tank commander. We get to see parts of the naval battles through the captain of a ship. In the depths of the sea we see sub fights. In the outback in Iceland we watch one of our heroes hide out from the Russians, and provide headquarters with intelligence about what is going on in Iceland. We also get to listen in as the leaders of the war efforts, on both sides, make decisions and analyze what is going on.This is one of Tom Clancy's best. It is well written. It is hard to put down. If you have enjoyed any of Tom Clancy's novels, then you'll enjoy this one. If you like military fiction, but haven't read any Tom Clancy novels, this is a good one start with."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I picked this up never having read a Clancy Book and was immediately hooked. A strategic novel that depicts what would happen if we had ever went to war with Russia during the cold war. A very intense novel."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book of course is dated, but it is an interesting play-through of the maritime doctrine of that period. Key battles, including aerial, are at sea (or depend on seapower) since the book was derived from the wargame, Harpoon designed by TC's colleague Larry Bond, a techno-thriller author in his own right.The tale is not typical of Clancy, in that he doesn't stay with a single set of characters, but there is a lot of cutting to the different theaters of war... cinemtatic technique typical of a wartime documentary, familiar to us from the opening scenes of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.All in all, an easily digestible way to revisit the way in which the US Navy imagined the Big One with the Evil Empire would play out...at least this is the way they projected it to the Congressional appropriations committees.For a more prosaic, less dramatic, play-through of the view from 1978, read Sir John Hackett, et. al., The Third World War, August, 1985. The Hackett committee's style mimics the military history textbook for those who prefer that approach. It also reflects NATO's wish list as of 1978 to meet the apparent Soviet Airland threat.This &quot;Imaginary War Novel&quot; has a history going back to the British Colonel of Volunteers, Sir George T. Chesney, whose 1871 _The Battle of Dorking_ projected a German invasion of the British Isles. It is interesting that Tom Clancy stepped out of character to try his hand at the genre before returning to his more character-centered tecnhothrillers."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"As a special operations officer, I read this book years ago when it was first released-- before the Berlin Wall came down and we were worried about the Russians rolling through the Fulda Gap. Clancy takes a very difficult subject-- World War III-- and gives overly detailed snapshots of certain parts. Because he has no military background, while his technical details may be accurate, his potrayal of the men and women who actually would fight is weak and unrealistic. You want realism, try Bob Mayer's special forces series. DRAGON SIM-13 is a chilling look at a fail-safe scenario that could happen. EYES OF THE HAMMER makes Clear and Present Danger read like a comic book. Check them out-- Mayer is former special operations and knows what he's writing about."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This was one of Clancy's earlier books and it is a great read if you are into fictional military books that are based at least in part on reality of capabilities and methods. It is too bad that this couldn't be made into a movie, likely because the scope of the book was too broad for making a movie, because this could have been a good movie in the right hands."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Length:: 0:57 MinsI just started reading this book, and I noticed that I'm either missing pages, or they got scrambled somehow. I was on page 28, then the next page over was 48. After that, there is a blank page on one side with a quote by Edward L. Beach. And then it goes back to page 33.Then, between pages 33 - 50 all the pages are in what seems to be a random order. I think all the pages are there, so it's not worth returning and waiting another two weeks to get a new copy, but something screwy happened with the printing.I still give the product 3 stars because even though the pages are mixed up, i received the product on time. I understand that the seller did not print this book (as far as i'm concerned)."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I've read this one a couple of times over the years, and I get something out of it each time. To me, this is the best book Clancy has ever written followed closely by The Hunt for Red October, and I have often wondered why he didn't continue with these characters in future novels vs. writing one or two too many Jack Ryan novels as well as the Op-Center and many other derivative works with co-authors. It's too bad clancy seems to be done."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"After a setting up the situation and main characters this book roars into a gripping depiction of what modern war with equally matched opponents might look like. Once the war starts it is hard to put down, despite the, for the most part, two-dimensional characters and a few of the less plausible plot threads. It is best when describing battle and high tech fighting equipment and barely passable when trying to work in a love-interest or dabbling in politics. It holds up even 25 years later as a good read."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This Cold War thriller gets off to a slow start, but it's entirely worth the wait. The action heats up about 100 pages in, and never lets up after that. Middle Eastern terrorists sabotage the USSR's most productive oil fields, leaving the paranoid Soviet Politburo without the fuel needed to run their military and industry. In a few months, when their stockpiles of oil begin to run low, they will become vulnerable to attack. They decide to attack first, while they still have the fuel reserves to seize the upper hand. The Soviet military hits NATO head-on, and the result is a slugfest in the air, on the ground, and at sea. If you like military action, this book has got it in spades.Red Storm Rising has gathered a lot of criticism from Armchair Generals, but I spent a decade and a half studying for, planning for, and training for war with the Soviet Navy, and I think Clancy did a better job with the subject than anyone else. In hindsight, his descriptions of stealth aircraft were a little off the mark, but he made a lot of pretty shrewd guesses about a branch of technology that was still completely under wraps when he wrote the book. Slow start and minor errors aside, Red Storm is a page-turner.Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\""},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising starts out with muslim men blowing up a oil/gas factory in the former U.S.S.R., and now due to the damage, the hard-line high power Soviet leaders now have to make a decision; let the Soviet economy come to it's knee's, or take out NATO and invade the Middle East for their oil? Destroy NATO and her allies and invade the Middle East. So now, as the Soviet military head's to war, they then plan to get everything in order in 4 months to fight NATO. As the story goes along, we meet Bob Toland; a US Navy captain who is fighting against the Soviet's for their bid for the Middle East. The battles take place in Iceland, and the Baltic sea thanks to submarines.As the battle get's fiercer, the Soviet's think they have NATO done, but things take a turn for them, and they are being swept back to mother Russia and away from the Middle East. Then in a huge battle to end the war, the Soviet's then back away from their strong holds, and are driven back to their own lines. Eventually WW3 is over, and the Soviet's take a serious defeat.Red Storm Rising is a very interesting novel, although the Soviet Union is long gone, the book still holds it place as one of the best war novels out there. Also, not only do NATO take a beating, the Soviet's take a beating also, winning some, losing some. A great novel, and definitely one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book is a highly gripping account of what a war between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. might have looked like. Tom Clancy keeps the story fresh by alternating between several sub-plots, which ultimately all converge. Clancy is a master storyteller who puts the reader right in the middle of the action. He provides just the right amount of technical detail when it comes to military equipment and operations. As a former Army officer, I learned quite a bit about the Naval tactics from this book. Clancy is also very good at choosing and developing his characters. The story could probably have been a little shorter without losing any of its punch, but overall a great work and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Story Rising is one of the BEST Clancy books. This book was when Clancy was in his prime, and this is truly Clancy at his best.The book starts out with a terrorist attack on the Soviet Union in their oil fields, then the top men in the Kremlin in the now gone U.S.S.R., they now decide in order to save their country, they decide to take out the West in order to get the oil fields in Saudi Arabia.Then the novel goes through much detail about what would happen if the U.S.S.R. did go to war with the West, and if this really happen, then it would turn out just like Red Storm Rising without a shadow of a doubt.This is more a action novel by Mr. Clancy, if you like Red Stom Rising, then you would like Rainbox Six, Executive Orders, and Debt of Honor.But if you like the political type of novels, then Patriot Games and Clear And Presend Danger is the novels you want to read by him."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Tom Clancy's story of the Soviet Union and the United States is his best. After reading a rather boring Rainbow Six and a not-up-to par Net Force, I thought maybe Clancy was not as good as I had thought he was when I read Clear and Present Danger. It took me Red Storm Rising to figure out I was dead wrong. The first 300 pages are basically political, no real action...yet. In the last 400 or so pages, the war starts, and I didn't put this down from page 300 until I read it fully. The best book of the genre, you should already have bought it."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"One of the few books that I was not able to put down. It takes you from the drab into the extraordinary. Like a hurricane, you never know what to expect next, except that you had better hold onto your chair. Mr. Clancy is one of, if not the greatest suspense authors of our time! His vivid description of the modern era of warfare is nothing short of visionary. If there is one word that would describe how I felt after finishing his novel, (and there is a lack of proper words), the word would be WOW!!!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"RED STORM RISING was the first techno-thriller I read. It was while I was in high school some years ago and every techno-thriller I read is judged by that standard. After several years of reading that genre, however, I have noticed that there are numerous simularities between Red Storm and the many other NATO versus Warsaw Pact novels.The most frequent convention and premise of these novels is that the Russian forces will achieve limited success in the opening stages of a campaign in Europe. As the battle goes on, however, NATO's assumed technological superiority will overcome the Soviet's material superiority and carry the day, although by a narrow margin.I would like to ask Mr. Clancy and the others who subscribe to this theory to refresh their knowledge of history. In the Second World War the Germans had the best tank in the Tiger and the best planes with the invention of the jet. The Germans had a better machine gun in the MG 42. Many historians argue that the greatest factors that overcame the Germans was quantity of US equipment. This historical experience flies in the face of Tom Clancy's thinking in his novel and should give us all pause as we think about &quot;what might have been&quot;. Quality is not necessarily a replacement for quantity.I enjoyed reading Red Storm Rising, it is a well written and fast paced novel. The action is well developed, but if you are looking for character development, look elsewhere.Even with my objection, it remains possibly the best written of its genre and the standard by which all others are judged."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I think this is one of his best works. It really has a good pace. Plus the descriptions are great."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I have just finished reading all of the Tom Clancy books, and I have to say this is my favorite. During the course of this mainly Jack Ryian odessy, I cam back and read this book 3 times. The first time I found it exciting, but I was rather confused by some of the technical details. The second time through I concentrated on figuring out what was going on in the parts that I didn't understand, and once I did, I reread the book. This time through I found myself identifying with many of the characters. Morris seemed to remind me of my uncles, and I thought that these people seemed totally realistic. I would recommend that anyone who has the time (it took me 2 months, 3 weeks, and 4 days to read it twice) to read such a book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"If your into what if scenarios this book is for you. If you just like a good war story get it. It follows the same characters on both sides (Russians and Americans) through a facanating and realistic scenario. Good thing it didnt come true!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Tom Clancy updated and improved upon WORLD WAR III, 1984 written by a Nato general I can't remember. He used the Fulda Gap and a single ICBM exchange as guideposts, then added subs and Russian polical intrigue and created an environment that Larry Bond and others added to. Team Yankee (I can't remember the author) took place in a microcosm of this environment. Larry Bond wrote the story where the Russians won because the &quot;pair of deuces&quot; counterattack did not get rolling soon even to prevent German politicians from cracking.Clancy's book shows how the leverage of superior technology can play a decisive role at critical junctures in combat. Clancy was right about the decisive advantage that the M-IA with its SilverBullet sabot round has over the T-72 and T-80. There is more here than techno-babble if you care to look."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This was as excellent a book I have ever read. Tom Clancy seems to grab tactics he uses in his writing out from the blue, things that generals would never think of. His accuracy and realistic approach to a tale of World War will never be matched."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"the book from beginning to end gives one of the most chilling tales to date, about how WWWIII could start and who would start it. It also tells how the U.S. would be involved and play a part. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that is a war nut, and would love to understand more about how the latest tehnology would be used, and Clancy delivers one of his best ex ever and can be read over and over again."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Having been in the Infantry and Field Artillery for 9 years, this book is as real as it gets. Tom Clancy is so accurate (as usual) in his descriptions and scenarios. I couldn't put it down when I first started reading it. Read this book many times over when I was in Kuwait during Desert Storm (It was the only book I had with me and there wasn't much else to do but kill rats and flies). I never got bored of it though!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"When you put Tom Clancy and Larry Bond together, you've got an unbeatable team in the modern military genre. Although a bit dated by now, this novel really delivers. It's gripping from the start, and the action just doesn't let up. The best thing about it is that this scenario could very well have played out at the height of the Cold War. Every aspect of the NATO and Warsaw Pact military machines is masterfully depicted in full, grinding motion. It is amazing how the authors manage to keep a global scale, yet give the reader an up-close and personal tour of fierce combat. This is not a novel for the faint of heart, and an absolute must-read for any military buff."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I have read almost all of Clancy's novels and this one is certainly one of the best. It is a somewhat refreshingbreak from the usual intertwinig of personal characters (don't get me wrong, I love the way he does it in the rest of his books). He takes a much larger perspective this time and still manages to combine it with his awsome ability to narrate and get the reader totally invlolved with this book. I started reading it and could not put it down. I would walk down the street with this book in my hand just reading it while bumping into people...This book is definitely worth the reading time plus more!!!BUY THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"In this tale of World War III set in the time near the end of the Cold War, Clancy sets forth a beautiful plot: a submarine commander headed on a dangerous mission against the Russians, an anti-submarine frigate captain struggling with the loss of his last ship, a wing-wiper Air Force lieutenant and four marines desperately trying to survive in the wilderness of Iceland, a Russian army commander forced to fight a war that he knows he's not ready for, a Politburo attempting to hold onto power against all odds, and a Politburo member who wants to do the right thing for his country. Each part of the plot is fully developed; there are no loose ends at the end of the book. The action is edge-of-the-seat. If you need sleep tonight, don't start reading it today. This is truly one of the epic novels of our time."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"If you have not read any of Clancy's other books, this is a great one to start with. It's different then his other CIA spook, secret agent stuff, but it is the best Clancy I've read. It starts with a bang(literally) and then goes into great care in setting up a storyline that is one of the best I've ever seen.The action is basically non-stop after about page 150. You find yourself in the middle of the dogfights between the F-14's and the MiG's. You can get a picture in your mind's eye of the Abrams tanks letting loose into the Russians. You almost hear the propellers turning on the submarines and Aircraft Carriers.This book is about 800 pages, but I read it in about a week. I just couldn't put the thing down!I wish that Mr. Clancy would write another book similar to this so that we can find ourselves with imaginations running. My hats off to you Tom!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Let me begin by saying I am a major fan of &quot;The Hunt for Red October.&quot; I saw the movie in theaters and bought the VHS.Earlier this year I made the mistake of picking-up &quot;SSN&quot; by Clancy as my introduction to his books. &quot;SSN&quot; was a disaster. Slow, boring, uninventive and filled with mistakes I did not expect from someone with Clancy's reputation.&quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; is everything &quot;SSN&quot; was not and a lot more what I expected from the master of &quot;Red October.&quot;&quot;Red Storm&quot; is long (700+ pages) but a quick read. Clancy really has a knack for making you feel that you are in the meeting, on the phone or in the battle without drowning you with minutia.This book's biggest asset is its feasibility. Upon reflection, events could have worked exactly as Clancy projects in the late 1980s -- bringing NATO and the Warsaw Pact into full-scale conflict. Where &quot;Red October&quot; is based on the fictional or unreal reality of a super-quiet sub, there is nothing in &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; that will make the reader stop and wonder if that were possible. This makes the \\"Storm\\" better.Best of all, Clancy's character development is so good in places that you want to cheer for the enemy (the Russians) because you identify with them as people and feel compassion for their personal and political struggles.Don't get me wrong, &quot;Red Storm&quot; is not perfect. The ending is a tad too contrived for me. I won't ruin it by telling you what my problem with the ending was - but the book as a whole works.All in all, &quot;Red Storm&quot; is an exciting, great read. If you like the movie &quot;Hunt for Red October,&quot; than &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; is for you. Pick it up. You won't put it down. I promise."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is one of my favorite Clancy novels. This was written when he had to put a great novel on the table to make money, and Red Storm Rising certainly is this. Aside from the several slow stretches and its lack of development for some of the characters, this book is a compelling look at a Soviet-NATO war that could have easily happened, this book seizes your attention and holds it until the very last page. The ending is good as well, although some will debate me on this. I'm waiting for the movie."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"The first time I read Red storm rising, I didn't want to stop reading it. It really grabbed me. I hated to have to put it down. But, by the same token I was aware that I was enjoying it so much that I didn't want it to end either. So, I found myself going back over details just to savor the way this story is told. I've read it four times now, and I'll read it again, and again. I think this was one of Mr Clancy's best books. Anyone who likes action with a lot of detail; detail so your sure you can see exactly whats going on----- READ Red Storm Rising."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Readers of Tom Clancy know his skill at detailing the technological implements in his novels and finely weaving the plots into actual (or not yet realized) world events--fiction in a non-fiction setting.&quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; is a bit of a departure as it takes place in a more fictionalized setting as the United States and the Soviet Union battle in a third World War. The departure is successful as Clancy creates an incredibly-well-strategized war and mixes it with enough human interest to keep the novel from becoming a West Point textbook.Clancy's research and knowledge about weaponry and military strategy shine in &quot;Rising&quot; which shows, in a perfectly believable fashion, how a war could have gone between the two superpowers of the 1980's. Economics, the nuclear question, and logistics all figure into one hell of a great read...the best WWIII novel I have come across. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is my favorite Tom Clancy novel ! I truely enjoy each of his works but this one's just the best. While it doesn't have the character Jack Ryan (Clancy's alias-ego), it DOES have Bob Toland, Dan McCafferty and others, who I really enjoyed and felt connected to. The characters come alive in this sweeping drama about WW3 taking place in the European theater. I've read this book perhaps 25 times, which I'll admit sounds absurd, but it's just GREAT ! There is the requisite Clancy technical detail, AND there is excellent character development along with a very interesting plot and great descriptive scenes...I think this is a real masterpiece. Buy this book, take you time when reading it to visualize eath scene, and ENJOY !!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"An excellent book, worthy of several readings. With the fall of the USSR, the story is dated, but no less exciting. It's entirely focused on a land war between NATO and the Soviets, set primarily in Germany, Iceland, and beneath the North Atlantic ocean. It is truly a benchmark for war-story development, technical details and action. Like most Clancy books, the characters are fairly one-dimensional.It should be noticed that despite the large &quot;TOM CLANCY&quot; imprinted on the cover, this book is actually co-written by Larry Bond, an excellent military-writer in his own right."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This was the first Clancy book I'v read,and I could NOT put this book down!I must have stayed up till' 3:30AM every night untill I finished it. Excelant reading!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Never have I read such a perfectly realistic, exciting book about war. Clancy's military knowledge is incredible - and his writing is so good that it leaves little to the imagination. Reading the book is like watching a eight-hour long action movie. I can't believe no one ever made a movie out of this - I guess the budget would have been too high before the age of computer graphics and the like. The only possible way I can think of making it better would be to make the war more widespread instead of being pretty much confined to Europe and the Atlantic. The first Soviet attack on the U.S. Navy is perhaps the best ten pages of any book that I have ever read. Anyone who likes books about war of any kind, this will become your Bible once you read it. What a great book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising is a must buy! A very thrilling, frighteningly believable, and an all around great book! The WWlll scenario it incorporates is very beleivable. It is a awsome book for the price. Tom Clancy's best!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"When I saw this book,and bought it, i thought that it would be an achievement, if I read it all. And I did. One of the best books Iread, it took me 1 and a half weeks, to finish it.(That is not short time, but I had homework, to do too.) I recommend this book, for Clancy readers, and people that are interested in war scenarios."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Clancy did a great job explaining what was happening at each moment. I enjoyed the way he used characters which were connected through the past. The attention to detail he incorporated made it possible to picture the activities occuring. The possibility of WW-III as being a conflict over oil and subsequently power is a realistic scenario. I recommend this book to anyone intersted in nonstop action at the turn of a page."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This deserves 50 out of 10! Once the politics are out of the way, which incidentally, when the Soviets discuss the war strategies, are superbly done, this book kicks butt! Splendid action scenes on land and sea, and under it, great setpieces(Iceland in particular!) and laden with entertaining characters. A MUST READ&gt; BUY THIS BOOK NOW!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I have read most of Clancys books, and this is indefinetly his best, most exciting book of them all. It has great characters, wonderful story lines, very realistic and for back in 1988 it was VERY possible! One of my favorite things about this book is the absents of Jack Ryan. Ryans character was good in Red October, but after that he just went down hill. This is a great book, and to all of you poor people out there that have not read this book I highly recomend it!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book was the best book Tom Clancy has written in my opinion. A great read for any military personal. overall a must read"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising is an excellent book. Not only is it entrancing, it's realistic. For example, in the book, the American tugboat does not sink a Russian carrier, as some other American authors would write. He makes it seem real, and because of it, it's a non-stop page turner. Clancy is awesome."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I loved this book, begining to end! This is the first book of Clancy's I have read, and let's just say I'm on my third. It was a great mix of technology and military strategy! With a colourful blend of characters, Clancy takes us throug the sometimes dull political processes, but then fills the book with hard-hitting, fast-pasted, full scale war! An excellent composition, military enthusiast or not, and intriging, and somewhat effortless read."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I loved this book when I first read it although I'm not sure Clancy's references to advanced military technology are as applicable to the weapons of today. Unlike other books based upon war, Clancy does rely more on the fact that he is presenting something futuristic. The many years that have passed since this was written has muted the excitement over something he presents as futuristic and yet the reader sees as old technology.I only wish that Clancy would go back to writing books where he spends more than a few months between releases. When he spends some time on a book, he can be a very engaging writer but when he cranks 6 books out in a year, the quality of his books drop immensely."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I read this after my 5th read of Hunt for Red October (I love it)... and I had to go back and check that I was reading a Tom Clancy novel. It reads so differently from HfRO, and not in a good way, in my humble opinion. I have not read any of Clancy's other novels, but can only assume that Bond's co-authorship is what ruined this for me. Be forewarned: if you're looking for something on par with Hunt for Red October--this isn't it."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I love Tom Clancy. In fact I can safely say that Cardinal for the Kremlin is one of my all time favorite books. So when I heard that there was a novel out there about WWIII with soviets I jumped right on it.Big Mistake.I was expecting a book about major battles and world changing events. I was expecting to see the world structure change right before my very eyes! Although this is a great concept, I feel like Mr. Clancy spent too much time on minor things.******SPOILER*******I don't care about 3 men stuck on hill 142. I didn't want to hear about the personal feelings of a submarine captain. I wanted to read about major world changing battles, and got nothing of the sort."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book was lauded as a realistic piece in its day, but this is one of the most far-fetched works of military propaganda ever written, and one must wonder if the U.S. military did not have a hand in the book in order to sell the need for more conventional arms to the American public through a secondary source. Sure, this novel is classified as fiction--but honestly--anyone who visits globalsecurity.org for more than three or four hours will discover just how ludicrous some of the scenarios presented in the book would have been in the reality of 1987 (as if WWIII would have gone forth without nuclear weapons to begin with).For example, almost the entire book is based on a scenario whereby the Soviet Union is able to take Iceland from NATO extremely quickly, but there is no possible way the Soviet Union could have taken Iceland from NATO in 1987 without the soviets having suffered significant naval and air losses in the process. But if the Soviets could have accomplished such a task, the United States could have conducted a quick counterstrike with cruise missiles, F-16s, and F-18s [i]at minimum[/i] shortly afterward from Thule Air Base in nearby Greenland (the U.S had significant warning and was at Defcon 2 for quite some time beforehand in the book); instead, in Clancy's world, the U.S. waits for days after the Soviets establish themselves all over the island with a mere shipload of supplies: what is more, the Americans then limit their counterstrike to a small force of archaic F-4s and B-52s! Is it reasonable to assume that the Soviets could have created a greater defensive presence on Iceland within two weeks than the United States and NATO could have when the U.S. had months (if not years) to do so?It is not as if Tomahawk missiles and stealth fighter aircraft are missing in Clancy's book--they are simply mentioned in unrealistic scenarios. For some reason, the U.S. Navy can creep near Soviet territory to fire off cruise missiles--but they could not do so near Iceland, as has been mentioned previously.Clancy creates an overrated book of extreme double standards and contradictions. If you know a fair amount about real military strategy, it makes it almost impossible to enjoy the rest of the book without pulling one's hair out. NATO's ground forces are excellent in the book, but the U.S. Navy is made out to be a weak and incapable force--if anything, the opposite would be the case in reality.But then again, even the quantitatively COMBINED ground forces of NATO and the United States outnumbered those of the Soviet Union--surely, the U.S. and Europe already had enough ammunition stored in Europe to have destroyed every Soviet tank twenty times over. The book makes the NATO ground units seem to be invincible, which they probably would have been in a defensive struggle, yet, they run into supply shortages--give me a freaking break! They could have had truckloads upon truckloads of ammunition airlifted to them if they needed to do so! This wasn't the early 20th century!If you know nothing about military forces, read this book, and by all means enjoy it--but please, educate yourself afterwards. Don't think you are somewhat enlightened about the U.S. military just because you have read a long and outright dry Tom Clancy book such as this. If you want a good Clancy book, read Patriot Games--at least it is free of all the needless technobabble and geopolitical nonsense."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"World War 3 broke out. The USSR is trying to crush NATO. I'm going to upset Clancy's fans. I think it's one of the worst his books. It's absolutely unrealistic from the first line to the last. What do I mean? I try to concretize. I will not touch political issues1. The fable of conflict is sabotage of the biggest oil refinery in the USSR after which the USSR lost more than half it's fuel output. It cannot be just because the fuel refining is not so centralized over there how Tom thinks.2. Clancy too easy 'defeated' Soviet ground forces. Did you ever heard that NO ONE western antitank weapon can't penetrate newer soviet tank's front armor (since T-72)? That's true, read Jane's! Altogether, Russian tanks well better armored than their western counterparts, except Israel Merkava and they have much lower profile. They have also more powerful guns and they are more maneuverable. And Russian tanks are far lighter than western ones. Learn, western tank designers!3. The naval warfare is closer to reality. But... Russian antiship missile Mosquit (Sunburn) has speed M 5. Can you imagine how to defend against such treat? I can't.4. The soviet military putsch and attack on Kremlin. It is also impossible to imagine. Kremlin is much better defended than anyone can think. The Soviet leaders always worried about their personal security more than about something else. So, this attack against Kremlin is at least laughworthy.I can add many more bugs like this, but I hope you got the point. Tom Clancy was pretty bad informed and he did this book in hurry using mostly computer games"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I am a fan of Tom Clancy. I have read all but 2 of his novels and this was by far the worse....the story line was good, but the detail was so boring i wanted to skip half the book. In 350 pages this could have been good....now i understand why some readers view clancy as too detailed, technical and boring...."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I do think that if world war III broke out between soviets and americans AND IF nukes weren't used. The US and its allies would be the ultimate winners. But I don't believe in the extraordinary events that take place in Red Storm Rising, there are just too many coincidences. For example, when the air strike against the american carrier group takes place, a small group of F-15s en route to europe just happened to be passing by and killed some of the soviet bombers... come on people, the Atlantic is way to big for this. And I'm just sure Soviet commandos in a covert mission get distracted enough to be ran over by a car every day! Sorry, I just had to get it out of my system. The book is just full of these sort of events. If Clancy had just left them out, the book would be in one word Excellent."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Okay so I made those words up. They're not actual military terms. Buried in this Tom Clancy book though, I doubt that anyone except submarine and naval experts would even notice. I've never heard of an author doing TOO much research for a book. I think Clancy lost touch with the everyday reader if he thinks anyone would understand enough of the jargon he spews here to care about this book. And when jargon is all a book offers (characters? what characters?) the book, to put in simple, non-Clancian terms, SUCKS! Clearly it's not the dumbest book I've ever read, but it is the worst. I make it a mission never to stop a book once I've started, and never to refuse reading a book given to me. This book made me question the value of such a mission. Too boring, too long, too technical, too empty."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"this is clancy's most involved and boring book.do not buy it. instead try hunt for red october."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"RSR was a book so much filled with techno jibberish I had to stuff it away on my bookshelf of bad books. When I pick it up twenty-five years from now, it may seem a little more realistic, but not now. This is one of the worst &quot;Clancy&quot; books I've ever read. Please Mr. Clancy, next time you think of a WW3 type of book, make it so it can be easily understood."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Tom Clancy's RSR is one of the best book I have ever read. Even though it may seem unlikely that the Soviet Union will resort to a world war to get access to the oil fields, instead of just asking for help. ( They did when their wheat crops failed, and they were supplied by the US and Canada ) But the action is great, and I was just captivated by the book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Dear Amazon Shopper: There are two reasons you should buy this book. If you enjoy reading about believable American Heros of fictional fame, you have come to the right book. Dr. Jack Ryan is the man we have come to love, admire and respect. A man of character, a man of conviction, a vulnerable man, a man I would not mind my son growing up to be like. The second is this: Reading RSR is like taking a college course in combined arms from General Franks, personally. For those of you who know what it's like to be on the cutting edge: It's like kissing the purple tip of the silver bird before she glides to make all man sleep."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"If you love Tom Clancy's books or your just looking for a great read, this is the book for you.

This book has everything or as Ronald Raegan would say it is the perfect yarn."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"In 1981/82, I worked in the ASWOC at Keflavik .

This book is the pinaccle of my Tom Clancy book collection. The story line is so believable that it makes you worry that it's really going to happen"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"My chief rave is that the book really does immerse you in the action. You can feel yourself in theseat of the sonar officer on a sub or the radar officer on a ship. The naval action kept movingforward unerringly.My chief complaint is some of the excessive detail which adds bulk to a bulky story. Do I really care what model torpedo is fired every time oneis fired? I also fault the weak subplot of alove story during wartime. It just wasn't allthat interesting. Of all the campaignsgoing on, I found the ground war in Europe the least interesting from the point of the reader. It lacks the suspense of the submarine stories. Itlacks the speed of the air war. It lacks the intrigue of the intelligence war.The story is not perfect. There are some definite loose ends with the finale. SometimesI kept wondering when some of the characters were going to come back to take their bows, and theynever did."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is an excellent war story. I have every respect for Clancy's work, but thats just what it is, a story. The Soviets would not have been able to so easly conquer Iceland. And During Nordic Hammer, the B-52H raid was a terrible account of what would have happened. A Buff can take more than one SAM hit and survive, this was proven in Operation Desert Storm. 23mm shells hitting the bomb bay will not detonate the ordanece.Other problems with this book are the hints of the combat in Norway, the Pacific, and Indian Ocean but they are never talked about much. What about the Med? More attacks towords Scottland would have been more likely."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"For all of you Clancy Fans who haven't read this book yet - Red Storm Rising is probably Clancy's best fictional work. It combines plot twists, adventure, and drama in a handful of dependent but overlapping story lines. After you read this book, you will not doubt Clancy's mastery of the written (fictitious word"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I already read the book three or four times and still find it fascinating. Clancy writes in great detail and shows a great knowledge of military technology. The story is GREAT!Neverthelss there is a lack of knowledge on todays Germany and topography: Parts of the story like that about the spetznatz leader at the main post office in Aachen or the 'camping site' on the way to Lammersdorf show his knowledge to be 'only' from maps and don't work in reality. German police and military structures and titles described are from times BEFORE World War II.So would you please keep in mind, that this book is fiction in many ways, detailed and exact and real as it might seem."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"If you are looking to get away from his jack ryan novels this is the one to read. The action starts off right from the first page. From their it is nothing but all out land, sea, and air warfare. It is a very scary realistic possibility of World War 3. Surprised they havent turned it into a movie. Would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Tom Clancy is (or at least was) the king of the technothriller. Red Storm Rising, one of his few non-Jack Ryan books, is by far one of his best. The hypothetical scenario of an all out Soviet attack on NATO is covered from multiple vantage points including an SSN captain, an Air Force weather man, and Army cavalry.While it seems a little strange to go back to the peak of the Cold War, this is a great read at any time.note: this was a collaboration with Larry Bond, another amazing author and creator of Harpoon simulations"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I first want to say that I enjoyed Joshua's comments.The analysis by weapon systems was truly enlightening.I finally got my sons to read this book after many years of trying.They are both in Iraq playing with real guns at present.They look on the book now as a pc of nostalgic fiction,as opposed to the nightmare scenario,it was at the time.Only a few Americans know how close we came to the coming to pass of something like this.Former Soviet generals have also been quoted to the effect that they missed their chance to take us out,even w/o nukes.There is a lot of truth to this book-not as much as Red October-only a few know how much truth is in that \\"novel\\". Red Storm is a fun read for most guys and a few gals.The book points out the truth of the real strength of the American war machine-the character and courage of the individual American warrior.No country has produced men of the caliber we have seen since the Revolutionary war.If you read or hear the stories coming out of Iraq from the invasion to today-you know what I mean.The courage and sacrifice they show today would make Sgt York and Murphy proud.Clancy knows these men.He honors these men by his writing.One of many things we owe Pres.Reagan is the \\"discovery\\"of Tom.That's a good story on its own."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is what war is like. If you wanna read what woulda happened in 1980ish if the Soviets had pressed the red button, this is what would have transpired. From the deep deep oceans, to the endless reaches of outer space, the battle rages on. Tom Clancy is incredible in his detail of the military hardware that the US and USSR both control, and he communicates these details intestingly to his reader. AMAZING read."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book Red Storm Rising starts out really slow and boring but then out of nowhere it grabs you (and draws you) into the action. None could have described world war three better then Tom Clancy. The way he jumps from one person and place to another to cover several different theaters of the war at once is absoulte genius. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the book. You never know what is going to happen next. I can hardly wait till they make a movie about this book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is one of Clancy's finest. Only Red October and Rainbow Six comes close. He gives such a detailed account that you feel that you are right there. World War III breaks out when a key Soviet oil complex are destroyed by Muslim terrorists. The Politburo is then forced to attack NATO in an attempt to obtain oil from the Persian Gulf. Clancy blends raw human emotion with techological wizardry he is renowned for. It is shockingly realistic, although outdated. Only Clancy can write such a realistic and gripping story. If you read only one Clancy novel, this is the one to read."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Clancy's first book is definitely one of his best. The way he depicts modern combat is as if he was actually on the front lines in a modern WWII. The only part that I disliked was all of the tedious submarine lingo. It would be great if he would have put a glossary in, but it's still awesome."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book is excellent.

The political faces may change but the policies sometimes remain all to similar."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Just re-read for probably the fourth time. The only physical book that managed any space in my luggage on my recent vacation. It is that good!

From great plot to interesting characters and brilliant action scenes. Hard to believe it was published over 25 years ago. Even the fourth time of reading, I was still racing through the pages, Fantastic."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I think this was the novel that made Clancy famous, and if correct then rightfully so. Red Storm Rising is the story of a conflict between the Soviet Union and NATO over oil, after terrorists strike at Russian Oil production. NATO is seen as the major obstacle to the conquest of the middle eastern oil fields, so it must be taken out first. The main action of the book revolves around the taking of Iceland by Soviet paratroopers brought in by ferry, and they efforts of the United states to take the island back. There is plenty of action described in Central Europe and other areas as well, as the friction of war and unexpected resistance slow the Soviet advance. This book is not as well written as Clancy's later books, but is still a good read and of interest to anyone who asks the question, what if America and the Soviet Union had actually clashed head to head in the late twentieth century."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I have read 10 Tom Clancy novels and this is my personal favorite one.

Geezz it was good, shewwwww."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is my first Tom Clancy novel, although I have seen several movies based on his books, all of which I enjoyed very much. I think if Red Storm Rising had been about 100 pages shorter, it would have been wonderful, and the author would not have lost any of the suspense he manages to create with the great battle scenes and political machinations of the Russians. I thought the story line about the guys running around on Greenland could have been shortened by 2/3 and the book would have been more succinct and suspenseful. I think Clancy wanted to inject a bit of romance into this techno-thriller, but, since he is pretty hopeless with in-depth character development, this component fell flat and could easily have been eliminated. Anyway, the book is a fun read, even if the equipment used in this version of WWIII is quite dated (reflecting the date of the book, of course). I plan to try a few more Clancy novels."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I've long been a fan of Tom Clancy although I prefer his earlier works (while he was an author and before he became a brand).Most of his books fit the pattern where 75% of the action centers around the protagonist. This differs in that it's a true ensemble cast with several main characters in each of several major plot lines. The plot lines are woven together into a tapestry that plays out linearly in real time.I suspect, but cannot prove, that Larry Bond and Tom Clancy wrote this one first but it was only after \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" (which does fit the pattern) became a hit that this book became publishable. A good thing too, because this was one of the best selling books in the 1980s.The level of detail is immense. It's brilliant.I also recommend \\"Clear and Present Danger, The Sum of All Fears\\", and \\"Without Remorse\\" as my personal favorites."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Yes, there is no more Soviet Union, but never mind that.

A VOLUNTARY comment that you have to put on there to get 100% on the book completion. That is really dumb."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I'm guessing Tom Clancy novels are mostly a \\"guy thing.\\" If it's a Tom Clancy novel I'm probably going to check it out. I'm something of a \\"Naval Action\\" freak. I blame the 1943 Lawrence O'Donnell science fiction short story CLASH BY NIGHT, which I read in Junior High, for my fetish. Asimov made me want to read more science fiction; Lawrence made me want more Naval Action!RED STORM RISING presents a global non-nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia that involves our NATO allies. The first read-through I read everything, but on re-reads I skip many parts, depending on my mood, and focus on the parts involving the weatherman in Iceland, a U.S. Air Force lieutenant who is the main hero. There is also a cute love story that develops here.There is some great submarine action here. Many readers think Clancy novels are technical over-kill, but what he does in RED STORM RISING works for me. @hg47"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Have been an avid reader of Tom Clancy books for years.

This is a hard book to put down.

I lost more sleep reading this, but yeah, itwas worth it! I don't know how he can write so many great stories."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Tom Clancy did a wonderful job, again. I discovered Tom Clancy a few years ago by a friend, and have gotten several of his books since. \\"Red Storm Rising\\" is a WWIII scenario, and frankly, the way it is written, is very realistic and all military campaigns in the book could be carried out. I would tell others to read this book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This novel really had me gripped for the first 200 pages or so. It begins with a disgruntled terrorist from the Caucasus who takes part in an attack, leaving the politburo with an awful dilemma: go to war or leave the Soviet Union vulnerable and in economic dire straits. Of course they settle on war and the story begins. Unfortunately we hear little more from our terrorist baddies after the first chapter although the build up to war is well done. Clancy gets eleven out of ten for his technical and all round military procedural knowledge, but for those of us who are not military hardware anoraks there is a lot of effort required to keep up with the various subs, planes, ships and weapons; not to mention the ranks and names of the characters. Clancy has a knack for thinking the reader knows the characters as well as he does and uses ranks, names and eastern European nicknames interchangeably; that's fine for those of you who are familiar with military ranks and so on, but I had lost track of the names and ranks only quarter way into the book. Maybe three characters stuck in my head, but I wasn't clear on what they had been upto and was still left confused when he continued to refer to them by rank rather than name.The sub and air battles had me in suspense and on the edge of my seat at times, but half way through the book and the infantry battles became more hastily narrated. People were dying left, right and centre with little of the suspense that preceded the earlier confrontations between aircraft and subs. At this point I didn't really care who was winning. I wasn't sure who the good guys and bad guys were due to a lack of any storyline involving public reaction or politicians - specifically western politicians who we hear nothing from in the book. I was really bored with the book at this point and felt that the infantry battles really dragged on.The only attempt at anything other than battlefield drama is a USAF man named Edwards, who is the star of the most suspect romance you've ever read in any book. He rescues a vulnerable young lady, but turns out to be a man who fantasises about what he would do to vulnerable young ladies if he could only have met them somewhere else - and he's meant to be the good guy. A dubious character if you ask me, but as war crime romance goes this is probably groundbreaking stuff, although it may never have been done before for good reason: it was extremely corny.Near the end of the book I felt Clancy was far too hasty in narrating the final submarine battle. Earlier in the book he narrated the emotion of horror and loss that military men go through extremely well. However, he inexplicably gives scant time to hundreds of allied soldiers and sailors dying in other incidents.I feel this book would have really captured people's imagination more readily when it was published at the time of the cold war, but it really didn't offer enough to stand the test of time. Despite Clancy's strong points on technical and military procedures, the book seems to be missing the political and public reactions that would have made it worthwhile reading its 800 pages. For me the book is at least 200 pages too long and although it is very strong at times; mostly near the beginning and end, with some air and sea battles in between being the exception, it is also very weak for a good portion and for that reason I cannot justify any more than three stars. If you are purely a technical and military enthusiast you may thrive off of what the book does provide, but if you are not you'll be left feeling there is something missing."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"What a great read - over and over again. Now I transferring my Clancy hard back collection to electronic - but only for early Clancy."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. I have read a lot of military books and this one is the best. I have read \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" and \\"The Sum of all Fears\\" and this one is better that both put together! Can't go wrong with this book. Its exciting all the way thought.Simply put Great Book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book is a door-stopper (830-pages), however its worth it at any price. Its extremely detailed and realistic. While rich in as many details as Sir John Hackets \\"August 1985\\", it is more relate-able and personable. The plot-line with the USAF Met officer and the rag tag group of marines in Iceland behind Soviet lines was a little drawn out, but very believable when compared to such real life characters as Navy Radioman George Tweed who survived on Japanese occupied Guam for four years during WWII.Also Clancy got his high tech wrong in a few places (the F-19 Ghostrider) but it doesn't really effect the story too much.Overall, its a classic of 1980s Military Sci-Fi"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"A must read!

This has got to be the most realistic WW III book ever written. The realizim of the tactics, weapons, and cold war events leading up to hostilities are great. I served in the US Air Force in the intelligence carrer field during the cold war. This novel is as realistic as you can get withour the real thing occuring. Inter mingled with the War are storeis about participants in different parts of the northern hemispher. The Soviet political intreg is edgy. Once you start to read you cant put it down. The places, equipment and mentioned units are real. The details of the story are awesome."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"My son, who HATES to read, actually read this book. While he was in high school. And he loved every single word! For me, there is no higher praise than that."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising begins with a rogue group of Muslim terrorists destroying Russia's most important oil refinery. Remember, this book was written while Russia was still a Communist country, and is still known as the Soviet Union. Russia's Party leaders eventually \\"agree\\" that they must seize oil from the Persian Gulf to keep their economy from falling. But, to draw the NATO forces from the area, they must launch a massive ground and air assault against Germany and other European nations. With this they also plan to put political pressure on these NATO countries. Air supiority is key for all fronts: land and sea. Iceland, as one would guess is an important air and naval base. From the SAMs and torpedos in the Atlantic, the dogfights and bombing runs in the air, and tanks and artillery fire on the once beautiful German landscape, the action never misses a beat in this engrossing page turner that will keep a reader with an intent focus on getting to the next suspenseful battle. Red Storm Rising perfectly mixes character development and explosive action which will make sense to anyone who has heard of the military and WWII. Unlike other Clancy books, this one doesn't focus on one character, instead it has many characters one will come to like and might even admire. None of this book feels stale or terse because no one author has ever attempted to write such a complex book to my knowledge.(This book was written by two people though: Tom Clancy and Larry Bond) If you are a fan of Tom Clancy, this is a must-read, and if you are not I would still whole-heartidly recommend this book as an excellent read. BAR-NONE."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I have just recently re-read this book (the first go around was back in high school, some 15 years ago) and I was once again enthralled by the extremely vivid descriptions and very tense environments created in this book.Red Storm Rising describes a scenario for World War Three, between the Soviet Union and NATO. Keep in mind this was written in the mid 1980's, when the Soviet Union was still alive and kicking. The scenario is very well thought out, well researched and developed, and somewhat plausible. The political machinations of the Soviet Politburo prior to the conflict is described, as are the military preparations and the justifications for starting the war.The character development necessarily must focus on only a small handful of characters in the book, but I did not think that was a detriment, because to flesh out several dozen characters would have made the book 2000 pages long, which I'm sure nobody would be brave enough to read. Of course, if you want to read this book, it's probably because you enjoy books about war in general and understand at least a little bit about tactics and strategy, but if you're looking for an easy to digest read with complex characters, you're going to be disappointed. If you're looking for a taut, suspenseful, well-written thriller, than I definitely recommend this book.Even though it's a long read, it's well worth it."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"The book is a classic...one of my favorite books. I am reading the kindle version, and there are issues with optical character recognition. I becomes '1', 'rm' scans as 'm'. Tons of these issues. It is not hurting my enjoyment of the book, but for $6 plus, you would think that someone would proof the kindle version.Or, another way to put this review is 5 stars for the book, 2 stars for the OCR."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Outstanding; superior to anything in its genre; non stop suspense page after page, and swiftly moves from scene to scene. Clancy did his homework. He has an eye for detail; a realistic and plausible story. It can be hard at times to forget the book is fictitious. No details are missed (I presume). He brings out a wonderful personal look into the characters. Plenty of technical and military jargon. Could this be an accurate portrayal of the Russian: his speech, his actions, the party, the expendability of life?The story takes place near the end of the \\"cold war\\". Wargames: Russia vs NATO; a fictional war in the North Atlantic and Europe. Reluctant to show any economic weakness, Russia decides on war. Detailed battles and maneuvers--capabilities of craft: surface ships, subs, tanks, and planes from both sides of the front. Clancy plays no favorites. I did not realize the potential technological capabilities in the mid 80's.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising is Tom Clancy's mid-1980s vision of how a war between NATO and Warsaw Pact countries might come about and be prosecuted. It was for a while required reading in many major military academies worldwide, and though with the demise of the Soviet Bloc and the new types of conflicts the US now finds itself involved in, it still makes for a fascinating story.Like all of Clancy's novels, this book moves fast. The rapid--and sometimes frequent--scene (not to mention POV) changes jar the mind and keep the senses alert. If the twenty hours this book takes to read aren't the fastest you've ever had awake and sober, you're not paying enough attention to it.The fast pace does create confusion, though. It is often difficult to keep the names straight, especially since they are often so similar to each other (for example, two Russian generals that figure prominently in the story are named Andreyev and Alekseyev). Furthermore, one tends to expect the various subplots to somehow merge together in the end a la \\"Clear and Present Danger\\", but this does not happen--land/air engagements in Iceland and Germany and the naval battle for control of the Atlantic are all resolved at the same point in the book, but as separate parts of the story.Tom Clancy's cheesy sentimentality is also apparent in this book; for instance, his description of a US Air Force officer's falling in love with an Icelandic rape victim he rescued is a bit over-the-top and ungenuine. Clancy tells an excellent story, but episodes such as this make it painful in places.Finally, the book ends rather abruptly. Perhaps this is to be expected, as it comes as one of the participants is stretched almost to its limit, but it still reads as though Clancy had realized that he had a deadline the next day and he had one night to finish it. It's difficult to describe it without giving away the ending; suffice it to say that one would expect the story of the ending of World War III to be told with more drama."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"A wholly possible scenario for World War III without the threat of a nuclear holocaust. Clancy includes many technical military terms that are less known to the general public. Despite the vernacular, the story moves along well. Some parts may become confusing, given the five or more subplots used to tell the tale. A well written stand alone piece by the author of the Ryan series Hunt For Red October and Patriot Games."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is one of my all-time favorites, and had to have it available on my Kindle. I was disappointed to discover that the Kindle edition contains many typographical errors - enough to intrude upon the story. PLEASE, Amazon, work on the quality control!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"The atomic winter of a Socialist militia threatening world domination, the atomic aftermath of the world that once was. But a band of men come together to form an alliance and pushback this plague. For it is no longer a Red Storm Rising, but a Red White and Blue flag rising.Red Storm Rising is a novel about a conventional attack on NATO by the United Socialist Soviet Republic (U.S.S.R.) They first storm through Europe, just as the Nazi's had in many years past, for there is now the fear of world domination once again. They crept ever closer until they came to the Atlantic Ocean near the cost of the United States of America, stopping in a neighboring island of Iceland. This would be a major section for the Soviets to secure for it would be their newest airbase for launching attacks on American Fast Action Groups in the Atlantic and it would be perfect for launching attacks on American Soil.In Iceland, Mike Edwards, an American Air force Meteorologist went to the control tower to make his daily checks on instruments and equipment. As soon as he takes a step away, he hears the alarm that their are inbound bandits. His immediate thoughts are to take action and send out a strike force to stop the incoming bombers. After that's completed he rushes down stairs to Air-Ops to coordinate all of the action. Soon after that, the Soviet attack was a success and he is now stranded on a hill with a field radio and nothing else. What once might have been celebrated more before the break up of the Soviet Union, in a post Cold War world, while it's still enjoyable, is not the same without the threat of the is actually occurring. There are many, many characters in this book including Soviet and American that are very descriptive and important to the story, one can not explain all of them but if you like naval battles and classic military warfare, described as realistically as possible without being their yourself, than you will enjoy this book more than any that have come before it and those to come afterwards."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This novel is really a war game that focuses only on the military side of a possible WWIII scenario. What's missing are the facts of a third world war: the collapsing world economies, the broken alliances, the failed currencies, the disrupted food delivery systems, the millions of refugees in Europe, the panic in the streets, the police crackdowns, the political chaos at home and abroad. Presidents aren't mentioned; diplomatic efforts aren't mentioned. It's all rather clinical. Ships are blown up, planes are hidden behind interesting displays of chaff, subs sneak around each other, and all the characters speak the same, act the same and are one-hundred percent military (except for the occasional Soviet rapist). In this novel, China doesn't take advantage of the situation to invade Taiwan or Japan and absolutely no one thinks of the nuclear option. The Azerbijani terrorists who started the war (out of a private spat with the Soviets in their region) are never mentioned, nor are any of the other Soviet satellite countries, most of which are Islamic republics and, as it turned out, absolutely hated the Soviets. They aren't given any further role in this novel. Clancy gets all the gizmos and hardware right, with some nice surprises. But I felt Clancy wasted a good opportunity to examine the horrors of war, REAL war, and instead focused on the sexy hardware and what it might do if turned loose on the Soviets. This novel read like a giant game of RISK and seemed oddly bloodless by the end."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm reminds me of how Mr. Clancy got to be the highest paid military thriller writer.

However, it does have some aspects of unrealism. The &quot;F-19&quot; never existed. I think he just put it in there to give NATO a fighting chance. Otherwise, the Russians would probably have won, unless NATO used some special trick so that they would win."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I'd admit it. I used to love this book when I was like 13. Now I'm 21. 8 or so years of military amateurism and general maturity growth has changed my view. It is with the latter heart that I write this.First, Clancy's strength - Technical. Superficially, it looks good, but closer looks suggest otherwise. If there's a fuzz zone (particularly common in Cold War texts), it is used for NATO's benefit. Soviet subs have no towed arrays, fighters have no IRSTs, tanks don't have dedicated loaders (autoloading or human) nor ammo that can penetrate early M1s (DU-armored tanks are years in the future). NATO of course has deadly fire control, God's-eye-view, near unjammable Intel assets .... etc. All of it adds up until the real miracle is that the Soviets are advancing at all. This is not only UNrealistic, but does nothing to promote exciting battles where all have a real chance.Tactics. Kinda same as Technical. NATO made maybe 2 \\"real\\" mistakes without being made to pay the full price. The Soviets slowly fritter advantages away, and in contrived ways. Western theory holds that the Soviets lack of initiative will hurt them. Clancy seems to agree. Fine, let's see how it is implemented.1) 3rd Shock Army schedules an attack. The commander of the Western TVD fires 3rd Shock commander for lack of progress. Instead of just sticking to the plan and attacking at the scheduled time, the deputy does not give the call. This is, actually, an act of initiative (though utterly stupid), and of course it buys the Germans a chance to counterattack.2) A Soviet motor-rifle division NEARLY blows a hole through the American lines. An extra regiment is required. The only one close by happens to an OMG unit, and thus unmovable without talking to Moscow. Alekseyev mutters about Soviet inflexibility. This is not Soviet inflexibility, guys. If an American formation was declared out of bounds by the Pentagon, American commanders will be equally forbidden to move it. This is contrived stupidity to delay the attack, allow the Americans to reinforce, and wipe out the rest of the motorized rifle division and the tank regiment.3) A division rushes through a hole in the advance. They fight their way towards bridges. A short-sighted Sov regimental commander calls for artillery to fire ON the bridges to stop the NATO escapees. In Soviet theory, he should only have direct and rapid access to his regimental arty group (a battalion of light howitzers). Soviet centralization should at least stop his stupidity at that level, since the divisional arty would be under divisional control, especially since they have their own fire missions already assigned and executing. But of course, the Soviets CAN'T be given that advantage, so divisional arty drops its own fire missions and fires on the bridge with rockets.This stuff adds up, and the Soviets are defeated. Is anyone shocked?Characterization: Cardboard cutouts. Protagonists are at best one and a half dimensional, goody-goody personalities. Subprotagonists like Sgt Mackall (commander of an Invincible M1 Tank) are maybe zero dimensional. Worst of all, you quickly get the idea they won't die. So much for sympathizing with them.Conclusion: Read this off the library. Then read something like \\"Red Army\\"."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I re-read this one a few months ago and it still kept me glued to the page. Probably the most thoroughly depicted novel of large scale warfare, and a hard look at how close the former USSR and US might have come to a full-on throwdown without resorting to nukes.Some people find the technical and tactical details overwhelming. I don't. For me, they bring the story to life and make it feel all too real.This was Clancy's highwater mark - with some help from Larry Bond."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Clancy's second book - written when he could not use his characters from \\"Hunt for Red October\\" - World War Three scenario."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"i liked this book.it was my first clancy novel.i bought it because of his reputation.also because i'm an ex navy machinist's mate and have heard that he knows his sh%t when it comes to the navy's ships/operation- even shaft alley patrols- stuff like that... i was very impressed and entertained by all the naval action here-espescailly the ASW(i was on IKE)however- i bought THIS book because i thought it would be about the soviet empire overtaking the world--lol-- i would like to see an 'unhappy ending' once in a while. it was a very good read- dont get me wrong, but i was dissapointed in the outcome. i just dont see soviet tank divisions being eaten alive by un-reinforced allied forces,lol. very good book,though-- and i've already started my second clancy novel."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is probably the best novel ever written that speculates about what a conventional war between NATO and the old Soviet Union would have been like, circa 1985 or so. Of course, when the book was written the Soviet Union still existed, and the possibility of such a war was all too real. Despite the changes in the world since that time, this novel is still highly entertaining and interesting, if perhaps somewhat less relevant.Without putting out any spoilers, the plot of the novel is straightforward. The Soviet Union suffers a catastrophic failure of its internal fuel/oil supplies, which its leaders learn will soon bring the Soviet economy to its knees. Rather than deciding to deal with this setback through trade and negotiations, the Soviet leadership, dominated by hard-liners, decides to seize the Middle East oil fields immediately following a blitzkrieg campaign against NATO (to distract NATO from intervening in the Middle East). Therein lies the story.Clancy does an excellent job showing us a scenario of rising tension and the preparations by the Soviets for the surprise attack. His speculations as regards Soviet strategy, while imaginative, are very reasonable and plausible. In fact, supposedly the strategy in this scenario was \\"war-gamed\\" with the superb strategy game \\"Harpoon.\\"Like most Clancy novels, the character development here takes a backseat to the military-political story he is trying to tell, but the novel is fine for all that, and there are in fact some interesting characters in this book. Overall, this book is an interesting and satisfying read, moves along at a brisk pace, and always holds the reader's interest. Without giving anything away, I thought that the ending was very representative of prevailing thought and attitudes prior to the end of the Cold War.By the way, this is one of the few true Clancy novels that is not a \\"Jack Ryan\\" novel. This is not part of the Jack Ryan \\"universe\\" and Ryan is nowhere to be found in this novel.As always, Clancy's depiction and understanding of NATO and Soviet military hardware, strategy, and tactics, is the strength of this book. Even today, this is one to read, and most readers will enjoy reading this one more than once."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This was the best book I ever read.

The &quot;F-19&quot; aspect, even though we all know that such a plane never existed, was still about as accurate as one could have expected the author to be able to do in the mid-'80s due to government security. Great action on land sea (and under it), in the air and in space in a limited way.

The premise is interesting but the execution has problems. The biggest problem is that the story jumps around to many different perspectives. I understand why he's doing it but the result is a disjointed and distracting mess. There are really three main story threads but they could have interplayed better.Also, the whole \\"love-interest\\" angle was pretty lame. Enough said about that.The constant showing off with the technical terms gets old after a while as well, but that seems to be pretty typical for these types of books.I think the author missed an angle that could have made the story more interesting. The whole chemical warfare and/or nuclear angle was underplayed. That could have been developed to increase the conflict in the story.Anyway, RST is an o.k. book. I found myself skipping through the boring parts to get to the main story threads. I know this was only his second book but, still, it could have been better.Not terrible but not recommended."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"The brief review: The first thing that strikes you is the length of the book which weighs in at close to 800 pages. The action picks up from the beginning and very quickly the belligerent sides tear into one another over land, sea, and air. The strengths of the book are the detailed naval and submarine warfare exploits (both shown from American perspectives only). The land warfare is surprisingly weak in comparison, along with a soppy romance story that is given unnecessary exposure. After 700 pages a sudden and unrealistic plot device allows the end of hostilities in a draw.******SPOILERS**********As other reviewers have pointed out, the lack of deployment of tactical nukes is astounding. The Group of Soviet Forces Germany had close to 400,000 soldiers and 5000 tanks stationed in East Germany alone, during the time-frame of 1986 in the book. It is hard to believe that the Warsaw Pact forces streaming into West Germany from Czechoslovakia, Poland, and East Germany would proceed only as far as the Weser river after a month of fighting! Amazingly, there seems to be no hostilities anywhere else in Europe, the Middle East, or Asia.The action set in Iceland drags on and on and should have been cut drastically. The USSR was one of the largest producers of oil in the world and would not have started a war over that. The beginning of the book seems to be inspired by Frederick Forsyth's 'The Devil's Alternative'. There is no mention of Soviet naval activities in the Pacific. Finally, what takes the cake is the overthrow of the Soviet government and takeover of the largest country in the world with a battalion of soldiers!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I'll repeat what surprisingly only a few people have mentioned so far.Unless you're an expert in military lingo and with the different types of military hardware you're going to find yourself lost and disinterested.The first few chapters were actually quite good and laid the groundwork for what I thought would be a good story. The remaining chapters had little connection to this however. The book ended up being nothing more than endless military talk, little character development, tedious descriptions of military and submarine encounters. Even Clancy's much maligned Red Rabbit is far superior to this."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Availability should read: 2-3 months.. Not 10-14 days..I ordered this on Feb 13th and it STILL hasn't shipped yet.

Should be a TV mini-series. Spielberg, are you listening?Best novel regarding the possibility of WW3."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"As with most Tom Clancy books the attention to detail and the complexity of the action story is amazing. At times I felt the many action scenes were a bit repetitive but kodos to Clancy for writing a scary account of how complex and terrible a modern war between heavy weight forces would be. The only clear winners would be the arms dealers and those who make the weapons."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is my favorite work by Tom Clancy (and Larry Bond), I've read it...please don't judge me...38 times since it came out. When I finish a book and don't have another at hand, this is the default go-to time filler. And just so you know, it's not a Jack Ryan novel, but it has equally powerful main characters.The narration is simply brilliant, the technical detail is there of course but not in a cumbersome way. The story MOVES along and there are many plot lines interwoven in just the right way to keep you caring about every damn one of them!Why won't I tell you about the story? Because it's already there by the publisher...scroll up =)The book is too good to ever be a 2 hour movie...get the picture?"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is my favorite Tom Clancy book because the premise is so personal. I served 28 years in the Army with the early years in the Mechanized Infantry and two tours in Germany. The primary focus of much of my life was on exactly the kind of conflict depicted in this book. While the book is comprehensive in its coverage of naval, air, and ground conflict the ground conflict was well done and some of the battle scenes were in places I have been and prepared to fight in.Unlike most of Clancy's writing, this book is not part of any series. It is a stand alone book with no spill over of characters or scenarios. But the characters are richly developed and believable. The ground combat depictions were very believable so I suspect that the air and naval operations were equally realistic.The book actually has multiple sub plots within it as it follows characters and forces from multiple services (and both sides of the conflict) through the war. The interweaving of the sub plots contributes to the big picture overview without being disjointed. As I write about this I am realizing that this is probably one of Clancy's greatest talents, the ability to weave this big picture from small stories and this is perhaps his best example."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This, along with 'Without Remorse\\" has got to be Clancy's best work, right up there with Hunt for red october. If you are a Clancy fan or a first time reader put this one on you're list."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising is a good effort to narrate from multiple points of view the origin, course and resolution of a hypothetical conventional (that is, non-nuclear) war between the U.S. of America and the Soviet Union. Although the characters tend to be a bit flat and some of the effort at emotional writing ends up being a bit stiff (to say the least), the war/military buff (like me) will find in this book exactly what he should be looking for: a well structured description of the conflict and the clash of both superpowers weapons of war based on the doctrines and specifications of the time, which today, about 30 years after the book was written, may be a bit dated but are grounded on essential tactics which remain in use by most military forces. Don't come to this book looking for anything more than a big clash of steel on air, ground and sea and you will be satisfied with the result."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Tom Clancy is a prolific writer and his offerings are almost always entertaining. Red Storm Rising is no exception and I would not have believed that 725 pages could go that fast. Definately a fun read."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Always an excellent book. Have read several times. Each time the book has kept my excitement. A potential classic especially for style."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm Rising is an excellent book, and in my opinion it is Clancy's best. The sheer scope of the book is awesome, and it is something that I've enjoyed re-reading a couple of times. It's obviously not cutting-edge anymore as far as the tech references, but still a great plot and an exciting diversion."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Three Muslim terrorists striking a blow for freedom, destroy the Soviet Union's largest petrochemical plant. What they have done, unknowingly, is fire the first shots in World War III. NATO's forces develop Red Storm - a dazzling master plan of diplomatic subterfuge and intense rearmament. If Red Storm Rising has a problem it's that it starts so quickly that, when the inevitable pause for breath comes, it feels like an anticlimax. However, Clancy picks up the pace again from about page 150 on, and we're back on the roller-coaster ride of suspense and climax. Loads of battle situations, and the last 100 or so pages are amongst the most riveting and exhilarating I have ever read. So many similar but lesser works of fiction are based on taking you to the brink of WWIII, then drawing back... Clancy takes you to the edge, then roaring past it, leaving you in shocked disbelief that it's really happening. But the real genius behind this novel is the way that several different storylines are developed from the start, remining seperate until key points in the novel where they begin to interlock and the book becomes increasingly more difficult to put down! A refreshing departure from the Jack Ryan books."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This was the first Clancy book I read (despite it having been published after &quot;The Hunt For Red October&quot;.It's excellent.It tells the story of World War Three in a way which makes sense of the Cold War. It tells the story of a truly global struggle (some of the action actually takes place in an tiny, insignificant part of the world little-known to U.S.A. and English writers: the Southern Hemisphere)from the perspectives of a few well-written and created characters.Any war is difficult to dramatise, which is why many current writers tend to write more about the machines than the men who operate them - a trap Clancy himself has occasionally fallen into. But in this yarn, he blends the need for technical detail well with the desirability of telling the human story.Of all Clancy's books, &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, &quot;Debt of Honour&quot;, and &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; are the best: and they're all, principally, people stories.Mind you - whenever there's a new Clancy on the shelves, I buy it. Despite all the knockers, he is still the Champ. Don't we all just love to chop down the tall poppies?"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Due to political reasons, the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic decides to initiate a bold offensive against NATO in the intense book titled \\"Red Storm Rising\\". A realistic scenario during the Cold War period unfolds with authentic technology and exceptional writing.Throughout the novel, the reader follows key politicians while the military point of views include all aspects of the armed forces, from naval and air force crew to the foot soldiers. While the air and land combat scenes are powerful, the submarine warfare is the most detailed, reminiscent of Clancy's prior novel, \\"The Hunt for Red October\\".Having a non-military background, it might be difficult to follow some military jargon and acronyms and a glossary for those unfamiliar with the terms would have been excellent. The ending of the book doesn't finish the war well, similar to a movie when the ramifications of crimes against humanity and how characters deal with the success and loss of battles are neglected for the sake of a clean and speedy conclusion.Overall \\"Red Storm Rising\\" is an excellent Tom Clancy novel for any fan of the Cold War genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book shows in a very good fashion how easy a World War III could start. Some terrorists blow up oil wells in Russia, what does Russia do? They decide to steal oil from other countries. Thats a good way to start a war, considering our society is totally based upon oil these days.This has a great plot, but is very drawn out and technical (like most of Clancy's novels...) but is still very good. The book constantly switches between the war and a group of people lost in Iceland. This really makes the suspense nerve racking.This book is very long, and I am not to compelled to re-read it. It is also very technical, and it bothers me at times. Still, it is worthy of 4 stars. I am sure Clancy has better books out, I am reading Patriot Games and it is better already. I do recommend this book to Clancy fans or people who would like a good thriller but don't mind all this techno-blabber."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"'Red Storm Rising' is a remarkable look at a Soviet attack on NATO. Clancy, a master of making the complex understandable, gives a meticulously researched senario in which after an internal crisis, the Soviet leadership decide that thier only recourse is war. As with most Clancy novels, the characters are many and sometimes seem a little one-dimensional, but that hardly detracts from his fast paced story and action filled plot. A must for Clancy fans and a great read for lovers of military fiction."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I began reading Clancy novels at age 14 while stuck at home over the summer. In recent years I've grown tired of Clancy's habit of gratuitously injecting his right-wing opinions (which really slow his books down), his clunkey, tech-laden prose, and his one-dimensional characters. But I still, at age 22, have a fondness for Red Storm Rising.The plot is perfect for Clancy's story-telling skills: WWIII breaks out between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The emphasis is on story and action rather than on character and the story and action are terrific. One gets the sense that this is really how a Cold War WWIII could have been like. Even the ending is somewhat plausible. Excellant work."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"The soviets are back, taking a beating as the bad guys. After theirlargest oil refinery is blown to pieces by terrorists, their planis to first split NATO by attacking Germany and then to seize suppliesin the Gulf area.This loose plot starts the extraordinarily long book (800 pages).Soon Clancy focuses on tactical details and technical descriptionsof conventional warfare on land, the sea and in the air. Withmuch attention to detail, action and reaction of both parties areoutlined. We learn what we've believed for the past decades, that thesoviets have more men and artillery, but that NATO has the technicaladvantage of more sophisticated weaponry.One of my problems with the book is that the stereotypical imagepresented of soviet officers is much reminiscent of the cold war.Then there is the unsatisfying ending. Once NATO overcomes thesoviets' advantage in numbers, we learn that the war has beennothing but a mistake, and both parties pull back their troopsto pre-war lines and act as if nothing has ever happened.Something has happened, but the book shows us a cleanvideogame war -- soldiers push a button and kill a tank,submarine or fighter aircraft without thinking of its crew.Never does the book hint at the civilian desaster behind thefronts, or even the numerous losses of the armies.Yet if you don't mind these deficiencies, it is a recommendable,very thrilling book. The book is long, but the pagesturn fast."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is really the backstory for Larry Bond's and Clancy's Harpoon game. It is also the story of the war that never happened, and better than Sir John Hackett's The Third World War. Carries the military zeitgeist of the 80's perfectly."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"The most complete story he had ever written, You will time and again, finding yourself taking everyones side at some point of anothr,"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This was the first novel I've ever read directly from Tom Clancy. I read Endwar before that, but apparently only his concept and style was taken for that, and someone else actually wrote the story.Reading the story, it begins a brief action scene, then the rest is a slow-burn of tension and details. It's the kind of story I'm sure other people would find tiresome, as at times it reminds one of a textbook. I, however, don't mind reading a textbook if it's an interesting subject, and the subject of this is indeed interesting. Following a conventional war in Europe between the NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries as a backdrop to various personal stories, it includes interesting progression, briefly exciting scenes, and a load of references to hardware which I enjoyed taking time when I wasn't reading it to look up online. Best of all, the story seemed to follow world events as they would likely play out, not as they must play out so something can happen to the characters. By that I mean the characters react to world events rather than having the world revolve around them.All in all an interesting book. The only reason I wouldn't say I loved it was because it can be a bit tiresome to read at points (not a big issue, as I read it before bed) and the loads of characters the book jumps between could be difficult to keep track of. So, it's a good book to get if you are interested in the subject matter (and are grown up, as not only is this a long book at over 600 pages, but it also has some R-rated scenes), and you can find it very cheap these days."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Clancy has always been a mastermind, make no mistake about it. His knowledge shows in his work, and while he may get too technical with some, in the end it usually makes sense. Most people know Clancy through his Jack Ryan books. But just when he was starting the Ryan books, \\"Red Storm Rising\\" reared its ugly head. And what slowly begins with the destruction of an oil facility in the U.S.S.R., churns into a possible hellacious thought process, if you can get your head around it!NATO will soon be under attack in a European game known as World War III. The Politburo is up to what they think they do best. And of course, U.S. Forces get involved! Somebody's havin' themselves an accident, and that accident ain't gonna be pretty when all is said and done.In saying what little I just said, this was really just too good to simply go over all the little details in a simple review. I can't bring myself to attempt such a thing. But I can say that I do recommend what Clancy brought to the table over 20 years ago. It will still get your attention!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Hard to believe Clancy gave up writing one-off's like this and stuck with Ryanverse novels, of which I'm also a fan (not counting the last 2 or 3).This is a GREAT book. If you are even slightly interested in militaria, or just a good suspenseful book, then you cannot go wrong with this one.Is it dated? Sure. Can you get lost in the technical mumbo-jumbo? Name a Clancy book where you can't... Does any of that matter in the least? Not at all!!This was the first of Clancy's books that I read, some 20 years ago, and just re-read it after buying the hardback version here for a song. If anything I appreciate it more now as a 30-something than I did as a highschooler.Buy this book!!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"When Islamic terrorists cripple the Soviet Union with a terrorist attack on an oil-production facility in Nizhnevartovsk, USSR, the Politburo is faced with a difficult choice: Lessen their global influence by conceding weakness and asking for Western assistance, or try something a bit more daring. Naturally, the Soviets choose the latter option in this Tom Clancy novel that could easily have been a forecast for WWIII.The decision made by the Politburo is twofold. First, an attack on Persian Gulf oil fields will provide sufficient power and reserve for their recent losses. Second, a manufactured attack by West Germany provides a smoke-screen large enough to distract NATO and cover the military footprint being inserted in their quest for replacement oil.As with any Clancy novel, the details are do the heavy lifting. The scenario proposed by Clancy provides the former Cold War foe ample opportunities to enact evil, insidious plans that leave no person safe, no topic reserved. When global stakes are at play, he realizes that pawns will ultimately be sacrificed. Thoroughly researched, Red Storm Rising is a master-stroke of realistic strategy that provides a believable amount of depth. The kind of depth that is developed behind closed door war-rooms.AUDIO BOOK SPECIFICS:Too many highs and lows, the quality is not as good as I would have liked. Additionally, the accents used may be genuine and accurate, but they do nothing to aid a listener. The rewind button should be used to hear a favorite portion, not missed dialogue. I recommend reading the book.Jason Elin"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I've read this book a number of times since I got in the mid 1980s. It had been long enough since my last reading of it however, that I kept being reminded/surprised by that happens next.For those of you who don't know this title, it was published in the 1980s, before the fall of the Berlin wall and the end of the Cold War. By the time this book came out the Cold War had been rolling for close to 40 years, and the USA and the USSR had enough nuclear weapons to wipe out humanity several times over.This book provides one author's (Tom Clancy) vision of what war between the Warsaw Pact and NATO might have looked like. It is a masterful military and political action adventure that takes place at political, strategic, and tactical levels of conflict.This is my favorite Tom Clancy novel. He writes in a layered fashion, skipping from one location and set of characters to another. I think that he is the one who made this writing method popular. I like the fact that he keeps the reader up to speed with what's happening simultaneously with several different characters in differnt locations at the same time.Definitely 5 stars for me. Have a great day!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Clancy's version of WWIII in Red Storm Rising is believable and epic. I love the point of view he gives us from both the Soviet and Nato forces too. Great character development allows the reader to admire and even like the Soviet Commander. The story moves around between all the characters from chapter to chapter so you will get the feel of the war effort from a global standpoint. It's a long book....but it never feels as though it drags at all. Love this book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is one of Clancy's very best of all of his novels, one which is most difficult to put down once you begin reading. If only a movie would be produced based on this book.It would need to be a very lengthy movie though, probably six hours or so. Heck of a read worth its weight in gold."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"If you like adventure, you have to read this! The different plot lines are exquisitely wound together to create a fantastic adventure. It has a politics, submarine battles, tank battles, air force battles, it is awesome! And the ending is phenominal!This book is so good that even if you have read it, it is a great book to read again on a long trip. (If you have room in your luggage for only one book, bring this one!)This is the best Tom Clancy novel ever. And Larry Bond should have a credit for this! (The Author's note says \\"Although Larry's name does not appear on the title page, this book is his as much as mine.

Well researched, but relevant to the era it was written in. I just reread it and am still entranced by Clancy's storytelling style."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Though I've never been a supporter of war of any kind, I really enjoyed this book. It was the first Clancy book that I ever read and I have loved his work ever since.The first time I read it was over ten years ago and I liked it so much I have decided to read all of Clancy's books all over again in the order they are to take place.Not being one of the \\"Jack Ryan\\" stories did not take anything away from the entertainment value. It's got thrills, tense situations and plenty of hard battles.I strongly recommend this book to lovers of espionage and action in general."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Argueably the best Clancy novel ever written, \\"RED STORM Rising\\" is probably his most exiting novel (polar opposite of \\"RAINBOW Six\\").An extremely accurate depiction of a modern day Battle of the Atlantic, the novel follows the USSR's Operation RED STORM, a bold plan to conquer Germany, destabalize NATO, and control the oil fields of the Middle East. The ultimate WWIII novel. If you liked this, check out \\"World in Conflict,\\" a 2008 RTS about a Soviet invasion of the US. Avoid Tom Clancy's Endwar at all costs, on the other hand. This book was neither written by Clancy nor has the skill, precision and depth of a real war and not some crappy all flash and no substance we'd expect from Xbox."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm reminds me of how Mr. Clancy got to be the highest paid military thriller writer. The politics are smart, and the battles are hair raising. This book is the master in top form!!!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is classic Clancy at his best. Along with The Hunt for Red October, it stands as one of the best two novels he ever wrote in my opinion.The details of the technology and the tactics associated with 1980's warfare, NATO angainst the WarSaw Pact are astounding. The action is almost non-stop, and the battle scenes riveting and captivating.For anyone wanting to read a great war story that you can't put down, and who wants to see a foretaste of the \\"shock and awe\\" warfare practised by the Unites States today...but practised on both sides when the cold war was at its height...you simply have to read this book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I'm just now wrapping up reading this book for the third time, and it's almost bittersweet to realize how good Clancy was, and how far he's fallen since his best source material, the Cold War, has ended.I'll echo the comments about it being slow to start. You know the book is about a Soviet/NATO war, so getting through the reasons and build-up can be a bit tedious. Then the book is so long that I almost wished it would start wrapping up at the 2/3 mark. But the story itself is very compelling. In true Clancy fashion, you follow the paths of several characters which sometimes cross or affect each other in powerful or subtle ways.Since it was written in 1986, it could have been easy for Clancy to portray all the Russians as evil and/or stupid, but with the exception of the leaders who plunge Europe into war, most of the Russian characters are given sympathetic personalities and are just as intellegent and human as their NATO counterparts. A balanced viewpoint that Clancy has seemingly forgotten how to write lately.The book does suffer a bit from being written nearly 20 years ago. It depends significantly on describing the \\"gee wiz\\" technology being used, much of which is now antique in the high-tech world. So I would occasionally chuckle at some of the descriptions that were meant to be awe-inspiring (like the fact that a sub was transmitting data at half the speed of a 56k modem!!!). I also thought it suffered from the strange problem that, while it has a rather large (and sometimes confusingly so) cast (4 primary Americans, 1 Russian, and probably 2 dozen minor characters), the conflict sometimes seemed more about the equipment rather than the people. Perhaps this was due to the fact that, besides the small party in Iceland, the land war is told from either the perspective of the tanks/APC's or command posts. There's very little written about the tens if not hundreds of thousands of infantry engaged in the war.Still, this is an exceptional book, and an example of Clancy at his sharpest. If only he could still write about characters who are believable instead of the squeaky clean heros that whine nonstop and pure evil villans that do nothing but plot America's downfall."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I read this book when it first came out and was amazed at the perceptive plot and a recent re-reading hasn't changed my view. The characters are well developed and not so simple as the ones in The Hunt for Red October.The early battle scenes are in many ways the best and I enjoyed seeing the US commanders utterly fail in the initial battles of the North Atlantic. The ground assualts are believable esspecially in the way Tom Clancy presents your views as if a participant and seeing only bits and pieces leaving a general feeling of shock at the destruction and yet never undercutting your ability to follow the overall plot.The end of the book is a little too tidy, to fast a wrap up and perhaps even anti-climatic. It is not that is is bad it is just that Clancy writes a realistic ending in the sense that battles often end from mutual exhaustion rather than one side soundly defeating the other. In one place the NATO commander realizes that he has stopped the Russians at last and thinks - Now what do I have left to push them back? The answer is not much. Very realistic.All in all it rates 5 stars. The characters in this book are only matched by the CIA opperative Clark in future books."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"\\"Red Storm Rising\\" is the type of book when after you have read it you know the only person who could of wrote it is Tom Clancy. It is the story of what the United States has spent billions of dollars to avoid: World War III.The story takes place when Russia was known as the U.S.S.R (United Socialist Soviet Republic). The Russian economy is in dire straits and to make matters worst, an Islamic terrorist group destroys one of the U.S.S.R.'s largest oil field and refinery compounds, In which stores almost half the nations oil. Eventually Russia's Party leaders \\"agree\\" that they must seize oil from the Persian Gulf to keep their economy from falling. As a ploy the russians unleash a huge offensive campaign to distract NATO from what its real intentions are. Russia declares war and fights on all fronts. As the Russian offensive presses forward NATO forces find themselves fighting for Germany and most of Europe. Iceland is lost from the allies as a huge soviet invasion takes the island in a decisive attack and the few marines that escape find themselves playing hide and seek with soviet forces. As the NATO front lines in europe drop further and further back a trade off of victories in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans happens as the United States find themselves winning territory from the overwhelming Soviet fleets. Now the Americans must worry about what forces the russians have on Iceland which is in striking distance of America. Slowly NATO lines are brought back to past positions right before a huge Russian Offensive takes them back again. With Casualties raising on both sides each country must take drastic measures.Rather than focusing on one specific character, Tom Clancy tells the story through many characters eyes. giving it a unique touch and enabling the reader to see things from all points of views. Tom Clancy makes the reader feel if you were actually on the front lines, fighting on the battleships or in the cockpit of each fighter. Each word adds up to the suspense and literally leaves the reader breathless. This is a must read!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I gotta say when i first started &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; i was pessimistic. Without Jack Ryan, or John Clark how would it fare? Well &quot;Bob Toland&quot; is almost a carbon copy of Jack Ryan, which i find.. not so good. He\`s an intelligence analyst at the NSA instead of CIA, and even get\`s deployed to a Carrier early on. But this book isnt about character development, i think of it as a spin-off of Clancy work, it concentrattes on the Soviet/NATO war BRILLIANTLY. It was made mid-80\`s so the technology is a little outdated with some things, but he describes the war jumping theatre to theatre just great. Im kind of hoping Clancy write\`s a book like this (or one of his older ones like Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger) in his next book instead of all the polotical stuff like his newer ones. His biggest mistake, IMO, was making Jack Ryan president."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book was one of my first &quot;bigger&quot;, english, reading experience. I would say it's a lexicon of modern warfare, but written as a terrifying novel. In my opinion, the big difficulty of discribing a whole world war as a novel is that the protagonist can act only at one place at the same time, whereas a world war has more important events at the same moment(because of all branches of military service). Tom Clancy solved this problem in an elegant way. He switchs the scene, for instance, from the battleship captian, fighting submarines at the Atlantic, to the fighterwing commander, who stops the first wave of russian bombers heading towards germany, and so on. This style of describing the war leads the reader through various stories, which give you a picture of the whole war."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book does not fit into the usual Tom Clancy Jack Ryan/John Clark series. It is rather a &quot;What If?&quot; story that hypothesizes on how WWIII would have unfolded in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.Due to an internal terrorist act by Muslim fundamentalists, the Soviet Union needs to find new sources of oil. The Politburo decides to invade the Persian Gulf area and seize the oil fields there. But they are afraid the U.S. would be able to marshal the resources to stop such an assault. So the decision is made to &quot;distract&quot; the U.S. and NATO by launching an invasion of Western Europe.The action takes place mostly in Washington D.C., Iceland and the North Atlantic, Germany, and Moscow. Clancy brings his usual attention to detail to this work. The strategy and tactics used by each side, if not textbook, are certainly believable.If you enjoy &quot;What If?&quot; fiction or Clancy's work in general, buy this book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I read this book years ago, and it gripped me all the way through. I read it again recently, and it doesn't really seem anywhere near as good as when I read it the first time. It is still worth a read, though, but I am comparing it to two other similar books, WWIII by Ian Slater, and WWIII by Sir John Hackett.Firstly, the trigger for the war is pretty unconvincing. WWIII by Sir John Hackkett and it was far more convincing. In Sir John's book, it is a large number of seperate incidents that create a momentum of events which bring the two sides to war, much like the start of WWI.Second, there is a bit of military hardware overload. It is very interesting to learn about various systems and equipment, but you just get flooded with it. You need a Jane's manual next to you to imagine whole sections of the book. The absolute worst part is the anti-sub warfare element, which was so boring that I ended up skipping whole paragraphs just to get through it.Third - and I don't think Tom Clancy is the only author guilty of this assumption - Nato wins easily against the Warsaw Pact. I'm sorry, but though the West has an edge in technology, it isn't that great, and even less when you consider how outnumbered NATO forces are in Europe. Clancy is aware of this, and creates a number of handy 'coincidences' which allow NATO forces to prevent potentially devastating attacks. The Warsaw Pact does not get similar 'coincidences' in the book. With only one or two, they would roll right over the thinly stretched NATO forces. There is a book by Ian Slater about WWIII, which feels far more realistic about NATO's chances. In his book, the Warsaw Pact gets lucky on occasion, as much as NATO does.Fourth, the ending is a bit sudden, and unlikely. In the two books I mentioned above, Sir John Hackett's makes the same mistake. Ian Slater's finishes with the war still raging, which is better than trying to fudge an ending to the book.But there is a lot to enjoy. I was glad of the inclusion of the action in Iceland, which was a welcome distraction from the anti-sub related boredom. And you can see why the Warsaw Pact would invade Iceland, so they could ravage the Atlantic convoys. It's a smart bit of stragic thinking out of the box, and far more interesting than the slog in Europe. The love-story is a bit contrived, but forgiveably. And British soldiers do not speak with plummy, 1930's Noel Coward-esque accents. Other than that, well worth a read. With a copy of Jane's next to you."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"The book Red Storm Rising by Tom Clancy is a phenomanol book. It is a book about the Russian government and how they start a war with Germany. One of the main characters is a man named Alekseyev. After the Russians supply of oil is destroyed, the Russian party decides to have Alekseyev lead a war against Germany.On the other side of the war are the Germans and their allies the Americans. As the Americans and Russians send out more submarines to destroy each other the war becomes more heated. One thing fueled the Americans to want to win. If they didn't win they would be killed, and that wasn't what they had in mind.Red Storm Rising is a very good book with danger around every corner. The book will keep you reading for two reasons. One with the battles on land, sea, and air you won't want to put the book down. Second you actually feel as if you are their in the book. There was one challenge when reading this book. There are a lot of Russian names which makes the reading very hard. But if you want a good, suspenseful book you should read Red Storm Rising."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I have read Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising three times. This book is unmatched in its frightening realism and detail. Mr. Clancy's finest piece for all you Clancy fans out there. Red Storm is a large book, encompassing a theoretical world war III between the Soviet Union and the United States. Mr Clancy's extensive knowledge in the areas of submarine as well as political warfare have made this book into a gripping &quot;what could have happened&quot; senario. I recommend this piece of literature to anyone who enjoys reading military based or political based literature. The realism of Red Storm Rising will shock you and make you think of the cold war in a whole new light."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book is down right excellent. If you like military battles this book is for you. There is a new battle every page."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Hunt for Red October made him famous, but Red Storm Rising made Tom Clancy great. The novel is a fascinating scenario that revolves around a 1980s Soviet oil crisis that leads to World War Three. Like his first book there is a large amount of submarine scenes, but RSR goes on to include a detailed air war and ground battles. though some of the plot lines no longer ring true (the F-19), it is still easy to enjoy. The sudden end was odd and it took me a page to figure out what was going on in Moscow, but was satisfactory. I've read many Clancy novels since this book, but it still remains my favorite."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This was the first Clancy book I read, and as far as I am concerned, he is yet to beat it! I'm in the middle of &quot;Executive Orders&quot; and it may, in the end, dethrone RSR, but most likely just meet it.I can only hope that Tom Clancy returns to this sort of hi-tech war novel for us to enjoy."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I first read this book back in 1990, as I had to describe it in french class. I was hooked on Clancy from then on. Since then I've read practically all of his other books, as well as others on the military theme, but when all is said and done, none contain as much realism, clarity, sense and technicality as RSR.Of course Clancy has his faults, his later books, although being excellent, do appear quite &quot;soap-operaish&quot;, each character is &quot;the best in his field&quot; and &quot;all-American&quot; to such an extent that he seems unaware to the fact that other strong military forces exist. eg UK, France etc. Yet RSR does show that it's not only the USA and Soviet Union that would fight WW3.The many small stories that take place around the world makes the book easier to read; they all culminate together in the end to create an overall story which tends to end rather confusingly. There is no big moment of victory, but more a confusion as to when the war ended. The Gulf war was similar, if you remember, there's so much destruction and devastation that nobody is really jubilant, but when the harsh reality of war's aftermath sets in, there's more of a relief that it's over. This book is like that.I loved the way each chapter, and section within began with the date and location, meaning that there wasn't any confusion as to what was happening.Of course today you have to read the book as though it is (and was) set in the late eighties. We know today that the Cold War is over, we didn't then. The F-19 wasn't brought into service, but rather the F-117. Warfare techniques today have even come along in leaps and bounds, so that if RSR was written today, there would be noticeable differences. It belongs in the eighties, but that's not a bad thing. Most of us can still relate to the feeling back then about the West and East.RSR summed this up perfectly.After all this time, I must have read RSR at least seven times, and each time I see something I missed before. It's not as ! if we didn't know the ending, it's more about how we get there, this is why it can be read over and over."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"RSR clearly excels, even without the beloved Jack Ryan. Wonderfully accurate battle scenarios, and the romance on Iceland, although perhaps not up to the standards of Danielle Steele, provides a touch of humanity to the hardcore military and political themes. I would recommend this book to most people, but military nuts (like myself) would enjoy it most."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I found this book having the affect of a magnet on iron to my eyes. I simply could not put the book down. From page one to 724. This book defines the Technothriller genre. I gave it a 9 because I feel nothing is perfect and because it was easy to get lost in some spots with so many characters to keep track of. All in All, a great read for Clancy fans and newbies to him and/or the genre!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Never before has a book with the subject of something as terrible as war been so fun to read about. I got the chills when I read this book. It was so real and near and yet it seemd so far away. Tom Clancy is a excellent writter and this was the first book I have read by him. It was amazing, I must have gotten through it in a week. You have to be fairly in to the military part before you read it though. The Russian are short on oil and plan to attack NATO and the Middle East to get some back. A dramatic and sometimes funny book. Two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"A 10 if you like stories about war. A real page turner. As the story unfolds it stays at a pretty high suspense level, so it might be a little taxing on one's nerves to read it. Some statements about Germany are false for the 1980-s, they are more from the 70-s or even earlier, but that argument is more for nitpickers than anyone else.What struck me odd was the complete absence of any references towards insubordination and desertion of forces on both sides. OK, you can't desert on a ship, but on the ground it's another matter.The 'White Knight' part was a little out of place, though it counterweighted the hardware stuff nicely.Just replace any references to the F-19 with the F-117. I remember the plastic models of the F-19 sold at hobby stores 'till the early 90-s, and the F-117 to appear only shortly after Desert Shield.All in all it's a pretty good book, though by far not high literature. It's pretty long, too."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"this is one of Clancy's best books. The senerio is possible and the plot is brilliant. The American , Russian and British forces and weapons are spectacular."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I feel that Tom Clancy's &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; is one of the best novels ever written. It gives great detail of real wartime scenarios and the dialogue is quite believable. However, the whole idea of Russia, or the USSR in this case, would make such a foolish power play is absurd. One, they wouldn't stand a chance against American air superiority. Also, Russia's government is in such disarray, the offensive would probably fall apart before it began."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Red Storm rising, by Tom Clancy, was a superb book.

Everything from the Russian experience to the intelligence gathering, you are in the loop and feel like your a part of it. Having been stationed in Iceland, his portrayal of the take-over was very detailed. I could picture every move and it made me remember a great assignment. I couldn't put this masterpiece down!!!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"First off, I think Chris Mumby needs to realize a few points. Tom Clancy's work are fiction that are sometimes based off the truth with a little stretching of the imagination to make the story better. I read Red Storm Rising when I was 15 for a Western Civilization class I had in high school and ever since then I cannot wait until his newest book comes out, be it one of the Ryan/Clark line or the new Op-Center series. Back when Red Storm was written, the Russian Mafia was not as big of an influence as it today in the CIS. Furthermore, as a member of the military, it is true that I can read some of these novels and know that the information is totally wrong. How do I know this, because I have actually been there in some of the situations? The military is nothing like they show it in the movies and Tom Clancy does superb job in portraying what we do to protect the USA!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Fantastic detail and realism. The Godfather of technothrillers"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Tom Clancy differs from reality in a small way as far as the weapons of war are concerned. In the stealth jet parts of the story, his description of what would have happened is not entirely accurate. The stealth fighter as we know it was operational and in service during the story's time-frame. No stealth planes would have been shot down and it would have been more effective. However, Mr. Clancy can be forgiven because the project was labeled TOP SECRET at the time. Considering the fact that the existance of the plane was only a rumor at the time, the inclusion of the plane alone is rather surprising. Also, I was surprised by the fact that he said the plane was developed in by Lockheed. He was right on the nose on that one. I think I know why Mr. Clancy described the physical characteristics of the plane like he did. Around that time, a company took a model of the SR-71 Blackbird's, added engines, and called it the F-19, America's stealth plane. The head of the Skunk Works took some heat for that supposed leak. Mr. Clancy probably thought that the F-19 was really the stealth plane. Besides that minor detail, the book was accurate and very good. I particularly like Mr. Clancy's style of telling the story from different characters' perspectives. The ending was also surprising and brillant. The beginning of the book was not the type that I would expect, but it was a great one. On the whole, it was a great war epic that inclued almost every facet of war."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Absolutely one of the best books I have ever read. Non stop action and never wanted the book to end. I have read a few of the reviews and one in particular, Chris Mumby's, struck me as someone who needs to learn how to write intelligently before he reviews a book. Maybe wait ten years and then read the book again besides. This was the book that launched me into reading Clancy's other novels. You won't be disappointed. I highly recommend &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; to anyone interested in genre of WWW3 books."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This is the second book by Tom Clancy that I started reading and almost put it down too. The first few pages of Soviet politics were dificult to wade through. I kept on reading and the story started to make more sense and the action picked up. I liked how the book showed the NATO-Soviet war from both sides and the details made the story believeable to me."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I have read several of clancy's books and this one blew me away I would recomened it to anyone who enjoys a book involing sub warfare high tech battles and a in depth plot line."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Book ReviewTom Clancy's Red Storm Rising published by Berkley Publishing Group in 1986 is 725 pages long and is suspenseful novel. This book deals with the cold war turning into a world war.The book starts off with a terrorist attack that forces the war. Then it takes a while for the war to swing into full gear. The war is told from multiple characters around the globe so you can experience the war more fully. The protagonists are the NATO countries while the Soviet Union is the antagonist. This book covers the entire war and the war constantly swings in favor of one side. Also political factors are dealt with along with economic and obviously militaristic factors making this book as real as you can get to a war simulation. Who will win? Read to find out!This book uses a lot of military vocabulary during the battles so you should have some knowledge of the military. Even though this book is amazingly realistic it is a longer read. I loved the strategic view by the generals. The fights that occur like at Iceland are written extremely well. Red Storm Rising is hard to put down. This book is a classic.I strongly recommend reading this book. It is one of the best books I've read. READ IT!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Following shortly after an extremist attack on a soviet oil field, Russian political forces have to make a choice: try to repair a lost oil well or take oil by force? When a young comrade General suggests the invasion of the Middle East for oil procedures that could start the third world war commence. The soviet actions force NATO to scramble to defend two fronts. If a wide scale Soviet invasion happens it would mean defending the pacific coast of the U.S. and the eastern front of Germany.The main characters in the novel are the promising soviet general Alekseyev, the new U.S. naval captain know as Morris, Bob Toland a U.S. satellite operator, and the skipper John Edwards. Alekseyev is a thirty-year-old Russian who is in charge of making the plan and granting all the actions of the possible invasion. Morris is a young captain who is in command of the U.S.S. Pharris, which is patrolling the Atlantic sea border of Europe. Bob Toland is a 40-year-old satellite operative that is watching for any Russian advances by Russian forces. John Edwards is a NATO spy working deep undercover in Iceland. Together these characters shape the events that very well may lead to a third world war.One of the more impressive things about this novel is how real the setting is. The attention that Clancy pays to detail is superb. There are many times midway through the novel were I could see the places he was describing in my head.I hope that this review has been written I such a way that you the reader are inclined to read this and other titles from Clancy. It truly is a splendid book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"A look into a very possible future is what this is all about. The idea of Muslim terrorists operating in &quot;the former Soviet Union&quot; is a reality - not a possibility. The notion of ethnic problems is also a reality. And the possibility of parts of the former Soviet military rising and acting independently is a nightmare waiting to happen.As usual, Clancy deals with international capitals, intelligence gathering, detail-packed war plans and battles as well as all the political ramifications. The battlefield shifts across huge areas but throughout, he keeps the story unified without bulging apart at the seams.The real problem is that Russia extremely weak economically, politically and militarily but still has lots of deadly hardware just waiting for an owner. The Iceland scenario was really daring if not exactly plausible. Oil and resources will continue to cause problems in the future. Great personalities / great battle scenes. Vintage Clancy."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book is , I believe, destined to become an American classic. It is certainly Clancy's best, even topping &quot;Debt of Honor&quot; and &quot;Executive Orders&quot;. From beginning to end, this book is unbelievably thrilling. The story is excellent, and doesn't focus on one particular character, but instead devotes an even amount of time to several. Because of this, this may be the one book Clancy wrote where his notorious excessive detailing actually paid off, and made the story even more interesting and thrilling. Clancy also proves he knows what he's talking about when it comes to military tactics and strategy. The buildup prior to the conflict is also intensly thrilling and very realistic, as is the whole story. It has long been difficult for people to imagine what a conflict between NATO and the Warsaw Pact would have truly looked like. This book is probably the closest glimpse we'll ever have of the war that never was. Highly recomended."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book is amazing in scope, depth, and detail. Just the logistics alone of writing a war between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. seemed like an impossible task, but Clancy managed to pull it off brilliantly. This book is a page turner. Military buffs will love the detail and dissection of the military strategies and tech info on all sorts of equipment.Even though 'Hunt For Red October' was made into a hit movie, I've always felt that THIS is the book that should have been made into an epic film.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"Overall this is the first tour de force for Clancy. He really stated he could map out a large, detailed story and bring it down to the characters in the book. He always does a great job of running a number of sub plots through out the whole book and meeting them up at the end. That is always one of the fun things with one of his books, trying to determine ahead of time how the richly described characters are going to play off of one another for a great climax. The only reason I am not going to give this 5 is that I thought the end of the conflict was rushed."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"A great book. The book kept me wondering a little since it never left the European battlefields. I constantly wondered if the other countries of the Warsaw Pact were also fighting with Russia, and how did China and other countries of the world think about the war. Tom Clancy also needs to work on describing the characters' uniforms and arms. Other than these complaints it was a great book."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"I got this book for Christmas this year and as soon as i opened it up i was hooked! I read it from cover to cover in less than 2 days and i was definitely satisfied with it. Unlike most other Clancy novels, which are mostly political, Red Storm Rising ditches most of the politics and gets straight down to what Clancy does best: action. the book is crammed full of fast paced action that leaves the reader in suspense. if you are looking for more clancy or think clancy is a good action writer but his political ramblings are subpar, get this today. you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This was the first Clancy novel I had ever read - and to this day remains my favorite. He weaves an enthralling tale of the &quot;Third World War&quot;, with all of the drama and techno-fetishist's fare we fans expect from his novels.As always his characters are more archetype than real - but they are always enjoyable, if not always believable.No fan of thrillers or modern war novels will be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Red Storm Rising","review":"This book has a great beginning, but it is more like a naval operations technical manual than a novel. Some of it is hard to follow for us laymen, and the ending is quite predictable. This book is not a part of the Jack Ryan series. This is a stand alone book. That is what makes this book interesting to me. But again, it was hard to follow because I am not familiar with military operations, weapons, and equipment. This one is for hardcore Clancy fans, submarine fans, and military afficiandos."},{"Title":"The Rise of the Right","review":"This is an amazing history of the Conservative movement in America from it's founding in the early 1950's to the present. William Rusher was the leader of a group of 15 men from around the country who met in a log cabin in the snowy winter in Wisconsin to create a network of conservative leaders who would work together to eventually nominate Barry Goldwater as the Republican nominee for President of the United States in 1964. This book chronicles the humble beginnings of the Conservative movement in the 1950's to the ideological triumph of the election of Ronald Reagan as President. William Rusher was the publisher of National Review for 31 years"},{"Title":"The Rise of the Right","review":"William A. Rusher's \\"Rise of the Right\\" is a fascinating insider look at the rise to prominence of \\"the conservative movement\\" as many Americans understood it in the years from Goldwater to Reagan. The long-time publisher of National Review, Rusher was one of the key forces behind the Draft Goldwater movement in the early '60s, and the Goldwater era occupies about a third of the book. From there, Rusher was also close to the early Reagan campaigns (1968 and '76), and many of the other key moments in the growth of conservatism as generally understood.As Rusher notes in his Introduction, his emphasis is on \\"the rise of the right\\" as a *political* movement -- as opposed to an intellectual/philosophical one. That ground, Rusher notes, was \\"ably described' in George Nash's 1976 work,The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America Since 1945.\\" As a result, Rusher doesn't spend a lot of time arguing the fine points of conservative doctrine. Instead, he takes us on a backroom tour of political campaign activism. I found this book an exciting read. Any political junkie, regardless of party affiliation, will probably get a kick out of some of the episodes recounted here.I first read this book around 1987, when I was a devoted Reaganite and a loyal reader of National Review. Rusher opened my eyes to the diversity of the conservative movement -- particularly the three main strands he identifies as the dominant forces in conservatism in the Cold War era: the Big Business types, the anti-communists, and what we would today call the Religious Right. I learned an awful lot reading this.However, I subsequently learned that Rusher wasn't telling me the whole story after all. The \\"Right\\" he describes here, while certainly the most visible subset of conservatism, isn't the whole story. It turns out that conservatism wasn't as discredited or moribund in the pre-Goldwater years as Rusher suggests -- though what we might call the \\"Buckleyite\\" wing Rusher belongs to has always tried to claim that it was. Though I would still recommend this book, I would encourage you to read it in context with, for example, Paul Gottfried'sThe Conservative Movement (Social Movements Past and Present)or Justin Raimondo'sReclaiming the American Right: The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement (Background: Essential Texts for the Conservative Mind). Rusher tells his story well, but it's still only part of the larger picture."},{"Title":"Communities of Practice: A Guide For Your Journey to Knowledge Management Best Practices (Passport to Success, 1)","review":"&quot;Communities of Practice&quot; is part of a series that introduces topics in continuous improvement.

I like them so much I've bought these packs to split them up and use as gifts."},{"Title":"The Power of Praying: Help for a Woman's Journey Through Life","review":"I have many books by Stormie and they have helped me and I have given her books away to help other women. Stormie's books are about the truth of God's Word and His ways in all types of situations we all may find ourselves in. Her testimonies are helpful because we come to know that we are not alone in our circumstance. I have met Stormie and heard her testimony, she is a delight and very giving of herself."},{"Title":"The Power of Praying: Help for a Woman's Journey Through Life","review":"I read \\"The Power of a Praying Woman\\" and loved it. When I finished it, I wanted to read \\"power of a praying wife\\" next and knew I was going to get \\"power of a praying husband\\" for my husband for Christmas. That's when I realized it was very smart to get the collection. I basically got one of the 4 books free and am able to give the one I have already read away as a gift. It would also make a great gift to give all 4 together, as they do come in a nice box, but I decided to split it up, so I could keep a couple and give a ocuple away. The item arrived very quickly (2 days after purchase) and in great, brand new condition. If you're thinking of buying 2 of the books anyway, I really recommend getting the collection - it's worth the extra few dollars to get 2 more of Stormie's books."},{"Title":"The Power of Praying: Help for a Woman's Journey Through Life","review":"If everyone understood the power behind prayer we would turn to it first rather than as a final and desperate last resort! These books will pave a future of blessings, hope and security! I wish everyone had a copy, and would read them!"},{"Title":"The Power of Praying: Help for a Woman's Journey Through Life","review":"Stormie makes you really think about how and what you are praying- the praying parent is a wonderful baby shower gift and praying wife/husband makes you really adjust your thought process when dealing with your spouse- if you really use these books life becomes so much more!"},{"Title":"The Power of Praying: Help for a Woman's Journey Through Life","review":"I graduated from highschool in 2004 and recieved this book from a good friend.

Marriage is work, this helps make that work a little easier."},{"Title":"The Power of Praying: Help for a Woman's Journey Through Life","review":"This collection was just what was I was looking for. After recently reading one of them from the library I saw the value in having each of these and not just reading each book once, but returning to them time and again. The chapter's are usually short and easy to pick up on where you left off (espeically for busy women) and while you want to read them each all the way through it's easy to pick a chapter that's appealing to meditate on and inspire/jump start your prayer time. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Berenstain Bears and the Missing Honey (First Time Reader Series)","review":"Missing Honey is not a good book to teach young children about the importance of being honest, and trust worthy.

You should read it yourselves and find out."},{"Title":"Berenstain Bears and the Missing Honey (First Time Reader Series)","review":"The Berenstain bear books are my three year old daughter's favorite books. We started with Visit the Dentist and Visit the Doctor, bought at used book sale from local library, and have slowly added to her collection. In the beginning I didn't realize some of the books are rhyming books geared towards a younger audience, and some are longer stories told with a lesson on manners, getting along, not being afraid of the dark, etc. We probably had twenty of the longer books before I discovered there were these simple little rhyming books. A few of them remind us of her Dr. Suess books. This Missing Honey book is a simple little book full of easy rhyme, and is funny. It is similar to the Missing Dinosaur bone (another favorite of my daughter's). We read it for the first time last night at bedtime (where we always read four Bear books). My daughter had me read it twice, she loved it so much. I highly recommend this one to the younger Berenstain bear fans."},{"Title":"Berenstain Bears and the Missing Honey (First Time Reader Series)","review":"The rhyming is annoying. The message is good.

I can not believe that it has been over 20 years since it's frist release and I regret so much that I wasn't around to see it's opening, but this book has allowed me the chance to do just that. I live in london so I do not get the chance to get hardly any memorbillias of the movie and I wish I could but so far all I have managed to get are two copies of the movie the 2 sound tracks, the songs score and this book it is such a shame that this country does not allow Grease fans the chance to endulge on such a great movies. I have read all the reviews and can't help but feel jelaus at the thing that people have mangaed to get about the movie like the trivia book I wish this were possible for me. i have asked every where and no one seems to know of it. But this book has made up for it and I never get tired of it. I have even managed to get my 6 year old neice in to it.

There are lots of cool photos, although they're in black &amp; white which is pretty disappointing. There are maybe a page or two towards the end, which are colour photos, but the black &amp; white photos don't seem too clear for some reason.There's not much reading to do either, and it took much about an hour to read right the way through. Didi Conn (Frenchy) was the perfect person to write a book about Grease. Whether she's babbling on about how drop dead gorgeous John Travolta, or that the actors were only a &quot;little bit older&quot; than the characters they were playing, she does it in such a bubbly way that you smile right the way through.This is a terrific book, and well worth hunting it out on Ebay, or buying it used from Amazon. Mine was brand new, and managed to entertain me for a morning. But you have to be a serious fan of Grease. There is not a lot of new information, but the pictures are well worth it."},{"Title":"Frenchy's Grease Scrapbook: We'll Always Be Together","review":"My son really got into the movie while performing in a local stage production of Grease. We got this book, and he read it cover to cover several times. He was fascinated by the \\"behind the scenes\\" information, as well as the \\"then and now\\" (now up to the time of writing, of course) pictures and stories about the stars of the movie. Fans of the movie will find a great deal of interesting information. On a personal note, my son wrote a note to Mrs. Conn regarding his performing in a stage version of Grease, and she replied back nearly immediately with friendly encouragement, as well as a great deal of specific information that let my then 8 year old son know that she had really read his note carefully.

I had Grease Jeans, Fotonovel, Regular Novel, and of course the Album. My biggest regret was not getting &quot;The Grease Photo Album&quot; with John Travolta &amp; Olivia Newton-John on the cover. However, this Scrapbook more than makes up for the loss of not getting the &quot;Photo Album&quot; where you get insights about everything from the relationships between the cast members, the writers and producers and most of all, how they are doing twenty years later. It's also refreshing to know that although, John, Olivia, &amp; Jeff Conaway had their share of problems personally &amp; professionally they managed to conquer them which is an inspiration to so many folks.I would definetely recommend this to any die-hard Grease Fan."},{"Title":"Frenchy's Grease Scrapbook: We'll Always Be Together","review":"This book is very informative and interesting.I loved it.It tells you about the broadway play,then tells how it became a movie.It even covers the auditions of actors to the filming.It has alot of pictures and facts on the cast and crew.It even has a section telling you what they are doing now 20 years later.I recommend it for any Grease Fans."},{"Title":"Frenchy's Grease Scrapbook: We'll Always Be Together","review":"If you love the movie Grease this is a book you have to have.

Most interesting is her behind-the-scenes info on everything from famous scenes from the movie(like the \\"Greased Lightning\\" musical segment) to the premiere of the film. Some of her interviews with the stars are insightful and some of the photos are OK. But Conn should have perhaps hired a ghost writer as her style is a bit weak. Also, it would be nice if there were more color photos in here as well.

A man returns to life on Earth as a dog...trying desperately to adjust to his new life, he is constantly beset by confusing flashbacks to his former life as a man. Why is he one of the few who remember? And should he go back home to find his human family? These questions and more are answered in \\"Fluke.\\"I've read this book many times and still find it fascinating; it's written simply but beautifully, in language anyone can appreciate fully. The author obviously has a vivid mind and understands how the world looks through a dog's eyes; or perhaps he has been a dog in past lives. I know that I have.

Not scary, not clever, not his best work. I'm a huge King fan but this was terrible (worse even than From a Buick 8).Dare I say, he's retiring just in time. The idea well is dry."},{"Title":"The Man in the Black Suit: 4 Dark Tales","review":"The first story \\"The Man In The Black Suit\\" tells a dark edged tale laced with grief and centers around a young boy and his fear of losing his Mom. Out fishing one day a boy has a run-in with the devil who attempts to take advantage of his fear. It manages to be creepy, funny, and heartbreaking and the characters come to vivid life. This is a story I'll be rereading before passing along.Next up is &quot;All That You Love Will Be Carried Away&quot; about a suicidal traveling salesman with a quirky habit of collecting little snippets of bathroom graffiti in a notebook. As he contemplates suicide and the trauma it (and the discovery of his odd collection) will have on his wife and young daughter (he has no clue . . .) he reviews his favorites for what may or may not be the last time. This was a downright gloomy story filled with despair and near hopelessness about a lonely life spent on the road. There's an itsy bitsy glimmer of hope at the very end and the emotion felt very real but I wish I hadn't \\"read\\" this one in such an intimate format. I can deal with gloominess, darkness and all the grossness you can splatter at me but a suicidal father is something I never, ever wish to read about if I can avoid it.\\"The Death of Jack Hamilton\\" takes a step back in time. It's all about a gang of bank robbers, one who is gravely wounded, running from the law. I'm not a big fan of this sort of thing but King's writing voice managed to hold my attention. His characters are full of color and wit even when facing down death. It's also very gruesome. It's a good thing I have a cast iron stomach because I not so brilliantly insisted upon listening to the bullet removal scene while eating lunch. Ewww. . .The final story, \\"You Can Only Say What It Is in French \\", features a long-time married couple on their way to their second honeymoon. While traveling, the wife has an odd sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and \\"sees\\" some disturbing images. She knows bad things are going to happen to her husband. She's seen his glasses melt right into his face (amongst other gruesome images). She also knows she can prevent \`em if she changes but one thing in their routine but, for reasons that are explained later on, isn't compelled to do so. As the story begins she appears to adore her husband, who has given her riches beyond her greatest expectation and seems to have been a decent guy during their time together but as the story progresses it turns out he's done some not-so-nice things along the way. He's also the reason why she feels she is doomed to burn forever in hell if those Christian School teachers of her past have their way. This was entertaining but slightly predictable."},{"Title":"The Man in the Black Suit: 4 Dark Tales","review":"Stephen King is writing novels, and in this case short stories that are supposed to be read in the night to put yourself to sleep with a pair of nightmares as fodder of your soul. But here they are read, and it is different. Quite different indeed because the visual reading we are used to is replaced by hearing the reading of the tale by someone else. You become in other words inactive. And the reading by the actor simplifies the text and reduces it to one possible interpretation, whereas your own reading might open more doors. So you have to follow the reader. At times it even brings up readings you may not have thought of at all. For instance, the fourth tale, That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is In French read by Becky Ann Baker brings up that the d&eacute;j&agrave; vu feeling comes from the fact it is a second honeymoon and a second honeymoon has to be deja vu . Hence the hell or purgatory the text speaks of becomes that second honeymoon and not at all the hell or purgatory that might follow death. The tale becomes then very strong in the idea that you must never take second helpings, especially when the first one had been good. The second one can only be second grade. So try to listen to these tales and you will enjoy them as much as I did but in a quite different way you had enjoyed your own reading of them as printed on paper."},{"Title":"The Man in the Black Suit: 4 Dark Tales","review":"Stephen King's \`The Man in the Black Suit' is a collection of 4 short stories from his book \`Everything\`s Eventual\`. As with all Stephen King audio books, these stories are unabridged.The first story, \`The Man in the Black Suit\`, tells the tale from an elder man's perspective of his encounter with the devil when he was a young child. The story is well told. At 9 years of age, he sets out on a fishing trip by himself, John Cullum does wonderful voice work in this audio book.The second story, \`All That You Love Will Be Carried Away\`, is about a traveling salesman by the name of Alfie. Alfie is a man obsessed with the graffiti he reads in rest area bathroom stalls. Much of the story is poems you would find there. At times it seems as if this work may be Stephen King's excuse to show off his prowess in these toilet poems. The story premise is of a man's world as he contemplates his final thoughts on his upcoming motel room suicide and how it will reflect on him and his loved ones.The third story, and perhaps the most engaging one, is about John Dillinger and his friend, Jack Hamilton. In \`The Death of Jack Hamilton', Dillinger and his gang are on the run from the FBI, when Jack Hamilton is shot and wounded. What follows is the continued adventure of their attempted escape and nurturing of Dillinger's close friend, Jack, in his final days. I am not sure how historically accurate the story is, or whether the author intended it to be, but the story does a good job with it's entertaining details.The fourth story was one I had trouble with. While the story telling was good, it still disappointed. Carol and Bill are on their way to their second honeymoon. Carol encounters an incredible amount of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu's. It builds up well, and has promise, but it never really goes anywhere.Overall, these short stories are simply OK. They are well written, and well read, but they lack some of the meat of the story I expect from Stephen King."},{"Title":"The Man in the Black Suit: 4 Dark Tales","review":"First, a few words about each of the four different stories.\\"The Man in the Black Suit\\" - 3 starsThis is a story about a 9-year-old boy who meets the Devil himself. It's a very scary experience for the boy, especially because his older brother died the year before and now the Devil tells him that his mother has just died in the same way.This is the weakest of the four stories because the Devil, although being scary, doesn't really come across as a serious threat. What kind of second-rate Devil is it that can't even catch a boy who decides to run away from him?In \\"Everything's Eventual\\" Stephen King writes that this story won a prestigious \\"best short story\\" award in 1996, much to his surprise. That surprises me too, because in my opinion this story is not that great.\\"All That You Love Will Be Carried Away\\" - 5 starsThis is the shortest story (only 35 minutes) and one of the two best ones in this collection. Alfie Zimmer is a traveling salesman in the American Midwest. He has an amazing hobby and he's tired of life. But if he commits suicide, what will everyone think of his hobby?What makes this story so good are the very detailed and evocative descriptions of the conditions under which a traveling salesman lives. Alfie's strange hobby is also captivating, as are the descriptions of the landscape and isolated towns in the bleak and barren Midwest.In \\"Everything's Eventual\\" Stephen King admits that Alfie's strange hobby was actually something he did himself!\\"The Death of Jack Hamilton\\" - 4 starsThis is a very unusual story for Stephen King. It tells a \\"mythical\\" story about the 1934 death of Jack Hamilton, member of the John Dillinger gang. Homer Van Meter, another gang member, purportedly tells the story.John Dillinger, Jack Hamilton and Homer Van Meter were all real people. You can find a lot of interesting background information about them by doing an Internet search for John Dillinger.Despite the fact that these were all ruthless gangsters we find ourselves sympathizing with them. Stephen King's approach to the story is that gangsters are also human beings. The slow death of Jack Hamilton and the efforts of John Dillinger to get him medical help and Dillinger's distress as Jack Hamilton's condition worsens are powerful images.\\"That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French\\" - 5 starsThis is the best story in the collection. Carol was brought up as a strict Catholic, but then, during the first years of her marriage to Bill, she had an abortion. Now she and Bill are supposed to be celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary and Carol is being subjected to a horrendous punishment for what she did.What makes the story fascinating is that it is not God who is punishing Carol. No, it is Carol, under the influence of her Catholic upbringing, who has prescribed her own punishment. And this punishment Carol is inflicting on herself is much worse than a benevolent God would come up with, even assuming that God considers what Carol did to be wrong.In summary, two very good stories, one good one, and one that's just OK.The four stories are read by four different professional readers. The total running time is approx. 3 hours 40 minutes, not 4 hours as specified on the packaging.All four of these stories are included in the book \\"Everything's Eventual\\", along with 10 other short stories by Stephen King. If you want to save money or if you dislike audio books then \\"Everything's Eventual\\" is a better deal.Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"The Man in the Black Suit: 4 Dark Tales","review":"bought this one in audio book form and truly enjoy listening to it as I drive to work but I won't listen to it when I'm driving alone at night :-)"},{"Title":"The Man in the Black Suit: 4 Dark Tales","review":"These stories were leftover from the book edition of \\"Everything's Eventual\\" that didn't make it onto the lengthy audio version. The stories themselves are quite good, but the audio narration isn't the best. \\"The Man in the Black Suit\\" refers to Death here, not Walter from the Dark Tower books. Then again, you never quite know with Stephen King.My suggestion is to buy \\"Everything's Eventual\\" and read all of the stories. If you really don't have the time, get the audio version along with this CD. It will take up a good 12-14 hours of driving time!"},{"Title":"The Man in the Black Suit: 4 Dark Tales","review":"The audio version of this is on 4 CDs, so it's a quick \\"read.\\" It's well-produced, and voice casting is super. (You'll perhaps recognize Doctor Green's dad from the TV show \\"E.R.\\" - same guy from \\"Northern Exposure\\" [no kids, that's NOT a reality show!]).In terms of the stories, I think the man in the dark suit is an absolute winner, and as the first it provides the thrust to keep you interested in the other 3, which aren't as likely to induce palpitations, but they're quite dramatic nonetheless. There's the sad tale of the salesman, which strikes me as a classic short story. Then there's the story of the worst case of deja vu ever. This one was a bit confusing because of the repetition of the diction - I thought my audioplayer was on shuffle all the time, and was thusly distracted. I can't remember the last story, so...there you go.Very enjoyable, but I love the short story too! I look forward to finding more Stephen King short stories so I can consume them in short order!"},{"Title":"The Man in the Black Suit: 4 Dark Tales","review":"This intriguing little collection of short stories is fun, but not my favorite of King's work. In the title story of this small collection, a young boy runs into the devil on a fishing trip. Pretty far-fetched, but King has the knack to make it seem real. The three other stories are a little less outrageous and deal with more mundane subjects. As always, the King character development skills are in full bloom here, but the plots of these stories don't have the usual twists and turns, and are more predictable. The narrators are excellent storytellers who add a lot to the interpretation of the stories."},{"Title":"The Man in the Black Suit: 4 Dark Tales","review":"Heard THE MAN IN THE BLACK SUIT, four unabridged short storiesby Stephen King.Although I've liked some of the movies that have been madeout of King's work, I've never actually read (or listened to) verymuch by him until this collection . . . and now, having spentseveral hours listening to these tales, I'm not sure I wantto read too much more by this acclaimed author.The very first story, \\"The Man in the Black Suit,\\" just didn'tdo anything for me . . . its' about a suicidal father, which to beginwith, is not one of my favorite topics . . . overall, it was a gloomybeginning to what followed.Only one story kept my attention: \\"The Death of Jack Hamilton\\" . . . itis about John Dillinger and Hamilton, his friend, over the last daysof the latter's life . . .

It acts as a common framework for understanding quite different effects. To some extent, this framework contains, not unexpectedly, a standard treatment of solid state physics.But unlike a typical solid state text, Kao then goes on to discuss in detail subjects like electrets and pyroelectrics. While you can certainly find many research papers on these subjects, standard texts tend to avoid them, as being perhaps too specialised.Kao seems to have filled a useful gap in the literature. The level of discussion seems suited for a graduate level readership. (It's a trifle advanced for most undergrads.)"},{"Title":"1994: Colpo grosso (Storie della storia d'Italia) (Italian Edition)","review":"The book speaks of the political rise of the Italian leader Silvio Berlusconi. The happening in the year 1994 was the first act that carried this millionaire to the leadership in Italy. Three authors (Corrias, Gramellini and Maltese) trace a picture of Italy in the '90.

Combine this book with &quot;The C programming language&quot; by K and R, and you should be able to handle anything that comes your way. Of course, you'll need books on the OS APIs depending on which OS you're developing for, also. But that's later."},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"I bought this book while looking for a good text to teach kids how to code C. This is pretty much a college/professional level book. The reading is very dense and quite dry, though the author does a very good job of breaking down simple programs and explaining them.If you want to learn C inside and out and heavy reading is your bag, this might be the book for you, however, I would recommend Bjarne Stroustrup's C++ book as a better alternative."},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"I used to believe in customer reviews. But after reading the reviews of this book.... This is one of the worst books on C in print and THE worst text book I have ever come across. It was selected by the curriculum committee for use in our school's C programming classes. Student complaints have been universal - the book is poorly organized, the examples confusing, and the use of Backus-Naur Form (originally developed in the 60's!) is worse than confusing. To cite just a few examples of the problems with this book: in Chapter 1, Paragraph 1.1, the book refers to &quot;Commonly available operations systems include MS-DOS and UNIX.&quot; There is no mention of Windows in the entire book. Now, I hate Microsoft as much as the next guy, but to ignore Windows in a programming book copyright 1998?Another complaint about the book is its heavy use of advanced mathematics in the examples. Not everyone has completed calculus before starting to learn programming. Example: in discussing recursion, a table shows &quot;Number of function calls required to recursively compute fibonacci(n)&quot;. In the chapter on arrays and pointers, it develops the example &quot;Finding a root by bisection&quot;. It is difficult to follow the example if you have no idea of what the example is supposed to be doing. Which leads to the next complaint, which may or may not be justified, depending on your reasons for choosing the book. It never addresses the topic of program design: HOW you determine what steps to perform. It simply discusses &quot;this is what the if (or switch, or while, or whatever) statement is and what it does.Even the writing style has drawn complaints. The authors are exceeding proud of their California vocabularies. From Chapter 2, Syntax Rules: &quot;To the compiler, program text is implicitly a single stream of characters, but to the human reader, it is a two-dimensional tableau.&quot; a.k.a. the compiler ignores white space.For my fall classes, I have already replaced this text with Problem Solving &amp; Program Design in C by Hanly and Koffman. It is light years beyond A Book on C in both organization and content. It covers not only HOW to use a statement, but WHEN to use it. There are other good C books, especially those by Kernigan and Ritchie (the famous K &amp; R you see so often).I hope this helps my &quot;human readers&quot; in making a choice."},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"I'm quite satisfied with the purchase. The price, book condition and delivery time were quite good. At the beginning I refused the idea to buy a book in the USA while I live in Spain. Then I was not able to find it in Spain. After I've found it here it was so expensive... So, the optimum solution was to buy it by Amazon."},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"I bought this book because it was a set text for my C programming class. I have to add a review, because contrary to most reviews I read on this site, I found this book extremely difficult to get any useful information out of. The examples are not practical, when they provide a sample program they totally disect it in to a long-winded discussion with much more detail than is needed. They take about six pages to go through a ten line program.If you have some programming experience in another language and just need a reference (as I did), this is NOT the book to buy! I recommend \\"C: How to Program\\" by Deitel & Deitel, which I have been using instead of this stupid book through the duration of my course.Maybe this might be halfway useful if you have never programmed before and need a really slow baby-steps book, but I really believe that it is not a good C reference."},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"Contrary to what the title of this book implies, this is one of the worst book I've ever read, and I regret I bought the book.

Now as a professional, I must learn the language and searching for a book to teach me quickly, I UNFORTUNATELY stumbled on this book and after browsing through the pages, I was more confused than ever. The teaching style is TERRIBLE ! Alhough I learned a thing or two, it took me sometime, definitely NOT A TUTORIAL ! NOT FOR BEGINNERS ! For those wanting to learn C the SUREST and FASTEST way, I highly recommend &quot;THE C PRIMER by Les Hancock and Morris Krieger&quot;.

I have to write this because I feel angry after spending $...(Canadian dollar) on this book. It was the simply worst book i ever read on C. It does not offer any insight. The book is full of syntex rules and idiot examples. This book is un-readable. I have to force myself to read it because I spent so much money on this one. I am regret of this. Avoid this book at all cost. instead get a book that teach you something deeper. This is a book that is for absolute beginnner,someone who never seeing a program before.Even though i was trying hard to finish reading this book, I could not continue after 6 chapters because it just not engaging at all. The authors don't even try to explain anything worth explaining, they just stating syntex after syntex. no real insight at all. no explaination on some difficult topics, I was often left wonder why? This book covers easy topics. This made the author's lifes easier, but rip off our readers the money and our time. It looks like there is no real effort by the authors to teach anything decent. I don't understand where all the stars come from for this book's review. It is the worst I ever read, period. Next time when I buy a book I will be more careful as to what I buy because some books out there cost a lot but just doesn't deliver any quality. This is a prime example. Avoid it or you will be sorry."},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"This is a great book. Yes, I too first thought it was terrible because it is NOT a 21 Days for Morons type of book. This book covers 95% of everything there is to know about C. It is all there. My 3rd ed is extremely well worn. There is a reason this book is chosen by universities. It has real, useful code. If you were to program up all the examples in this book, you'd have yourself a nice little library of functions. Multi-dimensional dynamic arrays, numerical methods, data structures. All useful in future classes and on the job for those who program real C and not &quot;Hello, World!&quot;"},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"I purchased this book because of it's high reader review, and I am glad I did. This is an excellent foundation for C programming, and I reccomend it for anyone wanting to learn C."},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"A BOOK ON C was the main textbook used in a freshman college course I took on the C programming language. As an introduction to C aimed at people who are completely unfamiliar with the language and the programming concepts behind it, this book is not terribly helpful. Some of the examples are a bit obscure, while some details are explained too quickly. However, as a general reference guide for someone who is already familiar with some of the fundamentals of the C programming language, this book is invaluable.I found this book to be quite handy for use in more advanced classes, as well as in programming projects done in a work setting. The layout is very orderly, and it covers virtually all of the topics that the average programmer needs. It doesn't get bogged down with numerous examples that can double the page count in other, more introductory programming books. Instead, authors Al Kelley and Ira Pohl merely give one or two examples and leave it to the reader to pick up the meaning that they were conveying. In just about every case, this works out to the book's advantage. Instead of having to wade through numerous examples to uncover what it was you were looking for, you can get what you need at first glance and then get back to whatever it was you were doing. This is the book's greatest strength as a guide; no one wants to spend a lot of time flipping back and forth between numerous references just to find one item. The clear layout and the straightforward examples save the programmer quite a bit of time.It also has a closing chapter that goes into a short introduction to C++ and Object Oriented Programming. While this is by no means enough to teach anything more than the bare fundaments of OOP, it does serve as a nice introduction to the topic, which would be quite helpful for any programmer looking to go beyond their current level of knowledge.All in all, I highly recommend this book for programmers who are already familiar with some of the fundamental C elements. If you're looking for a reference guide to material you already know, or looking to plug some gaps in your knowledge, then this book should be quite helpful for you.(FYI, this is a list of topics that the book covers: Introductory C Overview, Syntax, Data Types, Flow Control, Functions, Arrays, Pointers, Strings, Bitwise Operations, Enumeration Types, the Preprocessor, Structures/Unions, Lists and Sorting, I/O, the OS, Multiple Processes, OOP. In addition to these, other topics are touched on and developed, such as information on the standard included library header files and comparisons between ANSI C and traditional C. Standard and helpful algorithms for common tasks are also discussed.)"},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"I own several books on C, including many fast &quot;Teach yourself C in 24h&quot; and &quot;21 days&quot; titles. Kernighan's book is also classic, but it's too condensed, lacks some detailed explanations and is now a bit dated maybe. Still a good referece and the book everybody will tell you about, but if I could have only one C book, I'd keep this one instead. A book on C is still my favorite. This book is very well written, covering the usual topics, probably in the usual order, but most of the time, in a very readable and clear way.If you're a beginner some parts might be too complex for you, but with time, you'll get there. The introduction to Javascript and C++ is a nice extra too.The shocked reviewer who is a beginning programmer has a point, this is not a book for absolute beginners, but if you know the basics of programming, and a little C, you won't want to miss this book, and you surely won't rate it 1 out of 5. :-) Kelley and Pohl do know how to teach, but if you know 0 when you start, you will find it a &quot;bad&quot; book. If you know nothing, don't spend your money unless you know you are dedicated enough to force yourself to read it while searching basic books, or, best option, read a couple of &quot;teach yourself C in 24h &quot;-type books first.This doesn't mean begginers can't use this book. If you know the basics about programming structure and have used other languages before, that is probably enough to be able to use Pohl's book.Very competent title, useful if you know little about C, and still a good reference for experienced coders. Probably one of the top 5 best C books."},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"I found this one of the highest rated books on C a couple of years ago, so I bought it.

If you know a bit of another programming langauge such as C++ or Java you should be fine.With that said, this book is outstanding. It may be a bit dry compared to newer style books, but this gets the job done. It clearly explains the vast majority of the langauge and challenges you. What more do you need?Every chapter is filled with lots of great examples and some terrific problems to work on that will deepen your understanding of the language; and make you better at problem solving, an extremely important skill if you want to be a good programmer. Even a simple 10 line program can have many subtleties and this book covers them. If you have ever seen a simple hello world type program that takes user input, and has a few security issues you know what I mean. In a language like C it is the details that will sneak up behind you and stab you.Yes, it doesn't offer many specific operating system examples and that is fine. You should learn the language first, then branch into specific OS API's.This book has enough information to fill 2 or 3 courses, and leave you with enough background to go in any direction from there(networking, advanced data structures, embedded programming, other languages, ect).Granted, alot of the examples are mathematical but lets be clear. Computer science and programming are mathematical disciplines. If you are not at least comfortable in basic mathematics, including some calculus, linear algebra(especially important in CS) and statistics, you need to be. However, the mathematical concepts in this book are almost entirely in the realm of college algebra, not even close to advanced mathematics(even calculus isn't advanced math). Any college CS or programming class that doesn't require a solid algebra background is one to avoid anyway.Bottom line: At this level, a good grasp of algebra is the bare minimum.I suppose it is all the for idiots and total morons \\"programming\\" books out there that is to blame. They turned this mathematical discipline into paint-by-numbers. That is just shameful.Anyway, if you need a deep, clear understanding of ANSI C(which makes it more relevant then K&R;) this is the book for you.

The balance of material pertaining to UNIX and other systems is good, and I particularly like the treatement of pointers and arrays. This is not a book to get you up to speed on C quickly.

Windows programming is not too much to do with language itself (C/C++), it's more about the compilers (Borland C++ Builder , Visual c++...).

The language is simple and it is focused on beginners. It covers a lot of important topics and emphasizes common errors programmers usally make. The step-by-step program dissections are a great idea. The book, however, often looses too much time on very simple issues and overlooks more difficult ones, perhaps to keep the book simple.

That's not necessarily a bad thing though - when you have to look at something for a few seconds before you go &quot;Oh... i understand what he did&quot; - you'll probably remember it. As opposed to those &quot;I stupid, spoon feed me the information&quot;-type books. With those, you find yourself going &quot;Yeah, that's easy, next...&quot; thinking you understand it without REALLY looking at it and thinking about it.

It's a great book - if you plan on doing C programming, it belongs on your shelf."},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"I found this book to be very well written for someone who already has some programming experience (I already knew FORTRAN). HOWEVER, BE WARNED that the binding is the worst that I have ever seen on any book I have ever purchased (and I have a lot). I am constantly glueing(sic) it back together. However, the writing is good enough to compensate for the almost criminal negligence of the bindary at the publisher."},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"This was my second book I read on C.. It really complimented my first read.. Absolute Beginners Guide to C. Some of the information was over my head.. but I kept going.. It really got me understanding the language and using it."},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"I was introduced to this book as a learning text in college. I have continued to use it as a reference tool ever since. When all you need is a reference, it has very concise descriptions of the C constructs, functions, and libraries. Yet it also has very helpful texts, examples and exercises for that time when something new comes along or a review is needed. If you don't have photographic memory and can't remember everything all the time, this is the book to have on hand!"},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"I learned C with this book. I think it's not too bashful to say that it is the best C book on the planet. Here's why:A. The authors spare no &quot;idle talk&quot; in getting their point across.B. The material is very readable and very organized.C. Programming dissections, computer science concepts, data structures, even operating system ideas are all contained in this wonderful, small (easy to carry) text.ABC - A Book on C. get it?? ;-]In short, I highly recommend this book to students, professionals, and just about anyone who wishes to learn the syntax, the semantics, and more importantly, the APPLICATIONS of the ANSI C programming language"},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"I've always been told just to use K&amp;R to learn C. I thought I needed another book to help out. Unfortunately, this book was a bit too simplistic and did very little to clarify points in K&amp;R that were difficult. If you can program at all, this isn't the book for you."},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"This is the best book I have ever read on C, one of the best textbooks I have ever read, and one of the best books (no exceptions) I have ever read.I learned C from this book (second edition) in the author's (AK's) computational math class at UC Santa Cruz. I have since looked at many other C books (including K&amp;R, &quot;C By Example&quot;, &quot;C for Programmers&quot;, and others) and this is hands-down the best. It provides a thorough, accessible and ANSI-compliant introduction to the language, uses many useful (nontrivial) examples from general computer science and computational math (sorting algorithms, matrix math), and I found it fun to read! In particular, I think it provides the most intuitive and useful introduction to pointers and pointer arithmatic anywere. The examples are well integrated into the flow of presentation, and it is well indexed (it is an excellent reference book). One of the reasons I like it so much as an example of good writing is that it serves double duty as a teaching tool and a reference work, and does both successfully.This is the one!"},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"Well, after reading Teach Yourself C in 24 hours and not learning much from the overly useless examples and plain explanations, I decided to a buy another C book to get a more advanced education on the C language. I looked through the reviews of the C books, and decided on this one...Best choice I ever made.This book is truly fantastic. Explanations of new concepts and ideas are given lots of detail and thought, programs are explained well with the helpful dissection technique, the order of the chapters is well thought out, etc, etc. I would suggest an easier book on C(Don't get Teach Yourself C in 24 Hours tho), although it isn't required to understand this book because of how well it's written. Overall, this book is incredible, and wouldn't hesitate for a second to recommend it full-heartedly. Althought it isn't perfect (Typos and lack of full examples are the only two problems I can think of) this book comes the closest I've ever seen. It even introduces C++ and Java at the end, a very nice touch."},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"I got this originally for an advanced class in C when I had already been programming in it for a few years. I had been using K&R; as the bible but K&R; is a little too terse for me and I needed some examples. I have been programming in C for 20 years but I have a terrible memory and always need to refer to some part of it for syntax and usage. This book is just right for me.It is so useful I keep it with me all the time. All my friends in the lab were borrowing it so it got so dog-eared I threw it out and bought a second.It not only covers basic and advanced C, but it also has some data structures with linked lists, stacks, and queues in programs that actually compile and work. I also use the little bit they have on the differences with C++. You need another book if you really want to get into data structures or C++ but this will get you through the most common situations. Very useful indeed."},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"I had difficulty understanding C programmming in my years at college. You couldn't ask anyone for advice because people would contradict each other. I somehow got a job and wanted to make a career in software. My boss gave me this book to get started and I never looked back. I have read lots and lots of books in C programming. But 'A Book on C' stands out for it's clarity and it's graded presentation. If you solve the exercises (and they are doable) you will be a master. Mastering programming requires effort in the beginning, but once you understand the concepts you can cruise for the rest of your life. This is a great book to learn concepts. A lot of people recommend K&amp;R's 'The C Programming Language'. There is no doubt that this is a great book. It is a masterpiece in brevity and it defines the language. But it is more of a reference book. To get good concepts and a more 'humane' starting book you need 'A Book on C'. You will never regret the purchase!"},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"This is a wonderful, concise book on C programming, possibly the best I've encountered. The examples are illustrative with detailed explanations on every piece of the code. I'd suggest it for all level of programming, whether you're just starting or for review."},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"If your're a beginner some parts might be too complex for you, but with time, you'll get there.I've been learning C and bought several books, Kernighan's is a classic, but it's too condensed, lacks some detailed explanations and is now a bit dated maybe. Still a good referece, but if I could have only one C book, I'd keep this one. I also read some of the &quot;fast&quot; books like Teach Yourself C in 24h and Teach yourself C in 21 days, and a few others. A book on C is still my favorite. The introduction to Javascript and C++ is a nice extra too."},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"This the second book that I've read on C. It is a great book to gain a solid understanding of the language. The C++ and Java sections really whet your appetite for those languages. Overall, I felt the quality of the writing was outstanding and very easy to follow. Being in the business world, I chose to skip some of the scientific examples. The book has a great section on unix makefiles and permissions. I recommend this book for any programmer's library. Very enjoyable and applicable reading !"},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"Somebody complained that this book doesn't talk about windows programming. Windows programming is not too much to do with language itself (C/C++), it's more about the compilers (Borland C++ Builder , Visual c++...). This book which was written by college math professors focuses on the language itself, and the best way to do that is using a text based environment (DOS, UNIX compilers). Yes, it is dry and a little too much math oriented, and lack of deep, clear explanation in some important, confusing parts. And, it is not a easy, how to, tutorial book. I am not sure if this book will make you a good, practical C programmer any time soon, but you will have OK understanding on C though (if you survive after those exercises). If you are a true beginner and need a easy-to-follow tutorial book, &quot;Teach yourself C in 21 days&quot; is not too bad to start with. If you know a little bit of C programming (&quot;Teach yourself C in 21 days&quot; will get you there), I have some recommandations for you :*Pointers on C (the best)*The C programming language (!!!!!!!!!!!)*The Standard C Library (must have)*The C Puzzle Book*C Traps and Pitfalls*Expert C ProgrammingConclusion : Buy 3 books (if you are kind of new to C but serious),1.

I've rarely found a text book in any field that combines such a level of rigour with such a fluid writing style. Even now, I still refer to some of the more advanced sections to brush up my knowledge. Kelley and Pohl deserve congratulations for creating such a useful work (and for making it a no-brainer when someone asks me for a recommendation for a C programming book)."},{"Title":"A Book on C: Programming in C (4th (fourth) Edition)","review":"I remember my project supervisor had told me that I needed to learn C for a robotics project in university.
