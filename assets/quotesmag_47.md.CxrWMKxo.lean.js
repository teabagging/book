There is a long (compared to the length of the book) build up, where piece by piece, he starts accumulating information that leads him to finally break out of his world. It is at this point where you figure the story can really take off. Instead, it ends, pretty much in short order. It's sort of like opening a huge beautifully wrapped present and then finding there's a gift certificate inside. Not so bad, but, it brings the experience down. Worth a read."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"Finally found this book again, after so many years. My god, when I was watching Jim Carrys &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, I knew exactly where the storyline had originated. Only hope the PKD estate got some thanks. I mean, cmon, the guy is living in the distant future, but has the life and is made to believe that he is in somebodys idea of nostalgia heaven. Anyway, PKD is the man, and more and more people now know it. The difference between geek and hipster really is only 20 years, not a bad clip."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"This is one of Dick's early novels and one of his easiest reads. His handling of the cracks that gradually appear in his \\"real\\" world is simply beautiful and is great literature. This is a book that I have disposed of and then later bought again and reread several times. I recently bought the Japanese language edition to practice my Japanese with."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"This is one of PKD's finest. The idea that the first two-thirds of the book are more &quot;mature&quot; than the last third is outrageous. The fact that this is SF should not make people give excuses for liking it. PKD was an SF writer, and while the beginning of this book does not read like science fiction, it certainly does not mean that the last third is childish or juvenile. SF can be just as mature as normal fiction (and at its best, it far surpasses the hights that non-science fiction can rise to). This is an excellent work, and one of the 4 or 5 best PKD ever wrote."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"Ragle Gumm is the all time winner of the 'Where's the Little Green Man' contest. Everyday he fills out the contest entry forms from the newspaper and mails them in before the deadline. He's famous and there's something dreadfully important about his entries being accurate and timely. Ragle lives with his sister and brother in law. Although Ragle thinks he is living in 1959, he discovers some magazines in a ruined lot that are dated 1997. He's not sure whether he is being kept prisoner in this small town, or whether he's paranoid or worse, a Lunatic."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"That Dick could be as popular as he is now without his works containing some literary merit seems impossible. The characters are drawn in settings with about as much detail as viewing them in immediate experience would provide. Words are twisted or invented to represent objects or ideas - real and familiar- though not previously experienced except on the printed page. Floods of recognition are released in the reader's mind by the loving representation of the \\"lowly\\" objects of everyday life. Dick becomes a friend invited into lunch discussions with colleagues, or to be \\"haunted\\" by when in moments of quiet contemplation. If you are at all thoughtful you will enjoys his writings. If these qualities are not representative of \\"literary value\\" they should be. For they are the qualities sought after by ordinary people - like me. Dick, as a philosopher, avoids the error commited by many of the \\"great\\" ones. Ideas cannot affect us only though the cerebrum and its logic. The limbic system and associated areas generating emotion are intimately intertwined with the cerebrum in development. The experience of reading the TIME OUT OF JOINT has left me with only one regret: how I wish Sammy could have known I was in the Tree House listening in on his crystal set."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"This novel to be a turning point in PDK's journey as a novelist. By choosing this road, Dick put himself into position to write some of the classics that come later. The beginning of TIME OUT OF JOINT is mature PDK. I am sure practical considerations and pressures cause the ending to be of lower quality than most of the book, but it is the first two thirds of the book that make it worth the trouble to get and read this pivotal work. Great American novelists of recent times? Have to say Steinbeck, Dick and Amy Tan."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"This is Dick's most overrated single novel. PDK wrote a lot of stuff for a grand on the barrelhead to pay the rent (or alimony) and TOoJ is one of them. (Note that some humorist at Amazon has paired this one with \\"The Simulacra\\"--be forewarned.)TOoJ impresses the intelligentsia due to the fact that they think it's about the Cold War. Well, it is and it isn't. Granted that anything written in the immediate post-Sputnik epoch is going to be drenched in the quivering fear of the period. But the basic premise here is drawn from WW II, the \\"Special Talents\\" section of the OSS, which recruited everything from safecrackers to psychics to aid espionage missions. As for Ragle Gumm's existential predicament, this was a universal for Dick, not tied to any particular historical moment, as any examination of his novels of the next fifteen years clearly reveals.A critic would say that this is a transitional novel between Dick's dystopian novels of the 50s and the false-reality stuff of the ensuing decade. All too true. One of the fun aspects of reading Dick is trying to guess what outlandish, wild-eyed explanation he'll come up with for his reality shifts. Here, there's no explanation whatsoever. Weird things happen (e.g., the disappearing hot-dog stand) and we're just supposed to roll with it. Dick was not quite ready to deal with the concept at this point. He got there, though.Apart from that: horrendous writing, even by Dick's standards--at one point, Gumm comes across a photo of Marilyn Monroe (nonexistent in his 50s paradise) and immediately starts spouting like a psychology postgrad. Right--that's the first thing I'd think too. (Amusingly enough, this passage is quoted without fail in academic critiques of the novel.) Clumsy development unrelieved by Dick's wilder leaps of imagination, an extremely sketchy and cliched future history, an anticlimactic ending (The Big Surprise on the final page is something we were told about five pages earlier). This is Dick's version of a 50s potboiler.You can do better. Dick produced good ones even this early, \\"The World Jones Made\\" and \\"Eye in the Sky\\" in particular. (This last is his earliest full-length assay into reality shifts, and one that puts TOoJ in the shade.) For the Truly Weird PDK that everyone swears by, see anything from the mid-60s to 70s. (You'd be well advised to leave \\"Three Stigmata\\" for last.)No question that PDK was the American Borges. Of course, Borges didn't leave a trail of TOoJ's in his canon. But then, he had a day job."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"The biggest problem with this book is that the themes that Dick would later use are presented far too neatly. When you finish most Dick novels, you're never quite sure what is and what isn't. Here, the seemingly inexplicable events are all neatly tied up at the end, which rather takes away from the richness. It's still Dick, though, and thus it's still quite good.Addendum: I have no idea why I gave this four stars. It's just not that good. Insufficient claustrophobic paranoia for my personal taste. A sign of things to come, but not brilliant on its own. I dig the cover of the new Vintage edition, though. When were all these books reprinted?"},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"I liked Time but was a bit disappointed in it only because I assumed Gumm was going to be trapped inside a computer. I read a review that seemed to hint at this, and I had been warped by too much Matrix and Dark City. Thus I was surprised to see that Gumm was really living in a big prop-town like Truman Show. It's like seeing the movie preview like Batman and saying, \\"This is gonna be awesome,\\" and then walking away not totally satisfied. I must, however, give the Dickman his due because his books about hidden reality and alternative history strike me deep.One more thing about Joint: Why did Dick start his book with a secondary character and not Gumm himself?"},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"As a former reviewer has pointed it out, Philip K. Dick's TIME OUT OF JOINT has greatly inspired the authors of the screenplay of Peter Weir's THE TRUMAN SHOW. Ragle Gumm, the hero of TIME OUT OF JOINT, is questioning the reality he is living in, like in fact the majority of the characters created by Philip K. Dick during his literary career.Ragle Gumm's efforts to discover the &quot;hidden&quot; side of the world he has been thrown into is, in my opinion, the most interesting aspect of the novel. The science-fictional explanation of the reasons why Ragle Gumm has to play everyday is not very convincing and the analysis of the origin of the war between Lunatics and Terrians way too simple for an author such as PKD.However, TIME OUT OF JOINT provides the kind of pleasure the Philip K. Dick fan searches in vain in today sci-fi production. So don't hesitate to add this book to your collection if you are already familiar with the world of this writer."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"Somewhere I read Philip K. Dick say that the one most important piece of knowledge he had picked up from philosophy is that, \\"The nature of reality is to disguise its true nature\\" (which he claimed to have read in Heraclitus, though it's difficult to be sure if Heraclitus actually said that).TIME OUT OF JOINT is one of Dick's earlier novels that treats the theme of \\"The World Is Not What We Think It Is\\" explicitly. It's a novel about knowledge and recognition. The characters play parts in a detective story where the mystery involves piecing together missing parts of the world. Some of the clues include finding light switches on the wrong side of the door, finding a note where a lemonade stand used to be, finding pictures of some actress nobody's ever heard of, and seeing visions.A number of PKD's later books involved more significant permutations of this theme of Nature-In-Disguise. This story is like a one-trick pony in comparison to books like PALMER ELDRITCH, NOW WAIT FOR LAST YEAR, UBIK, MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE, MAZE OF DEATH, or VALIS. But the gradual accumulation of evidence, the dawning of recognition in the main characters, makes for pretty fascinating reading.For good or ill, several modern film makers have really taken this motif to heart (e.g., Dark City, The Matrix, The 13th Floor, The 6th Sense, etc.)."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"I suppose I should begin this review by stating that I did genuinely enjoy reading this book. I felt it had highly readable prose and a gentle narrative style that eased you into some of the more bizarre happenings which occur later in the story. My one gripe, and I suppose this is just as much my fault as the publisher's, is the summary on the back of the book. Let me explain.Usually when I read a novel, I do my best to avoid reading the notes on the flap of a hardcover or on the back of a paperback. The reason is simple, I don't want the story to be spolied. Now with this particular novel, I am reading at work during my lunch break, revelling in the peculiarities that befall poor Ragle Gumm (the protagonist) when I realize that lunch is almost over and I have to stop reading. I place the book down on my desk face down and while glancing down simply to pick up a pen I inadvertently read two short sentences on the back of the book which ruined all of the suspense and mystery of the story. (They were the second and third sentences of the summary, which is the same as the summary here at Amazon.com, if you are interested.)I still enjoyed the book, although the last couple of chapters seemed very rushed to me. Yet, now whenever I think about \\"Time Out of Joint\\" all I can think of is the gradual dawning of understanding that might have been. The sublime joy of slowly, over time, figuring out what is going on... just as Ragle Gumm does. All spoiled by a poorly written summary on the back of the book.If you are the kind of person who hates when movie trailers give away the entire story of a film, avoid reading this summary before reading the book itself."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"Often called Philip K. Dick's breakthrough novel, Time Out of Joint is one of his best early works, essential for fans and a good place to start. Though not his most ambitious or meaningful opus, it is supremely entertaining and thought-provoking, tackling many themes later handled more complexly.Time is greatly engrossing even on a very simple level. It draws us in quickly and does not let go until the very end; we truly never know what comes next and read feverishly to find out. It is virtually impossible to discuss the plot without giving away something essential, as many reviewers and even the description on the back of the book unfortunately have. Suffice it to say that there is a wealth of suspense and surprises and that anyone who knows nothing about the book is in for a true thrill. It is highly regrettable that other books - and especially films - have so often imitated and simply plagiarized Time, probably making it impossible to experience initial readers' shock. We can only envy them.Of course, as nearly always with Dick, this is in many ways a vehicle for deeply philosophical themes. His signature question - \\"What is reality?\\" - is here in its then fullest expression, and it still stands as one of his most intriguing and thought-provoking explorations. Mental illness, another classic theme, also has a large presence, and Dick's signature dark humor is here in abundance. However, Time is in many ways unusual mostly in that it has virtually no science fiction content. It is quite far in before anything really out of the ordinary happens, and true SF elements do not come until the last few chapters. Initial readers must have been quite confused. We can easily think Dick wrote a mainstream novel and tacked SF elements on in order to fit a genre into which he had begun to make inroads, which is very likely true. He was one of the few major SF writers who wrote mainstream novels, though only one was published in his lifetime, and becoming a mainstream writer was his goal. Their recent publication demands nothing less than a full canon reevaluation; the mainstream books have always been seen as an SF writer stripping away SF trappings, but a close look at them and Time almost suggests the opposite. Seeing Time as a period piece is thus very legitimate - and extremely interesting. Published in 1959, the twilight of the Eisenhower years that have been widely idealized, Time is a fascinating glimpse into what it was like to live in this important era. We learn about everything from speech to pop culture to gender roles, and it soon becomes clear that the time was not so ideal. Cold War paranoia, female oppression, economic woes, and general ennui made life anything but pristine for the perceptive. One was of course not supposed to point such things out, and the subterfuge by which Dick manages to do so - even sneaking in significant political critique - is brilliant. It also cannot be discussed without giving too much away, but let it be known that he pulls off the seemingly impossible deftly and smoothly. Indeed, unlike virtually everything else he wrote, the ending actually ties everything together.All told, Time epitomizes the best of early Dick and points to later work more than anything previous had done. It is important to know that this is not his most significant writing, and anyone who likes it should certainly read more, but this is essential for anyone alive to any aspect of his genius."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"Anyone who lived next door to Philip K. Dick in 1958 might have regarded him with a sense of mild suspicion. He hung around the house most of the day, probably, or he'd go to the library for long periods. He'd spend a lot of time reading books and making notes, and otherwise doing little or nothing that seemed like any kind of paid employment. Then for a week or ten days he'd type nonstop for hours, drop a big package at the post office and gradually sink back into apparent non-activity. You'd have to wonder what he did for food money.At least, that's what PKD must have looked like on the outside. On the inside - that's another story. In fact, it's Time Out of Joint. (Like how I came full circle on that one? It's a cheap copy of something PKD did all the time.)Now, before I go any further, I must apologize for rehashing that tired old assertion that any novel is to be read as a thinly-disguised autobiography of the writer who produced it. Interpretations of that kind leave no room for the imagination, ours or the author's, and we've had quite enough of that, thank you very much. PKD of all people was far too original in his thinking to rely on such hackery. Unfortunately, Time Out of Joint reads uncomfortably like thinly-disguised autobiography - it's about a man named Ragle Gumm, a figure of some suspicion, who spends his tense days at home reading books, making notes and sending mysterious packages through the mail. Sorry, kids, thinly-disguised autobiography it is. (Well, maybe a little thicker than that, but you get the idea.)What's more, like PKD, Ragle Gumm has a sneaking suspicion that all is not well, that there's a hidden world of paranoia and violence behind the tranquility of his surroundings. And like PKD, his suspicions shortly prove to be accurate.He lives somewhere in small-town Eisenhower America, and those packages he mails every day consist of his solutions to a newspaper contest called \\"Where Will The Little Green Man Be Next?\\" The thing is a joke, consisting of a grid of 1,028 squares and a small group of utterly useless \\"clues\\", and you're supposed to guess the correct square. Lo and behold, by spending some eight hours a day examining, researching and postulating, Ragle Gumm wins the dratted thing every single time. And naturally, every time he wins, the pressure on him increases to win again the next day.So far, despite its original publication under an SF imprint, this is about as science fictional as \\"Wheel of Fortune\\". Granted, at one point Ragle Gumm has a vision in which a soft-drink stand dissolves out of sight, to be replaced with a slip of paper labeled \\"soft-drink stand\\". Well, that could be a mere hallucination, a sign of incipient psychosis. Then he picks up the piece of paper and puts it in a box he keeps filled with other such slips of paper, and you realize that something really is rotten in the state of Denmark.In other words, we're in PKD Land, where nothing is what it seems to be and reality changes shape while you wait. This is plain enough when the author shows you a town where buildings turn to slips of paper and no one knows who Marilyn Monroe is. The true greatness of Time Out of Joint, however, lies in the fact that PKD somehow managed to convey, even before the faade cracks open, the tension of living in a lying world. This author wasn't really a great stylist, but only a great writer could use simple language to show the rotten underbelly of conformist postwar America just by describing how a man insists on crossing the street in the middle of the block because it's a \\"point of honor\\".Speaking of points of honor, I will say no more about what's actually bothering Ragle Gumm. Of course, Time Out of Joint has been in circulation for going on fifty years, and the true nature of Ragle Gumm's world is no big mystery anymore, but on the chance that someone out there considers reading it and doesn't know what's up, let's keep it quiet, shall we? It would be nice if new readers learned Ragle Gumm's secrets along with Ragle himself. Suffice to say that those who declare this to be PKD's breakthrough work are quite right. After five years of publishing good but predictable pulp according to Ace Books' strict science fiction template and utterly failing to sell any of his mainstream work, here is where PKD scored his first major victory in combining his deep investigations of suburban ennui with his explosive SF imagination.The style rides rough and unpolished at times, some of the characters behave in the most cardboard fashion, there's at least one major crevasse in the plot, and I'm telling you, you won't be able to put it down. PKD knew what people's lives were like and what they dreamed about; if he wasn't always comfortable to read, he was always, always compelling.I will conclude with a few words about this book's title. It's a quotation from Hamlet, of course - Ragle and Vic use the phrase to express their sense that things around them aren't quite right. They don't consider the entire quotation, but you should, because it provides a nifty clue as to who Ragle Gumm really is:\\"The time is out of joint. O cursed spite, / That ever I was born to set it right!\\"Benshlomo says, Combining reality with imagination takes a real genius, or a real psycho, or maybe both."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"IF you have seen the movie &quot;The Matrix&quot; then you've seen Time Out of Joint pushed forward to a timeframe of 1999/2200 rather than 1956/1996. Right down to the nagging sense of something out of joint in 'the real world'... the difference is in &quot;The Matrix&quot;, humans are enslaved by machines. Dick hits on something more insidious: Humans voluntarily enslaved to a cause. No sooner do they submit to this, than they begin to fight it subconciously. This was my first PDK novel many years ago and had a profound effect. A must-read."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"Well, this is the first book I've read by Dick, who probably became famous to my generation for his book \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\", which became the inspiration for 1982's Blade Runner starring Harrison Ford. So, you might say that I had a nominally high level of expectation when I picked this book up. The afterword, by Lou Stathis (written in 1984), claims that this book was Dick's attempt to sabotage his Sci Fi writing career so he could transition over to more \\"mainstream\\" writing. However, that motive doesn't really express itself until chapter fourteen, the last chapter.The thing that attracted me to the book was the description on the back cover about Ragle Gumm, who experiences a soft drink stand, among other things, being replaced before his eyes with a piece of paper that says \\"soft drink stand\\". And, although it's 1959, there are no radios except the one Gumm and his nephew build. But, all they hear on their homebrew unit is chatter from planes or rockets they can hear flying overhead but can't see. Sounds really promising doesn't it? I thought so, too.I won't say that I loved this book but I didn't hate it either; probably because of Strathis' Afterword and Blade Runner. As expected, it is well written, the plot kept me turning pages and most of the primary characters were round enough to enable the reader to visualise their personalities. This book is good enough that I picked up one of Dick's short story collections, Minority Report. Unfortunately, things aren't all kittens and gravy. Perhaps, because Dick was purposely trying to write a stinker (God, I hope so) or maybe because he got tired, the key hook of the story just pffffft! disappears from the conclusion. Not to give away any details of the end or anything but EXPLAIN THE DISAPPEARING STUFF! It wasn't in Gumm's head, he kept the bits of paper and showed them to other people. I mean, WHAT THE H---! But, you get nothing, not a hint, not a glimmer. It's as if Dick said, \\"Hey, you read right to the end, eh? Ha ha ha! See ya! Don't forget to catch my next book. It's a real mystery-love story.\\" I'm gonna give him another chance though, just because I liked Blade Runner so much. I just wish I could find a copy of \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" But what can you do?"},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"One of Philip Dick's more noted early novels is Time Out of Joint, from 1959. This was originally published in hardcover by Lippincott -- perhaps Dick's first appearance between boards.The setting is what seems a first a slightly altered 1950s. The main character is Ragle Gumm, who makes his living solving a puzzle for a newspaper. Ragle lives with his sister and her husband. He carries on an somewhat unsatisfying affair with the rather immature wife of a not very pleasant neighbor. And he worries about his curious standing as the reigning puzzle-solving champion.Slowly we realize that his world is somehow artificial. He (and his brother-in-law) uncover curious buried items, occasionally see strange things that seem to imply most everyone in the town in artificial, hear via crystal radio odd transmissions, and so on. One of the most symbolic findings is slips of paper with names of objects -- \\"the word is the thing\\", anyone? Most significant is when Ragle stumbles across newspapers and magazines from the future (1998 or so).The general outline of what's going on with Ragle and his family should be relatively clear -- I'll leave the specific solution and the motivations for readers to discover. The basic idea is, then, familiar enough -- redolent of Daniel Galouye's slightly later novel Simulacron-3, just to name one. What makes the book stand out is for one thing the way Dick uses the 50s setting to comment, as if from the future, on the 1950s (and to do so with an aspect of nostalgia that almost makes the book seem as if written in 1998), also the portrayal of the characters, and finally a certain charged feeling of strangeness -- very much a central feature of much of Dick's work -- that gives the idea of inhabiting an artificial world -- \\"word as thing\\" or \\"signifier as object\\" if you will -- real psychological immediacy."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"It's difficult to talk a lot about what this book is about without giving important plot elements away. This was the first PKD book that I read and, while it is not as deep in meaning as some of his later works, I still think it's one of his best. Time Out of Joint takes place in a 1959 small town world where nothing is as it seems, and it should appeal to both the non-science fiction fan who wants a good suspenseful read, and to dedicated sci-fi readers."},{"Title":"Time out of joint","review":"This is my first Phillip K Dick novel. He is most famous for works such as Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly and most famously Do Androids Dream of electric Sheep aka Bladerunner. This is an early novel written in the 1950s.This was an excellent introduction. We are introduced to Ragle Gumm and his very mundane suburban existence. He is a serial competition winner who lives in an ordinary house with his sister and her normal family. Things however are not all that they seem. Is this world real or simply a faade? What is going on underneath and why does the man who wins a newspaper competition, apparently become the most important in the world. Or is this just paranoia? The sense of mystery is gripping and I finished it in a day.Things indeed are not all they seem and a chase for escape and reason begins. This is in many ways a forerunner of other books and films based on this theme e.g. Truman Show. It was a great read and I will be trying some of the others.The only slight criticism is that the ending is all a bit sudden. It comes almost as if it is grafted on to explain the mystery. But it takes nothing away from an excellent read."},{"Title":"Eyes of Love","review":"It's difficult for an author to say anything in a &quot;review&quot; manner about one's own book. What prompted me to enter this comment is that it's just been announced (Aug. 28th) that &quot;Eyes of Love&quot; is Romantic Times Magazine's winner for &quot;Best Historical Fantasy Romance&quot; for this year. Naturally, I'm delighted. This is the first time I've written a fantasy historical romance - which to me means in this case a story set in authentic medieval times featuring a young heroine with &quot;psychic gifts&quot;. As it turns out, the only man who isn't afraid of her, in spite of her dazzling beauty, is the one man who truly loves her! I hope you enjoy this as much as a growing number of readers have told me they did"},{"Title":"Eyes of Love","review":"FROM THE BACK COVER:Abandoned at a convent when she was just a babe, the Scottish lass named Edain has grown into a hunting golden beauty. So beautiful that after he betroths hear to a drover, the local laird secretly plots to have her for himself. But after her bridegroom mysteriously dies on their wedding morning, Edain is banished from her girlhood village amid whispers of witchcraft and murder.From the moment he spies the lovely young woman in her wedding gown on the mist-shrouded beach, Magnus fitzJulien knows his destiny is sealed. But the passion Magnus and Edain share is filled with danger...and magic. For Edain's Celtic second sight bespeaks distant times and far-off realms. And the aristocratic knight who worships her must challenge a king's might and a word of intrigue and treachery to win her liberty and precious love.MY POINT OF VIEW:I am actually shocked at the reviews, and I want to sincerely apologize to those who read the prior reviews and purchased this book as a result, because I too was a victim of such circumstance. I mean this humbly, as I am not an expert writer, but I am an avid reader, so here it goes: I really thought this book was terrible.I would not go as far as to say I hated this book, as hate is a strong word. Therefore, I would like to call this:5 reasons why I DISLIKE this book.1. This book lacks seduction. It fails to seduce the reader. The words do not flow and we are not lured into the plot. There is also no art of seduction between the hero and the heroine. I can even go as far as say that there is absolutely no romance. This will be more exemplified as you read numbers 2 to 5.2. We never get to know the characters in this book. The author is good at visualization, but we have no insight to the type of disposition these characters possess, especially the hero and the heroine.Aside from the heroine being a seer, she has NO PERSONALITY. All we know about her is that she is very beautiful, has a power to foresee the future that she can't always control.The hero too, has NO PERSONALITY. He could be a totem pole (no pun intended). It seemed that he only had two roles: sleep with the heroine and rescue her.3. I have no idea why these people loved each other.The first time the hero meets the heroine, she has been abandoned on the beach, and he is asked to transport her. He refuses to, thinking her a concubine of a laird, although he is told otherwise (that she grew up in a convent and she is an innocent). He tries to leave her behind, but the heroine, Edain uses her power to \\"call him\\" via telepathy when he is on his ship, and he turns around. He carries her from the beach and then dumps her on the boat. Whilst on the voyage, she has a vision of him \\"naked\\". This supposedly tells us, the readers, that they are fated to be together.Now, even though it is destiny, there is no journey in their love story. The hero says barely 5 to 10 lines to her and she, probably about 3 lines to him before they are intimate with each other. He finds out then, that she is a virgin...but does he even say anything to her? - No!After taking her innocence, they fall asleep and then she gets kidnapped. He wakes up and finds out that she has gone.This is the initiation of this story's format, which can be summarized by the following 3 distinct step pattern:Heroine is in trouble - Hero rescues her - They have an intimate encounter -Then the cycle begins again....Moreover, I believe that the author assumes that the readers should buy into their love story because of the vision Edain has in the beginning of the book. However, it does not work that way. I do not believe that the characters cherished or valued each other. They never get to know each other, just as we the readers never gain insight to who they are.4. Although this book is packed with historical facts, and I would probably give it two thumbs up for accuracy it is absolutely boring.It is supposedly action packed, but it is not. Just a lot of dumb things happen. (I wish I knew how else to put it). A lot of contradictory and illogical things occur. I shall illustrate:We have people who torture the heroine. But within 2 minutes she is OK, so we as readers have to rethink whether or not she had been tortured in the first place.An example of this is when she is in the hands of the \\"Templars\\" who administer tests on her to see if she really has some powers, so she calls on Magnus (telepathically) to save her....Then later in the book the author has her thinking that they were not really being mean to her in the first place!!!????? She starts to justify the actions of the Templars....Another scene, a man who has a twisted love / obsession for her tries to kill her. (The only character with a personality by the way).He chokes her, to the point that she is bleeding. With her powers, she is able to usurp him. In the next minute, she is fine.She often gets premonitions, or feelings of \\"dread\\" when danger is about to befall her. There is a scene that she sits with King Henry, where she gets this so-called feeling of dread, and does not want to sit with him, but she ends up doing it because she feels forced. Does anything happen after she sits down? No!!! She gives him a prophecy of death....that makes him go mad for a moment.... But that's it! Why did she have the feeling of danger being near in the first place? Why was she afraid? We never know.The author teases us with the potential for action, but it is never fulfilled.5. The hero sleeps around. To me this is a big deal breaker. He is even \\"pressured\\" into some sort of group encounter...but it is ok, according to the author, because he is thinking of the heroine Edain at the time!!!????There is a scene when Magnus tells Edain, that he had slept with other people, but it is her that he wanted. And with her \\"power\\" she can tell that he was thinking of her whilst sleeping with others....!!!????? Yuk! Does anyone else not see anything wrong with this scenario?This book unfortunately, I believe to be abysmal at best. I gave it two stars and not one because of its historical accuracy.Is this a keeper? - Definitely Not.Is it worth reading? - No. Pick up a Susan Tanner or a Jude Deveraux instead please.Is it worth scheming through when you are absolutely bored? - Maybe."},{"Title":"Eyes of Love","review":"Katherine Deauxville aka Maggie Davis continues the medieval sagas started with Blood Red Roses and continued in Daggers of Gold and Amethyst Crown. This time she takes her readers on rousing adventure into Scotland.Edain was a foundling, raised by nuns who said she was 'special'. She was also very beautiful. The beauty provoked a minor barron to steal her from the convent, but not wanting to incur the wrath of his liege and the church, he set about to marry her off to one of his men so he could claim 'first night' with her. Only, as the wedding took place, the groom suddenly and mysteriously died. The villages, having heard rumours of her special powers, banish her fearful she is a witch.Magnus fitzJulien first sees her sitting on the beach where he is collecting taxes for his lord the Earl of Chester. He is told he must carry her away with him, for they fear she will come to harm. At first, he ignores the woman and sets sail, but suddenly feels compelled to return for her. The two tax ships get into a terrible storm and become separated, and later, Edain deliberately runs their ship onto a sandbar delaying them. After they get back under way, the learn the first ship was attacked and robbed and all killed on board. Had she not run them aground, they, too would have faced the same fate. She had saved them. Later the ship goes down with Magnus rescuing her. Once on shore, he makes love to her, but in the morn awakes to find that someone has taken her.This starts a journey for them both. The English King wants her word reaching of her powers, William the Lion of Scotland wants her, the Knights Templars want her, the Auld Culdee of Scotland wants her, but most of all Magnus wants her and will go through about anything to save her.Edain and Magnus are a delightful couple that find themselves in very unusual situations with strange results, making for a winning time. As with all Deauxville historicals, she is so rich in details of history. Few write with her feel and understanding for the medieval period."},{"Title":"Eyes of Love","review":"I read this book when it came out, then lost my copy. So I was delighted to find one again on amazon. This story of a sweet girl with powers that make her coveted by so many men and plan to use her power for various deeds is amazing in the historical research, especially the part concerning the Culdees and the Templars hoping to control her powers.So delighted to find this again. It's funny, it's romantic, it's really great read!"},{"Title":"Eyes of Love","review":"Sorry, but I can't recommend this one. I found myself scanning through the pages to get to the end.

I could explain in more detail, but even this review is not worth the time."},{"Title":"Merry Men","review":"Just as &quot;Ulysses&quot; was derided at it's debut, so has this book been. And just like &quot;Ulysses&quot; is now celebrated as a masterpiece of the millenium, so this book will be. Carolyn Chute, with only four titles in print, is the undisputed heavyweight champeen woman writer of the world. If you love Hemingway's wry just under the surface populism, you will love Chute. In fact, if you only read one book in your life, make it this one!"},{"Title":"Merry Men","review":"Carolyn Chute has an amazing talent at bringing to life the very heart and soul of her characters. This book exemplified that ability. Being from the same part of Maine of which she writes, I can identify strongly with these characters. Reading this book thrust me back in time to my youth in Maine---I was overwhelmed with nostalgia simply because Mrs. Chute wrote so well and was able to breathe life into her story. The characters of this novel were Maine personified. Anyone who grew up in Maine can understand what I mean---it wasn't like reading a novel, but rather was like actually being there and experiencing it. Thank you, Carolyn, for treating me to a part of my life I had previously thought forgotten and past."},{"Title":"Merry Men","review":"Carolyn Chute can write, no doubt about that. With rich, spicy, earthy prose she brings to life her rural Maine setting and a whole town full of characters in this third novel.The setting is the same as for her first two books: Egypt, a small town on the edge of the woods in western Maine, a place where impoverished natives and rich folks \\"from away\\" live side by side, but seperate existences.The characters in this 695-page novel include most of the population, with emphasis on LLoyd Barington, of working-class/farming stock, Forest Johnson, Jr., whose backhoe and 'dozing business employs many of the town's poorest, and Gwen Curry, whose horrid mother proves that money and Connecticut gentility are no proof against cruelty.The plot, well, here the novel runs into trouble. There is no plot, so to speak. While her characters do cross paths with one another, there is no unifying progression of events- except the slow generalized denigration of a rural way of life. That, it turns out, is Chute's point. \\"Merry Men\\" is a documentation of hard times getting harder, of the corporate mindset grinding down the individual.Not that all her Maine folk are saints, although Lloyd Barrington comes close. Forest Johnson, Jr., for instance, takes advantage of his employees' desperation at every opportunity.As the book opens, Forest has called out the constable on a bitter winter night. A prank -the fifth in as few days. \\"Forest, Jr.'s frozen breath bunches and bounces around his face so now there's no face. When his face reappears, it's just this dark sovereignty of eyes behind steel-rimmed glasses and a fierce close shave.\\" Faced with the constable's impotence, Forest vows to lie in wait and kill the merry prankster.The book then jumps back 30 years, although this is not apparent unless you glance at the top margin of the page. We meet Lloyd Barrington, age 8 3/4, fat, earnest, sensitive, a writer of poetry, a lover of shade trees. This lengthy section is breezy, humorous, affectionate and deeply touching.Lloyd's mother has died. He lives with his taciturn, incomprehensible father, Edmund, and a houseful of uncles, including Unk Walty, who cooks fabulous meals for them all, unless he's absorbed in one of his papier mache projects, like his masterpiece - lifesized reproductions of all the local women Edmund has slept with, seated around a table dressed in beautiful last-century costumes.At night Lloyd sneaks out of bed and flits around town in his Super Tree Man costume. \\"A fat boy by day, maybe so. But tonight and many nights to come, he's a thing of glory.\\" Lloyd plants baby maples. \\"If they make it, in thirty years, the fat lady's yard will be in deep cool splendorous shade.\\"Next we meet Gwen Curry on the day her father, Dr. Curry, has died. Gwen is a fearful, lonely child, her mind flickering between the awful events following her father's death and jagged memories of her short life with Phoebe, her mother. Every night Phoebe sings under the grate to Gwen's bedroom. A few times her father had remonstrated. \\"So Phoebe sang louder. Show tunes. Pop tunes. Rock and Roll. Television jingles. And once a shattery tinkling splat! A glass thrown into the sink.\\"Chute's portrait of manic cruelty and bewildered child is heart rending. Yet when Grandma packs them off to Connecticutt that's the last we see of Gwen for hundreds of pages.In between there are numerous vignettes - Forest Johnson, Jr., fires an illiterate man and Forest's dissolute son returns from California bringing a grandson who's soon embroiled in family strife. The Soules, Lloyd's wife's people, lose their family farm to the bank. A young Soule falls in love with a middle-aged cousin of Lloyd's, a man on parole, suffering from clinical depression. They marry and as the husband loses his job, she becomes pregnant. Many of these stories end badly; some Chute simply abandons. Each absorbs the reader; none are fully resolved.Finally Gwen Curry comes back, a rich, very rich, widow of an industrialist, a symbol of all the things gone wrong in Egypt. Her attaction to Lloyd, educated former hippie, man of all work, crusader, prankster, is instant. He is more ambivalent.How Chute resolves this final conflict adds to the reader's frustration. Such magnificent writing, so often leading nowhere. And towards the end, Chute cannot resist long preachy passages explaining what's wrong with America even though she just spent 500 pages showing us. But Chute is worth reading for the breadth and beauty of her language and characters - even if you turn the last page and throw the book across the room."},{"Title":"Merry Men","review":"Chute's cyclonic novel absolutely captivated me and revealed a world within the state in which I live, but one that will always exist outside of mine as an &quot;outer-stater&quot;. The characters, their struggles and disappointments were utterly realized. However, I have a problem with Lloyd's final &quot;Robin Hood&quot; act. For nearly 700 pages, Chute gave us an utterly endearing and sensitive character in Lloyd Barrington, one who NEVER hurt anyone and only acted against faceless corporations. For him to act so contrary to that nature was unfounded, no matter the economic status of an individual. Any feedback?"},{"Title":"Merry Men","review":"Makes _The Beans_ seem like a primer -- and I like _Beans_.The characters move in and out of our view like players in anAltman movie; as I am sad to leave one scene, so I amdelighted by whoever shows up next.I think the ending is somewhat contrived and untrue to (atleast my own version of) the protagonist, but that's a matterfor discussion; other minds might differ. Shall we talk?"},{"Title":"Merry Men","review":"Living in a small Maine town, I can attest to the veracity of Chute's vision. The characters are well-realized. Many scenes are breath-takingly well-written. Two problems with the novel: (1) It would be better without Chute's sermons about the grotesque evils of hunting &amp; corporate America. (2) It would be a great novel with a different ending. The final act of the protagonist, Lloyd Barrington, is uncharacteristically &amp; gratuitously cruel. That Chute had to change her protagonist's personality shows that she did not know how to end this wonderful, sprawling novel."},{"Title":"Merry Men","review":"I learned from this book. It's not uncommon for me to pick up some history or a sweet turn of phrase from a novel, but this book offers lives and generations that go through something that I've only read about in news articles -- the end of family farming, of family land ownership, of small town economies that can't hold up against corporate takeovers -- not of other corporations -- but of farmland, local employment, local shopping, local banking, local medicine.This book is not a political diatribe, although the message is very clear. It's the stories of how it happened, from the perspective of the people it happened to, most of whom are not big thinkers (though not stupid). But a few are thinkers, and what they say and what they do creates a kind of hot thread through this book -- not necessarily of hope, but of resistance, while the world and the prospects of the people who once owned Egypt, Maine, gets smaller, poorer and more dependent of the roughest kind of shared resources.Because of the way this book is written, often with no expressed emotions, only fact seen through a narrow lens of personal interest, I often didn't \\"get\\" what I'd read until a few hours after I put it down. And then the historical and emotional context of scenes just blew open my heart. These people do not complain. They may be cynical, angry, depressed, but they just keep going. They are parts of family clans that keep moving as a whole. There are virtually no abandoned people or hermits in this book. But it's clear that the adults, as the book ends, are the last ones with memory of their ownership of another life. Their children will be rootless and virtually homeless except for their relationships, the concept of clan evolving probably to gang.This is an apocalyptic novel without redemption. But it is so rich, in detail and character, that it carried me along. I had to get away from it to gain some perspective on what I was reading, to occasionally cry. (And I never cry over novels.)I don't know how much reality this story is built on. But one reason I was particularly greatful to read it is that I live in the mid-Hudson valley in New York, which has been an historically agricultural economy until relatively recently, when it became harder for farmers and dairies to survive against the economic pressures exerted by agribusinesses and chain supermarkets. And then the summer residents and 9/11 refugees from New York warped the real estate prices, driving up property taxes. The township where I live is much changed from even 20 years ago. Fortunately the local government is still largely in the hands of long-term thinkers who value the place as it was.There is probably basically more outside money here than at Egypt, Maine, where the local economy was more vulnerable because it was so insular. But that's not something to depend on. And this book, lovely and touching and fascinating and explosively human as it is, is most of all a lesson in history that hopefully some few other agricultural communities will be able to avoid, or rebound from."},{"Title":"Merry Men","review":"This book is not comfortable reading. Its canvas is tiny (and familiar, if you've read Chute's other novels)---the small rural Maine town she calls \\"Egypt.\\" Despite the smallness of the place, the scope of \\"Merry Men\\" is sprawling. Like a Russian novel, it has a list of characters at the beginning, although, as Chute says, \\" . . . only a few characters are central. The rest are walk-ons, like the people you see only to say \`Hi' to in the P.O. . . . Please do not struggle to keep everyone straight.\\" Given the ongoing constriction of the postal service since the book's publication in 1994, bumping into one's neighbors at the post office is hardly likely, but Chute's advice is good. Find some time when you get into a novel of this length and give yourself up to it.Chute's style demands that you pay attention. Characters appear and then disappear for long periods of time. Conflicts may be resolved, or not. Characters from her other books show up, and you feel, \\"Ah, I know you from somewhere,\\" as if they were real people. In a sense, they are. With the surnames one encounters just about anywhere in Maine--Plummer, Moody, Soule, Cole, Plummer, and Bean --they populate Egypt in such human variety that they create their own complete world. One of the protagonists, Lloyd Barrington, goes off to get an education but ends up back in Egypt; any small town has someone like him. Aneeka DiBias, another protagonist, leads a local protest against the excesses of the hunting culture that thrives in Egypt; the story is based on actual Maine hunting accident that killed a woman in her backyard. Forest Johnson, also a central character, is as perfect a depiction of a small town road commissioner as you'll ever see. There is a whole gallery of quirky oddballs: Unk Walty, with his gift for creating papier-mache likenesses of real people, to macabre effect; David Moody, the minister turned philosophical well driller; David Turnbull--the biker creaking with leather, with a creepy dog named King in his lap; Carroll Plummer, the alcoholic whose second chance at a happy life is so heartbreakingly destroyed.The characters in \\"Merry Men\\" don't mean much to anyone beyond Egypt. Someone loses his family farm to the bank, someone else ends up living in a car camper. A couple loses their first child because the hospital is reluctant to treat the wife and they have (surprise!) no health insurance. Jobs with logging operations pay, until the companies leave, having despoiled the landscape.These kinds of characters, along with their precarious economic situations, don't mean much to some readers, either. See Ann Hulbert's contemptuous review in the New York Times when the book was published. She practically wore out her thesaurus with words like \\"hicks,\\" \\"rustic,\\" \\"cramped,\\" \\"provincial,\\" \\"primitive,\\" \\"grotesque,\\" and \\"yokel.\\" No doubt a novel that examined a cross-section of a New York City block in all ITS minute detail would be, by contrast, fascinatingly cosmopolitan. Hulbert, writing in 1994, noted contemptuously that the novel has \\"an air of stale populist propaganda\\" because its characters suffer at the hands of indifferent corporations, banks, agribusiness, hospitals, and schools. Today, the novel seems downright prescient. Near its close, one of the \\"rustics\\" offers a bleak view of the future: \\"'everyone will be entirely dependent on big business, and entirely created in the image of big business. Many will fail the competitive part, but they'll certainly be dependent. They will not make the grade at the fast and funny new hi-tech life. They will fall by the wayside. But there will be a place for those kind! The military. The prisons. And executions like you never saw before.'\\" Sometimes a novel can open up a world you don't live in, the better to see the one in which you do.M. Feldman"},{"Title":"Merry Men","review":"This is a great book in \\"The Great Books\\" sense of the word. It's rich and full and, amazing things seem to happen on every page. Take Rembrandt and Velasquez and Dickens and Tolstoy and have them create a portrait of Western Maine. That will give some idea of what this book like.Mrs. Chute, however, is very upset that people cannot be farmers the way they were in the Nineteenth Century.

So, what's in Houdini's Box? Read the book to unlock the secrets that it holds."},{"Title":"The Houdini Box","review":"I'm probably like a lot of people these days who were introduced to Brian Selznick throughThe Invention of Hugo Cabret. Thoroughly captivated by that book, I eagerly anticipated the release ofWonderstruckand was equally captivated by that clever story that was cleverly told.During a recent visit to the local library, I decided to explore other books Selznick had written. While he's illustrated a wide variety,The Houdini BoxandThe Boy of a Thousand Facesare the only other books that he both wrote and illustrated so I picked them up along with a few others he had illustrated.I foundThe Houdini Boxto be interesting enough but certainly not as good as I'd expected following the first two Selznick books I'd read. It's an interesting tale of a young boy named Victor who is inspired by Houdini and attempts to escape from things around his house - his grandmother's trunk and closets - and to walk through walls. After a series of events including a visit to Houdini's doorstep, Victor gives up his hopes of magic and illusion and embarks on an otherwise ordinary life. Fast forward and Victor's now a father playing ball with his son when they encounter Houdini's grave unlocking his childhood memories and fascination with the great escape artist.The illustrations are very well done and augment the story wonderfully but the story itself is a bit lacking in interest, intensity, and inspiration. It's worth reading but certainly not as great a work as his later projects. I'll return this one to the library and leave it at that rather than buying a copy for myself. I doubt I'll be eager to read it again."},{"Title":"The Houdini Box","review":"I found this book well written and the illustrations were great. I would recommend this book to anyone. The story was well written."},{"Title":"The Houdini Box","review":"I bought this book mostly because Chicago Children's Theatre was running a children's production of \\"The Houdini Box\\" which they advertise as suitable for children ages five and up. Plus, when I realized it was by the same author as the book on which the movie \\"Hugo\\" was based, that seemed like a bonus. My older daughter is five and I was considering bring her to see the production, but my parents expressed concern that the magic and escape acts might be too frightening or at least over-stimulating for her. I read the book to get a better sense, and I'm glad I did. I'm not overly concerned about the magical elements, but I just don't see much of a story that would appeal to young children, and what story there is seems rather gloomy.The first thing I noted when I received the book was the intense staring blue eyes on the front cover. Said eyes are in a face which presumably is that of Harry Houdini, and he looks none too inviting. Nevertheless, a small figure of a young boy stands next to the face, looking at it with excited curiosity. The next thing I noticed was that, despite the intense bold colors on the cover, the artwork in the book is black and white pencil sketches that, while well executed, really didn't raise my interest in the book.The story itself is about a young boy, Victor, who grows up during the height of Houdini's fame. Victor is so enthralled with Houdini that he locks himself into his grandmother's trunk, tries to hold his breath for 5,000 seconds in the bath, and makes quite a mess attempting to walk through walls. His mother decides that some time in the country with Aunt Harriet will do him some good.On the way, Victor happens to meet the master magician himself, who promises to tell him his secrets in private sometime soon. Taking the boy's luggage tag, Houdini promises to write. After this bit of excitement, needless to say, Victor's time in the country is not as restful as his mother had hoped, and Aunt Harriet is not sad to see him go.Victor does eventually get his hoped-for letter (while he happens to be locked in yet another suitcase). Victor is too eager to wait for the appointed date, so he goes straight to Houdini's house, where he learns that Houdini has died. Houdini's wife gives him a locked box, but while Victor is puzzling over the lock, he notices the letters \\"E.W.\\" engraved on the box. So it isn't even Houdini's box anyway, and that's that. Victor stuffs the box in the bottom of a closet and forgets all about Harry Houdini. The end.Okay, no, that's not the end, of course. Victor and his son Harry (unconvincingly named after Aunt Harriet) discover a clue which unlocks the secret of the nearly forgotten box. The end. For real this time.I'm tempted to go see the stage production myself just because I can't picture this story being adapted for children's theatre, but I definitely won't be bringing my daughter. The death of Houdini and the finding of the clue in the graveyard make this tale a bit too morbid for her, and even without the morbidity factor, there's not much appealing about this story without over-hyping the magical and escapism elements.Brian Selznick has built his reputation on developing obscure by true stories with a blend of real and fictional elements to create fantastical children's stories, but this one falls flat in my estimation. Older kids may want to check it out of the library, but I don't advise spending money on it, as I doubt most kids will return to the story more than once."},{"Title":"The Houdini Box","review":"I bought this for a younger grandchild.

Historical facts are so smoothly woven into the storyline it is difficult to determine the line where reality cross over into fantasy. Replications of posters, pictures and articles from the era mixed with Selznick's notable illustrations show us the emotions felt by Victor as he pursues his hero, Houdini.This is an excellent book for the family to read together. Note it was originally written to the 9-12 year age group; the publisher recently listed it for 7-10 year olds, and Amazon has pushed that down to 4-8 year olds. No!

As I was surfing this site, I saw this title pop-up and it captured my attention for two reasons - one, that it featured Houdini, and second, because my daughter had enjoyed Hugo (we read the book and watched the movie), and I thought we might enjoy this too.A cold winter's night afforded us the perfect opportunity to snuggle and read this. The story weaves in fact and fiction. Ten-year-old Victor is inspired by his idol, Harry Houdini and tries in vain to walk through walls, escape from a locked trunk, and perform magic tricks - all of which do not quite turn out right. Then a chance encounter with the great magician leads to Victor receiving a mysterious letter stating, \\"A thousand secrets await you. Come to my house...\\"This leads Victor on an adventure of sorts - he comes into possession of a box with the initials E.W., gets all upset that it is not Houdini's box, and vows never to think of Houdini ever again. It is only years later, as a grown man with a child of his own, that young Victor makes a startling discovery!The book is heavily-illustrated with Selznick's wonderful crosshatched pencil drawings, which add to the magical element of this story. There's also a brief biography of Harry Houdini, the author's explanations of his research into the Houdini Box, some early sketches, and even magic tricks that can be easily performed! There's also suggestions for further reading on Houdini. This is a book to inspire and delight!"},{"Title":"The Houdini Box","review":"I went through a phase as a child where I was really interested in Harry Houdini and magic. I read this book several times, and it really sparked my imagination. I remember being totally drawn into the story and being left with a deep feeling of wonder."},{"Title":"The Houdini Box","review":"I found this book since it appears in our fourth grade reading series. Most of my fourth graders love this story. They especially love to discuss Houdini and Magic. This is a wonderful piece of Historical Fiction for young readers."},{"Title":"The Houdini Box","review":"I was read this book when I was in 2nd grade. I absolutely loved it and checked it out from the library repeatedly. Now that I'm about to become a mom, I wanted my little boy to have it. But, I couldn't remember the name, just that it was about Houdini and a little boy. After about 4 months of searching, I finally found what seemed like it was the right book on amazon. I wasn't positive, but I bought it anyway. When I got it, I was so happy. It's the exact book, and is still as entertaining today as it was when I was 8."},{"Title":"Shooting For The Moon: The Amazing Life and Times of Annie Oakley","review":"Stephen Krensky details &quot;the amazing life and times of Annie Oakley&quot; in this engaging and creative picture book biography. From her hard and impoverished childhood in Ohio, to her young adult years as a sharpshooter and entertainer in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, the story of her life is fascinating and full of drama. Annie was resourceful and tough as nails. She knew what she wanted, and made it happen through hard work and determination. Mr Krensky's interesting and informative text, draws on Annie Oakley's own autobiographical writings, and is enhanced by Bernie Fuchs' marvelously expressive and evocative oil paintings done in dark and subdued earth tones. Together word and art paint a portrait of a remarkable woman who never let anyone or anything get her down for long. With an afterword to fill in the gaps and complete the story of Annie Oakley's amazing life, Shooting For The Moon is perfect for youngsters 5-9, and is definitely an introductory biography that shouldn't be missed. As Annie always told everyone...&quot;Aim at a high mark and you will hit it. No, not the first time, nor the second, and maybe not the third. But keep on aiming and keep on shooting. Finally you'll hit the bull's-eye of success, for only practice will make you perfect.&quot;"},{"Title":"Shooting For The Moon: The Amazing Life and Times of Annie Oakley","review":"The book fulfilled my expectations.

It 's a historical romance ... duh ... which means they all tend to resemble one another. There's usually a strong hero and a beautiful heroine who are initially in strife, yet sexually attracted to one another. Then, the hero fights some enemy to save the heroine, and they eventually fall in love. It seems that a person would read this genre and expect it to follow a certain pattern, since all them do. I enjoyed how the author seemed to stay true to the language and dialect and lore of that era and setting, although I don't know much about it. I also really liked the hero and heroine - he ... masculine and fierce, yet vulnerable ; her ... courageous and bold. They are a good match and destined to be together. That's what romance is all about. You'll see once you read it. The only reason I gave it a four and not a five is because I personally like more eroticism.

In THE BEAUTY BRIDE by Claire Delacroix, the reader will find out one method: by auction. Alexander has become the Laird of Kinfairlie, due to the unexpected death of both parents, and one of his duties as head of the family is to make sure each of his five sisters is betrothed and married off at the proper age. Unfortunately, Madeleine, the oldest at 23, refuses to commit to anyone, since the love of her life, James, has been killed. And, with Madeleine not ready to wed, the other four sisters must wait their turn. Alexander has tried everything, but she refuses to cooperate, so he tricks her into attending the auction held at their estate, with the prime catches of the day bidding upon this fair maiden, who will soon be considered an old maid.What Alexander has not counted on is the appearance of Rhys FitzHenry, who is wanted for treason. Furthermore, Rhys decides to bid on Madeleine, and with his seemingly unlimited supply of coin, he wins, to the horror of Alexander. Rhys does have an ulterior motive. He believes that Madeleine is the long lost heir to his family's land. With him wed to his \\"cousin\\", the land will be secured under his name.Madeleine is outraged by the entire concept of this auction. Alexander has been known to be the king of pranksters but this was the ultimate insult. She runs away that night, the night of her nuptials, and lucky for her, Rhys anticipates her actions. He saves her from being raped by someone she thought she could trust, and from there, their adventures take off.This reviewer enjoyed the adventures of Madeleine and Rhys in THE BEAUTY BRIDE. Historical romances are a very specialized sub-genre, but this novel was so well done that it is possible that any fan of the romance novel will enjoy it. There is humor, adventure, as well as love in this well-written book. The characters are likeable and believable, the dialogue is realistic, and although one cannot exactly duplicate the English of the 1400's, Delacroix wrote the novel in such a way that will take the reader back in time and believe they are truly there. A touch of fantasy inhabits this novel, with one of the sister's ability to see Fairies, but it is done in such a humorous way that the reader will buy into it. This is the first in a three part series, and this reviewer is looking forward to the next two books."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"Setting - Kinfarlie Castle, Scotland, 1421 --- With a depleted treasury and forecasts of a bad harvest, Alexander, the new laird of Kinfarlie was in a quandry. He had five sisters and the eldest, Madeline, refused to marry. Discussing his problem with his cousin, they come up with the plan to \`auction off' the \`jewel' of Kinfarlie - namely Madeline. The auction, to take place at his Uncle's nearby keep of Ravensmuir, would be offered only to the worthiest of men whom Alexander knew would be good to his sister. Naturally, Alex kept this plan a secret until Madeline walked into the hall and the bidding took place! Furious, Madeline couldn't stop the auction. Although in shock, she bravely faced this humiliation -thinking it an ill-conceived prank by her brother. When the purported outlaw and traitor, Rhys FitzHenry won her hand, she even endured his claiming kiss, which shook her to her very core. But, no matter - never the obedient child - she wasn't about to stick around for the wedding.The night before the wedding she ran away, never believing that Rhys would pursue her. But, as her hastily, ill-planned escape progressed, she was very glad he did as he came to her rescue. Contrite, Madeline was now fairly resolved to her fate and open to taking a chance with the enigma that would soon be her husband as they traveled to a nearby abbey to be married. Rhys consummated their union into a sensual dance of physical passion that convinced Madeline to work at making this a real marriage as she was determined do all in her power to discover his secrets, and in spite of his reticence, Madeline began to lose her heart.Rhys, continued substituting folk tales in answer to her many questions until he realized that he had, of all things, fallen in love with his courageous wife. Rhys knew she might soon discover the true reason for his mad dash to Wales and he decided to be honest by answering all of her questions. He knew that she might end up hating him but loving her as he did, he would forfeit his own happiness for her.In this first novel of Ms. Delacroix's brand new trilogy, the Jewels of Kinfarlie, I found an exciting action tale fully packed with an assortment of well-defined forceful characters, both old and new. Along with the wonderfully strong and engaging protagonists, Madeline and Rhys, I enjoyed the highly mischievous little fairy spriggan, Darg, and Madeline's youngest sister Elizabeth, who was the only person able to both see and communicate with the spriggan. AND, I certainly will be anxious to see what I hope will be a future confrontation between Tynan and Rosamunde - boy does he deserve a swift kick! BOTTOM LINE - This is a prime example of the highly imaginative and entertaining novels Delacroix is celebrated for in a stellar start to what looks to be a sensational new medieval series that is heading straight for my \`keeper shelf'!. ---- Marilyn Rondeau, for www.historicalromancewriters.com ---"},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"I enjoyed this story for the most part. The lowered rating is due to (a few, but very noticeable) grammar issues and a few plot holes/unresolved dilemmas, with an Other Man who is pure foil. It is also very formulaic, but that's not here nor there.PROS:-Roguish H and non-quivering h-Stories within Stories (H is a story-teller who tells many stories)-Engaging story itself-Good writing style for the most part (not the whole part, sadly).-Can easily be standalone. Though the sampling shown of the second book is a very horrid cliffhanger!CONS:Some things that I had issues with:* numerous errors - missing words, wrong words used, messy punctuation. For the most part it didn't interfere with the story, but it did trip me up quite a bit. (Location 3138- \\"He a deliberate glance over the contents of...\\" or Loc 3931, \\"'...prefer not to be seen,' Madeline concluded, no censure in her town.\\") I've never felt a need to start highlighting so much. There are more, but those are just to show how it can break you from the book.* Author changing sporadically from third person into 2nd person POV. Yes, second person. Where the audience is being actively spoken to by the author. Perhaps this is intended to make it seem as if the author is telling a tale like Rhys does, but it just isn't appreciated by this reader nor does it add a homey/earthy tone to the story. Of course this only happens when she's talking about fairies or spriggens.* fairies and spriggens. Just seemed kinda ... pointless. The bit about the ribbons was interesting, but eh, still kinda made it lame. Wasn't really a fairy story and yet it tries so hard to be. To the point of it taking away from the story.* Unrealistic characterizations: The sisters at the wedding feast, eager to sell h's most intimate secrets for a laugh, completely trusting a stranger they'd just been terrified of a few hours earlier. The brother being well-loved and forgiven no matter how much of a ____ he is. The H never making concessions and the h accepting it all. He showeth her much scorn but she hath not much fury. An Uncle who goes from not caring what people think of him to being a complete prude suddenly.* no resolutions on a half dozen of the H's boorish/trollish statements. \\"If you don't want me to cheat on you, then you better give me a male heir.\\" Heroine than screams and rants and then says \\"You're absolutely right. Let's get jiggy.\\" It's not so much that it's a different culture he comes from or (blahblahblah whatever justification he gives) as much as I felt she should stick to her guns on the matter. Until he ceded the principle at the least. As opposed to \\"I'm gonna love doing it too!\\" maybe he would say \\"It is regrettable that I may need to boink someone else if you hit menopause before giving me a boy child. I assure you I will find no joy in the matter SHOULD IT HAPPEN, GD FORBID, and will even let you pick her out so that you know she will truly mean nothing to me.\\" (Yes, I get that he was born to someone other than his father's wife and everything, but again, cede the principle if you claim to love her so much and don't want to lose her!). There are other trollish things he says, but that really bugged me. Le Scoundrel!* The whole bit with Rosemunde and her (foster?)brother. *minor spoiler* Just didn't make sense about the whole cheating her out of her inheritance thing and is she a pirate? Why would her parents let her be a pirate? They did adopt her, right? Just confusing and the way it was resolved was rather unsettling.* The brother is a piece of *censored* and yet they keep loving and forgiving him and thinking so highly of him even when he arranges for one sister to be auctioned and *MAJOR SPOILER FOR SECOND BOOK?* his second sister to be raped in her sleep i.e. have a disfigured exboyfriend sneak into her room without her knowledge/consent and have sex with her so she'll be forced to marry him. This is only because he's not allowed to auction his sisters off anymore. *END SPOILER*Some loose ends, grammar issues, unrealistic behaviors (everyone is ultra forgiving and accepting of everything right away). Traditional Romance, if formulaic. Engaging and fun to read (for the most part).Not bad."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"I could not put this down, I read into the night (while hubby watched his \\"boob tube\\"). This is so well written and much more than \\"just\\" a romance story. The author has done her research as well as captured the heart. there is intrique and adventure as well as flavor of the era. I am hungry to read more of 'Jewels of Kinfairlie\\". The characters all invite to read more of their stories. I may have to read it again it was so well done."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"This book did not make sense. SPOILERS AHEAD.*******The whole premise of the family chasing after the couple is nonsensical and ahistorical. First, didn't anyone at the abbey tell the family that the couple married and had consummated the marriage? If so, why the heck where they chasing them, especially with the ole fiance. Second, even if no one informed the family of the marriage, the woman would have been ruined having spent so much time in the company of a man . . . alone! These facts alone, should have stopped the search once the family realized that the two were together.Third, the family sends two women unaccustomed to such to search for the missing sister. Seriously? Who would send a child on a mission like that? What would be the point? And what purpose does it serve to send the 2nd oldest daughter? None. The idea that two untried, young riders are merrily chasing after the oldest sister with no mention of fatigue or mishap or anything else was just nuts.This was a lightweight book. No logic to the story. You have to suspend not only belief but also common sense. At least it was free."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"I read this a couple of days ago and I didn't make any notes while reading, which I now regret. Oh well. Sorry!I remember enough of it anyway. This book (THE BEAUTY BRIDE - by Claire Delacroix) was so formulaic that you probably needn't bother reading much past the first few chapters, where all of the characters are introduced, but I did anyway.Sure, it was entertaining. I read the whole book, didn't I? But I'm blessed with fast reading speed, and I believe I read the whole thing in one or two sittings. Even with the entertainment factor, the book was uninspired and the writing tepid, at best.The narrative follows Madeline and Rhys, one either Irish or Scottish and the other Welsh. I never could figure out exactly what she was supposed to be, but it didn't really matter too much. Her hand is auctioned off by her brother, who needs the money for something, and this... Welshman? Is that a word? Well, he buys it. We have an escape from her terrible fate, a near rape, a fairy, her old beloved betrothed coming back, some lies and deception, a near death, a journey by sea, and even a daring rescue from a dungeon.Thrown in with all of this rollicking adventure are some incredible cliches and plain bad writing. This woman must have taken an English class sometime in the past, what ever happened to that old rule of using 'said'? What's wrong with a good old 'said'? On pages where more then two characters were speaking I was pulled out of the story with all of the instances where a word was used (asked, suggested, queried, etc) that would have been invisible as 'said'. Another of my largest pet peeves was the usage of the word 'spouse' where she must have meant 'husband', or 'wife', or another other romantic word. Because honestly, I never refer to my husband as my spouse. How formal that sounds! I would write it that way on government forms, not in a romance novel. She does it so often that it feels stiff and unnatural.But even if I didn't have these (petty, to be sure, but I am a writer myself so I notice these things) complaints my largest disappointment would have been the plot. The old betrothed, the one that Madeline remembers so fondly (James), is portrayed in the worst light possible. Lazy, uncaring, and not even good at his chosen profession. This is because the new husband (Rhys) really has no chance against any serious competition... he's a traitor, a liar, a coward (running away from her family! To what end?), almost kills her and even tells her flat out that he'll cheat on her if she can't give him sons (which never really gets resolved, except for her fervent desire to have sons). I kept expecting each of these revelations to be much more serious than they ended up being. Relationship ending, huge arguments. But they both just kinda roll with it, James is dispatched without even a last scene to cushion the blow (he is simply banished from the plot), they dispatch the final bad guy, who is thrown in without warning in the last chapter, and live happily ever after.Was it worth it? I would have to say no. It was confusing, nonsensical, and poorly executed. Sorry, Claire. You get good reviews anyway, somehow."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"This was an excellent book. I found a few minor mistakes, but they were nothing compared to the enthralling story. I almost didn't download this one, because I had read THE COUNTESS, enjoyed it, but did not enjoy the graphic sex. There is some of that in this book, but the couple is married, and it wasn't as bad as in THE COUNTESS. In fact, this book was so good, I could do no less than give it five stars. Claire DelaCroix can definitely write. I just wish I could nudge her toward the Christian market."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"I loved the whole jewels of kinfairlie series. It got kind of predictable but still entertaining. I could not put the book down once started."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"The Beauty Bride is the first in The Brides of Kinfarlie Series and yes it is a reprint but if you haven't had a chance to read this series or this author give it a try. Claire Delacroix has long been a favorite of mine, although lately she has been sneaking around as Deborah Cooke and writing some wonderful Dragon Stories.. but Beauty is pure Claire. Intricate, interesting, detailed, sensual, simply divine.The new Laird of Kinfarlie has all sorts of troubles, first off winter is not that far off and he just can't imagine how he is going to be able to feed his family.. and he has not 1, not 2 not 3, not 4 but FIVE sisters to marry off.. and none of them will marry before the eldest and she is just not willing. Head in hands not sure what to do, he decides to auction of the Jewel of Kinfarlie in a private auction. Of course he doesn't bother to tell any of his sisters about this. One would think this would be bad enough but once they get to their uncle's keep, the youngest sister, Elizabeth starts seeing fairies. An ugly, malicious faerie, determined to cause as much mischief as possible.Lady Madeline is on pissed off sister. To think not only is her brother auctioning her off, yes that's right auctioning her off but it's at her Uncle's Keep and both her aunt and uncle are involved.. Determined to not be sold as cattle or chattel she tries to devise a means of escape.. Finally leaving the keep in the dead of the night with only one guard for protection she is off. Of course said guard is not there to guard her...Rhys FitzHenry, the bastard son of a Welsh lord branded a traitor to the crown, is determined to gain title to his home. Thinking that Madeline is in actuality the long lost child of the missing heir he determines to purchase her, marry her and claim his castle. Easy Peasy.. *rolls eyes* Men really can be clueless. Sure he buys his bride, but before he can even think of marrying her he must track her down. Saving her from being raped isn't enough now he must find the quickest way to marry her and get them to Welsh soil.You have to feel for Rhys, this man faces ridiculous obstacles, a recalcitrant bride, a greedy aunt who wants to gain Madeline's bride price as a dower for her abby, family hunting them down and a former fiance say, the love of Madeline's life back from the dead.. On the run from just about everyone these two meet as equals in their marriage and learn just what a real marriage consists of. Working together to survive seems to be the perfect environment for a couple to bond. To discover just what real love can be..I am so glad to see this series in reprint and am looking forward to reading the entire series and can't wait until the continuation series begins next spring..Shauni"},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"Charming with good characters.

The story line was a bit different from anything I've read in the past which is great because we all know the same plot can get so played out.Madeline's brother loves her but he can't get her to marry. She wanted to marry a musician named James but he is believed to be dead and she refuses to accept the likelihood of his death although it has been almost a year. Her brother devises a plan to auction her hand which will help financially with them as well since they are sure the crops are going to be less this year.

I just can't see her behaving the way she did in the story. Another thing that annoyed me was the frequent editing mistakes because they interrupted the flow of the story.

I ended up finishing this book in about 24 hours I think, and then devoured the second one in even less time! The only complaint I can even begin to have is that sometimes the words Claire uses are a little hard to understand in the context or just sound odd, but that is honestly nothing compared to the amazing story she tells!"},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"I could not put this down, I read into the night, after midnight. This is so well written and you get wraped up in each person as they arrive in the book, waiting to hear their background and each personality. there is intrique and adventure as well as flavor of the era. I am excited to read more of the 'Jewels of Kinfairlie\\" series, canit wait to get the next one. I received an email stating this one was free, I can undertand why becuase once you read this one you are online serching the next ones in the series to purchase them aswell :D. Thank you Mrs. DelaCroix for such an amazing story which tugged my heart, had me on the edge in the action, and hot in bothered with the love scenes. I love the fact the family who no matter what happens to them or between them will stand with each other."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"I enjoyed The Beauty Bride and intend to read more books by Claire Delacroix. The story is fast paced and kept my interest throughout. I had read a contemporary book by Deborah Cooke (Claire Delacroix) and decided to try one of her historical novels. This is the first in a series and I plan to read them all."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"This is a great read and a very well written story. I found it contemporary, although it is written as a \\"once upon a time...\\" The writer puts words together very well, and the story flows as if told in prose. The only thing I didn't like was the name. I really think it would attract many more readers if it were simply titled; The Jewel of Kinfairlie, because the title; The Beauty Bride may lead one to believe that this is a dime a dozen romance novel, but it is so much more. This is a really enjoyable story with very likable characters that support strong family values and loyalty (well for the most part). I really liked it. Not too much romance, but enough, and a really well told tale. Well done."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"At first I thought I'd have this book on my Kindle for days when I had absolutely nothing better to do. However, once I started, I couldn't put it down. It has all the ingredients required for an amazing story - adventure, romance, a true hero, a damsel, passion, sweetness, roughness, tenderness - it's all there. After finishing it in a day, I immediately purchased the other books in the series, and they are equally great."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"I read books for entertainment, and I love historical romance. This book did not disappoint me with the head strong woman, and the brooding hero. It showed what all young woman go through when it comes to the opposite sex at the teen years be it historical or present day. They are never sure if the man really likes/loves them. The book had a lot of interesting twist and turns, of family relationships.I like the fact that she was fearless in what she had to do at the end of the book for her love. Don't know if I could have done that.I have now purchased the rest of the books in this group and can not wait to read."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Will definitely read the others in the series."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"I bought this book for free and initially I was looking at a bunch of Welsh names I couldn't pronounce and Scotland laird this and treasure that....but the fae Durg caused havoc and the fact that only Elizabeth could see her sort of kept the action hopping. But let me begin again: Alexander is the eldest brother of his family and he realizes that his family, noble though they are, will be broke utterly and completely within a year. So he needs to marry off his little sisters, but the oldest of them refuses to be married. He decides to have an auction after the idea is put into his head and it doesn't go the way he expects it to.So what's Madeline to do? The man who buys her comes completely out of nowhere. Meantime the man, Rhys, has a reputation and a closed mouth to everything except stories and tales. But he proves himself to her as a man in almost all the important ways and Madeline learns the hard way to trust herself and her family pays the price. It was slow to start but the book was good and entertaining. I just bought the second one (full price) because Ms. Delacroix has written a medieval world that intrigued me. Plus Madeline had intelligence and spunk which I like in a heroine. Even better is that Alexander and Rhys were not just one dimensional characters. Yes, this plotline is not entirely new but the way it twisted and turned was unique and entertaining. I'd recommend it to others who like a fair amount of historical-tinges to their books, a little sex, a lot of family meddling, and a pinch of fey."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"The story started off as fascinating. You have stolen treasures, a beautiful setting and an auction not only for the stolen treasures but for the Jewel of Kinfairlie. The relationship between the siblings is so typical that I couldn't help but smile at them harassing each other. Lady Madeline's relationship with her brother showed me that she wouldn't be happy with any of the men that her brother invited to marry her and that Rhys FitzHenry might be her only chance at real happiness. The only trouble is getting the two of them to actually admit it to each other and themselves. I'm looking forward to reading the stories of the other sisters."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"What a wonderful story. I loved how Welsh tales and parables were woven through the story.

I loved the description of the political situation in England, Wales and Scotland during the 1400. Since I do not know much about British history, I am assuming that what the author gave is accurate.But, the accuracy (or the inaccuracy) of the historical bits mentioned is not the reason why I gave the book only 4 stars when the title of this review is \\"Amazing\\". It's because the book dragged a bit, it took me almost a week to finish it when it should have been finished in a day or a max of two days.The protagonists, Rhy and Madeline are adorable actually. Even the supporting characters are fun to read about specially knowing that we will definitely meet them in the future wherein they would be the leading characters in another book.But, for some reason that I cannot pinpoint, the book was dragging. :-( I kept on putting it down yet I want to know how Rhy and Madeline resolved their feelings for each other.What I love about the book is the voice. It was written in such a manner that you can actually imagine the characters living in 15th century Scotland and Wales. I don't have an idea how they spoke but I can tell you that they don't speak English the way we do. And that's the reason why I like the book a lot. I'm reading it in the English I'm used to yet the voices I hear in my head when I read the dialogue are from another time.I'm looking forward reading the rest of the series"},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"Its been quite some time since I've picked up a romance novel...but once I started I could not put The Beauty Bride down.Set in the wilds of medieval Scotland and Wales, the story of Madeleine Lammergeier and Rhys FitzHenry is captivating and full of intrigue with the breathtaking country serving as both the backdrop and a character.Having just lost their parents in a tragic accident, the Lammergeiers of Kinfairlie are faced with a deficit in revenue from their holdings to see them and their vassals through the fast approaching winter. Alexander, eldest brother and newly appointed Laird of Kinfairlie, is faced with the task of seeing his brothers fostered out and his sisters wed in order to save the estate. Madeleine, being the eldest and most reluctant, shall be married off first...but she is steadfast in her refusal as she has sworn to wait for her lost betrothed even though he was killedvin battle in far away France. Madeleine has forced Alexander's hand and sets in motion a scheme so dastardly that she may never forgive her family. A scheme that goes horribly awry at the arrival of a dark and dangerous stranger...a marked man wanted by the crown for treason.Intrigue, danger, escape & pursuit through a wild and untamed land....The Beauty Bride is everything one wants in an adventure with a wealth of romance woven in."},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"Great love story.

The depth of love/pain/mis-trust etc., is well developed in the characters in short order to allow you to feel familiar with them quickly, become invested in their story and root for or against them in earnest.

Adding to his woes is that he feels he must find spouses for his sisters, but has no money to fund them, let alone feed them. The oldest female Madeline refuses to wed anyone since her betrothed died during the assault on Rougement.Heeding the advice of his Aunt Rosamunde to auction the \\"jewel of Kinfairie\\". Alexander holds a bidding war amongst acceptable suitors. A stunned Madeline learns she is the jewel and even more shocking regally declared traitor Rhys FitzHenry wins the bidding leaving an angry spoiled Reginald Neville seeking mischief. Meanwhile Madeline's sister Elizabeth insists she sees a fairy on her sibling's shoulder, only Rhys takes her seriously. Unbeknownst to all except perhaps Elizabeth, an angry fairy seeks revenge against Rosamunde and kin for selling off treasures at the auction. As an outraged Madeline thinks of fleeing, Rhys begins to win her over, but soon is stunned when the woman he bought to produce an heir steals his heart.THE BEAUTY BRIDE is an enjoyable fifteenth century Scottish romance with a wee bit of the supernatural. The story line can seem a bit complicated with eight siblings amongst other players to delineate between, but Claire Delacroix does a great job of seven degrees of separation. Though Alexander's actions seem dishonorable, fans will commiserate with his dilemma. Readers will receive immense enchantment from a warm paranormal historical starring two fabulous lead protagonists and a horde of support players, human and fairy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Beauty Bride","review":"I don't read many romances, but this one looked intestine and I'm glad I took a chance on it.

I purchased the 1st edition in November in order to start planning our trip to Maui in June. One of the reasons I purchased this book (in addition to &quot;Frommer's Maui&quot;) was because the cover of the book states &quot;Updates at dummies.com&quot;. So, I figure this meant that up to date information would be provided on that website (as far as Hotel recommendations, restaurants, activities..etc..). Well, after reading the book and making many notes, I went to the website and perused the ENTIRE site..went to the travel section...located the book but could not find any reference to any &quot;updates&quot;. All that was there was information on ordering books. So, I wrote 2 emails to them asking about the &quot;updates&quot; and have not received one word in response. So, has anyone out there actually been successful in getting updates or does this simply mean that we have the opportunity to purchase the 2nd and 3rd editions of Hawaii for Dummies online at dummies.com?

But after flipping through books at the local bookstore looking for a good guidebook for my honeymoon trip to Oahu and Kauai next October, I finally decided on this one. It's got great maps, for one thing, as well as extensive lists of hotels, places to eat, and things to do. Because the descriptions are full of personal anecdotes, I really trust that Leas has seen and done it all herself and she's being straight with me about what she thinks -- traditional travel guides always make me nervous because they're written in the third person. If I'm going to spend ... on a vacation, I really want to know what things I should do and what things I shouldn't!Possibly the greatest feature, though, is the fact that at least 75% of the entries for places and activities have web site URLs. Even though the book is extremely detailed and I could easily plan my entire trip without a single tap on the keyboard, I definitely love the fact that I now have the option of logging on to learn more about some of the museums and restaurants she recommends. I probably would've done searches on many of them anyway, and Leas has just saved me a step. Since I've got about a million things to do between now and my trip, every step saved is a pretty great thing! I also have to say that after reading the book, I asked a friend who had been to Honolulu several times for some tips. Every single thing he said I'd already read in Leas' book. Right down to the &quot;don't call it 'shaved' ice -- it's 'shave' ice&quot; one. When the author knows enough to help you avoid making yourself look like a disgusting tourist, you know you've picked a good guide. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Hawaii for Dummies","review":"\\"Hawaii For Dummies\\" is a good general reference, especially for first time visitors to Hawaii. I visit Hawaii on business about four times a month, and have found the information in this guide to be generally quite accurate. In any guidebook there are obviously things that are out of date, and that's especially true in a guide this compendious. Most of the inaccuracies are prices that have increased, though in my personal experiences none of the increases I have seen has been ridiculously out of line with inflation. I find that the diagrams are good for general planning, but a dedicated map of the island you are visiting is necessary for navigation.The book has several useful features including the Post-It flags to mark pages of interest (a very useful feature) and a \\"Quick Concierge\\" section in the Appendix which is a quick reference to important phone numbers and Internet addresses. The book discusses customs, weather, selecting things to see, and choosing an island. I think the author does a quite good job of explaining the pros and cons of different areas. For example, in the chapter on the Big Island, she explains that Kona is dry and has excellent beaches, while Hilo is wet and tropical and the beaches (such as they are) are places generally to avoid (although I personally love the retro feel of the city of Hilo.)I spend more time on Oahu than anywhere else in Hawaii, and the discussion of Honolulu and the rest of the island is a strong point of the book. I found the author to be generally excellent in her observations about specific venues (especially restaurants), and her choices of \\"Best of the Best\\" in all categories are generally on the money.I am amused at many of the lower-rated reviews. People should buy this guide to expose them to the basics of a new travel experience, in this case, Hawaii. This book does not have detailed travel maps for route planning, nor is it geared to eco-tourists or others who only want to see obscure and offbeat places, nor is it useful for driving while consulting the text (all criticisms levied against it in one form or another.) What it does do very well is give an average new visitor a lot of useful information that would be of assistance to a person who needed to take a survey of the highlights of Hawaii. In that regard I think it excels, and in my fairly large experience with the Hawaiian Islands, I think the author has done an excellent job of diligently serving her core market.I gave the book four stars largely for illustration issues. There are no color illustrations (except maps on the inside of the covers) and the general map coverage outside of Wakiki should be improved. Despite these issues I recommend this book for people traveling to Hawaii: it is a great resource for planning a trip (especially for those going to Hawaii for the first time); it is likewise an excellent resource to review plans and itineraries in the hotel room at night.Aloha!"},{"Title":"Hawaii for Dummies","review":"I have traveled a lot, and own a lot of travel books, but have never felt compelled to write a review of one-- until now.Three years ago, while planning our two-week honeymoon to Maui and Kauai, I bought a LOT of Hawaii books. In the planning stage, I kept finding myself returning to this book. Unlike Fodors and Frommers, the author actually makes JUDGMENTS about places and activities and tells you what the BEST of each category are. Imagine that-- rather than just providing a rote listing of the hotels on an island with a short description (and maybe a star or two), the author actually tells you which hotels to go to if you want serious romance, which are best for families, and which rooms to request (or not). Rather than listing activities, the author actually tells you which are the safest and most reliable helicopter companies, which are the best companies to to take for a private, romantic and uncrowded sailing trip. There are \\"heart\\" symbols to denote the most romantic lodging, restaurants, and activities, and they never steered us wrong. (I specifically remember one romantic restaurant, for which the book said to be sure to make a reservation, and ask the hostess to seat us outside at exactly sunset. It was a perfect suggestion, and I will never forget that evening.) Once we arrived on the islands we were visiting, we used the book almost exclusively (our other books found their way to the backseat of our convertible and stayed there). It was incredibly accurate.Since that first trip, my husband and I have returned to the islands multiple times, and our book has been put to such good use that it is practically falling apart. The other Hawaii books are still in pristine condition!(As an aside, I also highly recommend www.fodors.com for planning Hawaii travel-- go to the message boards, which are searchable. Forget the other books; this book and fodors.com are all you need for a perfect trip!)"},{"Title":"Hawaii for Dummies","review":"I have bought several guides to Hawaii and I find this one the worse. Not only does it pilfer much of the information from Frommer's Hawaii, but it has so many inconsistancies you really don't know which path to follow eg. The Bus fare is shown on some pages as $1 and other $1.50, but in fact The Bus fare is now $2. This was suppose to be the 2003 version, but much of the information was out of date, speaking about the Pleasant Hula Show (formally Kodak Hula Show) which is no longer is existance. If you want to travel on a tight budget, don't look for accommodation in this book, you won't find any.Save your money and buy Lonely Planet Guides as they have more details, are more current and cater to people on different budgets."},{"Title":"Hawaii for Dummies","review":"This was my least favorite.

Liked that I had good maps for each island in one book. Saw a few other tourists with the same book and all had positive things to say.Restaurants I tried were ok; not great. But the prices are higher here than the mainland so I didn't go to many upscale places like normal. I ended up asking the conceirge for recommendations which were better and not in the book.However, the attractions and beaches were spot on. All great. And the advice on where to stop was excellent. If we had stopped at every \\"lookout\\" point or \\"scenic\\" stop, we would have never seen anything.

It was our first trip out there and I used it for just about everything--beaches, booking activities, renting snorkel gear, restaurants. It had great advice for those areas. We stayed at Lahaina Shores and I'm not sure why it wasn't listed in the book. It's a simple, moderately priced establishment but is right on the beach, staff is friendly and is just a few blocks from downtown Lahaina. We also strayed from the Luau suggestions and ended up picking the Royal Lahaina Luau. We really enjoyed that one.

I was only 14 years old, and I planned the entire trip with the sole help of this book. It gives you a phone number, address, and website (if applicable) for each place listed. I cannot stress enough the wealth of accurate information that's in this book.It starts out by telling you a little about each island, so you can decide which island(s) you want to visit. It then has a part on every island, including a &quot;Before You Arrive,&quot; &quot;Setting In On (Island),&quot; &quot;Fun On and Off the Beach,&quot; and more!Definitely a great buy - it has marginal icons for kid-friendly, romantic, bargain, and tips for each activity.

There is no better book than the Hawaii for Dummies to take along with any other book on Hawaii which is more specific.This is a place to start, before you even book your trip. Read it from cover to cover a while before you go, and take it with you, too.Most of the 'must-sees' are right on. Gives you a road map, before embarking on your chosen islands and itineraries."},{"Title":"Hawaii for Dummies","review":"The Dummies series is known for providing practical, easy to understand information to get you started on any topic. The Dummies book for Hawaii does this same thing - black and white, highlights, with short descriptions.It's important to understand this. This book has quality information - and they are helped out by the Frommer's team, so you are getting Frommer's advice here in the book. However, there are no lush full-color photos to help you absorb the beauty of Hawaii. There are not turn by turn directions to get to those secret locations like the Southernmost Point in the United States.The book does shine at what it provides. If you're looking for hotels, other travel books often skim over this information. The dummies book provides price ranges, 'best' choices and explains exactly what to look for based on your needs. You get phone numbers, website URLs and details about parking and specials.The same is true for restaurants. You're told what items on the menu are worth ordering, what seats give the best views and what is great for romantic couples vs for families. Often you are just on a given island for a day or two and don't have time to figure these things out for yourself. Following the advice can make the difference between a so-so dinner and an evening you will remember for a lifetime.The book in general is a great reference for people who are going to stay on land, with its heavy emphasis on hotels and restaurants. People who are cruising will find it far less helpful. It's description of the famous black sand beach on the big island of Hawaii is super short. The Southernmost Point gets 2 sentences and you aren't even told how to get there. The book is thick - but all in black and white, so you miss out on the gorgeous atmosphere of Hawaii. You learn how to find a good taco, but not the meaning behind the location you are visiting.So I'd suggest this book primarily for people who are staying on land, and make sure this isn't the only book you get. Go through this book to choose your hotels and restaurants, but get another book or two to go into the background of the location and to map out the sights you wish to see."},{"Title":"Hawaii for Dummies","review":"I bought this book from Amazon because I had borrowed several from the library and thought this one was one of the best."},{"Title":"Hawaii for Dummies","review":"Very helpful and fun.

The author provides an indepth description of each island, complete with maps, etc. Each island has its own chapter so it is easy to find the info you are looking for. She provides resort and lodging information (she then provides a map showing all the locations of the lodgings she's provided) for each island along with a dining guide and activities to do. She also provides info on how to get there, pros and cons, tourist traps; you name it and it is in there! An excellent resource and very easy to read and understand.

I read it cover to cover, and felt very well-informed about all of our travel and accomodation choices.

The books include tips, heads up, bargain alert, kid friendly, best of the best, and local know how symbols in the left margins to highlight certain information.

This book is easy and fast to read but very informative, which is exactly what I wanted.The book gives summary descriptions and helps you decide between the islands first, then goes more in depth on all each island has to offer. Add the internet to this to flesh out the author's information a bit more and you will be set. The maps were good here too for Waikiki: I never got lost as I drove around, amazingly enough, even though my Hawaiian born friend and her friends did!! The hardest part was just trying to decide between all the attractions/entertainment Hawaii had to offer: the author is thorough, and there was nothing I hadn't already been introduced to by the author when I got to the islands."},{"Title":"The Little Giant Encyclopedia of One-Liners","review":"I have to admit I was highly skeptical when I bought this book. I buy lots of joke books (I'm an entertainer) and a lot of times if I circle the jokes I liked I find I circled one of two. NOT IN THIS ONE! This is truly a &quot;little giant encyclopedia&quot;: small but quite THICK. These aren't jokes jokes that go on forever but short, punchy one-liners. And although this book DOES have some from famous current and legendary comedy mavens, it has a LOT of original stuff. Gene Perret (Bob Hope's former writer who has a lot of GREAT books he has penned himself) compiled and wrote this with Terry Marin -- and all I can say is that a &quot;jaded&quot; entertainer like me read this and laughed out loud. You can use these one-liners in your conversations with friends (remember that many of the BEST ad libs you see on tv are rehearsed!), for a speech, toast, roast etc. There are new ones such as: &quot;I told my doctor I couldn't lift my hands above my head. He told me to stay away from muggers,&quot; and &quot;He wore a toupee that made him look 10 years sillier.&quot; And there are ones from comedy pros: &quot;She's so fat she's got more chins than the Chinese phone directory.&quot; (Joan Rivers) and &quot;He's so old his blood type is discontinued.&quot; (Bill Dana)Jokes are divided into categories and there's a nice index so you can look up what you want when you need it. Bottom line: super quality...super-value...convenient size!"},{"Title":"The Little Giant Encyclopedia of One-Liners","review":"I was disappointed.

The photos are brilliantly gorgeous and add much excitement to the text. Schenk is clearly an enormous fan of moss as his pen scrolls simple, yet technical, information about moss throughout the text. The only qualm I have with this book is that Schenk keeps to the 2 major genus of moss. However, the photos, which might give the moss-lover ideas for a moss garden, pull the book into a text that is a must for the moss-\\"er.\\"I have a bit of an obsessive-compulsive disorder with moss.

It is the kind of book that has material both for the person who knows nothing about moss gardening and the person who is a veteran moss enthusiast. If we were more into moss and less into lawns the environment would be more healthy. We wouldn't have to pump polluting weed killers and fertilizers into our precious ground water. There is nothing more beautiful than an area of velvety moss and this book tells you how to achieve it. I'll take moss over a lawn any day.

Later we get a story about the Trade Federation going to the wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk and the wookiees deciding to fight them. There are a few other stories that just make no sense like the story about the artist who kinda, sorta, not really saves Padme from something we never see. Seriously he doesn't really save her so much as just stalks her and obsesses over her.There are other stories that are really just pointless like Palaptine fighting one of the giant worms from the Avengers movie, the head of the Techno Union Guild starring in what looks like a Tex Avery cartoon, and a story that looks like it belongs in Heavy Metal and stars what looks like an armored Larfleeze from the Green Lantern comics.The only GOOD story in this comic is where we see that Mon Motha had a son that was stationed on Hoth and was killed during the battle. That actually fits into continuity and does make sense, however in the timeline we are told this comic takes place outside of the Star Wars continuity so they aren't really part of the saga.***END SPOILERS*** ***END SPOILERS*** ***END SPOILERS***What was the point of making this comic to begin with? It's not part of Star Wars continuity so nothing in this book actually happened and it's all just basically fan fiction.This honestly isn't worth buying for anything other than the artwork, and the one good story from Hoth. Give this one a pass unless you can pick it up deeply discounted."},{"Title":"Star Wars Visionaries","review":"I have just read my Visionaries book and I would like to say that I 100% agree with everything nir085 says about the stories and the artwork.The book is definately worth buying if you are a fan of Star Wars and the good stories make up for the ones that are not so good."},{"Title":"Star Wars Visionaries","review":"This is a must for the Star Wars nerd in all of us! If you love all the stories that coincide with the rest of the saga, you ought to check out this book, it's a collection of several comics based on stuff in the films. It's worth a look if you really like Star Wars."},{"Title":"Star Wars Visionaries","review":"The stories were very enjoyable & added well to the Star Wars saga."},{"Title":"Star Wars Visionaries","review":"Old Wounds - My favorite tale (tale, not section). But whatever happened to Maul's origins? Was there a reason he came returned looking like the infamous Kalee more than the infamous Sith Lord? For a book that had Maul on its initial cover for multiple months, I would have hoped that there would be at least a little bit more meat on this skeletal tale. Also, isn't this story somewhat revealing?The Artist of Naboo - Not my cup of tea, this kind of work, but it would seem like a soothing drink for those who do appreciate the sort of art shown here.Wat Tambor and the quest for the sacred eye of the Albino Cyclops - Hmmm. What can I say here. It's....interesting? Seems like something that will appeal to the Star Wars Tales audience. Me? I would have rather seen Wat Tambor being beaten senselessly by his own goons. He simply doesn't come across as a character worthy of some mystical journey. Then again, I should keep in mind that it is a Star Wars Tales type of tale. There's nothing sacred about a Confederacy [pawn].Sithisis - The artist could have made it more clear as to whether or not the Sithisis fits in to the Star Wars timeline, and, if it does, then where. Great little Sith story nevertheless. Dialogue was not at all missed in this story and only made it cooler.Entrenched - I liked it. But even with that opinion in mind it begs the following question: why is there a Hoth story in a work supposed to be centered around RotS? A story about Mon Mothma's son could have been appropriately placed before A New Hope, which could have shown some of the reasoning behind her becoming an Alliance leader in the first place. The seamless Hoth tie-in with its respective ending was neat, but not the best context, in my opinion. That ending would have probably commenced either way.The Fourth Precept - Cool. I don't know what any of these couple of pages mean, but cool.Prototypes - Who's Nubyl? I'm not pointing at a flaw in the story, I'm only wondering if this is a regular. If not, then that's fine. Anyways. I'm not a Mandalorian devotee, but this tale was still enjoyable. But I did notice one fallacy (unless I missed out on something EU-related): Durge cannot speak english. There were no greater than or less than marks around his speech to denote a foreign language and his ineptitude concerning english was revealed in Obsession #4. Nothing big, really; just to the Star Wars nerd.Imperial Recruitment - The...artwork...should enamor most SW geeks. Exciting, these two pages are.Deep Forest - Pretty cool. The readers did miss out on Chewbacca, however.Celestia Galactica - ....if you do not consider this to define the word art, then buy a dictionary; please.The Eyes of Revolution - Lovely. Like the Maul tale, however, I was expecting another Grievous story, or a bit more development, as Visionaries was supposed to show-off Grievous more than anything else.To create brevity, I'd say that this should be a must-buy for any Episode III merchandise or movie lover. I haven't even seen the supplementary Eps. III guides yet, but already I know that this book is the better buy. You will not be disappointed. Especially if the few pages you have seen have been from the Dark Horse preview.Just don't expect stories leading directly into Revenge of the Sith, a la Obsession. The compilation you have here is not what this is about. The emphasis is on art, more on character origins (though obviously it is sufficient in that regard as well). Such a big emphasis, in fact, that you cannot even accurately call all of them \\"tales\\".The last thing I'm going to say goes out to AMAZON.COM - update your image [Visionaries] already; or is there some exclusive Darth Maul cover I'm missing out on?"},{"Title":"Star Wars Visionaries","review":"I bought this book for my 10year old son who'd lost his original copy.

The Author's technology is dated, but as the new edition is slated to come out in a couple of months, I think I can give him a pass on that one. What I cannot forgive is the obviously deliberate way in which he sought out the most obscure and rarely seen verbiage to describe his common non-technical analogies. My professor dismisses this with the comment that the Authors are British, but I fear it goes deeper then that.However, in the final analysis, it does not matter.

When I went to begin a more serious inquiry into it as a real career I found a lot of equally useless websites and guides that just glossed over the \\"perks\\" and didn't detail any real practical advice on this topic. Until I found Beyond the Red Carpet. This is a comprehensive book that offers a complete view of the vital role that Personal Assistants play in the world of celebrities and high profile successful people. It offers a clear list of the skills, temperments and abilities required for this job as well as sound,concrete steps that you can take to be successful in this career. At about 25 bucks you get a wealth of knowledge, know-how and insight. It covers the pitfalls, expectations and some of the frustatrations one might face as well as the upside - well balanced, clearly written and practical it's obvious that the writer knew her topic throughly - living it not just reporting or glamourizing it. Despite an incredibly tight budget, I invested the extra monies to take the actual workshop at their Atlanta headquarters and found their help invaluable. This is a professional text written by a talented, focused and knowledgeable woman and is a link to a much broader network of experience and expertise. I was frustrated and lost before attending and through the staff's help, the information from this text and meeting other dynamic individuals pursuing this challenging, but exciting career; I found the inspiration to make a new, more focused start. After getting home I rewrote my resume using their suggestions and was told that my it stood out amid over 400 who had applied for an Executive Assistant/Personal Assistant job to a local CEO. The comment by the HR person was - Yours was the first resume that made me stop what I was doing and pick up the phone to call you. I've accepted the position and am happily pursuing it as the next step to building the kind of experience that will land me a Celebrity position. Don't be fooled by the sales pitch flashy books out there. If you're serious about this as a career - get this book and look into their workshop. I found the author and her entire staff to be bright, energetic and talented business professionals with the experience and connections to make great things happen.

Tallerman's prose is clear and understandable and the examples clearly explain the concepts. The book is organized well and both indices and contents pages do their jobs well, something I've found rare in many textbooks.The questions, however, can sometimes be quirky. The data can be minimal in the extreme and instead the question itself leads the student to the answer. This can make the questions seem just a rehash of the chapter instead of exercises that develop the student's skills. Depending on the professor, it can leave students unprepared for tests and quizzes. These quirks are rare, though, and most exercises help the student well enough.I'd recommend this book for those learning syntax on their own or for really basic courses in syntax. This isn't really a graduate level book by itself, although with supplements or another more advanced text it is a great way to introduce students to syntax before moving on to the harder stuff later on in the semester."},{"Title":"Understanding Syntax (Understanding Language)","review":"It is a good introduction to linguistics, however this book doesn't necessarily focus on syntax.

I purchased the anniversary edition from a reputable dealer with 7 books in it, covered in plastic. Well, how could you go wrong with a classic collection? Very wrong. The collection had 6 normal books and 1 blank book with nothing on the cover. The big problem is that there is a design flaw in the books. The pages of the books do not fit into the cover but stick out at at least 1/8 of an inch, maybe more. My husband is an engineer and saw immediately that whoever made the books cut all pieces the same size, but since the cover was cardboard, when folded it fell short. Random House should be embarassed to put these books on the market and ask the public to pay for their mistake. It is not a few books...I checked all the others in my local store and those in my local supermarket. They are all the same! My seller tried to tell me the way the pages stuck out was so children could open the book. I don't think so. The larger hard cover versions of the book are fine, though. Look for the ones for $8.99.

Not only was she missing The Pokey Little Puppy, but in it's place was a COMPLETELY COVER TO COVER BLANK book. Also, we discovered that she had received a duplicate of Scuffy The Tugboat. The Little Golden Books were my favorite as a child, and I wanted so much for my dear, God-daughter to discover the joy of these wonderful stories.Instead, it appeared I had bought these \\"off the back of a truck\\" from a less than reputable source and for a bottom of the barrel fee.

It also makes you value the importance of spending time Him."},{"Title":"Spending Time with the Lord","review":"For centuries, Christian believers have drawn daily encouragement from reading the Bible and \\"spending time with the Lord.\\" Many have found inspiration, spiritual strength and daily encouragement to live the Christian life by reading about the Lord's life, the many inspiring stories, and examples of positive Christian character found in the Bible. This, no doubt, helps explain the popularity of the Bible today. Yet, many ambitious authors have turned this popularity into an opportunity, and made it their personal mission to write books to assist Christians seeking a deeper walk with the Lord. Some authors may also be church leaders with \\"big egos\\" that simply \\"edge God out.\\" Instead of being empowered by the Lord, they're wound up by their own charisma. Being driven by the wrong source and perhaps blinded by selfish ambition and pride, they might mistakenly consider themselves \\"spiritual authorities.\\" Adding their own Biblical knowledge, they might unknowingly attempt to become an intermediary or substitute for their reader's personal experience and relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ. Let us not forget that \\"knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.\\" The Greek word translated \\"puffs up\\" is the image of an object puffed up with wind, which might appear grand but simply has no real substance at all.An inherit danger exists whenever a church leader promotes their Bible knowledge and \\"how to\\" books in an effort to generate a following after themselves. This tree has its roots found in Genesis three. A healthy Christian might be persuaded to follow a knowledgeable church leader, but if that leader flaunts and imposes their knowledge upon the congregation, the result may be a congregation that is misdirected and misled to the Tree of Knowledge instead of the Tree of Life. When the confused woman in Genesis three saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Adam and Eve's relationship with God took a change the worse. We all know the rest of their story.\\"Be wary of false preachers who smile a lot, dripping with practiced sincerity. Chances are they are out to rip you off some way or other. Don't be impressed with charisma; look for character. Who preachers are is the main thing, not what they say. A genuine leader will never exploit your emotions or your pocketbook. These diseased trees with their bad apples are going to be chopped down and burned.\\"--Matthew 7:15-20(MSG)On Page 84, Bill Freeman writes:\\"It is an awesome thought that God uses us aschannels and allows His intentions, desires, and designsto pass through us. The more time we spend with theLord, the more opportunity we give God to have a wayon this earth through us to accomplish His purpose.\\"Bill and Pat Freeman have gone rogue. They have led many fine and innocent people astray and away from our loving God. This charismatic author's attitude has been to promote himself and his books. Yes, God may use us as channels, but this is entirely up to God! It is certainly not left up to this ambitious, high pressure, and persuasive salesman. God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. Bill appears more than presumptuous when he writes \\"God uses us as channels\\" as though he might somehow lend assistance to our omnipotent God. Frankly, instead of listening to his conscience, Bill Freeman seems to be listening to his big ego. Perhaps, if he thinks big, he should start small. Start small by actually helping the dear Christians near him and around him. Let's begin by taking proper care of the congregation that he and his wife are presently \\"shepherding\\" and then we'll see if he can be a channel for God or not!1. Two Trees--If this author and his wife were genuine channels for God, why haven't Christian believers who spent years or even decades in this author's \\"church\\" witnessed God accomplishing and fulfilling His purpose? The problem with channels is that they will eventually be filled up with something. When we talk about spiritual things, we are talking about good spiritual things or bad spiritual thing. Seriously, their source may be either God or Satan. Many of us are familiar with Don Moen's song that \\"God is good all the time.\\" God is building His church. But, in the meantime, this author and his wife have a long history of damaging individual members of their \\"church\\" congregations and even causing \\"church-splits.\\" The Freeman's \\"church-life\\" drama has led to marriage and family trauma. Bill and Pat Freeman continue to violate the sanctity of their church and marriages among their congregation. Instead of stepping aside to let God build His church, this author and his wife have held the psychological reigns over members of their congregation so tightly that many church members must ask Pat for permission before taking vacations. Bill sheepishly allows his wife to oversee all daily operations of their church. Since Pat has no formal training beyond high school, she uses mind games and political acrobats to outfox their unsuspecting congregation. This has set the stage for Pat's authoritarian leadership style and reign of terror. After this author and his wife's congregation has been on the decline for over 25 years, God may actually be opposing their present leadership. If God is opposing Bill and Pat Freeman, what should we be doing?Should we spend time with the Lord or with the Freemans?Bill and Pat Freeman often present themselves as a well-dressed couple that appears to enjoy conversations with their \\"church\\" friends. Many Christians that have met the Freemans are left with the impression that they seem to know a lot about God and the Bible. They both claim to know what God is doing in other people's lives. Yet, in their roles as self-imposed \\"church\\" leaders, Bill and Pat have elevated themselves above their young followers. They've been relieved of most earthly and mundane chores by the several \\"church\\" women residing in the Freeman's large homes as unpaid domestic servants. Bill appears prepared to give an impromptu Bible study at the drop of a hat, while Pat retains several church friends at her side as personal servants from dawn till dusk. These helpful individuals are considered elite members of the Freeman's \\"church.\\" In the meantime, other women in the general congregation aspire to one day assist and \\"fellowship\\" with Bill and Pat all day long. Indeed, Bill and Pat, or Patsy as many have known her, simply appear to be \\"larger than life\\" while their congregation appears to be \\"too good to be true.\\"Any time you hear a gospel that works for only a select few, you should be suspicious, because God is no respecter of persons. Acts 10:34While reading any of Bill Freeman's books, we are literally spending time with this author. This author's sermons are intended to overwhelm and mesmerize the congregation by dispersing a maze of Bible references throughout his messages while Bill recites Bible verses from memory. He does this to impress his audience and promote an air of authenticity to his messages and scriptural discussions. Yet, Bill often twists his interpretation of Bible scriptures to lend support to whatever point he and Pat are trying to make. Thus, he's often played with his listener's minds with the intent to mislead them. But, in their culture of silence, and without doing a background check to gain an understanding of this author and his wife's controversial history, we may have unknowingly opened ourselves up to a team of predators that have a very hidden agenda. Bill and Pat Freeman have been manipulating and devouring young, innocent believers and unsuspecting Christians in their congregations for over 40 years.When young Christian believers among the Freeman's congregation take their initial steps to \\"go deeper\\" and become die-hard Freeman followers or become involved in Pat Freeman's \\"inner circle,\\" they unknowingly open themselves up to be manipulated by a woman that has no formal education beyond high school. This is where the real damage begins. Time spent singing songs and hymns in Bill's congregation is much like foreplay. The real intercourse begins when individual believers are handed off by this former high school quarterback to \\"fellowship\\" one-on-one with Pat. An innocent Christian believer, after spending time with Pat in a series of one-on-one \\"fellowships,\\" will reappear as a newly begotten follower of the Freemans. Most notably, their mind has been corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.--2 Cor 11The Freeman's church practice of public confession serves their own purpose; Brainwashing. This is not about God. It's about the power of an adult over adolescent minds.Should we spend time with the Lord or with the Freemans?2. Business as Usual--Pat's ruse is to appear as warm and non-threatening as a grandmother, then simply lie her way into our lives. She'll initially play us and manipulate us to gain our trust. Unbeknownst to us, all the while she is doing this, she is profiling us to determine how to gain an inroad and deeper control of us. To Pat, this is a mere confidence game. In dozens of cases, after a married woman in Bill's congregation spent several one-on-one encounters with Pat, the result has been an increased level of stress in her relationships with husband and family. This woman's blossoming relationship with Pat soon took precedence over all, including her relationship with Jesus Christ. So, even though we might sing songs like \\"In Christ alone I place my trust,\\" it was Pat who coerced us and lorded over us during these small and private one-on-one meetings. Pat's history is to drive an icy wedge between husbands and wives, promoting an alienation of the wife's affection. She's maintained a long history of plotting and coercing women within her own \\"inner-circle\\" to verbally belittle their husbands in front of other women and assert themselves as the new \\"spiritual\\" leader in each of their homes. Pat's tangent leads to marital discord, separation, and eventually divorce. Soon, husbands would be treated merely as roommates. The husband's role is reduced to being the \\"breadwinner\\" and bringing home a paycheck. Yet, the overall goal of Pat's authoritarian \\"fellowship\\" or \\"spending time with Pat\\" is more than just the dissolution of dozens of otherwise healthy marriages in the congregation. By getting rid of these women's husbands, Pat has effectively removed her competition. After all, it's much easier for Pat to manipulate women once they are divorced and no longer protected by their husbands. The bottom line is the transfer of wealth from these loyal, yet now divorced women to Pat to fuel her financial dominance. Now that these husbands have been literally done away with, these women are also much more vulnerable, allowing Pat even more power and even more control over their lives.3. Lording and Landlording--The sad thing is that Pat won't stop there. She appears to manifest little if any inner restraint. Often, these women will be directed to move into one of Pat's homes or one of her close \\"church\\" friend's homes and begin paying rent. Many of these rent payments will find their way into Pat's deep pockets. At one point a dozen single, separated, or divorced women all lived in Bill and Pat's Scottsdale Arizona home. Many were charged hefty rents by Pat. Pat told some of us that Bill allowed her to keep all money gathered above the mortgage payment amount. This became so lucrative for Pat that she even had an old tool shed remodeled to allow her son and nephew to live on the property and, of course, pay rent. In addition, Pat purchased another home in the neighborhood as a rental house for other single church women. Notably, two ultra loyal \\"church\\" couples gave Pat $67,000 to assist in the purchase of this rental property.The Bible does not state that having a lot of money is the root of some evil. The Bible emphatically states \\"The love of money is the root of all evil.\\"--1 Tim 6:104. Pat's Playbook--In hindsight, many now realize nothing fills Pat's tank more than promoting and causing divorces. Like an organized serial killer, she derives a sense of accomplishment and intense personal pleasure from outsmarting husbands in her sinister game. Pat is mission oriented. In her concept, she is doing their \\"church\\" a big favor by violating the sanctity of the church and marriage and ridding their congregation of men. Pat envies the God given position and authority men have in the church and in the home. She likely experiences a heightened sense of power and control while inflicting psychological terror and emotional abuse upon the men and husbands she victimizes. Since these events occur in what appears to be a church, many of these men were simply broadsided and left literally speechless. Meanwhile, Pat experiences a sense of emotional and sexual release. The dozens of divorced women and fatherless children remaining as loyal members of Freeman's \\"church\\" are Pat's present souvenirs and trophies. They simply have nowhere else to go. Yet, in many cases, even after Pat has wrestled the last penny or ounce of usefulness away from a divorced woman, she will ultimately discard them, too. These spiritual scars run deep, but God can heal the wounded heart and spirit.Although Bill Freeman appears as the visible leader in their church, he spends most of his time hidden behind closed doors operating his Ministry of the Word enterprise. Bill prints, markets, and sells his books, DVDs, and CDs on his own website. Pat functions as the actual church leader by overseeing and micromanaging all daily operations of their \\"church,\\" \\"church-life,\\" and church schools. Bill recently disclosed that \\"Patsy has all the money.\\" Yet, Ministry of the Word, Bill's non-profit organization or \\"bookstore,\\" has claimed over a million dollars in assets. Most of these assets are actually real estate holdings purchased with money laundered directly from the Freeman church congregation's tithes and offerings.5. Home Invasion Handbook--Another means by which Pat controls and manipulates individual members of their congregation is by persuading young single women to live together in \\"sisters' houses\\" or young single men to live together in \\"brothers' houses.\\" Often, a family in their congregation would have a young man or a young woman living with them in what was called \\"corporate living situations.\\" All this is under Pat's complete control and covert supervision. Those living in homes or apartments together with other Freeman church members are referred to as enjoying the \\"the church life.\\" During 1997, Pat arranged and supervised the living arrangements of over 25 mixed households; totaling at least 84 Freeman church members. Six or more unmarried women resided in one household. Pat even directed several teenagers to move out of their own family's homes and live together with some of the other young people. She also controls the operations of their two private church schools, placing her own daughters in positions of leadership. Often, other adults were directed by Pat to move into and live in the bedrooms left empty in these teenager's parent's homes. On occasion, Pat even directs complete families to move in with other families or complete families to move out of their own homes and into a home owned by another family. Thus, Pat labors (24/7) to manipulate and control the Freeman flock. In the Freeman congregation, whether we were at home, at one of their church schools, or in their church meetings, no one was free from Pat or her growing manipulation or authoritarian rule over us. Pat's self assumed preeminence often became extremely awkward. She would even \\"change things up\\" or play \\"musical homes\\" every few months to keep followers from getting too \\"settled in.\\" One young man recounted his years of involvement in the Freeman's Seattle congregation. Pat directed him to move in and out of 12 different living situations within a single year. All this is validation of the high level of manipulation and control Pat wields over members of the Freeman's congregation.Should we spend time with the Lord or with the Freemans?6. Time Gap and Time Warp--Perhaps the greatest testimony to Bill and Pat's manipulation of our lives as Freeman followers is the fact that many of us completely lost track of time during the years or even decades spent in the Freeman church. Inside the Freeman church, time stood still. Bill and Pat piloted us around in circles like airplane holding patterns. We never seemed to land or arrive at any destination. The Freemans simply kept us preoccupied. They distracted us with their many church meetings, social activities, games, and events. They verbally encouraged us to \\"spend time with the Lord,\\" but, we always found ourselves literally spending time with the Freemans and their followers while we were being herded around in circles.Meanwhile, outside their church, time continued to tick away. Presidential elections took place. Wars were started and won. Even, 9/11 came and went. But, looking back in retrospect, our recall of world events and the happenings during these same years was minimal. Our memory banks should have been filled up with memories of family and social events, etc. But, the Freemans and their church activities took precedence and simply robbed us of what was normal. The Freemans taught us that the world and everything outside their church was evil. They conveniently replaced normal family activities and world events with their own church events.In retrospect, most of us now acknowledge that we actually lost a big chunk of our lives while we were involved with this author's church.Among those of us that departed and divested ourselves from the Freemans and their church, this former sense of isolation is part of the \\"common oneness\\" we now acknowledge after being freed from the Freemans and their influence over us. By severing relationships with the Freemans, we got our real lives back. We stepped out of the Freeman \\"time warp\\" and back into time. Time has continued to move forward but we had been literally suspended in time while trapped in the Freeman church. So much had transpired while we were being manipulated by the Freemans into spending all our time in their \\"church.\\"7. Unsolicited Marriage Invasions--Pat arranges marriages in the same way she arranges living situations. Bill and Pat Freeman's abusive \\"church\\" leadership appears to be a serious frustration to God's genuine purpose and desire on this earth. In their version of ministerial abuse, this author and his wife have misled their congregation, stolen our innocence, arranged and damaged our marriages and relationships with other believers, and spread evil lies to \\"excommunicate\\" former church members from their present congregation. Pat has not only arranged marriages, she has interfered in marriages and families to promote divorce. Psychopaths lack a sense of repentance. Pat's failure to repent after her covert activities were made public has led to several \\"church-splits.\\" In over 40 years, Bill and Pat have evolved, moved and relocated across the western United States seven times and dragged a congregation of psychologically battered women behind them. The Freemans have also isolated the children in their church and church schools from outsiders by convincing them that anyone outside their church group is evil and not to be trusted. Thus, the Freeman's ministry of deception reaches all ages. The result of their \\"ministry\\" has been an ingrown and subtle misnomer. They've drifted deeper and deeper into their own deception.In essence, Bill Freeman has used the title of this book, \\"Spending Time with the Lord,\\" as a soapbox to promote himself and further confuse his congregation and readers. Many Christians have unknowingly been caught up in the Freeman group for years or even decades, unable to exit from this author and his wife's atmosphere of coercive persuasion. In the last decade, Pat's form of legalism has promoted an ever deepening atmosphere of isolation by forbidding her present followers from maintaining relationships with family and friends outside their church. Thus, none have been allowed to post pictures on Facebook or remain in contact with \\"outside\\" friends or relatives. Likewise, Pat's followers are only allowed to maintain unlisted phone numbers and hide their physical address from outsiders by using post office box addresses to receive their mail.\\"Evil has no boundaries.\\"--Slayer8. Invasions of Time--Among the Freeman's die-hard followers or Pat's \\"inner circle\\" of women, the more time and money followers invest in this author and Pat's church, the more time and money they are expected to continue \\"donating\\" or investing. For some, their practical service to the Freemans consumes nearly every waking hour. Pat stresses that their time is simply not their own. Thus, while this author speaks about spending time with the Lord, many of their die-hard followers are simply too preoccupied to spend much private time with family or with the Lord. The longer we were involved with this author and his wife, the more we empowered them to twist God's Word and damage our lives and the lives of others. Actual time logged \\"spending time with the Lord\\" had to be suppressed because we were far too consumed with \\"spending time with the Freemans\\" in their many weekly \\"church\\" meetings or in practical duties assigned us by Pat herself. Thus, under the Freeman's church leadership, \\"serving the Lord\\" became redefined practically in specific ways as serving the Freemans. More emphasis was placed upon this than \\"spending time with the Lord.\\" Some of us actually missed church meetings in order to labor on one or more of Pat's home remodeling projects.Salvation by grace had been twisted by the Freemans into salvation by works.Spending time with the Lord is widely considered a healthy Christian practice. But, this author has hidden himself and his wife's abusive church practices behind a facade of Christian terminology and a camouflage of upscale religious practices. In reality, while Bill is publically promoting \\"spending time with the Lord\\" to his congregation, Pat is secretly exploiting individual members of their congregation. As a manifestation of her hatred of man's authority in the church and in the home, Pat's anger propels her to dominate over others by promoting and carrying out divorces, and arranging the dissolution of marriages among her \\"inner-circle\\" of followers. Only Bill and his congregational meetings are visible to the general public. Although Pat directs the women in the congregation to keep their homes neat and tidy and invite others over on Sunday for tasty home cooked meals, her unsanctioned activities and their destructive effects remain well hidden behind a thick curtain of religious secrecy.\\"Remember that all through history, there have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they seem invincible. But in the end, they always fall. Always.\\"--Mahatma Gandhi9. Reflections in the Mirror--While spending time with the Lord, we are encouraged to actually behold and reflect the Lord. Bill may appear to promote spending time with the Lord but it's obvious that the Freemans have not been reflecting the Lord in their church practices or in the way they've targeted others for over 40 years. They've been exploiting their congregations. Our Lord Jesus Christ would never attack and harm marriages ordained by God or arranged by Pat the way the Freemans have. Jesus Christ would never harm and spread such evil lies about individual Christian believers. After all, the institution of marriage was designed by God. Church leaders are not to do for families what God has ordained for families to do for themselves. Church ministers are an adjunct to the family, not a replacement. But, according to the Freeman's evolving history of misleading church congregations, the actual fruit from their \\"ministry\\" has been many bruised and broken believers, broken relationships and broken families, and broken bank accounts among their dwindling number of followers. Yet, the Freemans have consistently refused to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the damage they have caused or repent for the destructive effect they've had upon former and present \\"church\\" followers. They have swept all their dirt under very expensive rugs. Each time they move, their dirt is left behind.Should we spend time with the Lord or with the Freemans?10. Culture of Silence--From the onset, none of us would have expected our friendship and association with a church pastor and his wife could eventually cost us our relationships with family and friends. None suspected that it would ultimately cost us our marriages and families. Bill Freeman's preaching had brought many of us as young college students to the point of giving our lives to Jesus. Yet, this initial act was to be followed up by years of Pat's grooming and subtle manipulation. We had all given our lives to Jesus, but Pat now coerced us to give all our spare time and money to her. Wasn't that enough? No. Pat stole the preeminence from Christ in the Freeman church. Her insatiable appetite for control continues to encroach into family matters that normally stayed within the four walls of a family's home. She moves members of their congregation around from house to house like pieces of furniture. Her episodic bouts with depression have driven her to a warped preoccupation with the manipulation of others. She simply \\"plays church\\" to play out her fantasies of dominance. Home is where people should feel safe and secure. Yet, each home and family within the Freeman \\"church\\" is where Pat's eventual encroachment would fulfill this maligned fantasy; a delusion of dominance over others. Thus, there is a serial component to Pat's unsanctioned behavior. Once she has destroyed one marriage, she will move on to destroy another and another and another.\\"Experience is a brutal teacher, but you learn. My God, do you learn.\\"--C.S.Lewis11. Hidden Monkey Business--Perhaps readers might begin to understand why I cannot recommend this book or any of Bill Freeman's literature. This author and his wife have not been good stewards of the grace of God. As authoritarians, Bill and Pat Freeman may talk about Jesus, but they do not give Him the preeminence in their church. Neither have they been forthright and honest with their congregations. While smiling outwardly, they've secretly targeted and manipulated their church friends to wantonly destroy innocent people and once healthy marriages en route to generating an absurd cash flow. While claiming to love God, the Freemans have never been known to donate money to the homeless or the needy. They've never been known to lend support to other ministries. This author has even written another book entitled \\"The Church is Christ.\\" Yet, dozens of Christian believers have been targeted, damaged and eventually put out of the Freeman's \\"church\\" at Pat's insistence. These individuals have left and returned home to healthy, wholesome, and loving churches. But, each time another follower is \\"excommunicated\\" or \\"put out\\" of the Freeman's \\"church,\\" this author and his wife would win a temporary publicity war by spreading evil rumors and misinformation to discourage their remaining congregation from contacting or talking to these departing souls. Pat lays all blame upon her departing victims; turning them into her scapegoats.Thus, present Freeman church members are subtly discouraged from confronting hypocrisy or injustice in Pat's leadership. Anyone doubting or questioning Bill or Pat will be ridiculed. Any confrontation with the Freemans will be twisted and wrongly perceived as equal to doubting or questioning God. \\"Oh, ye of little faith.\\" Bill and Pat's routine is to toss accusations back by playing a \\"blame game\\" to undermine their accuser and claim that this individual is simply \\"not living by faith.\\" Thus, such topics as doubting or questioning the Freeman's leadership were simply off limits and avoided by sweeping them under the rug. Included among the Freeman's misinformation is their false claim that since the \\"church is Christ,\\" anyone leaving their \\"church\\" or anyone being dechurched and excommunicated by Pat is leaving Christ. This is simply another subtle lie. A genuine church is God's house and the bride of Christ. Regarding the Freeman church, God and His son, Jesus Christ, may have simply left the building.12. Fallout in the Family--Such legalism in the Freeman church renders dysfunctional everything a person touches, including family: There is a corruption in the heart of the legalistic family that will eventually break though the surface and adversely affect the children. The damage comes not from what is done to the children but rather through the more subtle messages they learn about themselves and others. Legalism eventually turns children into church mice and Christian leader into authoritarian monsters.--David Miller, Breaking Free: Rescuing Families from the Clutches of Legalism, pages 34-35.For many of us, our only exposure to Christianity came in the Freeman church. We knew no other church. So, we accepted the Freemans performance-based teachings and incorporated them into our family life. Our children were pressed into laboring for the Freemans at an early age. Each parent's loyalty to the Freemans was further tested when Pat demands that we spank our children according to her harsh tactics. Children receive the brunt of the abuse; not only from Pat, but especially from their mothers in coerced attempts to show loyalty to Pat and her strictly enforced control methods. Pat sternly demands that mothers in her congregation use the rod when disciplining children to \\"break their will\\" and independence. Shame on you Bill and Pat Freeman. You've turned our freedom of religion into your own freedom of deception.\\"There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home.\\"--Dorothy, The Wizard of Oz, the final scene in the 1939 movie version after the witch melted.By God's grace, and contrary to Pat's evil rumor mill, the same people she damages and intentionally puts out of the Freeman \\"church\\" and those that have departed the Freeman \\"church\\" on our own steam have simply left and returned home. \\"Home Sweet Home.\\" We've returned home to healthy churches and loving families where we can freely \\"follow the Lord\\" and \\"spend time with the Lord.\\" We've returned home to God's house where Jesus is still preeminent. We're not defeated; we're thriving and survivors of the Freeman's ministerial abuse. And now you know the rest of our story."},{"Title":"The Aeneid : notes","review":"This book proved extremely useful.

This leads to the \\"price elasticity argument\\" that infers the ideal price at which consumers will find new high-tech products attractive. \\"Grove's Law\\" posits that people adopt new technology when it is \\"disruptive,\\" that is, when it becomes 10 times better than anything else available. But author Pip Coburn, who writes with a lively pen, believes that high-tech leaders must put these revered principles aside, and focus instead on the people who use their technological marvels. Those who appeal to consumers will thrive. Those who do not will lose money as their products go down in flames. Is Coburn correct? As the founder of a firm that advises investors on high-tech stocks, he makes a compelling argument.

Technology companies very often fail to ask questions like \\"what problem is a consumer trying to solve when using my product(s)?\\" Starbucks, Apple and Amazon seem like rare examples in a world overloaded with technology I don't understand. What exactly does ViiV do for me? I am walking down the isles of CES and got scared. Pib Coburn helped me a little with his book. He extended the views of Levitt with his 'Change function'. I no longer feel like an idiot. Companies who struggle with creating user experiences will be tagged 'idiots'by Wall Street. I am sorry Dell, the market is no longer about price anymore. Price is only a small part of the perceived pain of adoption of consumers. Intel, wake up, what is my ViiV crisis?"},{"Title":"The Change Function: Why Some Technologies Take Off and Others Crash and Burn","review":"According to Coburn, his book \\"aims to identify the root of crisis [i.e. producing what customers do not want, at least in sufficient quantity] by getting in users' heads to what they really want - as opposed to running insightless focus groups - and it looks for ways of reducing the total perceived pain of adopting a new way of doing things. In other words, we want to understand the crisis at the adopter level, or specifically how a new offering solves a problem such that the pain in moving to a new technology is lower than the pain of staying in the status quo.\\" Throughout this book, Coburn examines the level of the crisis with regard to the services a new technology might offer. He also examines the total perceived pain of adoption associated with that new service.When explaining why certain technologies \\"crash and burn,\\" Coburn offers several examples which include the World's Fair-Style Picturephone, the Iridium satellite phone system, interactive TV, the Segway (although not all votes are as yet counted), and Webvan. He suggests why each failed., as well as lessons to be learned from those failures. With regard to technologies which have \\"taken off,\\" Coburn includes the iPod, BlackBerry, and Netflix while noting that to be aloft for a while in way ensures an extended flight. A technology which solves today's problem may quickly be replaced by a new technology or by a better application of a relatively established one. Credit Coburn with a lively, at times highly entertaining narrative. He claims to have 14,292 opinions and most of them seem to be in his book. It remains for each reader to determine the significance and limitations of the Change Function concept.

But, what is it? What does it mean?Pip Coburn wrote a book on technologies: The Change Function, Why Some Technologies Take Off and Others Crash and Burn. With his years of practice at understanding change as a 'change analyst' he tries to make us understand what is wrong with technology companies. He repeates one single message until you understand: The Change Function. The change function is what it is all about. Understanding change, because every adoption requires change. And to change is allways a free choice of an individual.In technology (companies) it's all about technology, not about the end user. An end users is an abstract entity that buys technology because it's better. (This sounds familiar.) It's about natural disruptive technologies (Grove's Law) and ever decreasing price (Moore's Law) that make it all just happen.But it doesn't just 'happen'. According to Pip only 5% of the products (read technology) developed are successfull. Unsuccessfull examples he examines are Segway, Interactive TV, The Picture Phone, ISDN and others. Successfull examples he disects are Salesforce.com and Reactrix. He even goes so far to predict the rise of Flatpanel displays (not really a surprise) and Business Intelligence software (a surprise but one long in the making), and the fall of WiMax (interesting) and RFID (in dutch we would say \\"vloeken in de kerk\\", cursing in church). His analysis is clear, concise and logical but more important it makes you understand what it is really all about: The Change Function.But the crux of the analysis is only to be found at the far end of his book, pages 204 and 205 to be precise. You will have to read the book to fully understand this message. But it is so powerfull than it can easily be turned around.

Having followed Pip's writings on and off wall street for years, his concept of Change-Function is so valuable and useful, I know many technology and investment pundits kicking themselves for not having thought of it first--or at least thought of it as lucid as Pip explains it, first. His insights have typically been reserved for multi-billion investment funds and high-tech CEOs, and being part of this inner sanctum, I'm half-frustrated he's made his insights accessible to the masses. But, the truth is its highly relevant for investors in bull and bear markets, and entrepreneurs in any field trying to understand why the best product or technology is still subject to timing and factors that most never take time to notice or understand.

The Change Function presents this method in a witty, enjoyable style that holds the interest of even the most attention-challenged, multi-tasking, digital natives."},{"Title":"The Change Function: Why Some Technologies Take Off and Others Crash and Burn","review":"I didn't think I would like this book much. If the author really had the secret truth behind success and failure of technologies he should be a billionaire rather than an analyst or an author. However, after I started reading I realized that the author was really providing a kind of primer for those considering the actual market viability of making a product / service using technology and a way for people considering investments in technology a tool for measuring the possibilities for success.He begins by describing the traditional view of technology products using Moore's Law and Grove's law. They are traditional and well understood. With Moore's law the secret is increasing power while lowering cost and you get to a tipping point of acceptance. Grove's law is that if you provide an order of magnitude in improvement (10x) you can replace in incumbent technology. While these are good yardsticks, they can lead to technologies used in products with no markets. You know, the old mousetrap being sold in a world with no mice.Instead, to get the focus shifted to market place realities, the author, Pip Coburn, offers what he calls the Change Function. Basically, you have to look at the Crisis the product / service addresses for the customer versus the Total Perceived Pain of Adoption. Until the Total Perceived Pain of Adoption (TPPA) becomes significantly less than the Crisis, you will not be adopted in the marketplace and cannot succeed. I think this is a good way to look at thinks. However, I would do that in addition to Grove's law. I still think it is a fundamental measure of the kind of difference their needs to be between the Crisis and TPPA.The author takes us through a variety of winners and losers and even makes some predictions (i.e. he likes Satellite Radio and hates RFID as just two examples). And he provides a chapter with many sets of questions that should be asked of any technology product thinking about entering the marketplace before gobs of money are wasted. I like this section a lot. Even if you only find a couple of questions you hadn't explicitly answered for yourself, it can help you avoid fuzzy thinking about where that last land mine could be that will blow your feet off after you start your journey into market competition. That is a good thing!So, if you are a technology buff and thinking about a business for your technology, this is a great book to help you take the blinders off and see the actual market possibilities rather than the gee-whiz-this-is-cool-stuff attitude that can sink your business before it ever goes anywhere."},{"Title":"The Change Function: Why Some Technologies Take Off and Others Crash and Burn","review":"Don't let the title fool you: this is a book all who persuade for a living need to read and embrace. The Big Idea: it's not the service that matters but whether the customer or client is ready to adopt what you're selling. The status quo bias will prevail until a crisis driven client needs the service you are selling and the pain of adoption is lowered to the point where the bias does not block the change. A simple but elegant idea that he talks about with lots of examples.The last three chapters help you integrate his ideas with a case study, questions to ask to see if someone is customer centric or self centered, and a To Do list to become the first and not the second. The writing is direct(\\"earthlings do not want to learn, nor do they enjoy learning\\"), peppered with interesting quotes and charts, and ends at 213 pages. Let me stress the 213---so many books are really fattened up articles, and this one is not.

It contradicts itself in numerous places and its examples are sketchy on details and facts. For instance, cost is rarely even a factor and that's the magic of the \\"change function\\", but in chapter 4 it seems to be a significant factor in the failure of Iridium/Globalstar. His hyping of satellite radio was very one sided. He mentioned none of the reasons many investors already consider it a failure- if you want customized music just buy an ipod, the most important 20-30 year old demographic can't afford brand new cars with XM and have a \\"free music\\" mentality, and the infrastructure costs with satellites combined with still needing ground antennas makes it uncompetitively expensive. Intel did not give up on MHz increases because customers did not care. They gave up because they are hitting technology limitations as silicon approaches the limits that physics will allow. Salesforce.com is mentioned practically in every chapter as a godsend example of a great company, yet I can easily apply Coburn style methods to counter this enthusiasm.

In one colorful example, an intelligent woman applies the change function's \\"perceived pain of adoption\\" concept to understanding why men were suddenly very interested in diets a few years ago. What had brought about the change? At the time, low-carb diets were allowing men to eschew salads and other unfulfilling diet foods in favor hearty, protein-laden meals.

The whole point of the book is this -- if we don't want or need something, it doesn't matter how little it costs and how well it works.Numerous examples are provided which illustrate that the tech industry's infatuation with Moore's law (cost will decrease and performance will increase steadily until consumers *eventually* will make the purchase) and Grove's law (success can be achieved by creating 10x improvements to technical capabilities) continues to misdirect billions of dollars.The book illustrates how the tech community continues to believe that any cool technology will be adopted by the masses if it's costs come down enough.

Soundview recommends this read because it not only looks at successes such as Netflix, iPods and flat-screen TVs but it scrutinizes failures including the Segway people mover, the Tablet PC and video phones. Coburn then demonstrates how both of these successful and failed technology streams provide meaningful lessons toward answering his billion dollar question: \\"Why do some new technologies succeed and others fail?\\" Coburn's key takeaway is that people are only willing to change and accept new technologies when the pain of their current situation outweighs the perceived pain of trying something new. He further found that the average potential adopter of a given technology is afraid of it and needs to be convinced of the need to change. Without that conviction the marriage between change and technology is simply doomed to fail. This is a thoroughly engaging and worthwhile read, and it may even change some minds regarding technology."},{"Title":"The Change Function: Why Some Technologies Take Off and Others Crash and Burn","review":"Mr.Coburn provides useful insights into why some technologies succeed in the marketplace and others that seem equally good or better do not. The answer often lies in not viewing the technology from the user's point of view, either in its use or how it is presented. Includes interesting and helpful illustrations of real technologies that failed and some that suceeded. This book complements Everett Rogers' \\"Diffusion of Innovations\\", which discusses how innovations are adopted in social systems."},{"Title":"Shot at Dawn: Executions in World War One by Authority of the British Army Act","review":"This book has effectively become a handbook for the Pardons movement. This is unfortunate as it is inaccurate in many areas and some of it's facts are simply wrong. The book has been slightly updated but at the time it was written the official documentation on the courts martial was still classified. It has since been released and blows apart some of the \\"facts\\" that the authors assert in this book. Far from the image of a bright young conscript, finally losing his mind after weeks on end under constant bombardment in mud filled trenches, the reality shows some cases where men deserved to be shot, some cases where those shot probably did not deserve to be and some cases that are definitely grey areas. The vast majority of death sentences were commuted. Of those who were shot, most were regular soldiers who were expected to maintain better standards of discipline than conscripts. Of those shot 40% had been in repeated disciplinary trouble before, some of whom had actually been sentenced to death before and had the sentence commuted through leniency (in 1 case the man shot had been sentenced to death TWICE and shown leniency in each case). Far from them all being boys (though some were) the average age of those shot was around 26 and the vast majority were over 21. A large proportion of them deserted in 1914, long before the conflict deteriorated into trench warfare. Many of those shot deserted without ever reaching the front lines. Some had subsequently committed murder after desertion. Academically or legally there is NO case for a blanket pardon. There is an arguable case for a SELECTIVE pardon, at least 4 of those shot seem not to have received fair treatment. The problem with this book is that rather than being an analysis of primary sources, it relies too much on memoirs and other secondary sources, some of which seem highly unreliable.Anthony Babington's \\"For Sake of Example\\" is a significantly more reliable and balanced account than this. Babington had access to more sources and used them with greater impartiality. He argued for pardons but after the release of the documentation on the courts-martial made a reassessment and admitted that there was no case for a blanket pardon of deserters, switching to support for selective pardons on a case by case basis.This book has many failings, among them:-Factual inaccuracy.-Reliance on secondary sources some of which have been shown to be unreliable-An emotional rather than academic approach.Effectively it is a polemic rather than a history book. Those interested in the executions of Great War soldiers should consult this book and also the recent book by John Hughes-Wilson which presents an elegant case AGAINST the Pardons movement while using Babington's \\"shot at dawn\\" as a middle ground.The idea that all those executed for desertion were innocents \\"murdered\\" by the British Army is simply a myth. There are cases where pardons might well be in order but it is about time the debate started to be looked at in less emotional terms. This book should not be taken as impartial fact, because that is not what it presents."},{"Title":"Shot at Dawn: Executions in World War One by Authority of the British Army Act","review":"This book is a must for anyone interested in the fate of those unfortunate soldiers and sailors who were so unjustly executed during WW1. As it gives the fullest information possible about each of the victims and also (with one or two exceptions)the precise burial or commemoration site for ease of visiting.My wife and I have recently completed our self imposed quest to visit every one of them throughout the whole of the Western Front and this book was taken along and the particular man's story read out at each of the gravesides.Without this book the task would have been almost impossible and the magnitude of the so called authorities at the time in this legalised murder would not be so appreciated."},{"Title":"Shot at Dawn: Executions in World War One by Authority of the British Army Act","review":"See Mud, Blood and Poppycock by Gordon Corrigan for a chapter with an interesting opposing view."},{"Title":"The Confident Leader: Getting a Good Start As a Christian Minister","review":"This book is promoted as the text book that reads like a novel. It certainly is an interesting format for a text book. It is specially designed to help young pastors just out of seminary get off to a good start. The book follows the first year of ministry of the fictional Jim Stafford as an associate pastor in a mid-sized church. The Confident Leader covers a wise range of areas from goal planning to sermon preparation as well as the personal dangers of overwork and emotional attachments to the opposite sex.Genz presents a massive amount of material in a few hundred pages. As I began to read this book it seemed as if the author was only going to give us simplistic, sugar coated advice. I kept saying to myself, Sure, that will only work out in dream land! As the plot thickened complications set in and the story took a turn towards reality. It is extraordinary well organized and easy to understand. Two of the strongest sections were his discussions on goal setting and motivation.Getnz increased the difficult of his work by setting his text book in novel form. There are some inconsistencies in the story. For instance, the poor fellow cannot order new brochures without the board's permission; yet, he is empowered to make the final decision on the computer purchase. On the story side of the book, where did Jim get all his money? Right out of seminary and he is spending money like a sailor on a three-day leave- taking all those men out to lunch is expensive. The chapters on leadership and preaching are very weak. The advice given on leadership seems to urge the reader to accept the statue quo and work within it, and the advice on sermon preparation was right out of Homiletics 101. The most serious criticism is the sheer volume of lists. Do not get me wrong,. There is a lot of valuable information in there; but the author had list overkill. In the first 100 pages there was over 300 points and I estimate that he must have had an overwhelming 1000 separate points listed.The last chapter on success on a failure spoke to my heart. He warned us that success often carries within itself the seeds of failure, and that we are only as good as the last victory. This point was made over and over again by Collins and Porras in Built to Last. It's a good book for undergraduate study, but for professional enhancement and graduate work, there are better works out there."},{"Title":"The Confident Leader: Getting a Good Start As a Christian Minister","review":"The Confident Leader by Arlo Grenz is a practical, helpful and enjoyable book. It could serve as a textbook on church administration but it reads like a novel. The book is ideal for a novice Christian Education Director but is a good refresher for any administrator.

Grenz examines planning, goal setting, decision-making, team building, motivation, conflict management, time management, delegation and communication. The information is basic, practical and applicable."},{"Title":"The Confident Leader: Getting a Good Start As a Christian Minister","review":"This book not only will help a beginning Minister get started in the exciting world of Ministry, but also helps anyone that wants become a leader, or more confident in their daily lives.

After I read this book it was my sole purpose in life to stop drinking and become a Minister. After 19 and a half months of hard work I finally achieved my goal. I now live in Fremont, CA and got married 6 months ago and I'm happier then I have ever been in my life.

I think, though, that the author was trying to show how Dobry was growing up. In the beginning, he is satisfied with slow country life but gradually grows to realize his dream is to become an artist.DOBRY is a good book for learning about the culture of Bulgarian peasants. It is rich in the folk stories--how God created man and Hadutzi-Dare saved the world--and everyday life of these people. Also, the author conveys the village's excitement when the massage bear (you'll learn what it is!) comes to herald the summer.The language is beautiful and Dobry is an eternal optimist. The characters represent different facets of village life--for example, the rotund mayor explains government and Dobry's grandfather shows Bulgaria's heritage.The book introduced me to a culture that thinks differently and lives differently yet dreams the same.

In a way it is a little unusual (at least it seemed that way to me) in that the first half of the book appeared to be written for 8 to 11 year-olds whereas the second half of the book, as the boy Dobry grows older and wishes to be a sculptor, seems to be written for an older child.

In short, this book is most definitely NOT for everyone, and even the most committed students will find that the author makes you work for the insights the book delivers.Although the book covers over a century of early American banking (from the first colonial land grant offices to the Civil War), the unmistakable focus is Nicolas Biddle's management of the second Bank of the United States (BUS) and the successful Jacksonian assault on that institution beginning in 1832. During the course of his narrative Hammond mercilessly shreds the shibboleths of liberal historians: poor and simple agrarians fought the moneyed elite through Andrew Jackson and his reforms; Nicolas Biddle was a conniving, flagitious political operator; the BUS was a corrupt, inefficient institution that fattened lazy aristocrats at the expense of the humble productive classes; the West was the primary source of hostility toward the BUS. All nonsense, Hammond argues.Rather, Hammond's thesis is that the main Jacksonian enemies of the BUS - not one of whom was an agrarian, he points out - used Jeffersonian language merely as a pretext to eradicate an institution that was successfully stabilizing the national currency and thus thwarting their speculative business interests. Although he acknowledges that residual agrarian hostility to banks and the resentment of states rights politicians to the intrusion of federal power through the BUS were contributing factors, Hammond argues that the primary impetus for destroying Biddle and the BUS was provided by a new and burgeoning group of business elite, primarily from New York. Made up of ambitious entrepreneurs and local bankers, these new Jacksonians bridled at the regulatory influence the BUS had on restraining free credit. Moreover, because the BUS collected all federal receipts, which at that time were mostly import duties on goods flowing through New York City, local New York banks could not profit from the lucrative trade their city supported. They believed the use of that currency was rightfully theirs, and they resented the fact it was sent to a bank run out of Philadelphia and controlled by Philadelphians (and foreigners, or so many believed, but Hammond denies).Thus, Hammond concludes, the \\"Bank War\\" was really a fight between conservative, principled businessmen on the one side and reckless, \\"get rich quick\\" speculators on the other. He holds Nicholas Biddle up as second only to Alexander Hamilton for his contribution in creating the greatest economic engine the world has ever known: American capitalism. Andrew Jackson, meanwhile, is disparaged as a well-meaning dolt whose supposed reforms did nothing to benefit the common man he professed to represent, but rather destroyed the most effective central banking system ever developed by the 1830s."},{"Title":"Banks and Politics in America from the Revolution to the Civil War","review":"About twenty years ago I was researching the early development of banking in U.S. history. Since much of what is available regarding this period is marginally important, I was prepared to be disappointed. Instead, I found Hammond's work to be the most significant research and writing on the subject available at that time.I learned that Hammond was an experienced banker before joining the Federal Reserve Banking system and becoming their first official historian. His work combines access to original source material, a plain Midwestern style of explanation, and scholarship that is both honest and reliable. In short, Hammond was one of nature's gift.The book gives a comprehensive account of banking from the colonial period to the Civil War, a time of particular importance for innovative growth. The most important part of his work is his interpretation of the period immediately preceding the Jackson presidency, including a previously unknown development of an alliance of opportunistic young business democrats with decidely opportunistic interests in the potential of Western expansion. Hammond convincinly ties this movement to persons within Jackson's kitchen cabinet. When reading Hammond you quickly become convinced that he knew where all the bones were buried.Hammond wrote a second book covering the period from the Civil War to the development of the present Federal Reserve system in the Wilson Administration. I understand from other sources that he became seriously ill during this period. The latter work is much shorter than the first and does not achieve the same high standard.Hammond's original work is a must for anyone with a serious history in the history and development of U.S. financial structures."},{"Title":"Mickey's magnet","review":"This is a FABULOUS story of a young boy who discovers a great way to pick up Mom's pins is with a magnet.

It aims at the undergraduate/graduate student (I could be wrong - having English as your second language inhibits you somewhat - so perhaps High School students in English-speaking countries could find it useful also) who is curious as to what Eliot's poetry &quot;means&quot; and of what material it is comprised..."},{"Title":"A guide to the Selected poems of T.S. Eliot","review":"In A GUIDE TO THE SELECTED POEMS OF T.S. ELIOT the critic B.C. Southam has prepared an ideal guide for students new to T.S. Eliot's poetry. Southam is adamant about seeking to help students who have already been attracted by Eliot's work to form their own appreciation and understanding.Though I've been a fan of T.S. Eliot for many years, I learned quite a bit from Southam's notes. All four \\"Ariel Poems\\" - which are deceptively simple and difficult for students to penetrate - are covered in depth. The often-neglected \\"Chorus From The Rock\\" finally gets substantial attention here.My largest complaint about the work is that it is indeed a guide only to the material which appears in Faber & Faber's SELECTED POEMS. As a result, the extremely tricky and allusive FOUR QUARTETS is not covered (too late), nor is Eliot's early turn at drama \\"Sweeney Agonistes\\" (not strictly poetry).Another problem is that not all of the book has been updated after great discoveries in Eliot studies - such as Valerie Eliot's edition of the manuscript of \\"The Waste Land\\". Southam makes some assertions which are clearly informed from the latest evidence, but other material looks as if it has remained unchanged since the book's first edition.In spite of its flaws, I think Southam's work is a great resource for school and university students who find Eliot sublime but opaque. I'd recommend it to any beginning reader of that great poet's work."},{"Title":"A guide to the Selected poems of T.S. Eliot","review":"First of all, this is a very difficult and laborious book to read. But it will be a very fulfilling experience for those who are seriously interested in poetry. Reading this book certainly shows us the range of allusions that T. S. Eliot used in his compositions. The variety of texts that T. S. Eliot mentions in &quot;The Wasteland&quot; reveals us the depth of spiritual struggle that the author has went through in order to write the poem. There are references to the Bible, eastern philosophy, literature from the antiquity to the present. There are also reference to some earlier writings by the author. Reading the commentary has shown me the richness to T. S. Eliot's writings that are otherwise difficult to see. With the careful analysis of &quot;The Waste Land, one sees that it is not simply about a struggle of modern life, but it encompasses wide range of philosophy and literature that are involved in the spiritual struggle one must face in this modern world."},{"Title":"A guide to the Selected poems of T.S.

This work of Eliot's is entrenched in laborious detail that takes the reader from the text to the footnotes again and again. It becomes quite confusing and a bit irritating at times. This book, _The Selected Poems of T.S. Eliot_, was extremely helpful in that it construes Eliot's use of footnotes, and the allusions made within the work. It helps to clarify the questions lingering in the reader's mind, and allows for a more critical reading of the poem. I found it to be an insightful aid to my presentation, and would recommend it to anyone who desires an indepth study on any of Eliot's work."},{"Title":"A guide to the Selected poems of T.S.

Southam's book really gives a reader new perspectives and may even validate thoughts that one may have about &quot;The Waste Land&quot; and other poetry written by Eliot. The way that Southam uses language to give insight into the poetry is really easy to understand and a pleasure to read whether you are interested for academics or pleasure."},{"Title":"The Night Calls","review":"I've read the first book in the series, and wasn't much impressed, but continued on in case the writer found his stride in the second. This is a strange book, second in a series, but with the feel that it should have been the first story. It would have made more sense if this had been book one rather than two. Now book one makes less sense when it comes to the Doyle and Bell relationship. They don't feel like the two books fit together.There are mystery murders presented from early in the Doyle and Bell collaboration in this one, and the story actually feels finished by 2/3 of the book. The last 1/3 just flounders. It feels like the author is tacking it on to get you to the third book, because the last third isn't a complete story.I don't really find Doyle all that likable, not that he's not presented as a good man who means well. But his temper is annoying, and endangers cases causing problems. By the time he should have more belief and respect for Bell's methods he fights believing in them. Doyle and Bell work together, but it seems that they're more annoyed with each other than anything. Because they're drawn into the first mystery together they form an alliance which feels forced rather than natural.The characters just don't do it for me. By the end of this book, and the last meandering 1/3 that dragged it down, I found I just don't care enough even with the surprise ending to go to the third."},{"Title":"The Night Calls","review":"I got through this book by gritting my teeth. Why I put myself through the thankless task is the true mystery of this novel of suspense. A mystery compounded by the fact that there is no resolution at the end - just a referal to the next volume in The Murder Room Series and I won't be reading that any day soon - make that never. I have never felt so conned.It's an odd book. The narrator is an irritating, petulant twerp who constantly lets his emotions rule his behaviour and I quickly lost any sympathy for him. The novel is within shouting distance of a resolution half way through but the author then spins the novel out and on to its detriment.The second half of the novel turns on an increasingly preposterous series of coincidences that would put Amistad Maupin to shame. The predictability of the ensuing events is equally annoying. As for the \\"surprise\\" at the end? What surprise - I could see it a mile away!The author's notes makes it clear that he was inspired to write this particular novel due to a coincidence he discovered in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's background history - that he had studied medicine with a notorious serial killer - but he took that idea and just got carried away. The \\"idea\\" didn't warrent a second (or third?) novel. In deed, it didn't deserve one novel of this length. The first half could have been developed into one interesting, self-contained novel but it wasn't and more's the pity.All in all, an unsatisfactory read."},{"Title":"The Night Calls","review":"Sherlock Holmes. Very few names are as evocative as that one. And yet there are many questions and speculations surrounding the creation of that marvelous fictional detective. It has been said that the only way to gain any true knowledge of Holmes is through his creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. David Pirie must subscribe to that train of thought as well and has therefore devised a background for Doyle. In so doing, Pirie gives us an imaginative glimpse into the relationship between the writer and Dr. Joseph Bell, the man credited with being the inspiration for Holmes himself.\`The Night Calls' is first and foremost a thoroughly atmospheric, not to mention a completely absorbing, story. Each setting and scene is described in careful detail, which lends the prose a rich density that manages to escape any sense of being cumbersome. The reader is allowed to take to the streets of Edinburgh and London right alongside Doyle and Bell. Yes, those streets are dark and unsavory, but you would never think of turning back. And even though Pirie takes the mystery on a couple of tangent jaunts that may seem unnecessary, the heart of it remains compellingly close and \\"concludes\\" in a highly chilling manner.After reading the Historical Note included at the end of the novel, I was surprised to find just how much of Doyle's real life had been snuck into the narrative. Pieces of the man's history that you think must have been part of the fiction turned out to be true and you appreciate the way the story was crafted even more for it. This is the type of novel that makes you want to learn more. More about Doyle himself, about the real-life serial killer that plagues Bell and Doyle throughout, and more about the women's movement that rose up during the time.I thoroughly enjoyed \`The Night Calls' and have since purchased \`The Patient's Eye' which actually precedes this novel. I am also anticipating the dvd release of \`The Murder Rooms', a miniseries upon which the novels were based."},{"Title":"The Night Calls","review":"Once again David Pirie has given us a winner: complex plotting, rich detail, characters who are real, beautiful writing.

A warning: &quot;The Night Calls&quot; and &quot;The Patient's Eyes&quot; are intertwined in some ways - a tidbit here, a phrase there - and you may find yourself picking up and enjoying &quot;The Patient's Eyes&quot; once again, as I did the moment I finished &quot;The Night Calls&quot;.

Bell's sharp powers of observation and clever methods of detection were an inspiration for Doyle's fictional character, Sherlock Holmes.It is the late 1800's in Edinburgh, Scotland. Arthur Doyle and Dr. Joseph Bell combine their resources to investigate a series of grisly assaults on women. Ultimately, Bell fears that the assaults are the work of an unhinged individual whose crimes may soon escalate to murder. It turns out that Bell's fears are well founded. Their antagonist is a sadist who has tremendous intelligence, imagination, cruelty, and daring.With his skilled description and vivid characterizations, Pirie has done a marvelous job of capturing the mood of the times. He tackles several feminist themes, including the discrimination that faced young ladies who wished to attend medical school, and the wretched exploitation of impoverished women who sold their virtue in order to survive.The characters of Bell and Doyle and sharp and well-drawn. Bell's incisive mind, no-nonsense approach, and tenacity when faced with a difficult problem are indeed reminiscent of the great Sherlock Holmes. The central villain of the piece is a vile individual who will make your blood run cold.Pirie includes several intriguing subplots, including one about a chauvinistic and cruel husband and another about an arrogant scientist who believes that the ends of scientific discovery justify unethical means. &quot;The Night Calls&quot; is a chilling, fascinating, and expertly written novel, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Night Calls","review":"In 1878 Arthur Conan Doyle studies medicine at the University of Edinburgh under the tutelage of Dr. Joseph Bell. However, Arthur particularly appreciates the deductive reasoning that his mentor brings to solving crimes by turning an investigation into a more scientific approach. Between his studies, the occasional detective work (see THE PATIENT'S EYES) and an intelligent female student, whom the professors treat with gender scorn, Arthur is able to somewhat put aside his family troubles.However, the city is gripped with fear as a killer begins murdering women in brothels leaving behind strange clues such as neatly piled coins \\"paying\\" the fee perhaps. Bell believes a new type of culprit has surfaced. This is a clever individual with an obsession that leads him to most likely kill again. As the duo struggles to solve a case with an MO outside their normal methodology, Bell and Doyle try to invent a different approach still using deductive and inductive logic.Doyle as a young man accompanied by his teacher are fun to follow while student Elspeth Scott provides more than a romantic interlude as the audience sees the disdain and prejudice the Victorian Era faculty and her peers bestow on her because of her gender. The historical look is fascinating as the reader observes Doyle before Holmes and Moriarty. However, unlike the first novel in this series, solving the mystery surprisingly is un-Holmes like especially in light of Bell recognizing a whole new category of homicide. Still David Pirie writes a solid tale, but not quite the par excellence of his previous book.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Night Calls","review":"another in the series of books about Arthur Conan Doyle and his mentor Dr Bell. Dark, brooding and filled with labyrinthine scenarios. I loved it"},{"Title":"The Night Calls","review":"I just finished reading this book, and I absolutely LOVED it, I couldn't put it down. Thanks to a friend in Edinburgh who sent me this book, I am now an avid fan of the series, and having never read any Sherlock Holmes novels (I know, shame on me!), not only did this book fascinate me, but it also made me want to read Doyle's works, and learn more about the man. Anyone who loves literary fiction or who is a Holmes fan (obviously), or just likes a good suspenseful horror novel, will LOVE this book!"},{"Title":"The Night Calls","review":"While the Sherlock Holmes pastiche novel has become a mini-genre of its own, some of even the most faithful had begun to feel it was beginning to show signs of being overdone. So it was only natural for some of the more ingenious of our writers to try to pump new blood into it. And what better way than to go back to the source, the original inspiration for Holmes himself, Dr. Joseph Bell? Thus we have seen the nascence of a new series of works with the brilliant, and very real, doctor performing as his later inspired fictional counterpart. Among the best of the practitioners of this new form (and arguably its progenitor) is David Pirie. He first presented Dr. Bell, deductive detective in a TV movie starring Ian Richardson. This was followed by the masterful and chilling &quot;The Patient's Eyes&quot;, a marvelous novel using the same ideas as the film and extending them to other cases. Now Pirie is back with &quot;The Night Calls&quot; and it is both more and less interesting than his first book. First the less part. The first, and largest, portion of the narrative is essentially a novelisation of the aforementioned film. Those who have not seen it will find it fascinating, but those of us who have will, I think, find it somewhat slow. The more is that it continues beyond the ending of the film which, without giving anything away, I hope, was curiously, albeit chillingly, open-ended. In any event, the book, and the series, provide the pleasures of marvelously atmosheric writing and intriguing characters in a highly entertaining blend of fact and fiction. Baker Street Irregulars and their ilk will love it!"},{"Title":"The Night Calls","review":"Purchased as a gift and arrived in brand-new condition, perfect for the new owner! Shipping was very fast and even though I prefer to purchase hardcovers, the soft-cover was very crisp and shiny. A nice buy."},{"Title":"The Night Calls","review":"I have had David Pirie's trilogy of books featuring Arthur Conan Doyle on my list of potential books to read for quite some time now. I wish there was some way to know what books you will love before you read them.... perhaps a little metal detector, or a literary Geiger counter that would give you a reading on its dial indicating you will like this but not that, even a forecast predicting enjoyment...you have a seventy five percent chance of enjoying this book. If only... and if so, then I would certainly have read David Pirie's books long ago.I was lucky enough to find these books after there were three of them to read. I'm sure I would have been frustrated to read the first one only to have to wait a year to read the second then do the same for the third. I read them one right after the other and I recommend others do the same.Pirie writes about Arthur Conan Doyle, embellishing on the known facts about his relationship with Dr. Joseph Bell, who was the model for Sherlock Holmes. The Historical Note alone makes for fascinating reading and I read that before starting the book, which for me made the fiction that much more enjoyable.I think I liked 'The Night Calls' best of the three books because there is a bit of happiness for ACD in this story and we learn about his relationship with Elsbeth who was referred to numerous times in 'The Patient's Eyes'. This was a fast paced read with all of the necessary ingredients for a favorite for me; realistic and likeable characters with convincing relationships, believable dialog and a story that follows logic. There were a few sloppy editing errors which reflected poorly on the proof reader but didn't influence my appreciation for the story and the characterization created by the author.I would recommend this to fans of historical fiction and mysteries and I think Sherlockians would appreciate this as well. Overall well done, I wish David Pirie would write more like this."},{"Title":"The Night Calls","review":"After the exceptionally well-craftedThe Patient's Eyes: The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes, this second book of the 'Murder Rooms' trilogy is a slight let-down. Chronologically speaking, the events happening in this book precede those in \\"The Patient's Eyes\\", and describe the following: -* although the events that had first brought Arthur Conan Doyle into the world of Dr. Joseph Bell had been described in the 1st book, the events that had followed that 'introductory' phase, are all here;* the deep scar left by Arthur Conan Doyle's nemesis, who went on to become the template for Professor Moriarty;* episodes in the Dr. Bell's crime-solving episodes, one of which surprisingly ends in placing Doyle face-to-face his nemesis, in a cliffhanger ending.As usual, it is a great fun for Sherlockian aficionados trying to find out as many references to the 'Canon' (yet to come, in a much diluted version, since Doyle must have been trying very hard to evade the shadows accompanying all those memories) as possible. But the book, while succeeding in creating a gothic atmosphere of palpable evil (a precursor of the events in Whitechapel in 1888-91?), does not do justice to Dr. Bell's detective skills as much we have started expecting. Nevertheless, heartily recommended."},{"Title":"Babel-17, Collectors Edition (Masterpieces of Science Fiction)","review":"Right now, I will just say that Delaney was a real star on the American literary skyline, and still one mistaken for a UFO apparently, judging from the scarcity of Amazon reviews on any of his books. I cannot believe how few!This novel is one of the several truly great sci-fi novels he wrote, alongside Nova, The Fall of The Towers, and others. Brilliant, colorful, gaudy, ambitious, experimental, I can't come up with enough descriptives. This novel is one of several big, big, ambitious novels he wrote, where he aimed for a total synastaesia within the mind of the reader; an intoxication with words and ideas, yet within the general form of a conventional epic science fiction novel. Did he aim too high? I think he always did, and I love him for it. Just like I did when I was a kid.If you like Ursula Leguin, Captain Beefheart, Robert Crumb, you will at least find this amusing. Maybe more. It was the art of a time and a place, and may seem dated now, but still reads as sweet as rock candy to me. I have watched Anime that strongly reminded me of Delaney and of this novel, but Delaney was years ahead."},{"Title":"Transportation Uniform Buttons, Vol. 3: Maritime and Aviation","review":"This is a wonderful piece of scholarship, truly a labor of love. Airlines, cruise ships, ferries, and so on, they all have uniformed staff in corporate livery. If you look closely enough, you'll see the carrier's logo (and maybe lots more) on the buttons on those uniforms. That is what this book is about, the buttons. It is profusely illustrated - in fact, it has different listings for the front buttons on a jacket and the smaller cuff buttons on that same uniform. That's how thorough thi book is, and it's just as thorough about each company, it corporate mergers, acquisitions, and more, and about the company's changes in uniforms through the years. It documents not just the buttons, but the rise and corporate fall of the carriers that used those buttons.Amazon does not carry this book, just because of some labeling issues. It is still available from its self-publisher, though. If Amazon can't get it for you, it's possible to contact the author directly."},{"Title":"Breast Imaging (The Core Curriculum Series)","review":"This is a good textbook for the radiology resident. This book is a significant improvement over the previous breast imaging companion. These include:1. Switch from outline format to prose. Outline format is useful for review, but does not lend itself well to a straight read-through. This book was designed to be read.2. A lot more images, both improved in quality and format. Many cases are presented in a logical fashion. Screen-diagnostic-ultrasound-biopsy workups are presented multiple times. This is really a big improvement over the 1-2 image \\"show me\\" style, since mammo often requires these types of workups. The ultrasound images are also excellent.The aspects I would like to see improved on would be a section devoted to common management and diagnostic problems in mammo. There is some discussion of management issues scattered throughout the text, but I think this deserves its own section since it plays such a large part in mammo.I would give this text 4 stars overall, but for the price I'll bump it up to 5 stars."},{"Title":"Pour Une Histoire de L'Imaginaire (Verite Des Mythes,) (French Edition)","review":"After reading this book you will finally understand that the history of humankind is not all about political movements and ideas, great leaders and conflicts. History also has to deal with the people's &quot;imaginary&quot;, which, on one side, has been evolving since the begining of humankind and, on the other side, didn't change its inner structures. You will find out from this book what exactly is the &quot;imaginary&quot;, which is different from &quot;mentalities&quot; or &quot;common widespread ideas&quot;,how can it be studied and how proffessor Boia sees its history. Apart from all these, the book is excelentely written, from the literary point of view and the subject itself is most interesting due to its originality."},{"Title":"Great American Ghost Stories (America Ghost Series)","review":"This book was headed for the discard pile even though I'm a ghost story junkie, but then I found a trio of really good stories buried within the dross of old pulp filler:\\"Stillwater, 1896\\" by Michael Cassutt - A Great Lakes lumber town is visited by a man who can locate corpses underwater.\\"One of the Dead\\" by William Wood - A vacant lot is purchased very cheaply in a canyon inhabited by movie stars, and haunted by its Spanish past.\\"Night-Side\\" by Joyce Carol Oates - Two skeptics test a medium who can speak with the voices of the dead. The really chilling aspect of this story is its author's depiction of the afterlife.There are also some decent stories that are worth a once-over:\\"Drawer 14\\" by Talmage Powell - A morgue attendant sees a corpse in a drawer that's supposed to be empty. This story has a kicker at the end.\\"Professor Kate\\" by Margaret St. Clair - A family of witches is hunted by a posse in Indian Country.\\"School for the Unspeakable\\" by Manly Wade Wellman - You will soon guess what is going to happen to the new boy at the prep school, but it's still a spooky read. I'm prepared to bet money that the author originally set this story in England, but the editors changed the location to North Dakota to fit it into this collection.\\"Clay-Shuttered Doors\\" by Helen R. Hull - A woman returns from the dead to host her husband's dinner party.\\"Poor Little Saturday\\" by Madeleine L'Engle - An original fantasy, but more about witches than ghosts--I think. A woman in a deserted, boarded-up plantation house befriends a boy with malaria.\\"Great American Ghost Stories\\" also features a so-so story by Harlan Ellison--\\"Pretty Maggie Moneyeyes\\"--I think he was feeling sorry for himself when he wrote it; and a really awful early Lovecraft: \\"Herbert West - Reanimator.\\" When Lovecraft is bad, he is really, really bad and this story's got sentences like, \\"Not more unutterable could have been the chaos of hellish sound if the pit itself had opened to release the agony of the damned, for in one inconceivable cacophony was centered all the supernal terror and unnatural despair of animate nature.\\"Yes, indeed. Most of the stories in this book have never been anthologized, as far as I can determine, except for a duet by Ambrose Bierce: \\"The Boarded Window;\\" and \\"The Stranger.\\" But the editors could hardly have called their book, \\"Great American Ghost Stories\\" without an entry from the man who defined 'happiness' as, \\"an agreeable sensation arising from contemplating the misery of another.\\""},{"Title":"Great American Ghost Stories (America Ghost Series)","review":"Herein lies a fine collection of Ghost Stories.

The first is good, but The Language of Chaos is more fluent, and much more enjoyable to read. I wont spoil the plot too much, but it leaves a lot of room for violence, which is good or bad, however you look at it. For me, it's very good. The art is stunning most of the time, especialy the color and depth.I was also reffered to Lone Wolf and Cub by Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima through the forward in the Lone Wolf 2100 series. If you enjoy Lone Wolf 2100, you will enjoy Lone Wolf and Cub even more. It is a VERY long series, with 26 volumes i believe, but the story is very well written and alot of the subjects are even thought provoking.I give Lone Wolf 2100 3 stars because the main story line is rather bland, and not thought out as well as it could be. Even in spite of that, I would suggest you buy or atleast find this to read."},{"Title":"Lone Wolf 2100 Volume 2: The Language of Chaos (Lone Wolf 2100 (Graphic Novels))","review":"I bought this at my local bookseller. I would have started with volume 1, but this one was the only one they had there. That said, it's easy enough to figure out the back story and what's going on. It's 2100, a dystopian society where robots have taken on more human qualities (such as skin and, to a degree, emotions). Itto (or rather d.Itto, as the constructs are named) has to protect Daisy, the toddler daughter of his creator, as she holds the key to the future of the human race.I'm an artist, and aspiring comic book illustrator. I buy comics for the art, both as inspiration and study material (and Francisco Ruiz Velasco definitely doesn't disappoint in this regard). The story usually comes second for me, but this series features some great writing. Like I said, it's clear enough that you can jump in without having read Volume 1 and still know what's going on. The main characters' personalities come through very clearly, and the assassin robots that constantly attack Itto and Daisy are able to express themselves with cleverly-written thought boxes that humanize them somewhat, and show that they don't always WANT to be the killers that they are forced to be.I haven't read the Lone Wolf and Cub series, but I'm definitely keen to check it out now."},{"Title":"Whose Hands Are These?: A Gifted Healer's Miraculous True Story","review":"This book is not technical and does not give any instructions on healing.

In this relatively short book (the translation could do with a bit of revision) Heidegger provides one of the best and clearest introductions to Kant's First Critique available in any language. Almost nothing in the English-language secondary literature on Kant makes clear what Kant means by \\"synthetic judgment\\", and since the stated theme of the First Critique is \\"how are synthetic judgments a priori possible?\\", this makes for a lot of useless English language secondary literature. Much of the fault for this situation lies with Norman Kemp-Smith, whose translation of Kant's text was the one used by most English-speaking readers for a long time. Interestingly, the structure of synthetic judgements, fudged and rendered incoherent by Kemp-Smith, is the first thing Heidegger zeroes in on in explaining what Kant's about. I would steer anyone who wants to read Kant first to this book, for an explanation of the basic terms of the First Critique, and then to Deleuze's little book on Kant, to get an overview, taking in all three of the Critiques, of Kant's philosophy in general.As a further bonus, this book's introductory sections provide a very enlightening and provocative discussion of the theme of mathesis in early modern philosophy and science.One further point that should be made: In this book Heidegger says virtually nothing about his view of what things are, or about things in general. A Heideggerian discussion of the thing would start from his discussion of the distinction between things as ready-to-hand and things as present-at-hand, as most famously articulated in the discussion of the hammer in Being And Time. In this book, right at the start, Heidegger explicitly states that he is going to discuss the thing solely considered as present-at-hand. So he very consciously chooses not to discuss his own position in these lectures. He's writing pureley as a historian of philosophy here. So, don't look here for any insight into what Heidegger thinks a thing is. This is Heidegger showing how modern philosophy's strict identification of being with presence-at-hand played itself out in the theme of mathesis in early modern philosophy, followed by a detailed examination of how it came to be elaborated in Kant's first Critique."},{"Title":"What is a Thing?","review":"The best guide to this book is the contents, pages iii-iv, which have topic titles for every few pages that probably won't mean a thing the first time you read them. If you are serious about this book, you will pay attention to those titles. Unless you speak German or Latin, or have a fantastic memory of why an expert like Heidegger would mention conglomerating thinkers like Hegel, the titles in the Contents will be the best guide you will have to figuring out what you are already supposed to know, when it finally matters. You won't get such help again, when you finally reach long sections on judgment (pp. 153-181), synthetic judgments (pp. 181-184), and the final section of:II. The Question About the Thing in Kant's Main Work . . .7. Systematic representation of all the synthetic principles of pure understanding (pp. 184-244).If there was ever a question that Martin Heidegger could use to demonstrate his knowledge of philosophy as a distinctly human outlook on what anyone might encounter, the book WHAT IS A THING? puts that question in the title. Most of the book is a discussion of Kant's philosophical project, as seen from a far more modern perspective. A short Preface by Martin Heidegger, dated April, 1962, states:This work presents the text of a lecture which was held in the winter semester, 1935-36, at the University of Freiburg. The lecture was entitled &quot;Basic Questions of Metaphysics.&quot;The English translation by W. B. Barton, Jr. and Vera Deutsch is followed by an analysis by Eugene T. Gendlin of the University of Chicago, as published in 1967. The Contents has detailed titles for the sections at the beginning of the book, including 12 items and an enumerated &quot;13. Summary&quot; on &quot;A. Various Ways of Questioning About the Thing&quot; before getting to the main topic, &quot;B. Kant's Manner of Asking About the Thing.&quot; I was puzzled by the opening remarks, but the Analysis points out, &quot;Although written as a simple common-sense discussion, it contains all of Heidegger's major points.&quot; (p. 247). Most of the Analysis sticks to English, but four pages are referred to as supporting the idea, &quot;An object in German is a Gegenstand, literally a standing-against.&quot; (p.260). There is an index of German Terms in which ten pages of Heidegger's lecture are listed for the term Gegenstand, one page for Gegenheit, another page for Gegenstandlichkeit, another for Gegenstehen, a few for Gegenstehenlassen, and even one for Gegen-uns-stehenden. (p. 302). I don't know German well enough to know if this is getting too personal for you, but something bipolar seems to be an aspect of WHAT IS A THING?The indices are of Names, German Terms, Latin Terms, and Greek Terms. The topics listed in the Contents manage to be in English for Part A., but the first word in B. I. 4. is in Greek characters, which I believe can be transliterated as Logos. Heidegger is close to the ancient Greek beginnings of philosophy, the problems encountered in Plato and the attempt at scientific determinations which Aristotle wrote about extensively. The concern with Latin in this book seems to be derived from the work of Sir Isaac Newton, whose Principia in Latin was published in 1686-87. A major topic in Heidegger's lectures seems to spring from the shift in philosophy from Aristotle through Newton to Kant:&quot;Five years after the publication of the CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON, exactly one hundred years after Newton's PRINCIPIA, Kant published an essay entitled THE METAPHYSICAL PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL SCIENCE (1786). On the basis of the position reached in the CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON it is a conscious supplement and counterpart to Newton's work. At the conclusion of the preface to his piece Kant expressly refers to Newton's work.&quot; (p. 77).Greek terms for mathematics can be found on pages 69-75 and 91. Latin terms for universal mathematics and common mathematics appear on page 101. On the pages in between (77, 92), the Latin phrase \`axiomata sive leges motus' this title of a section of Newton's work &quot;in which he presents the fundamental determinations about things as moved&quot; (p. 92) is almost translated as &quot;The project is axiomatic. Insofar as every science and cognition is expressed in propositions, the cognition which is taken and posited in the mathematical project is of such a kind as to set things upon their foundation in advance.&quot; (p. 92). Trying to put Heidegger's point in a Latin phrase and basic German words:&quot;1. The mathematical is, as mente concipere, a project (Entwarf) of thingness (Dingheit) which, as it were, skips over the things. The project first opens a domain (Spielraum) where things--i.e., facts--show themselves.&quot; (p. 92).Some people who read reviews don't like to have the ending of a book spoiled by an explanation which ruins the suspense. Only a few philosophers are mentioned in this book, and much more attention is devoted to philosophy before Kant than to the few philosophers whose work was a reaction to Kant's thinking. This is really a book about how people think about things, and those who adopted Heidegger's approach to how a philosopher sees basic questions arising in any ambiguous situation have been successful in the field of philosophy, far more than those who lacked some guide to the complexities involved in this kind of study. The gap between thinking and engaging in activities might be dismissed by those who don't think in German terms like \`Entgegenstehenlassen.' If you react adversely to words like that, perhaps this book would be a bitter lesson to you, more than anything else. Don't try to read it unless you would be interested in what might happen on that level, Heidegger having been what he was, primarily a philosopher, as he definitely is in this book."},{"Title":"What is a Thing?","review":"Kant never effectively addressed the question of the independent reality of \\"things\\" (thing in itself). He supplied an outline of the epistemologic structure of human thinking that, based as it was on forms and concepts that were transcendental i.e. universal and necessary and therefore a priori, gave as close as he believed we could get to objective \\"truth\\". Because we are hardwired to apply the pure forms of intuition (space and time) and the schematized pure concepts of the understanding (rules by which we make judgments, in conjunction with the pure forms of intuition and empiric intuitions and concepts from sensibility) to \\"experience\\" our world, we are able to engage in a meaningful discourse with others of our type who share the same hard wiring.This means that space and time and the schematized pure concepts, such as cause and effect, may have no independent reality. We can never know since we can never travel beyond the limitations our minds impose upon us. Of course this means that \\"things\\", as they really are, are closed off to knowing. So how does Heidegger make use of Kant to come to what is a \\"thing\\"?In fact Heidegger would be much like a transcendental idealist if he were concerned with the term. It is his orientation that is different. For Heidegger the issue is not the epistemic makeup of humans but the ontological structure of human Being (Dasein). If Kant is simply turned upside down he is the perfect compliment. Kant is describing the structure of Dasein's knowing, and is saying that we have access to this, through logic and the necessary character of the transcendental forms and concepts, that we can never have to the external world (one can argue whether the pure forms of intuition and the pure concepts of the understanding are really \\"things\\" in themselves and if so why can we know them). Kant is therefore describing an aspect of Dasein's ontologic structure.This same privileged access to self knowledge is what Heidegger would like to say about Dasein's exploration of its Being. We have an immediate access to it that we cannot necessarily have to other things. The \\"things\\" of the world take their importance and relevance, for us, from their relationships to Dasein's projects. Their independent reality is not as important or is not knowable. The importance of \\"things in themselves\\" lies in their importance to Dasein- not in their reality independent of Dasein. This finishes the circle then. Kant says we can know the truth of the basic epistemic structure of human Being (one of its ontologic characteristics) but not the truth of other beings. Heidegger says we can know other ontologic aspects of human Being and that the importance of other beings is settled in what they say about Dasein and not in themselves.This book gives a fair picture of Kant's basic theory from the Critique of Pure Reason, but through a Heideggerian lens. I personally would not read it to understand Kant, it is at once too simplified and too eccentric in its view. Its importance is in demonstrating how the thinking of the two philosophers meshes when their emphasis is so far apart."},{"Title":"Inside Coldfusion MX","review":"Over the last few years, I've worked with ColdFusion sporadically and without great success. Everyone said how easy it was to learn ColdFusion, but I just wasn't getting it. I got a copy of this book as soon as it came out and let me tell you, the first few chapters cleared up all of the confusion for me regarding CF.This book explained ColdFusion and application development in a way that just makes sense. The authors don't numb you with ultra-techno lingo but explain each and every concept in a way that is clear and concise and they give relevant examples to back it all up.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn ColdFusion development, extend their existing knowledge of ColdFusion or even learn to administrate their CF servers."},{"Title":"Inside Coldfusion MX","review":"Wow! I just started to work with MX from CF 5 and was worried about how well I would make the transition. Picked this book up and already I can see a marked improvement in my MX programming. Book was easy to follow and well thought out. I have read some articles and bought some code from author Neil Ross and he didn't disappoint here. Great book!!!!!!!This book is not like other books that come with a cd where the code doesn't even work. The site had all the code from the book and real working examples. Why are you not buying this book this second?!?!?! Go...hurry before they are all gone."},{"Title":"Inside Coldfusion MX","review":"\\"Inside ColdFusion MX\\" is an excellent starting point for anybody who wants to learn ColdFusion from scratch. The book uses simple language and illustrates the more complicated issues of programming with real life examples, which makes it very easy to read and understand.Experienced programmers who have worked with previous versions of ColdFusion will find the book to be a great introduction to features of the new MX version such as XML and Flash MX integration, CFC's and more.A well-organized index allows readers to quickly find any topic of interest. Chapters in the book are logically arranged and well cross-referenced. Task oriented readers will appreciate not having to plow through the book in contiguous order to be able to grasp required information.Some of the chapters I would like to highlight as particularly useful are:User Defined Functions; CF Components; Application Performance; Advanced Database Interaction; and very practical Tips and Tricks. Additionally, the appendices provides an invaluable resource for the novice and not-so-novice reader alike. Inside ColdFusion MX is a great book and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Inside Coldfusion MX","review":"I was a bit sceptical about this book. I thought anyone would be hard pressed to compete with Ben Forta's classic book, but this book is really aimed at a different target. If you are fairly new to ColdFusion and are looking at taking that next step into intermediate/advanced use of ColdFusion, then this is the right book for you.It introduces advanced concepts like using XML, new ColdFusion Components, Flash remoting, with clear easy to follow examples. Give it a look."},{"Title":"Inside Coldfusion MX","review":"This is the first book I've seen that tries to go beyond ColdFusion syntax and is definitely geared toward the intermediate developer.It does not focus on the basics like all the others but rather gives real-world examples and approaches.

If you are a speed-reading ColdFusion expert, you can glean some good information.The bad: The book is terribly edited. This is inexcusable when you consider the credentials of the editors. This really hits neophytes worse than experienced users, who can ostensibly tell when an update query is missing the UPDATE statement. There are so many typos that it is hard to believe that the book was spell-checked, let alone proofread.For me, the lowlight was the wacky, wrong-headed explanation of &quot;n-tier&quot; archatecture, but the worst part is that the explanations lack depth, so that someone learning MX from this book would not really be any further ahead when they finished than if they had read a more comprehesible albeit less ambitious book, like something from Visual Quickstart (their MX book isn't out yet, but, presumably, it will aspire to the series standard).It is really disheartening and hardly unique to this book that lax standards and quick release seem to be the new norm. I should have waited for the new Programming ColdFusion MX book."},{"Title":"Inside Coldfusion MX","review":"For beginners to advanced users alike, this book gives a good overview of all the new features of ColdFusion MX like CFCs, Flash remoting, and new tags like CFLOGIN and CFCHART. It also includes tips on migrating apps to MX. The book also covers all the basics like application planning, error handling, and syntax which new users will get the most use out of. I found the article on regular expressions to be very handy. For more advanced users, the book offers detailed information on leveraging ColdFusion MX to interact with fairly new technologies like web services and XML/XSL/XPath.All in all, a worthwhile investment."},{"Title":"Inside Coldfusion MX","review":"Very well organized and easy to use.

I've got it on my desk at work, now that we've officially moved to Cold Fusion MX. I'm an intermediate developer and this book seems to be written for CF developers at my level, where most books are very basic or very high level.I got a lot from the chapters on CFCs and from the sections about application development and methodologies. The book provides a nice lead into XML and web services too. I think the part that was most useful right off the bat were the sections on security and e-commerce. I pulled some code right out of the example code and immediately put it to work in one of my projects.You won't be dissappointed!

This edition is a facsimil copy of the second edition from 1913. There's not much to say rather that I believe is a good reprint of a lost book, that otherwise would be here. Being a facsimil you cannot expect much. As far as the Forgotten Books edition, it is perfectly edited brought from the past."},{"Title":"Act Of Courage- Cassette","review":"Although I find the claim referring to Mallinson as the heir to O'Brien and Forester a bit of a stretch, I have enjoyed this series. O'Brien had a subtle way of educating the reader to all the unfamiliar details of life on a British Man of War that Mallinson has not. It is a formidable task and other authors have bored me with out of place explanations as the story unfolded, so I am glad that Mallinson has not attempted it. However, not being well acquainted with the equine arts, I was often at a loss with the terminology of the horseman. Therefore, if you are not into horses you should not shy away from this series (I am not a sailor either), for the story still held me and I read it in as few intervals as time allowed me. I was moved by the way Hervey struggles with his duty to his personal life and his profession during his imprisonment. The shifting from the times of his earlier experiences in the war with Napolean to his more present situation in 1826-27 Portugal is aptly done. It is difficult for any author to keep it flowing back and forth and Mallinson does an admirable job of it. It is therefore a most pleasing read and well worth the time if you have read the earlier installments. Mallinson does not (appreciably at least to me), bore us who have read the earlier works with a lot of catching up, so I would urge the reader to seek out the earlier works in the series before beginning this one. I look forward to the further adventures promised."},{"Title":"Act Of Courage- Cassette","review":"An Act of Courage is similar in form to the previous Rumours of War; but better presented with fewer longer flashbacks to the Peninsula War, and less jumping between now and then and character perspectives. Its still a little choppy, but good enough I can - just - give it 4 stars.Hervey is here in the Spanish prison of Badajoz, where he stormed the French nigh on 20 years ago as a culmination of sorts to driving them from Spain. Mostly he is remembering his youthful travails as a Cornet - and explaining how he managed to spend the better part of 6 years at that rank, which smacks of a bit of a fix-up by Mallinson ex post facto. This is pretty good, both as a study of a cavalry regiment and also as military adventure fiction. In the present day, he is resolving to improve his life and put his selfishness behind him: there are glimmerings of his old faith returning, but not much more than that.In the past, there is trouble with another Cornet which is dealt with a little unsatisfactorily; for a while we almost get courtroom drama (as in The Reverse of the Medal) but only to be told the result almost as a throwaway - when we know what it must have been already - is a let down.The book ends on the dual culmination of Hervey's rescue from Badajoz in 1826, and the storming of its walls in 1812. Then there is a little coda when Hervey's plans start to fall apart already; you feel a little sorry for him, so I suppose he is becoming a little bit sympathetic again, which must be a good thing.Dont start reading here, for all this and Rumours contain the \\"earliest\\" adventures: they are not true prequels at all. Best to start at A Close Run Thing and read on as long as it takes you."},{"Title":"Act Of Courage- Cassette","review":"This is part of a great series by Mallinson.

It is a good idea to read them in order though."},{"Title":"Destination Branding, Second Edition: Creating the unique destination proposition","review":"There's an old Texan saying \\" All hat and no cattle\\". That's how I felt after reading this book. Who is the book written for? If you are an academic, there is too little empirical data. If you are a destination marketing professsional, there is hardly anything you can gain from reading this book. If you are a student, its too shallow. Nearly all chapters start out with a definition of branding by some marketing authority. Very repetitive. Philip Kotler's contribution on chapter 5 is OK, but outdated. Not one of his best. Better to get a book about branding. Chapter 5 does provide some value, as does the case study on Western Australia Chapter 12. Hence the two stars.

Jim Kayalar is the managing director and founder of Business Tune Up."},{"Title":"Destination Branding, Second Edition: Creating the unique destination proposition","review":"After Destination Branding was first released it quickly became the branding bible for destination marketers and academics alike. Contributions by some of the world's leading destination branding experts such as Philip Kotler, Simon Anholt and Wally Olins have provided the second edition with some of the best in contemporary thinking on the subject. This edition introduced a number of new case studies that reflect the challenges of branding places in a variety of different market situations and lifecycle stages.

(It was in German and I was studying German.) I have since bought countless copies whenever and wherever I came across them to give to friends' children. I'm now grandmother-aged, but it's still one of my favorite books (in either language). The illustrations are so clever and the story is sweet.Note: I can't recall which language has which, but the drawing of an octopus in one of the books has only 7 tentacles, whereas the drawing in the other book has 8 tentacles.This is a must for children from 3 to 93.

I eagerly ordered it for my children so they could enjoy the story and witty illustrations, however, my children froze on the page with the cat burglar. After that my children hated the book and asked about cat burglars coming through the window often.I guess I didn't realize it as a child but the cat burglar (carries a knife I think ) was a little too scary."},{"Title":"Crictor","review":"Crictor is another old story about a wild animal who finds his place in a human home. This boa constrictor arrives in Madame Bodot's home in a doughnut-shaped box, shipped from Africa by her thoughtful herpetologist son. After her initial surprise, she accepts him as if he were any other kind of pet and he quickly finds his place in her neighborhood and community -- playing with the children and (likeLyle, Lyle, Crocodile (Lyle the Crocodile)andThe Story of Babar) helping with their educational instruction. The story culminates when Madame Bodot's home is invaded by a burglar, who is subdued by Crictor until the police arrive (drawn by the burglar's terrified screams). He gains the admiration of the entire village, and lives a long and happy life.The book, printed before the high-tech revolution in children's book publication, initially seems humbly illustrated with only two colors, but the limitations of the technology do not greatly hinder Ungerer's excellent writing, wry humor and sinuous lines. Madame Bodot and Crictor are each admirable in their own way -- she in her generous service to the community, he in his loyal courage in defending her. This old story retains its charm, and is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Crictor","review":"A charming tale involving a pet snake Crictor and his elderly female owner who has received the boa as a gift from her son in Africa. Lovely images throughout, especially Crictor in his 10 foot long bed.

He takes on the role of an average pet... he even walks on a leash. Cute."},{"Title":"Crictor","review":"Oh, I LOVE this book! It is from the 50's, and SO well written! Instead of dumbing children down, it uses words that are more sophisticated. The story is hilarious! It uses pen and ink type drawings, which brought back so many pleasant memories! As a child, I didn't remember the story too well, but the pictures stayed in my mind, particularly the one of Crictor in what looks like a 10-foot long bed and wearing a 10-foot long armless sweater!!This elderly lady receives a gift of a snake from her son in Africa. She is a teacher and brings Crictor to school, where he becomes a jump rope and slide for the kids. He also forms letters and numbers. He captures a burglar and the locals name a park after him!One of my favorite books of all time!"},{"Title":"Crictor","review":"This was one of my favorite books growing up--I must have checked it out of the school library a dozen times. It's the adorable story of an old French woman who relies on a friendly boa to see her around Paris.

We need books like these for the next generation."},{"Title":"Crictor","review":"19 years after I first read Crictor, I still remember nearly every word. It was quite possibly one of my favorite books as a child because it is sweet, funny, and heartfelt. Crictor is a boa constrictor that Mdm. Bodot's son has sent home from Africa. He bonds with Mdm. Bodot after an initial fright and quickly endears himself to everyone. Soon, he is given an opportunity to foil a burglar who threatens Mdm. Bodot and is revered as a hero. I read this book over and over again until it was in tatters. What child doesn't love a friendly protecting character like Crictor? Pair it with Lyle, Lyle Crocodile for a double-dose of green reptilian fun."},{"Title":"Crictor","review":"This is a cute book and one recommended by the Sonlight homeschooling curriculum. I don't like the picture of the burglar very much and although the rest of the story is very cute, I don't think I'll be buying my own copy. We checked this one out from the library. My son is 2 and he did enjoy the story, but he was confused by the burglar and wondered why Madame Bodot was tied to the chair. He wasn't scared because he doesn't know about burglars and I'd rather he not worry about that kind of thing. He thought that the gun the policeman had was a flashlight. It was very good for pointing out the color green though and the drawings are nice. If your child has already been exposed to violence either on TV, cartoons, or movies, then it probably won't be that scary, but to others I think it would be. I didn't read this one as a child, but if I had I think it would have frightened me. I like the idea of pointing out Africa and France on a map. I'm sure we'll read this story a few more times before we return it and I'll bring out the map."},{"Title":"Crictor","review":"Do you ever like a book 'just because'? I can't make a comment on the witty prose or beautiful artwork to back up my heartfelt, \\"I like it\\" but I will try. It is an endearing tale about a snake.

The pen and ink drawings with lots of green coloring like the beloved title character are a perfect compliment to the story.If you want to go educational get out the maps and locate the 2 places that are mentioned in the story -- France & Africa. A sense of right & wrong alongside good character always strikes a chord with parents so Crictor is right on there.

The observations of the authour stand the test of time, a tribute to her deep insight into the decade. Felicitas is a precocious Catholic schoolgirl who elects to attend Columbia University in the sixties instead of a Catholic institution. She has already made up her mind to test the boundaries of her upbringing when she arrives, making her a easy conquest for her professor, the feckless and beautiful Robert. Robert may be a prof, but as the expression goes, deep down he is shallow. Robert and his hangers on espouse all the right sixties attitudes, but in rejecting the values of their upbringing they have lost their compasssion and humanity. These have been replaced by a dogmatic free love, free thought philosophy. The changes of the sixties were very positive in many respects, but there was dark side as reflected in this book. The character of Robert is incredibly on the money, self serving and predatory while espousing the anti establishment cliches of the decade. Felicitas' story mirrors the very real damage done to many in the sixties when they broke ties with their family and their values to follow the darker trend of the times. The novel is based partly on Ms. Gordon's own experience, although in interviews she indicates she experienced the more positive aspects of the times, and found the freedom and ability to play at Columbia liberating in a positive way."},{"Title":"The Company of Women","review":"Final Payments, Mary Gordon's first novel, and Men and Angels, are so extraordinary in their richness, complex and compelling characters, philosophical depth and control of language, that I can safely say Gordon is one of the most interesting writers working today. But this? Oh dear. Felicitas is a cliche, her involvement in the 60's leftest colegiate circle a cliche, her 70s single motherhood a cliche; the whole a mess. Skip this and buy a copy of Final Payments, probably one of the best first novels by an American writer in the 20th century. This is the dreaded Sophomore Slump at its slumpiest!"},{"Title":"The Company of Women","review":"SPOILER ALERT: This 1980 novel tells the story of Felicitas Taylor, whose widowed mother is among a group of New York City five women in the thrall of a conversative Roman Catholic priest named Father Cyprian. The women, all single or widowed, form the company of women who raise the young girl. Overseeing them is Cyprian, who left his order following the Vatican II liberalization and eventually retreats to the rural town in upstate New York where he was born and raised. The story opens in 1963, when Felicitas is fourteen, and depicts her importance to the women and man who surround: She is their last best hope, Cyprian tells them. Felicitas is smart, perhaps even gifted, but socially isolated from people her own age and the mainstream of American life. She spends her summers at the priest's compound, and although she knows the kids at her school in the outer borough where she lives, they don't interact, and she has no friends. The story then shifts to 1969, and Felicitas is attending a small Catholic college, majoring in classics and reading Latin and Greek. Her relationship with Cyprian is tense because she speaks her mind and has turned against the Vietnam war, which he supports. She is so anti-war that she secretly attends a march on the Pentagon. However,not long after the classics program at her college is curtailed, and she decides -- against the wishes of all of the adults involved in her life -- to transfer to Columbia. At Columbia, Felicitas falls under the spell of a political science professor named Robert, a shallow man who spouts all the radical bullshit of the day, and quickly becomes his lover and soon after moves into the apartment he shares with two women who were also once his lovers. The love affair soon falters because of Felictas' obsession with her lover, who espouses free love and urges her to sleep with one of the louts who lives downstairs. Felicitas complies and not long after discovers she's pregnant. After scraping together the money for an abortion -- which was illegal at the time -- she runs out of the clinic at the last moment and goes home to her mother. The story then shifts to 1977. Felicitas and her daughter are living in a house her mother built in Cyprian's compound in upstate New York. All the other women have also moved upstate, and they've now formed a new company of women to raise Felicitas' daughter, Linda. Cyprian is dying of heart failure, and Felicitas is about to marry a nice local man -- silent and wise but not smart, she says -- who can be a father to her child.This is a dreary book, despite the pot-boiling plot. Felicitas is an unbelievable and unsatisfying character. As a devout Roman Catholic woman in 1969, she should have some misgivings -- some thought, at minimum -- about going to bed with the divorced Robert. Not a word. As a devout Roman Catholic woman in 1969, she should have severe misgivings about seeking an abortion. Not a word. As a highly-intelligent woman in 1969, she should notice that she's left a patriarchal circle she found tyrannical and immediately joined another, albeit one that was not celibate. No notice mentioned. As a anti-war young American in 1969, she should have continued to at least note, and perhaps even protest, the continuing war. Not a word. As an American women living through the upheaval of the second wave of feminism, she should make some connections. Not even mentioned. While I can believe that there were women who were as sheltered as Felicitas is supposed to have been -- even women growing up in New York City among single and widowed women who have worked for their livings for decades -- I find it not believable that a highly intelligent woman attending one of the finest universities on the planet, one that was in turmoil -- on strike! takeovers of administration offices! -- would have failed to notice. For all of those reasons, I found Felicitas unbelievable as a character. And after reading this book, I have serious doubts that this author's work actually deserves her reputation as a thoughtful and accomplished writer. In fact, I find myself very turned off by her and am unlikely to ever read anything else by her. Mary Gordon is well-known as Roman Catholic writer, and it is an insult to Roman Catholic women who struggled with sexuality and choice in those times to pretend that those conflicts didn't exist."},{"Title":"The Company of Women","review":"Felicitas, a young girl, was brought up by her mother, and he mothers friends.

I particularly loved the confrontation between Charlotte and the Duke's EX-mistress. Fun! I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Her Scandalous Intentions","review":"I just finished reading this book, and all I can say is I'm relieved it is over. First of all, the book does not concentrate on the main character's love story. There is too much going on, too many characters, too many conflicts, and I think they were not handled skillfully. The book does not flow, the situations are boring and the characters artificial. I could not care much about any of them.A good romance novel, is supossed to make you feel, to create sexual tension, to engage the readers and make them sympathize with the characters and their problems, this book accomplish none for me.Besides, there were certain scenes that I did not like at all, for example, at the end when the author tries to redeem the villain by making him do a good deed at the end of his life. I am not going to say what it was, for those of you who have not read the book, but I feel that the deed should have been accoplished by the hero, not the villain.All in all, I found the book boring. I would advise you to save your money on this one."},{"Title":"Her Scandalous Intentions","review":"If you're looking for a fun, adventurous love story, I highly recommend this book. A flawed hero and heroine have to wrestle their personal demons while wrangling with the pesky issue of staying alive. Charlotte, generous but naive, never seems to completely fit in with the crowd. She's at a house party in the country when she wanders out and happens upon the dangerous hero, James, in a suspicious rendez-vous. James, meanwhile, an English spy, is hard pressed to believe the coincidence. That night, Charlotte's attacked in her room. James comes to her rescue, only to have the two of them discovered in a seemingly uncompromising position. What follows is a sham engagement that's as heated as their arguements. They secretly try to prove the other's guilt, all the while falling in love. Good, strong characters, unexpected plot twists and a heroine that's not afraid to defend herself. Great suspense. Great read!"},{"Title":"Her Scandalous Intentions","review":"I have to agree with another reviewer about how this book has so much going on that the romance between the two main characters is overshadowed. I didn't like the way they even interacted with each other. I normally like it when the hero and heroine don't get along right off and then realize that they really love each other but these two just annoyed me. I wish I could rate this higher but I just can't. Hopefully her next book will be better."},{"Title":"Her Scandalous Intentions","review":"Witty, well written book. I particularly enjoyed the confrontation between Charlotte and the Duke's EX- mistress. Fun! I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Her Scandalous Intentions","review":"With my apologies to the author in advance, I found this book not up to the standards set by other Regency writers. There was too much inconsistency and too much plot contrivance. For example, the hero deliberately hides evidence in the heroine's room, then suspects HER of traitorous intentions. He has an evil cousin whom I'm not sure he has even met because he first says that he has been told that his cousin is handsome. Later, it comes to light that evil cousin has stolen a treasure he intends selling to help Napoleon escape. He does rescue heroine from a brute, but this is only because he has placed her in a position of jeopardy to begin with. Not very heroic. Later, he drugs her (not once, but twice) to get her quietly back to London. At one point in the story, the heroine throws a book at the hero and gashes his forehead (he feels blood dripping into his eye). In the next instant, he is kissing the heroine senseless. Yet, when the kiss is over and he dabs at his forehead, there are only a couple of drops of blood. Very difficult to follow with all the inconsistencies."},{"Title":"Her Scandalous Intentions","review":"In 1814, Charlotte Hastings attends a party in Southbridge, England though she would prefer to continue her work at the veterans' hospital in London. While by herself sketching, she observes the Duke of Girard James Morgan meeting with a frightened person. Unable to resist she draws the encounter, but James comes over and takes the picture from her. James believes that Charlotte is the future fiancee of his odious cousin Mortimer Blanton, who stole property that probably is being used to finance Napoleon's return to France.When thugs assault Charlotte in her room, James rescues her. However, the other guests catch them so he claims she is his fiancee. He takes her \\"prisoner\\" because he realizes that she has a document he needs, but where she hid it he does not know. As Charlotte and James become acquainted with one another, they fall in love, but both mistrust the other believing that their beloved is a Napoleonic agent.Fans of Regency romantic suspense will take great delight with Sari Robin's wonderful debut novel, HER SCANDALOUS INTENTIONS. The story line is brimming with action as the innocent Charlotte lands in the middle of an espionage mess while the tainted James tries to figure out her role in the fiasco. Though it takes a bit too long for the reader to receive that critical dramatic irony of knowing why before the hero does, sub-genre fans will rejoice while looking forward for more works from an obviously talented author.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Her Scandalous Intentions","review":"England, May 1814Unlike the other young ladies attending Lord and Lady Balstram's weekend house party, Charlotte Hastings is not on the hunt for a husband as she prefers her art and the work she does helping wounded soldiers back in London. Sneaking off into the countryside to do some sketching, Charlotte witnesses a suspicious encounter between a stranger and another houseguest, James Morgan, the Duke of Girard. Soon enough, Charlotte's world is spun out of control as she gets caught in a web of conspiracy involving stolen property and a plot to free Napoleon Bonaparte from Elba.James Morgan, the Duke of Girard, is out to find a thief within the government. Believing his cousin Mortimer Blanton is the culprit, James becomes suspicious when a woman Mortimer is known to be courting witnesses a transaction between an agent and himself. Needing a hiding place for items involving national security, James decides to place it in Charlotte's room, thus setting off a chain of events that lead to the pair getting caught in a compromising situation and temporarily betrothed.Sari Robins' debut novel is a tangled series of plots, subplots, and villains. While heroine Charlotte Hastings is admirably self-sufficient and prone to laying her opponents low with groin injuries, she comes across looking more like Lara Croft than a Regency era lady. Meanwhile, James Morgan may be a duke, but he certainly doesn't act like a gentleman. It's hard to imagine a true nobleman acting the way he does towards Charlotte -- rudely tearing her artwork, dousing her twice with laudanum, and kidnapping her -- all before page 75!While the story fast-paced and enjoyable for the most part, one gets the sensation that the author, perhaps fearful of not having enough of a story to tell, proceeded to pile on the characters and subplots until HER SCANDALOUS INTENTIONS comes close to becoming a historical soap opera. This reviewer respectfully suggests the use of minimal supporting characters and better research (i.e., Manton's was a shooting gallery, not a boxing saloon in Regency London) in the future.TheSchemer"},{"Title":"Her Scandalous Intentions","review":"I have read hundreds, perhaps thousands of romances and this one is great.

He is absolutely delicious and the shero, Charlotte, is someone I would call a girlfriend. Get this book, you can't go wrong. Just edgy enough for those of us who like a little heat in our romances but safe enough for those readers who are a little tame at heart. I want to encourage the author to revisit some of the other characters in this book and tell their story(i.e hilarious Elizabeth, spoiled Margaret, and yummy Robert). For a first time writer you have really hit a home run...keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Her Scandalous Intentions","review":"Charlotte tends to be minding her own business but James just won't let her - constantly putting her in jeopardy of losing her life. James, who is trying to catch a traitor working towards the Napoleon cause (possily his own wicked cousin) uses Charlotte as bait- not knowing exactly how she fits in the picture. So the adventure begins- Charlotte discovers through James' carelessness that there is a betrayal going on and thinking that James is the traitor, leaning towards the Napoleon cause, she gets involved. It is wild. And even though it would be so easy to &quot;throw Charlotte's reputation to the wind&quot;, James is too galliant of a man to do so. To protect Charlotte from talk of the Ton after being found in her bedroom, James announces in front of everyone at a house party that they are betrothed (when they don't even know each other). He figures that he will make a peace offering to her, move her off, let the talk die down and move on about his business. But those that know Charlotte has other plans- and they will do what ever it takes to protect her reputation even if it means forcing James to truly marry her. This is where the fun begins - and yes, my favorite scene is Charlotte's confrontation with James ex-mistress. Of course, Charlotte comes out being the true elegant lady! James is dashing and every lady's dream of a lover/husband. But Charlotte is nothing to cough at herself.Yes, there are inconsistances but there is plenty of suspence and romance to over-shadow them. It's a good read."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"SHORT REVIEW BLURB: I enjoyed this great recounting of The Battle for Stalingrad, but in many places it reads like an elementary school history book rather than an entertaining novel. That being said, I enjoyed reading the novel and would recommend it to others. I gave it four stars rather than five because of the many places it dragged due to superfluous detail or rote recitation of detail.ABOUT THE CONTENT: I enjoy reading about W.W.II when I get the chance, but I mostly review books about the Arab-Israeli Wars. This book, however, has a very interesting tie-in: many of Israel's soldiers were SURVIVORS of Stalingrad (On the Soviet side, of course!). William Craig didn't ignore the Jewish tie-in to The Battle of Stalingrad. His research includes interviews of several Israelis who were soldiers, Russian or Polish nationals, and survivors of Stalingrad. Among them were: Ignacy Changar, Mikhail Goldstein, and Hersch Gurewicz.The book in most places flows very well. Craig accomplishes this by interspersing personal accounts from the war from the hundreds of interviews that he performed over five plus years in several countries including Russia, Germany, and Israel. Hearing the personal accounts of an Italian doctor on march as a prisoner of the Red Army really gives the book some human interest. Reading of how this same doctor would regale his fellow prisoners with stories about delicious meals in Italy, while the prisoners were surviving on a few frozen cabbages and hunks of bread (not enough to sustain human life and well below minimum caloric needs) was very colorful. Craig also didn't ignore some of the more gruesome aspects of captivity under the Red Army: cannibalism. Many of the Italians and other prisoners of the Red Army during W.W.II were treated so poorly and were so desperately hungry that they resorted to cannibalism. Pretty gruesome, but very entertaining. Very few soldiers left the Red Army camps. Of the estimated 90,000 Axis troops (Italian, Hungarian, German, etc.) who eventually surrendered and went into captivity less than 5,000 of them were able to return to see their countries and families again (and the great majority of them, only after twelve years in tortuous captivity as described above). In this respect, the novel reminded me of \\"One Day in the life of Ivan Denisovitch\\" or the \\"Archipelago Gulag\\" books by Alexander Solzhenitsyn.The military history was commendable and presented details such as the significance of the battle, the major personalities and the battlefield butchery that have made this battle a thing of legend. However, Orders of Battles (OOB) or TO&E; (Tables of Organization and Equipment) are not included in the novel. While this may be a disappointment to many wargamers, the colorful accounts of many battles would be very inspirational to scenario writers. One of the most interesting tributes to this book is that it spawned an entire game that is well known to W.W.II gamers: ASL (Advanced Squad Leader).BEST THING ABOUT THE NOVEL: The author's many interviews with actual survivors and the use of those same survivor's personal diaries is without a doubt this book's greatest strength. The wide range of narratives from German, Italian, Hungarian, and Russian soldiers, support staff, commanders, and civilians gives this book its' considerable realism and entertaining strength. Even better, William Craig didn't leave the story unfinished; he wrote a short epilogue that tells about many of the characters as they survived the war as of 1973 (when the book was first published). For the film's fans, it was interesting that Tanya Chernova (the femme fatale) didn't end up marrying Zaitsev (the protagonist) after the war. She thought that Zaitsev had died and didn't learn until 1969 that he had both survived the war and married someone else. It's really hard not to like a novel that has such facts!ABOUT THE TIE-IN TO THE MOVIE: My edition of the book was the movie tie-in version and I view those words with dubiousness since the film's main characters occupy about 6 pages of this 455-page book. The movie focused on the micro drama of two snipers battling, but the book focuses on the ENTIRE conflict from the moment German troops entered Soviet soil until the defeat of German General Paulus at Stalingrad. Many believe that \\"Enemy at the Gates,\\" the movie, is more closely based on the fictional novel \\"The War of the Rats\\" (which in turn uses this book for a lot of its information). I agree with this conclusion. Another reviewer wrote:\\"If you want to be educated, read Craig's book. If you want to be educated AND enthralled, read David Robbins' WAR OF THE RATS instead.\\"I like the spirit of his words, but disagree with the idea that \\"War of the Rats\\" by David Robbins is educational and entertaining. While very entertaining and educational in that it uses William Craig's book as a source, the book would include a caption \\"based on fact\\" if it were made into a movie today (curiously enough like the film \\"Enemy at the Gates\\"). Robbins is a better writer in that his prose is much more entertaining, but his research wouldn't light a candle to that of William Craig. I would recommend reading both novels: \\"Enemy at the Gates\\" by William Craig for the facts and \\"War of the Rats\\" by David Robbins for entertainment.SUGGESTIONS: I would also suggest seeing the movie \\"Stalingrad\\" directed by Joseph Vilsmaier. This German-produced film follows the story of \\"Enemy at the Gates: Movie Tie-In\\" much better. The film does a better job of showing the horrific face of the battle than \\"Enemy at the Gates.\\"I also recommend the film \\"Europa Europa\\" for an account of Solomon Perel, a Jewish-German boy who manages to conceal his identity from the Nazis and ends up a member of their Youth Party as well as a soldier in the W.W.II German army. The movie is based on Solomon Perel's autobiography, also a good read.REVIEW BY: Maximillian Ben Hanan"},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"As an historical reference, this is the definitive account of the most brutal battle in the history of war. Through the use of Nazi and Russian officers' diaries, uncensored letters, official communications transcripts, documents and interviews with the combatants, William Craig has created a masterwork that is compelling and hard to put down.After seeing the movie, I read the book and was astonished to learn that the movie - which does take a few artistic liberties - was based on only a few pages!!!!!"},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"This book is a history of the whole battle of Stalingrad, and not just the story of sniper Zaitsev as portrayed in the movie.

And it was the Nazi's fighting the commies. I had no one to cheer for"},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Stalingrad was the definitive battle of World War 2. It was the battle in which the German juggernaut met its match and where the tide turned. Before Stalingrad, the German army won everywhere it went. After Stalingrad, the German army reeled back until Berlin was occupied, the Soviet and Allied armies united, and the war was won. What happened at Stalingrad and why are therefore important topics in trying to understand this turnaround point.Stalingrad is also known for a different reason. It was a bloodbath. The author of this book lists the estimated casualty figures and they total well over one million people. As horrifying as that number is, it probably understates that casualty rate significantly as this book was written in the 1970's - when the Soviet government was still not sharing information about World War 2 and what took place.In terms of the descriptions of the violence and destruction that was part and parcel of the Stalingrad battle, this book is horrifying and even mind-numbing. The author does a good job of putting into words the awful realities of that battle. However, no matter how nice the words, a battle of this type and nature can probably never be adequately described. Even visualizing some of the scenes described in the book can have sensitive people be subjected to nightmares. Even with that, I am sure that the descriptions provided still mask the terribleness of the actual events and cannot imagine what it must have been like to have lived through portions of that battle.The book focuses on the German 6th Army and its drive to Stalingrad and battles around Stalingrad until it is forced to surrender - or be annihilated to a man. Initially, the Germans are victorious and drive the Soviets back and have high hopes that the war will end in a few months. Then, Hitler changes the orders of the Army from maneuvering to capture the Soviet armies, to capturing the city. At this point, a series of blunders and mistakes arise on the German side which allow the Soviets to first stop the German advance, and then prepare a counterblow of their own which encircles the German Army and starts destroying it in detail. Most of the anecdotes and stories are told from the German side - which is understandable as the author had only limited access to Russian sources. However, even this limited view brings up a variety of questions and points out some highly questionable decisions made on the German side. For instance, while Paulus was masterful at getting to the city, he seemed completely inept at command after that. The Germans had made it to the banks of the Volga both North and South of the city. Why did Paulus decides then to attack the city frontally and not find a way to block the Soviet reinforcements coming from across the river? Instead of the encirclements that worked so well for the Wehrmacht to that point, he simply expends manpower and ammunition on a horrendous pyrrhic strategy of pushing the Soviets. The Soviets, for their part, pour hundreds of thousands of poorly trained soldiers into the city from across the river and suffer the casualties readily.And after it was obvious that a counterattack was being developed by the Soviets, Paulus kept pushing and placed his weakest units in the positions where the Soviets were concentrating for their counterattack. Also, when he had the chance to break out, he refused to do so. Of course, Hitler was denying him the authority to do so, but he ends up sacrificing hundreds of thousands of German lives for illusory gains.Hitler's mistakes are well documented here as are his rages and his totally mis-management of the war at this point, but that had been known before. Because the author had limited access to Soviet sources, we do not know what mistakes were being made on that end. One can only assume that some were, but it will take an updated study of this battle, now that we do have easier access to Russian sources, to see if there were any similar errors being made on the Russian side. I have to believe that there were, as otherwise, some of the personnel decisions made immediately after the battle do not make much sense.The brutality of both sides, the sheer elimination of their humanity as they killed each other and destroyed everything in sight is told in short little segments that describe vignettes of the battle. As a reader, this format was actually quite easy to understand and made it a bit easier to stomach the scenes. The author included two sections of photographs of some of the people involved as well as scenes of the city immediately following the battles. I think one of the most haunting for me, was the picture of the German Battalion cemetery that according to the note below it was dug up by the Soviets immediately after the battle and all the bodies interned there were reburied in an unmarked trench. That kind of brought home the brutality and nastiness of the two adversaries in this battle."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"I really like this book. It is well written and is accessible to all who read it. It is a good primer history of Stalingrad. I highly recommend it to all who are wanting a good general overall history of this battle. The new book by Antony Beevor is then the logical next step for me. Of course if you want a more nuts and bolts strategic view, then go to anything by David Glantz."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"An excellent book about the battle for Stalingrad. Is very well researched and very accurate based on other accounts I've read. The book describes the big picture and also tells stories about individuals who were part of the event."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"This book is narrative history at its best. It brings to life the horror or war and, indeed, the horror of war at its worst.Ostensibly, the book is a tie in with the movie of the same name although it was written long before the movie was ever made. The so called movie tie in is little more than a piece of marketing hype.As it was with Napoleon, so it was with Hitler. Russia proved to be the downfall of both. William Craig illustrates the pig headedness of Hitler and how this pig headedness contributed to his demise.Read this book not as story of the deeds of Vassily Zaitzev, the Russian sniper around whom the movie is made but, rather, as a history of an epic battle that was the beginning of the end of the Thousand Year Reich."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"In the height of the Cold War, Craig braved the Iron Curtain to tell the gut wrenching personal accounts of the battle from BOTH sides. Although the work is now criticized for the lack of Russian primary sources cited, it dosen't stop modern authors from conveniently 'borrowing' from this excellent book, in order to sell their own. Despite the collapse of the Iron Curtain, no author has displaced Craig's work from being the best account of the battle on the personal level. For an operational analysis, Erickson and Ziemke/Bauer should be consulted."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Still the best book on the subject. Be warned, the movie is based more on Robbin's &quot;War of the Rats&quot;. This book gives a very personal account from all sides (Corti's contribution from the Italian point of veiw is remarkable). It reads like a novel, a very easy but exciting read."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Craig writes eloquently about the epic battle of Stalingrad, combining points of view from both Russian and German combatants. Too often, especially with Eastern Front campaigns, we get clumsy, lifeless prose: Orders-of-battle, numbing statistics, and tons of minutiae. This is gripping, page-turning writing about the human cost of winning and losing a battle. Too bad it is no longer in print."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"I liked all of the details about the war. The sniper duel is only a section of this book. I expected it to be the bulk of the book but it is not. I also recommend Grandfather's Tale: the Tale of a German Sniper. It goes through the entire war from start to finish."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"&quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; is one of the most powerful reading experiences I've had in a long time. Meticulously researched and brilliantly written, right from the beginning, the reader is enmeshed in the personal stories of the men and women who fought and died in what is considered one of World War Two's most defining battles. This is not a mere parade of facts and figures. William Craig brings this story to life with prose that reads like a great novel. As the horror mounts, the reader comes to sympathize with those on both sides of the conflict. In the end, there are no winners. Everyone - Russian and German - has suffered a staggering toll. Not for the faint of heart, Craig spares the reader no detail. This is a book I will not soon forget."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Enemy At The Gates is a great history of the battle of Stalingrad, no doubt. But if you want to know more about the sniper duel portrayed in the movie, get WAR OF THE RATS, by David L. Robbins. It's an excellent novel, and is the real, true story of the sniper duel, unlike the movie which has Hollywood-ized the entire confrontation between the top German and Russian snipers at Stalingrad. WAR OF THE RATS is marvelous, as good a novel as Enemy At The Gates is a non-fiction history of the battle."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"What can I say about William Craig's masterpiece other than that it is an excellent, informative and profound work? Craig is an amazing writer who delivers his story with passion.

First rate and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"&quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; is out of print, but it shouldn't be a problem to locate a copy at a library or through one of Amazon's affiliates. It is worth the trouble! This was the first book to put a human face on the Battle of Stalingrad. Because the account was compiled from interviews and memoirs of participants, the book often reads like an exciting novel. In this respect, it closely resembles Andrew Tully's or Cornelius Ryan's accounts of the Battle of Berlin. When I learned of the upcoming film &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot;, I was ecstatic to think that this excellent book would at long last come to the big screen! Alas, only the title is taken from &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; -- the screenplay is based on David Robbins'novel &quot;War of the Rats&quot;. The movie's focus will be on the historically dubious sniper battle and the hysterically bogus romantic interest. What a pity. For the real flavor of Stalingrad, get the real &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; and Antony Beevor's &quot;Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege&quot;."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"First, let's be clear on what this book is not. It is not a detailed, operational history of the battle. There are only a couple of maps of relatively poor quality, and the day to day movements of units is largely ignored. If you want to understand in detail how the battle developed and where units were at any given time, you will be disappointed.What this book DOES do very well is to capture the worm's-eye view of the battle from individual perspectives. The many interviews with veterans from both sides (including the Axis allied armies) provides a moving, compelling view of the battle from the perspective of the individual soldier. While the previous reviewer is correct that these are slanted toward the German side and that the Germans come across as more believable, Craig made a strong attempt to work in Soviet views, and the Soviets come across fairly well also.The book's greatest strength (it's personal views) is also its greatest weakness: an individual soldier never has a clear picture of the larger battle he/she is in, and because of this, is in no position to describe the larger context of his/her own actions. Commanders of larger units do have this, but Craig is more interested in their psychology than in where and when regiments, divisions, and corps moved and engaged the enemy. Although Craig is occasionally clear on operational details, usually they are hazy, and it's very unclear which units are fighting which below division level (and sometimes even above).The previous reviewer's comments on Craig's unfamiliarity with Russian culture are also accurate. As an American who speaks both Russian and German, I can attest that his criticisms are accurate. Craig is obviously culturally much more comfortable with German culture than Russian, and this shows in many small mistakes throughout the book. In some cases, these mistakes, while small, are troubling in their implications. I am a historian, and I know that when sifting primary sources and synthesizing them into a narrative, I am often forced to make judgments and inferences. To do this accurately, one needs an encyclopedic knowledge of the entire context of one's subject, including minutiae. Craig appears to lack this. For example, on pages 71-72, there is the evocative story of the decimation of the 64th division. According to Craig, the division commander marched down the row of assembled troops, counted off each tenth man, and shot him in the face point blank in the face with his revolver. Craig writes, \\"When the last bullet in the revolver thudded into a man's brain, the commander shoved the pistol back in his holster and walked away....soldiers broke from formation and scattered in all directions. Behind them six of their comrades lay in a neat pattern on the grass.\\"This is a shocking and powerful scene, but there is a small problem: the Model 1895 Nagant revolver hold SEVEN shots, not six. One body more or less may seem insignificant, but it is precisely the minute level of detail in Craig's descriptions that make the book so powerful. However, it appears from this scene that he is making up some of the details, based on his own (Western) preconceptions. Craig doesn't use footnotes, so it's hard to tell what his source was for this story. Still, unless the commander had a partially loaded cylinder, Craig essentially fabricated at least one detail (the six bodies on the grass) in order to lend power and credibility to his story. It's unclear just how much of this story was based on documented fact and how much on undocumented extrapolation. One wonders how many other of the convincing details in the book are in fact Craig's own inaccurate assumptions as opposed to precisely accurate facts. Given his system of lumping sources together at the back of the book, there is no way to tell.Finally, while the Prologue talks of using previously unused Soviet and German archival sources, a glance at the Bibliography makes it clear that the book is based (apart from interviews with Soviet veterans) almost entirely on German sources. There is only one Soviet source that could be considered archival. Again, this shows up in the narrative as well: the movements of Soviet troops is quite hazy, and we are again often left with vague notions of hordes of T-34s and of Soviets shouting \\"urrah!\\" as opposed to any clear or detailed picture of Soviet units. The German slant gets extremely strong as the book winds down, with inordinate amounts of time being spent on the conversations in Paulus' headquarters. As the battle continues, the focus becomes more and more German.In the end, this is still a valuable book. Craig is a master of showing us what goes on in soldiers' minds as they fight to the death. However, a German-centered focus, troubling errors of detail and interpretation, and a limited range of sources make it less than ideal as a history of the entire campaign. I don't know of any book on the battle that does describe the campaign in detail and accurately on an operational level. Perhaps Colonel David Glantz will turn his considerable talents in this direction. For now, read this along with Beevor, but keep in mind that it is both dated and limited in its scope and sources."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"This tale of the struggle of Stalingrad, is a very good book. It is written very well, so that you actually feel like its a story, because people are talking about their stories, like from a good war story, which keeps you reading.The facts are very accurate and good. The data felt as accurate as it could likely get, along with current occupations of the heroes of the battle, (At the time of the book's publishing)It shows very minimal biases, with only a few extreme words here and there, but otherwise its very fair.Great book, i would recommend it for people intrested in WW2, to help understand the suffering and dissapointment of the normal soldiers, and how ruthless Hitler and Stalin were in their pursuits of war."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"If you want an excellent World War Two novel, don't pass this book up. This book includes war from both sides, German and Russian. There is no main character, but there are about 5 that you follow around and get their side of the story. I love the way that the characters can affect each other. For example, if the German commander orders an attack on a building, you then get a perspective from the Russians having to defend the building. This book is similar to Tom Clancy's &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; and the movie &quot;Stalingrad&quot;. I seriously reccomend this book for anyone who has an even small interest in World War Two. Thanks"},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"This book is about the Battle for Stalinsburg during World War II. During the five years that the author researched the battle, he interviewed hundreds of people concerning it. This provided an accurate and detailed look at the battle. The book is about the battle for Stalinsburg, with information on how the Germans advanced and attacked the city, how the Russian forces retaliated and fought. It contains some primary documents and dialouge that occured in the battles. The book catpures the horrors and thrills of battle, for both sides. If you are looking for a movie novelization however, you may be disappointed to find that the entire movie that was based on the book was really based on the events in about five pages. Other than that,Enemy at the Gates is an exciting read and one that I wouldn't pass up."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"William Craig's &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; recounts the battle of Stalingrad, the turning point of WWII.

Not for the feint of heart."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"WARNING: This book does NOT focus on the characters in the movie. They mention little about Zaitsev, which was a little dissapointing. It focuses on the ENTIRE battle of Stalingrad. I don't know why they call it the &quot;Movie-Tie-In&quot; just because it's the same title. If you're looking for screenplay novel I suggest War Of Rats. If you want to know more about the battle then this book is the best!"},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"A collection of stories about different characters in this battle from interviews and research. I found it very annoying that the author obviously knows nothing about weapons, as he would refer to a &quot;.88mm&quot; gun and similar blunders. That's a darn small projectile. The book really jumps around a lot between characters. The film was even more of a disappointment."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"This book has a terrific story to tell, but I found it deficient in ways. There are no footnotes, and chapter notes merely cite a volume--so if one wanted to check the accuracy of what the book says one would have to check the entire cited source, rather than a page in the source! The author did a lot of interviewing, so the book is full of &quot;war stories,&quot; some of which seem exaggerated. The book is clearly written for the non-scholar and while I like &quot;popular&quot; history (Richard Hough's Admirals in Collision was the best book I read in 1971) I thought this book too &quot;popular&quot; and a more scholarly study would have been more worthwhile reading."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"I came to this book after reading the great books on Stalingrad by Beevor and Walsh, and after actually visiting Stalingrad/Volgograd. The Beevor book does a much better job of personalizing the war than this book, and puts those stories in historical/milttary context.In comparison, as the reviwer Igor Biryukov mentioned, this is book is _primarily_ from the German point of view. It is so much from the point of view of the Germans, that German atrocities are almost protrayed as exceptions, and not the rule of those \\"oh-so-human invaders\\". Simply protraying outrageous incidents from both sides does not make this some objective insight into the nature of what happened in Stalingrad.This books suffers from a Cold War mentality in indeed protraying the Russians as indeed \\"card board\\" figures and in many ways elevating the German invaders. We get details about the German generals yet almost nothing about Chuikov whose brilliance saved the city. In protraying the stories, the author draws a moral equilavence between the Russians and Germans, and quite frankly white washes the millions those oh-so-human German soldiers starved to death, executed, and butchered, or sent to death camps. The author seemed to have lost the point that the Germans INVADED Russia to conduct a genocidial war and remove Russians from their lands. Beevor's has a story about those \\"normal invading Germans\\" that Craig so sympathetically protrays as telling each other that they wanted to come back after the conquest and set up their own farms along the Volga River--such are the attitudes of the \\"normal\\" German soldier that are never revealed in this book. Or that the Germans invented carpet bombing and used it on the civilian population of the city without compunction and mercy, and it was \\"normal Germans\\" flying those planes.Let me say this: the books should and must be read, but also rejected for it's subtle and not so subtle pro-Axis slant. It is well written, flows well, and spins a good yarn. For this reason it is very beguiling. The reader would do well to imagine such a book and its style applied to concentration camp guards. Would we be as sympathetic? Or let the reader imagine if those stories were about troops who invaded America and killed millions upon millions of soldiers and civilians--I think the reader will then realize the slant. Yes, let's have the truth and whitewash nothing, but also realize the context of how and why the war started, and what the invaders did. This book fails in this way.If you want an uncompromising personal tales that look at both Russians and Germans in the context of the war (and for the Russians in the context of a brutal/murderous regime under Stalin), better to read the Beevor book. With the Beevors book you get everyting this booked probably wanted to be, plus historical and military context."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"this is a robust account, overflowing with ribald tales of soldier yarn. nobody can doubt the russian resolve but mr. craig would credit german failure more than russian success. the red generals turned hitler's men into confused moth's, flittering aimlessly while the beloved 6th crumbled. for some odd reason, mr. craig treats the ruskies with a vile contempt, allowing their triumph to be a mild coincidence. he portrays them as peasants, ignorant and illiterate. meanwhile, the germans more often are celebrated as gifted physicians, professors, etc., off to war misled by a maniac nesting in his alps aerie. on the plus, i enjoyed his descriptions of the frozen volga, teeming with chunks of ice. the desolation in the bombed out streets of the city. the vulgarities of this battle are clear. in all, this pile of words is deemed readable and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"I have read Enemy at the Gates now two times. It is a good book but I'm not so sure about it being true. Battles, people, happenings are real but some of the stories sounded a bit exaggerated. For example you can only wonder how Russians ever came so near of collapse during autumn 1942 when you read about heroic actions of Soviet soldiers. This book was written during early 1970s so any information author received from Soviet Union must have been tightly censored.If you want to read entertaining book about one of the most famous battles of (military) history, go ahead and read this but I would recommend Anthony Beevor's Stalingrand for those who are interested about more historical facts."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"This is easily the best WWII book Ive read. It explains the battle for stalingrad with great detail and it is non-bias.Craig has the ability to 'write' which most historians in this genre dont.

If you want to be educated AND enthralled, read David Robbins' WAR OF THE RATS instead. Honestly, if I were David I'd have to be scratching my head over why a studio passed him over for an out-of-print book."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Enemy at the gates is a good book to read if you are a World War II scholar wishing to learn the full, in-depth extent of the battle of Stalingrad. To many others it will prove a challenging book to read. At times it is confusing and even the best reader's can only hope to drag themselves along the ragged plotline without any notes. Tieing in to the movie is not right - only about three pages of the book are even slightly similar to the movie. I was also disgusted to find that less than a half of the book was devoted to what I feel was the battle of Stalingrad, while the rest petered into the rather mundane account of the battle on the steppe both before and after the fact. I would only recommend this book to the worst of my enemies hoping that the drool from their bored eyeballs will damage the book and force them to pay for damages. Good day to you, you boring old scholar, William Craig. Logan 14"},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"This is a book to read if you want to get a sense of the scope, intensity and human drama of the incredible battle between German and Russian armies on the banks of Volga. It was one of the most important battles of the WWII (if not the most important). It demonstrated the incredible heroism of both the Germans and the Russians. It also showed that Hitler made a mistake of underestimating ability of Stalin to regain control and learn from mistakes of disastrous summer of 1941 and determination of Russians to fight for each building in Stalingrad.Written by the American author, the book for the most part describes events from the German point of view. I am Russian and admittedly it is not easy to stay totally objective about an account with slight pro-Axis slant, but I am interested in Stalingrad battle and have read some other books on the subject. I also been to Stalingrad (now city of Volgograd) myself, and my main criticism is this: Mr. Craig, despite the fact that he spent five years researching for this book, unfortunately didn't quite familiarize himself with some aspects of Russian life and culture. I don't know, may be he didn't have an opportunity...But that would have made his book more balanced and more readable for the Russian audience.For example, \\"Kazakhs\\" on page 321 aren't \\"Kazakhs\\" but Cossacks. There were no \\"Kazakhs\\" living on river Don, only Cossacks. Kazakhs live in Kazakhstan. These are two different peoples. \\"Kaytusha\\" throughout the text of the book is misspelled; it is really \\"Katjusha\\" - a Russian rocket launcher. I was surprised that it was misspelled, since it was not only famous Russian weapon of war, but also a woman's name, derivative of Katja (Russian for Katie). It would be equivalent for a Russian author to call German tank \\"Mark\\" as \\"Mrak\\".Another example - on page 283 Mr. Craig assumes that December 24th was a Christmas Eve for both Germans and Russians. Close, but no cigar...The Christmas in Russia is celebrated due to Christian Orthodox tradition on January 7th, hence the Christmas Eve is January 6th. But during Communist times it was prohibited anyway.Perhaps as a result of the author's lack of firm grasp of Russia's cultural context, the Russians in a book depicted a little bit like caricatures (despite the author's effort to do otherwise). Germans are more believable, better developed and likeable. To summarize, despite the fact that I thought the book was good, I have encountered many errors about the Russians that it made the book less enjoyable to read and sometimes even a little annoying. Otherwise the book is well written. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in history of WWII, military history, and German or Russian history."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"As a by-product of the Cold War, the subject of the Second World War as fought in Russia has been largely ignored, but the Battle of Stalingrad was so decisive, and so horrendous, that even general histories of the war cannot ignore it. The battle was fought out from August, 1942, until the surrender of the German 6th Army on January 31, 1943. Much of the fighting took place in the ruins of the city, which came to be known as, &quot;Verdun on the Volga,&quot; among the German troops, and as, &quot;the mass grave of the Wehrmacht,&quot; to the Soviet press. Today, the city of Stalingrad (subsequently re-named Volgograd after Stalin's official reduction in status in the Soviet pantheon), is rightly a shrine to Russian sacrifice, heroism and tenacity as well as a memorial to the thousands of soldiers and civilians who died there.William Craig's account of the battle is one of the better, more readable histories of the epic of Stalingrad. Craig masterfully weaves eyewitness accounts to put a human face on a campaign and battle of such immense scope and horror that many other writers have failed to adequately compass the subject. This book treats the decisive battle of the Second World War in Europe with the dispassion necessary to form a solid appraisal of where the errors were made by the rival commanders. In this sense, Craig avoids the pat answer of blaming Adolf Hitler entirely for the catastrophic loss of the 6th Army after it was encircled but could still break out. Craig is one of the few authors who deals candidly and fairly with the plight of the Rumanian and Italian armies shattered in the encirclement battle._Enemy at the Gates_ personalizes the battle with a montage of memories from the participants. Craig's effort is compelling, readable and very effective. Read in conjunction with such works as, _Last Letters from Stalingrad_, and Heinz Schroter's, _Stalingrad_, Craig's work fills out the gap in the historical lexicon of the Second World War."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"&quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; is out of print, but it shouldn't be a problem to locate a copy at a library. It is worth the trouble! This was the first book to put a human face on the Battle of Stalingrad. Because the account was compiled from interviews and memoirs of participants, the book often reads like an exciting novel. In this respect, it closely resembles Andrew Tully's or Cornelius Ryan's accounts of the Battle of Berlin. When I learned of the upcoming film &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot;, I was ecstatic to think that this excellent book would at long last come to the big screen! Alas, only the title is taken from &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; -- the screenplay is based on David Robbins' novel &quot;War of the Rats&quot;. The movie's focus will be on the historically dubious sniper battle and the hysterically bogus romantic interest. What a pity. For the real flavor of Stalingrad, get the real &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; and Antony Beevor's &quot;Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege&quot;."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"While most Americans tend to think of WWII mostly in terms of our losses, the Russians lost millions of citizens, both military and civilian, in the war. The Battle of Stalingrad was pivotal in the war; it turned the tide against the Germans and forced them to eventually fight a two-front war that they could not win. Had Stalingrad folded, the war might very well have ended with Hitler on the winning side.This book reads like &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (Cornelius Ryan) of the Stalingrad battle, with first person accounts from both the German and Russian sides sewn together into an excellent narrative that holds your attention.One of the stories in this book has been turned into the current (2001) movie of the same title. It concerns the battle between a Russian sniper who starts a sniper school in Stalingrad; his students go on to exact a huge toll on the Germans. In response, the Germans fly in their own master sniper to &quot;take out&quot; the Russian. The two snipers stalk each other among the ruins of the city, with the loser to make the ultimate sacrifice for his country. The book, however, covers much more ground. If you've seen the movie and want more on the sniper duel, read &quot;War of the Rats&quot; by David Robbins, a fictionalized account of the real-life events that is riveting. Read &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; if you want the full view of the battle. I recommend both accounts as superb books worthy of your time and money."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"It seems like every book I read on warfare makes me realize one central theme: Thousands upon thousands of soldier's lives are sacrificed by overzealous military leaders like Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin...case in point: The battle of Stalingrad. I thoroughly enjoyed Craig's book on this famous, yet rarely covered battle of WWII. Most Westerners and the world for that matter, are fed large doses of reading related to D-Day, Pearl Harbor, etc. etc. Significant, history altering battles like Stalingrad are rarely given much light..I considered myself a learned scholar of WWII until I read this book...I then realized I really didnt have the &quot;complete&quot; picture of WWII like I thought...What I really like about the book was the reader gets to see both sides of the war from the Red Army and Germans perspectives. In the beginning of the book, we relate to the Soviet's tales of horror as the invading German soldiers plunder and pillage their motherland...however, as the tide of the battle turns, we read how the Germans become the victims of the enclosing Soviet armies. I really liked how Craig got deep into the doomed German soldier's mind-set as they came closer and closer to annhialation. The reader really starts to see the German soldier as just another human being like you and I....a farmer from Dresden, a school teacher from Cologne, a mechanic from Stutgart...the list goes on...we really see the German soldiers for what they were, decent men just following orders. Dont get me wrong, there were plenty of Germans who committed such terrible atocities that they do not deserve to be called human beings. On, the flip-side, we see that many of the Soviet soliders themselves were no less brutal than their German counterparts...shooting surrendering soldiers, marching them to death camps, torture etc. etc...in short, we learn that war brings out the worst in man: German, Soviet or otherwise...I did catch one reoccuring theme in this book, similar to what I have seen in other great WWII books (see books by Ambrose): Adolph Hitler was a terrible military leader who killed thousands of his soldiers because his ego did not let him think rationally...Hitler's famous fallacy of forcing his policy of not giving up an inch of conquered land cost the lives of thousands of German soldiers not only in Russia, but France during D-Day. Therefore, Hitler not only was a racist lunatic, but also a piece of crap military tactician. Stalin was no less, as he ordered thousands of his men to suicidal charges against the German army and even resorted to killing thousands of his own men out of paranoia.All in all, Enemy at the Gates is a must read for anyone wanting to get the complete picture of WWII. Stalingrad was truly the battle that turned the tide of WWII. From there on, Germany fought a downhill battle...The movie was excellent (a little Hollywooded out of course), but portrayed the horror of the war through both a German and Soviet Sniper...go see it and read the book!!!!"},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"For most people in the West, the War between German and Russia 1941-45 is the &quot;Unknown War&quot;. Thanks to movies like &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, and many others, the impression is gained that the United States and Britain carried the bulk of the war against Nazi Germany, but the fact is that 3/4 of the entire strength of the German Wehrmacht was destroyed by the USSR's Red Army. Although many fine books have been written in the US and Britain about this war, most of them have been written more for people who already have a strong background in WWII, but this book makes the story of battle marking the turning point of the war, Stalingrad, accessible to the general public. The book is written in a form that was made popular in the 1960's and 1970's bringing vignettes both from the political and military leaders as well as the experiences of ordinary people caught up in the maelstrom. Famous encounters in the engagement such as the &quot;Battle of the Grain Elevator&quot; or &quot;Pavlov's House&quot; are described, bringing the horror of the &quot;rattenkrieg&quot; (rat's war) in the ruins of the city to the reader. Craig points out how the indescriminate bombing of the city as a prelude to the German attack which killed tens of thousands of civilians including the deliberate strafing of columns of civilians tryingto flee to the east bank of the Volga river ended up backfiringon the Germans, enabling the Soviet defenders to turn the rubble into improvised fortresses forcing the Germany's vaunted Sixth Army into fighting house-to-house, cellar to cellar, street to street, and sometimes room to room, something they were unused to, coming from successful blitzkrieg, mobile warfare, campaigns. He also points out that in spite of the fact that the German army was famous for discipline, when the German pocket (the &quot;kessel&quot;) was in danger of falling to the Soviets, many soldiers made self-inflicted wounds in order to be flown out or they would defy orders and storm the waiting aircraft, even though they had not been given permissionto be evacuated..A couple of items should be mentioned as corrections to the book, however. First of all, Craig calls Sixth Army commanderFriedrich von Paulus, but Paulus came from a family that was not part of the Prussian Military aristocracy, so &quot;von&quot; was not part of his name.Secondly, this book was written in the early 1970's, before the fall of the Communist regime. Antony Beevor has written another popular-style book about Stalingrad based on research done since then and he brings new facts to light. Among them is his skepticism about the famous duel that was believed to occur between Soviet master sniper Vassily Zaitsev and the German Konings. Although this story was circulated for many years and Craig recounts in this book, Beevor says there is reason to doubt whether it really occurred (this story forms the backdrop of the movie with the same title of this book, which is not really based on the book, unfortunately).In summary, I strongly recommend this book, in addition to Beevor's to really get a feeling for the titanic, inhuman struggle that was the Russo-German front in the Second World War."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Agree, be aware that this book is not a novelization of the movie. It is a powerfully written narrative of the battle for Stalingrad as experienced by combatant and noncombatants for both sides. I thought it to be superior to most historical &quot;military&quot; writing in general: this is a book to be read not for orders of battle and eye glazing sentences of roman numeral lists of panzer divisions but for a dramatic, immersive, account of a German Army entering a prostrate town expecting a rapid collapse and finding to its surprise die-hard Russian soldiers who were not quite ready to surrender. I read this book twenty years ago when I was fifteen and regretted losing my copy years ago. I am glad the book is back. P.S. the sniper duel is a part of the story but only a part..."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"I have not tried any books on military or history before. I picked this one during one of my routine flights just to pass the time, and I should accept that this book was so compelling and narrative that I finished the book in a matter of 4 days (fastest by my reading standards) and I am buying more books about World War I & II. History is interesting you see!More than history, William Craig has done an excellent job of narrating the pain and terrible costs of war through the best possible source: the people who fought the war. And this is one book that is unbiased in its text.As a reader, you can visualize every event unfolding in the battle field, like:1. The plight of the Russian soldiers & volunteers who painfully protected the arms factory and the grain silo in Stalingrad2. The German Stuka divers who mercilessly sprayed bullets and bombs on the civilians and injured soldiers alike on the banks of the Volga river trying to get out of the fully destroyed Stalingrad city3. The tremendously pressurizing situation in which the Sixth army leader, Von Paulus was in when many of his units were loosing to the Russian Red Army and Hitler rudely declined to consider the Russian demand for surrender of the Sixth Army. A classic example of what continous victory can do to even the best of leaders: ego and arrogance that can literally close your eyes. Ofcourse Hitler was not the best of leaders, though.4. The atrocities commited by German and Russian soldiers, for example, the two German soldiers who tore a Russian baby into two infront of her mother. I can understand that such atrocity finding place in a review would create a ghastly impression about the book, but lets accept the fact: War and war crime are brutally, utterly inhuman, doesn't matter who does that. Thats the same impression I got about war and war crimes after going through this book. This particular narration affected me so much that I am yet to come out of it.There are many events like this, and the author does a wonderful job of painting the exact image of the battlefield in your mind. I literally felt that I was very much part of the battle for Stalingrad from start till the murderous and terrible end. Again, you feel the pain of tragic loss of human lives, that too, at such big numbers when you read those last lines of the book. They tell you that the Sixth army, dangerously professional and of a size of 250000 soldiers was reduced to a mere 5000 when they landed back in Germany!You must read the book to see for yourself what I am trying to say. Its impressive text can be experienced only by reading it. If you are interested in WWII, this is the book that you should have in your collection."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"This is the first book I've read on the battle for Stalingrad proper. It's great reading, and I could hardly put it down. As they say, Craig knew how to spin a good yarn. True, he had excellent material to write a great story, but it's one of his merits that he collected much of this material himself, through interviews with many participants of the battle.That said, some flaws of the book bothered me even while I was enjoying the narrative:1) Craig often adds the \\"von\\" particle to the name of the German commander Friedrich Paulus. This mistake is more serious than it seems, as it may give the reader the impression that Paulus was of noble origin and, therefore, in all likelihood, the heir to a long family tradition of military service. This is not the case: Paulus was of relatively humble origins, and this may arguably be an important element to understand the man and his behavior both during the battle and in the years that followed.2) I was surprised to read about the \\"Kazakh\\" villagers at the Don that had expelled their Russian liberators and were all murdered in retaliation. One reviewer clarified that it was actually a Cossack village, which makes more sense. Again, an apparently minor mistake may lead to very wrong conclusions which affect our whole view of the war in Russia. Cossacks were opposed to the Bolshevik regime from the start, and suffered a lot under Soviet rule.3) To some extent, Craig fails to convey to the reader the moral dimension of the battle. Sometimes, it seems we are reading the account of a duel between two opponents with an equally valid claim to the stakes. Craig does tell some harrowing stories, most notably that of a baby torn apart by two German soldiers just for the fun of it. He also tells episodes of cruelty by the Red Army (and the NKVD). However, one of the main aspects of this war that made it different from all other wars was the SYSTEMATIC perpetration of atrocities - in an unprecedented scale - in the wake of Wehrmacht victories everywhere. By failing to present this context (or, perhaps, by assuming readers have it in mind), Craig makes it difficult for us to understand the harsh treatment Russians dispensed on German prisoners after victory, and makes it look like sheer, gratuitous cruelty. Without condoning the Russian attitude, Craig could have told us more about the reasons that led to it. Among these, the horrendous treatment of Soviet POWs, over one million of which died under captivity in the winter of 1941-42. Not surprisingly, a common motto in Russia at the time was \\"Comrade, kill your German.\\"4) As a consequence of the above - and this, paradoxically, is also a tribute to Craig's narrative skills - the reader could easily catch himself rooting for the Germans, especially in the second part of the book, which focuses on the plight of the Sixth Army under encirclement. One reader mentioned that Germans in the book are usually much more lifelike than Russians. I had the same impression. I think I'm much more familiar with Paulus and other German commanders and soldiers than with many Russians that are mentioned but that we never really get to know in depth. In fairness, let us admit it must have been much easier for Craig, in the late 1960's and early 1970's, to interview German veterans in West Germany than Soviet ones in Brezhnev's USSR (some of these accounts were obtained in Israel and elsewhere). And he certainly had much easier access to German documents and letters than to Russian ones.Why, then, four stars? Because, as I said above, the book is a great read. Also, Craig's account of the battle seems to be fairly accurate, within the limitations of the time when it was written, and in spite of the slant toward the German side. (This must not be confused with sympathy for the Nazis. Craig has none.) I thought I learned a lot in the chapters describing Stalin and Hitler making decisions on the conduct of the battle. One can easily understand why so many German officers and soldiers became disillusioned with the F&uuml;hrer after Stalingrad. No wonder so many high ranking veterans of the Russian campaign eventually got involved in the \\"officer's plot\\" to murder Hitler on July 20, 1944. A little episode Craig tells makes a lot of sense to the reader at this point. In the last weeks of the battle, a group of German soldiers were listening to a radio broadcast from Germany. They were weeping at the sound of the national anthem, \\"Deutschland &uuml;ber alles\\" (music by Haydn, remember). But then, when the \\"Horst Wessel Lied\\" (song of the Nazi Party) followed, someone smashed the radio to pieces. No one protested.As the example shows, Craig has an eye for the telling detail, and many of the episodes in the book really move you, make you think and give you a most revelatory picture of the mind of men (and women) in extreme circumstances. The description of cannibalism among Italian prisoners of war, the sense of duty of the German doctor (who would pay dearly for his decision to return to his men in the battlefield even though he had a chance to stay away), the feelings of comradeship, the Russian nurse who lost all her limbs: these are some of the episodes I think I will not forget. As I will never forget the story of Mikhail Goldstein's violin playing on New Year's eve. I won't spoil your pleasure here, but this very moving episode alone was, for me, worth the price of the book many times over!"},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"This is not a lame novel based upon a movie. This is a well-deserved re-issue of an account of the Battle of Stalingrad written almost thirty years ago. It rivals Ryan's &quot;The Longest Day&quot; as one of the great historical accounts of World War II. &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; not only tells the &quot;big picture,&quot; of fighting and death on a scale that Americans really cannot imagine. It also makes the horrible fighting more immediate with descriptions from Soviet and German soldiers, as well as civilians. (The movie is based upon a series of these accounts.) While more recent books on the subject have the benefit of some recently declassified Soviet materials, William Craig was able to benefit from more first person accounts. Readers who appreciate the works of Stephen Ambrose will find a real gem in William Craig's work. Since this book did not involve the British and Americans, it was overlooked in the mid-1990's World War II nostalgia. This book is finally on the shelves again, and it certainly deserves to be there."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"I loved the 2001 movie, &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; so much that I wanted to learn more about the true life characters in the book. This 1973 book of the same name DOES have more details, (and surprising details), of the film's main characters, but the film's main characters only take up about 6 pages, sprinkled throughout this 400+ page book.Actually, the film's female lead character, Tania Chernova, was interviewed in person by the author, William Craig, some 30 years ago. I was quite surprised that the true life Tania was actually MORE action-oriented than the film version! So the film made her into a more passive, conventional movie heroine, rather than the sniper killer that she actually was.Aside from movie comparisons, this was a gripping book that I couldn't stop reading. The first half focuses on the actual battle in the city of Stalingrad, which captures the feel of the movie. The second half of the book focuses on how the German army got defeated, when the battle shifted outside of the actual city, in the snow covered, open fields and plains, focusing on the German inner politics that would eventually lead to the defeat of the German army. Most of the second half of this book is not shown in the movie at all.Overall, I was surprised that some of the more unbelievable, yet dramatic moments from the film were actually true, while even more &quot;extreme&quot; details of the real life people were not used at all. I am glad that I read this book, which is definitely one of the most famous accounts of the battle for Stalingrad, but the book is definitely NOT for folks who are mainly interested about what happens in the movie version only."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Enemy at the gates covers the battle of Stalingrad perfectly. It focus's on main Russian, Italian, and German Genearls along with some Sergeants, Lieutenants, ect. It begins with the Russian retreat past Stalingrad to the Germans entering the town under fierce resistance. The Russians, with luck and good planning from Stalin and the high ranks, gradually begin to force the Germans back and begin to surround the Germans. Hitler won't pull back,and soon the Germans are surrounded. In no time, the German fighters (Italians, Germans, Hungarians), are caught and put in prison camps. This is an interesting part of the book. The Italians start to eat dead people. Overall the book was okay but i wouldnt buy it. You might read it twice. But save your money for something else. The book was good, but it dragged on in my opinon."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Craig accomplished something very important in this account of the Battle for Stalingrad. He tells the story in a way that acurately reflects the heart and soul of the battle while simultaneously producing a book that is as enjoyable and engaging as a novel. By collecting most of his material from actual interviews with the survivors of the war, Craig presents a highly personal account of an unbelievably tragic yet heroic piece of human history. This account is highly accurate historically (except for the few vocabulary errors pointed out in other reviews) and reveals the enormity of the Battle for Stalingrad and WWII as a whole. The clash between Hitler and Stalin is unmatched in human history and the amount of disregard for human life during that time is hard to understand. Even if it is hard to imagine something like this happening in more modern times, it is good for people to remember stories such as this one and not to forget the lessons of the past. Books like this make learning history enjoyable and give us human names and emotions to make the story real in our hearts."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Beginning of the end for the vaunted German Wehrmacht.The failure of the German army to capture Stalingrad and the resurgence of the Russian army signaled the beginning of the end for the vaunted German Wehrmacht and Hitler's quest for world domination. It simply was a city too far--to borrow and paraphrase Cornelius Ryan. The German soldiers and army field leadership were magnificent, but the meddlesome incompetence of Hitler and his sycophantic General Staff coupled with a reborn and resurgent Russian army spelled doom to the overextended Wehrmacht on the deadly Eastern Front.Enemy at the Gates is a very good general overview of the battle but shines with all its personal accounts of soldiers on both sides. It was a ferocious battle to the death as the powerful German 6th Army fought its way into Stalingrad and to the banks of the Volga only to become entrapped and eventually entombed there. In all, German General Officer field leadership was adequate but hamstrung by Hitler's \\"hold to the last man, last bullet\\" lunacy. The 250,000 man army could have been evacuated and saved to fight another day but was essentially thrown away by Hitler's failed \\"Festung\\" strategy. Both Paulus and Manstein realized early on the dire straits of the 6th Army but could not convince Hitler to withdraw the Army in the face of rapidly growing insurmountable odds. Coupled with German obsessive devotion to following orders no matter how ridiculous or incompetent, the 6th Army was basically thrown away through sheer madness on an epic scale. The sad epitaph of Stalingrad in retrospect is it was the high water mark of the German Army on the Eastern Front and signaled the beginning of the end for the vaunted German Wehrmacht.I liked this history of Stalingrad because it was so readable and concentrated on the individual exploits of the common soldier. Others write with more detail to tactics, strategy and numbers but Craig writes about the soldier's indomitable heart. His grievous tribulation, intense fear, and daily sorrow he faced. It was an unfathomable battle of untold misery and hardships that William Craig masterfully told. Still, the common grunts persevered believing in their leaders and the Fatherland. Like all wars, the basic frontline soldier is the foundation upon which strategy and tactics are built. The Generals can move pins around the map but it's the grunt who gives his blood. At Stalingrad the common German soldiers were heroic in their fealty to their country and their cause, it was the flawed leadership that sealed their terrible fate. The Wehrmacht Generals knew early on that at Stalingrad victory was in doubt at best and a total failure at worse, but blind obedience and acquiescence to the Fuhrer sealed their failure: And the common soldier paid with their blood and lives. The final German surrender by Paulus on 31 January 1943, came not a defiant bang but a mewling whimper as the once proud German 6th Army simply melted away into captivity.Strong recommend. Excellent general history of Stalingrad concentrating on the common soldier. Although dated, still very timely as many of those who fought at Stalingrad were still alive when Craig wrote this fine history. 24 pages of B&W; photographs of the battle and major players. A must read for anyone interested in the Eastern Front during WW2.*NOTE: Disclaimer, Although the title was used for a wonderful movie along with maybe 6 historical pages, this is NOT a sniper story but a general history of the Russo-German battle at Stalingrad during WW2."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Vignette prose style leads to confusion among a large group of participants.

The ruthlessness and inhumanity of war is nakedly exposed. Corpses abound - towards the end rotting bodies are stacked up in makeshift German hospitals.Stalingrad is what can happen to invaders. Although one feels sympathy for the Germans in reading their letters home to their wives and parents - there is no introspection in these letters of the reasons of why they were so far from their homeland. When one seeks to destroy a city (and in the case of Russia this amounted to many cities) there will eventually be a terrible price to pay.In the \\"World at War\\" documentary episode on Stalingrad a Russian comments: \\"These German soldiers are a funny lot with their shiny black boots attacking Stalingrad - did they think they were on a joy-ride?\\"This book should be viewed as manifesting the ultimate evil and destructiveness of war - millions paid a horrible price."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"It is hard to put into words this tremendous epic of a book. Beginning with the German 6th Army's confident march towards Hitler's \\"prize\\", Stalingrad, the book carefully and descriptively moves through stages the battle from both German and Russian accounts, drawing in the reader from one heart-stopping moment to the next. William Craig does a masterful job of describing the deteriorating situation in the city, the countless lives lost, and the tragedy that occurs during the capitulation and capture of the German 6th Army and its Italian and Romanian allies. All armies involved in the battle suffered immeasurably for what they believed in, and the human cost and brutality described during the battle and its aftermath is breathtaking. Craig also did an unbelievable job of gathering first hand accounts from the survivors to put the reader directly on the front lines. To learn the whole truth about this tragedy of WWII history I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"To begin, let us warn the folks who wish to read more about the movie's protagonist. You may be disappointed because unless you read the movie-tie-in (I read the original 1973 version) the book actually deals with very little of Vassili. Though what happens in the movie and the book is not 100% accurate, it is closer than most historical movies are. The book is an excellent blend of military tactics and operations, and personal narratives. The use of personal diaries is probably this books greatest strength and the wide range of narratives from German, Italian, Hungarian, and Russian soldiers, support staff, commanders and civilians and to the realism of the book. Two types of readers would find this book both useful and enjoyable. First the historian, whether academic or amateur, will find this book an excellent source of information on various topics. Second, the casual read will find the book easy to ready with more information about the people than the military logistics, which can quite overwhelming and boring. After reading this book one can begin to understand why the Russian wanted to reach Berlin first."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"One of the most history enjoyable books I have read. Gripping scenes could be assembled into an interesting movie of the battle. I always wondered why Hollywood has ignored all the great stories that came out of the German invasion of Russia."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Sacrifices have been made to reach one goal.....the retake of Stalingrad. The battle that changed the tide of the war. The heart of one man changed the tide of the battle and led the people of the Soviet Union to their freedom. It's a very \\"triumphant\\", as NY Times calls it, war book that should be read by most young adults, mostly adults. This book is about a sniper named Vassili, one of the most talented sniper in Russian history. His popularity kept the Russian troops and the people with hope. His sniper rifle is in a museum in Moscow to prove how great he was and to honor him. William Craig uses so much detail as if he was there. He uses so much information that he not only talks about Vassili, but he a also talks about everything around him. He explains each division on both sides, saying were they are attacking and defending and information like that.The book gave so much information that I thought it was going to turn out dull. I liked how in different sections, he put real pictures and explains each one. The organization of this book was very good. He put a index at the end to organize the book."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"SHORT REVIEW BLURB: I enjoyed this great recounting of The Battle for Stalingrad, but in many places it reads like an elementary school history book rather than an entertaining novel. That being said, I enjoyed reading the novel and would recommend it to others. I gave it four stars rather than five because of the many places it dragged due to superfluous detail or rote recitation of detail.ABOUT THE CONTENT: I enjoy reading about W.W.II when I get the chance, but I mostly review books about the Arab-Israeli Wars. This book, however, has a very interesting tie-in: many of Israel's soldiers were SURVIVORS of Stalingrad (On the Soviet side, of course!). William Craig didn't ignore the Jewish tie-in to The Battle of Stalingrad. His research includes interviews of several Israelis who were soldiers, Russian or Polish nationals, and survivors of Stalingrad. Among them were: Ignacy Changar, Mikhail Goldstein, and Hersch Gurewicz.The book in most places flows very well. Craig accomplishes this by interspersing personal accounts from the war from the hundreds of interviews that he performed over five plus years in several countries including Russia, Germany, and Israel. Hearing the personal accounts of an Italian doctor on march as a prisoner of the Red Army really gives the book some human interest. Reading of how this same doctor would regale his fellow prisoners with stories about delicious meals in Italy, while the prisoners were surviving on a few frozen cabbages and hunks of bread (not enough to sustain human life and well below minimum caloric needs) was very colorful. Craig also didn't ignore some of the more gruesome aspects of captivity under the Red Army: cannibalism. Many of the Italians and other prisoners of the Red Army during W.W.II were treated so poorly and were so desperately hungry that they resorted to cannibalism. Pretty gruesome, but very entertaining. Very few soldiers left the Red Army camps. Of the estimated 90,000 Axis troops (Italian, Hungarian, German, etc.) who eventually surrendered and went into captivity less than 5,000 of them were able to return to see their countries and families again (and the great majority of them, only after twelve years in tortuous captivity as described above). In this respect, the novel reminded me of \\"One Day in the life of Ivan Denisovitch\\" or the \\"Archipelago Gulag\\" books by Alexander Solzhenitsyn.The military history was commendable and presented details such as the significance of the battle, the major personalities and the battlefield butchery that have made this battle a thing of legend. However, Orders of Battles (OOB) or TO&E; (Tables of Organization and Equipment) are not included in the novel. While this may be a disappointment to many wargamers, the colorful accounts of many battles would be very inspirational to scenario writers. One of the most interesting tributes to this book is that it spawned an entire game that is well known to W.W.II gamers: ASL (Advanced Squad Leader).BEST THING ABOUT THE NOVEL: The author's many interviews with actual survivors and the use of those same survivor's personal diaries is without a doubt this book's greatest strength. The wide range of narratives from German, Italian, Hungarian, and Russian soldiers, support staff, commanders, and civilians gives this book its' considerable realism and entertaining strength. Even better, William Craig didn't leave the story unfinished; he wrote a short epilogue that tells about many of the characters as they survived the war as of 1973 (when the book was first published). For the film's fans, it was interesting that Tanya Chernova (the femme fatale) didn't end up marrying Zaitsev (the protagonist) after the war. She thought that Zaitsev had died and didn't learn until 1969 that he had both survived the war and married someone else. It's really hard not to like a novel that has such facts!ABOUT THE TIE-IN TO THE MOVIE: My edition of the book was the movie tie-in version and I view those words with dubiousness since the film's main characters occupy about 6 pages of this 455-page book. The movie focused on the micro drama of two snipers battling, but the book focuses on the ENTIRE conflict from the moment German troops entered Soviet soil until the defeat of German General Paulus at Stalingrad. Many believe that \\"Enemy at the Gates,\\" the movie, is more closely based on the fictional novel \\"The War of the Rats\\" (which in turn uses this book for a lot of its information). I agree with this conclusion. Another reviewer wrote:\\"If you want to be educated, read Craig's book. If you want to be educated AND enthralled, read David Robbins' WAR OF THE RATS instead.\\"I like the spirit of his words, but disagree with the idea that \\"War of the Rats\\" by David Robbins is educational and entertaining. While very entertaining and educational in that it uses William Craig's book as a source, the book would include a caption \\"based on fact\\" if it were made into a movie today (curiously enough like the film \\"Enemy at the Gates\\"). Robbins is a better writer in that his prose is much more entertaining, but his research wouldn't light a candle to that of William Craig. I would recommend reading both novels: \\"Enemy at the Gates\\" by William Craig for the facts and \\"War of the Rats\\" by David Robbins for entertainment.SUGGESTIONS: I would also suggest seeing the movie \\"Stalingrad\\" directed by Joseph Vilsmaier. This German-produced film follows the story of \\"Enemy at the Gates: Movie Tie-In\\" much better. The film does a better job of showing the horrific face of the battle than \\"Enemy at the Gates.\\"I also recommend the film \\"Europa Europa\\" for an account of Solomon Perel, a Jewish-German boy who manages to conceal his identity from the Nazis and ends up a member of their Youth Party as well as a soldier in the W.W.II German army. The movie is based on Solomon Perel's autobiography, also a good read.REVIEW BY: Maximillian Ben Hanan"},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"I have not tried any books on military or history before. I picked this one during one of my routine flights just to pass the time, and I should accept that this book was so compelling and narrative that I finished the book in a matter of 4 days (fastest by my reading standards) and I am buying more books about World War I & II. History is interesting you see!More than history, William Craig has done an excellent job of narrating the pain and terrible costs of war through the best possible source: the people who fought the war. And this is one book that is unbiased in its text.As a reader, you can visualize every event unfolding in the battle field, like:1. The plight of the Russian soldiers & volunteers who painfully protected the arms factory and the grain silo in Stalingrad2. The German Stuka divers who mercilessly sprayed bullets and bombs on the civilians and injured soldiers alike on the banks of the Volga river trying to get out of the fully destroyed Stalingrad city3. The tremendously pressurizing situation in which the Sixth army leader, Von Paulus was in when many of his units were loosing to the Russian Red Army and Hitler rudely declined to consider the Russian demand for surrender of the Sixth Army. A classic example of what continous victory can do to even the best of leaders: ego and arrogance that can literally close your eyes. Ofcourse Hitler was not the best of leaders, though.4. The atrocities commited by German and Russian soldiers, for example, the two German soldiers who tore a Russian baby into two infront of her mother. I can understand that such atrocity finding place in a review would create a ghastly impression about the book, but lets accept the fact: War and war crime are brutally, utterly inhuman, doesn't matter who does that. Thats the same impression I got about war and war crimes after going through this book. This particular narration affected me so much that I am yet to come out of it.There are many events like this, and the author does a wonderful job of painting the exact image of the battlefield in your mind. I literally felt that I was very much part of the battle for Stalingrad from start till the murderous and terrible end. Again, you feel the pain of tragic loss of human lives, that too, at such big numbers when you read those last lines of the book. They tell you that the Sixth army, dangerously professional and of a size of 250000 soldiers was reduced to a mere 5000 when they landed back in Germany!That said, over all, its a very very good book, but with a few minor drawbacks:1. I felt the maps could have been beter and a bit more detailed. There could be an alternative reason why the feeling set into me: I was so glued to the text that I forgot to refer to the maps!!2. Too many names put in. And some names are very rarely used, probably a good 50 pages apart. I guess, there could have been some reference mechanism within the text of the book that would have helped me remember about the soldier who found mention some 30 pages back!But all this drawbacks are definitely overcome by the compelling text. You must read the book to see for yourself what I am trying to say. Its impressive text can be experienced only by reading it. If you are interested in WWII, this is the book that you should have in your collection."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"This book is different from the average history book. Here the story is told through little mini-stories with the people involved. This book is loaded with facts and requires some re-reading in certain areas to digest it all otherwise probably the most interesting of history book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Forget the moview. It was long and focused on romance. It wanted to be Titanic set in Stalingrad. Very little of this book is devoted to Vassili Zaitsev (unlike the movie). It is instead about the entire battle for Stalingrad (and the horrible famine, freezing, and loss of life). This book does what any good book on war does......make you want to avoid it if possible. Any rating less than five stars is an insult to this book."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"\\"Enemy at the Gates\\" is a page-turner, a tight combination of historical detail and strong narrative. I read most of it in a day. I agree with many of Igor Biryukovs comments (see reviews below), though I think the focus on the Germans is due more to the impending sense of doom that drives the book than actual sympathy. That doom hangs over every anecdote, over every communiqu&eacute; between Paulus and the Wolf's Lair, over every plan to break through the Russian lines. In fact, the attention shifts from the Russian side to the German as the advantage shifts during the battle. Although few people sympathize with the German cause, Craig manages to creat and sustain hope in the reader, through the individual stories, that deliverance will come. The hope persists though most readers know the outcome of the battle before it began, and that the rout and subsequent destruction of the German army and Nazi Germany are rightly celebrated events of the 20th century.I did find it difficult to keep track of individuals named throughout the book. Sometimes, a person will not be mentioned for one hundred pages, and then only for a paragraph. I spent a lot of time in the index and looking back through the book to keep track of the soldiers.My biggest complaint is about the lack of maps. The maps provided did not contain the names of many of the places mentioned in the book, nor some key troop movements. If you are not the type to refer to a map often, then you will probably not be bothered. I like to look at maps as a situation unfolds and I found my curiosity frustrated.I have not seen the movie, though I heard it concentrates on the snipers. I suggest seeing \\"Stalingrad\\" directed by Joseph Vilsmaier. It is a German movie and is as overwhelming as the book. You will be cold for hours after the credits roll."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"William Craig's classic on this herioic, oftentimes heartbreaking battle remains the definitive book on Stalingrad even today. Meticulously researched and based on many first-hand accounts gleaned from various sources, Craig masterfully captured the intensity and human drama that characterized what was undoubtedly the biggest, most destructive single conflict in recorded history. Sweeping in its scope, Craig still manages to keep the reader enthralled with a brisk writing style and &quot;you are there&quot; immediacy that rival the best contemporary suspense novels. This is a book that appeals to more than military history buffs; it is a tragic tale of valor, sacrifice, stupidity, the stubborn refusal to face reality (on Hitler's part), and human suffering. This is one of the top 25 books on my list."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"This book was an incredible book to read. Once I started I could not put it down.

I recommend this book to anyone who can read and I truly do not think it is possible to dislike this book."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Easily the best account of real life in the second world war. No bad guys, no good guys. Just soldiers. That is why i find this book so appealing. All we ever hear about and see in movies are the atrocities committed by Germans. This book graphically describes crimes on both sides. I highly recommend this book. DO NOT bother with that awful film &quot;Enemy at the gate&quot;. It has virtually nothing to do with this book and it trivializes the entire war."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"I read lots of WWII stuff and this book is one of the best. We all &quot;know&quot; that war is the epitome of man's inhumanity to man. I know of no other book that illustrates the horror and futility of war so vividly. This book should be required reading to everyone to help us never forget the unrecoverable costs of war and human misery. For those who beat their chest and view violence as the solution to those who differ from one another - take this dose of reality and work for peace. May we never bear the burden of war again."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"i just finished this book today, as the &quot;war&quot; in iraq is ongoing. this is not my first book on stalingrad, i've read several others as well, and let me tell you, this has got to be the ultimate story of human struggle and survival. to lend some more credence to my review, i should add that i served several years in the canadian army, and i know what it's like to be cold, tired and hungry.this book is less about the war, and quite simply put, more about what men will do to survive as they are exposed to a horrific environment. during my military training, i was routinely subjected to periods of 3-7 days with little sleep, less than enough food, and extremely cold conditions. i may have felt badly about this, but i knew that at the end of it all, i would be going home. the germans (i use them, because that's what this book is really about) in stalingrad suffered a thousandfold more and were never certain that they would survive (at least after things started going badly for them).the stories of cannibalism, while only a small part of the book, are very gripping. the lengths men would go to, to get on a flight home are outlined here, even something so heart-wrenching as an italian soldier in captivity being beaten by the russians for speaking out about something, and for good measure, the russians killing the puppy that had accompanied him before and during his trek into captivity. the whole thing is so sad.....a really great book. makes you want to go out and find some of these men yourself and speak to them just to get a firsthand account.one last thing i wanted to say.... battles such as stalingrad will never happen again. this was a battle of attrition that took an awesome human and material toll. this was when war was war, man against man, man against nature, man against himself. These men deserve our respect for what they faced."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Stalingard was the site for the turning point on the Eastern front. Hitler's Wehrmacht attack on Russia in 1941 was initially so successful that it might have been set on cruise control. The Nazi armies gained huge masses of territory in a very short time, while chopping to pieces ever Russian army in its path. By the time the Germans reached the gates of Moscow and Stalingrad in early fall of 1941, the situation for Russia was grim. Stalin's losses were incomprehensibly vast. In the space of four months, he had casualties of more than a million killed, wounded, or POW. His airforce had been chased from the skies. For the first time in his career, he must have felt personally threatened. It is at this point that William Craig in ENEMY AT THE GATES analyzes how close Russia came to being swept away in the Nazi whirlwind. Craig notes there were several factors that turned the tide in Stalin's favor.1) Hitler's faulty generalship. There were several occasions that the German Sixth Army could have saved itself by retreating from Stalingrad. In each case, Hitler refused permission, despite the collective wisdom of his High Command that wished to.2) Stalin's brute nature. Craig pictures a totally ruthless and amoral leader who orders his NKVD thugs to summarily execute any soldier, reardless of rank, who retreats. Further, Craig shows a man who cares not a fig for truly monstrous losses so long as the battle is won.3) The immensity that is Russia. Russia was then one of the largest land masses on earth and had a population several times that of Germany's. Stalin could afford to lose three soldiers for each German and still win.4) The weather. By great bad luck, Hitler chose to attack Russia during the worst winter in generations. The freezing weather completely ground to a halt the German advance.Craig writes in a style that is breezy and easy to read, even for the historical layman. He punctuates many points by judicious use of interviews, although I wonder how he managed to gain access to such verbatim quotes. The picture of a collapsing German front slowly evolves such that the destruction of a German Army in the Russian snow of 1942 foreshadows the coming destruction of the Nazi state in 1945. This book is well worth the reading for those who wish to know more about one of the world's military pivitol points."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"I also remember reading Enemy At The Gates as a young teenager and thought it a powerful work: the immersion in one of World War II's most powerful and decisive battles was very strong. I think it is one of the best works of its type, for attention to overall historical detail as well as to the personal experience of individual German soldiers, Russian soldiers and civilians. Years after losing my copy, I am glad to be able to reread this book again. And I intend to hang on to it this time.

The perilous Volga river crossings, the Stuka attacks on them, the Luftwaffe's devastation of Stalingrad suburbs -- its all in Hayward's book. You must read it.Craig's book is equally good, even though its not (as the movie of this name was) only about Stalingrad. Craig's account needs to bew read by more recent and definitive books like Hayward's, Beevor's and Erickson's. But it is still a HIGHLY recommended first start. It is a good, realistic overview.Excellent stuff on a dreadful and totally destructive, criminal battle. Damn the evil tyrants; pity their conscripts."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"The battle of Stalingrad is on grand display in Enemy At The Gates. I read it for the first time back in the 70's and I'm thrilled to see it getting its due as a result of the movie. Also, I just finished War Of The Rats by David L. Robbins and found the same truelife intensity written into the novel, which focuses intensely on the sniper duel, as does the newly released movie. Whether or not you want to learn about the battle as a whole or just focus on the fascinating duel between the top German and Russian snipers at Stalingrad, you ought to read both in addition to the movie. If I had to pick just one, I'd go with War Of The Rats."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"it was a great read, it gave personal stories, and stories behind the battles, the things that happened besides the struggle, it is a very good book and i recommend it"},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"I must first say that I'm addicted to military history books, so perhaps my scrutiny is more critical than others. However, I was disappointed with what should have been a better organized, more compelling story about one of the greatest military blunders in recorded history.One of my primary complaints is the lack of maps and lack of details in the few maps that are there. When following the movements of dozens of divisions and hundreds of thousands of men, it is difficult to follow XX Panzer Division and YY Guards through numerous obscure villages across the steppe around the Kessel without clear visual references to where these villages are. For example, I found myself thumbing back and forth to the two maps of the overall campaign trying in vain to find Manstein's Panzer stand at the bridge south...ish of the fortress city...somewhere. The primary Kessel airfields were labeled on one of the maps, but the emergency airfields (farther west) after the Russians tightened their grip and extended the pincers were neglected.Another disappointment was the street fighting in Stalingrad itself. Perhaps the author was trying to make his book reachable for the vast majority of readers out there, but I was disappointed that literally weeks of brutal fighting were glossed over or missed completely. By example, Pavlov's defense of the house at the crossroads is a miraculous and compelling in and of itself, but the author spends a couple of pages talking of his first few days in the house and then, a while later in the book, starts over again with a \\"meanwhile, Pavlov had been holding this house for a month.\\" It left me wanting. I would have loved details inside the Barrikady of where x-room or y-shop were located because the fighing there raged from room to room for, literally, months. Chuikov, Pavlov, Vassili, and Tania all have very compelling individual stories, but I felt the individual missions, tactics, and accomplishments weren't fleshed out as well as possible, and that was only on the Russian side. I think the German stories were a little more detailed, probably because they were/are such prolific record keepers, but there were still large gaps in details that I missed.I'm going to try Beevor's 560-page brick to see if that satisfies my now piqued curiosity. Unfortunately, Enemy at the Gates, while being an easy and fast read (I finished it in 3 days), left out critical components for me."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"\\"Enemy at the Gates\\" is more a collection of stories of individual experiences of the battle than it is a serious work of military history. It is very similar in approach to Cornelius Ryan'sThe Longest Day. But that's also what makes it the most compelling English-language book on the subject. The stories tell us more about the nature of the battle than accounts of troop movements and lines on a map ever could. It is a much better book than Antony Beevor'sStalingrad: The Fateful Siege: 1942-1943. Unlike Beevor, Craig actually interviewed hundreds of survivors of the battle and retold their stories. That is, Craig presents the reader with mostly first-hand accounts. Also unlike Beevor, Craig is not preoccupied with Soviet attrocities, although he does not ignore that aspect of the battle either. The only unfortunate thing about this book is that a bad movie with the same title was based very loosely on it."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Enemy at the Gates is a classic military book written about the epic World War II Battle of Stalingrad, fought in 1942-1943 between the superpowers of the time - Hitler's Germany and Stalin's U.S.S.R. The author interviewed a lot of survivors from both sides, including soldiers, doctors and civilians and obtain invaluable insight into the battle which significantly influenced the outcome of the war. For the first time, Nazi Germany had been crushed in a battle.The book describes how in 1942, the German Sixth Army, fresh from crushing victories inflicted on the Allies across Europe, advanced deep into U.S.S.R. in an attempt to capture Stalingrad. Though out-numbered, the Russian army heroically fought back and held Stalingrad against a much more powerful enemy. Eye-witness accounts of the horrors of the initial bombings, the brutality of the fighting were described. The Russians were slowly pushed back and victory for the Germans seemed just a matter of time before the Russian reinforcements came in and encircled the Germans in Stalingrad, cutting supply lines for an army with almost 300,000 men.The Germans quickly ran out of food and ammunition as the Russians encirclement grew tighter and tighter. The book detailed how the German High Command was bullish about delivering enough supplies to the troops inside the encirclement (even predicting a victory) and the politics and individual misjudgements which lead to the diaster that followed.At this point, no matter what your opinions on the Germans are, you will feel sorry for the German troops trapped in the encirclement, slowly weakening and dying due to hunger, unable to launch counterattacks due to lack of supplies, waiting for the inevitable diaster to come.The final chapter also describes the surrender and the fate of hundreds of thousands of German, Romanian and Italian prisoners of war. Only a small percentage of these troops saw their home countries again as they were killed or starved to death. Survivors of the prison camps described in horror how some of their countrymen had to resort to cannibalism to survive.At the back of the book is a short chapter describing the fate of some of the survivors of the battle. I found this section to be quite interesting to see how the people involved in this battle ended up.The only thing I find lacking in this book is detailed maps showing how the battle evolved from the initial German advances to the final destruction of the Sixth Army.I strongly recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Schoolboys talk about it, armchair historians love to dissect it.This is easily the best of the Stalingrad books - not a novel but the historical record written in muscular prose that the great war chroniclers like Harrison Salisbury and Cornelius Ryan trademarked. Superb insight on the white heat of the battle, of how this was a culminating battle where animal hatreds would decide one of hisotory's turning points.This is considerably more readable and less cluttered than Antony Beevor's volume. It is definitive history that seems to settle the arguments of revisionists about what might have been. This time, not even Manstein could have saved them. The front was vulnerable in too many places. The Russians would win.The real story is just how Manstein pulled off the extrication of the rest of the southern German forces, which military logic would have seemed were next victims after the anihilation of the Sixth Army. And he followed up this mephistophlean feat with the astonishing Kharkov counter - attack that sent the Russians reeling.There's lots of great history surrounding Stalngrad. This book is the place to start and finish on the battle, then readers can move on to the real death knel - Operation Bagration. Books on this (which signalled the real collapse) are rarer but Amazon usually has a reasonably priced volume or two in its listings."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"This is one of the few WW11 histories that I have read more than one time.

Craig carefully follows the battle inserting personal accounts from both sides and telling us what happened to the protagonists after the war. Strongly recommended"},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"There was a time when I concentrated exclusively on the western european theatre of WW2. This book changed all that. This is one of the greatest war accounts I have ever read. The author maintains a strictly neutral tone which brings out the best and worst of both Russian and German armies. Absolute must read for WW2 fans.Note that this book is not about the exploits of Vassily Zaitsev (from the movie with the same name)."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Craig's book on the Battle of Stalingrad is as close as horrifying as the event it so magnificently sets out to depict.The German-Russo conflict of WW2 is the most ferocious war ever fought in the history of mankind. It was a no holds barred war between two ideologies, both of whose take on human rights and life was a non-existent national policy. Sadly for Hitler he did not exploit the welcome his armies received in many of the regions (they saw the Germans as liberators from the suppression of communism) and the subsequent ill-treatment and blatant slaughter of the population turned sentiments against the invaders; resulting in a very effective guerilla front being mounted within the occupied terrorities. Craig's account epitomizes the full drama of total war. Encircled by the Russians, cut off from their supply lines and in the grip of General Winter, and against express orders from Hitler himself not to break out, the 250000 German soldiers of the 6th Army, found themselves fighting, for the first time in their to-date triumphant war, a major defensive, door to door, building to building, battle to survive under the most horrendous conditions of cold, hunger, sleep deprivation, lice infestation, disease,artillery bombardment and depleting ammunition resources. Of the 90000 Axis troops who eventually surrendered and went intocaptivity less than 5000, the majority of them only 12 years later, were destined to see Germany and their families again. This book is essential reading for anyone interested in the major events that changed Hitler's successes in WW2."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"This book began in summer 1942, when Hitler planned to invade the southern part of Russia as it failed to invade Moscow and Leningrad in Operation Barbarossa. The target was Stalingrad located at the banks of the Volga deep into Russian territory aprroximately 3000 kilometres from Berlin! This will create a couldron. The city was name under Premier Joseph Stalin as an honor defending it from the white army in the Russian revolution. If the city fall to the hands of the Nazis, this would disgarce Stalin and open the road for the Nazis to invade the oil rich Central Asia and the Caucasus Mountains that would lead to the fall of Communist Russia! Whatever it takes, Joseph Stalin ordered his generals to defend what ever they have to delay the Germans till the winter comes as further reinforcements and equipments would be supply from Siberia.The German 6th Army was in full confidence as they won every battles until they reach the outskirts of Stalingrad! The Russians 62nd Army under General Chuikov defended every inches of the buildings to stop the Germans from reaching the Volga. William Craig decribed excellent accounts faced by German and Russian troops in the bloodiest urban warfare include close combat from rooms to rooms in apartment buildings to large tractor factories and some places exchanges hands several times in one day. The Russians defended bravely as never seen before by the Germans. Craig described accounts of Russian and German troops losing up to 75% battalion to divison strength from September to November 1942. German Panzers were vulnerable to ambush compared to the plains in the steppes. Artillery bombardment destroyed the city buildings created important fox holes and bunkers for the Russians. Russian snipers sniped German officers and soldiers everyday decreased the morale of the German Army. Example Russian sniper Vassili Zaitsev in the movie. As winter arrived, the Germans was exhausted and failed to invade the whole city. To entrap the German 6th Army, Operation Uranus was launched to counter attack the Germans breaking the weak rear front lines of the Romanians and the Italians surrounded the German 6th Army in 9 days! Food, fuel, clothing and ammunition were scared as the Russian winter arrived. Craig described the accounts of individual German army in starvation and suffered from the cold winter! As Hitler failed to supply and counter-attack the Russians, the entired 6th Army surrender to the Russians in February 1943. The fall of Stalingrad was the truning point of Hitler's Blizkreig that lead to the fall of Germany. The Battle of Stalingrad in this book tells us the history of urban warfare that brutally killing each other in a war of terror that killed alomost 2 million soldiers and civilians from August 1942 to February 1943! Unlike Operation Overlord in Normandy by the Americans and her allies, Stalingrad was not know by many people that led to the fall of the German blizkreig! Craig described a terror in military blunder faced by the Germans in World War II and the importance of Russia struggling to fight back alone in the East! This book is different than the movie and it give importance history information Battle of Stalingrad from to the beginning to the end!"},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Enemy at the Gates is a nicely balanced account about the Stalingrad campaign. The author gives enough details to tell the story, without listing where every unit is at each moment in time. He also includes enough personal accounts to give you a feel for the events that are taking place. This is not a book for the beginner or the expert, but if you want a quick read on the events concerning the Stalingrad campaign this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Winston Churchill lumps together the Battles of El Alamein and Stalingrad as his two turning points of WWII - both were decisive losses (the first 2) for the Wehrmacht. With all due respect to the British and Germans that fought over the desert in Egypt, however, El Alamein does not compare to the scope and importance of the Battle of Stalingrad, especially on the morale of both the Russian and German forces. Having said that, Stalingrad is best seen as the culmination of the real battle - the rebuilding of the Red Army (after Stalin's near-suicidal decision to liquidate its leadership) and the mobilisation of the Soviet Union's vast industrial postential.The German 6th Army was fighting its way across the Steppes of Russia with the objective of (a) protecting the left flank of the German invasion into the oil-rich Caucuses and (b) inflicting damage on the Volga basin - both an industrial and agricultural region. The Soviets chose to make a stand at Stalingrad on the banks of the Volga in an attempt to stall the invasion long enough to gather sufficient force to trap and destroy the armies located deep in Russia and the end of tenuous supply lines. This book tells the story, from both sides, of the drawn-out, severe street-fighting that took place as first the Germans fought their way into the city, then had to defend it as the Red Army fought to retake it.There are a number of things to like about this book. Both the generals and the private soldiers are well-represented in the cast of characters that Craig focusses on. We see Paulus, Chuikov, Hitler, and Stalin as they direct the motions of the armies under their commands. But we also see privates and lieutentants as they run from cover to cover with sniper bullets and artillery rounds raining down on them. The book quickly cuts between little vignettes of action, giving a frantic (and therefore realistic) pace to the narrative. Craig gives a good feel for the developing encirclement and desperation of the trapped soldiers. He describes in vivid (some would say nauseating) detail the nature of the conditions as the German army slipped from a well-oiled machine to a shell-shocked group of soldiers starving to death.Unfortunately, as mentioned by other reviewers, there is little by way of historical context. There is not much to describe why the 6th Army arrived at Stalingrad at the end of a very long and treacherous supply route. Without explanation of the context, it would seem that Hitler sent them off to die for no good reason, rather than explaining that the same tactics that led to this disaster were universally successful for the previous 3 years - in Poland, Norway, Greece, France, Libya, and the Soviet Union itself. This is what caused the paralysis at OKW - the German high command - after a string of unparalleled victories, they had no idea how to deal with defeat. Likewise, the Germans come off as sympathetic and pathetic victims, when they were the ones that invaded (in a surprise attack), slaughtered millions of innocent people, and sent Red Army personnel off to die on forced marches to slave-labour camps behind the lines. Without this context, it's easy to think of the Soviets as sub-human killer robots under the thumbs of the NKVD political police.It's easy to see why this happens in a book written in 1973, when it was fashionable to dismiss the Soviet Union as totalitarian and \\"evil\\" (which it undoubtedly was) and to admire the fighting quality of the German troops. This forgets the fact that the German soldiers were also pawns (often all too willing) of the totalitarian and evil Nazi government. Likewise, with access to a greater number of German survivors' stories, the author could be forgiven for slipping into a pro-German slant. Even so, it's a bit grating to see such a bias in a supposedly unbiased book.To sum up, this is definitely a readable and interesting book. It's a bit hard to find - Beevor's book on the same battle is now considered to be a better account - but there is a lot here, especially for those that like first-hand personal accounts. Strategic considerations are thin, however, and so lowers the quality of the book in my eyes, especially as they lend an air of pro-German bias to the account."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Undoubtably one of the very best action WWII books I've read, and I've read a bunch. This book simply reads well, full of historical accuracy, and captivates the reader. War is awful, and all educated people who value freedom and liberty should be mindful of the pain and sacrifices of those who experience the hell we re-live due to not learning from history. Craig is a superb author."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"I happened to notice the book as a special release while in Barnes and Noble. It was a very interesting read and will give you an idea to the intensity of the event.I saw the movie and in it's own right it's good. However, it rather interesting to see who they made a whole movie from what was basically 6 pages of the book.The author did a good job compiling interviews, memoirs and documents from the people involved. Overall the book flows and draws you in.I can say there isn't a favored side in the presentation. Even though it's suggested by another review. The author did a great job simply telling a story or in this case a series of stories. You get heroes, you get villains. You get to look into the minds of the mean deciding and fighting the campaign.One interesting thing I noticed was the fact that the soldiers pretty much stayed faithful to Hitler even though he basically screwed them by being stubborn and yet indecisive.There are touching accounts and sad accounts. I found it interesting that battle stopped to listen to a violinist play Bach. A vet who could not slay his favorite horse and left her in a bunker with a note asking the Soviets to take care of her. Don't know if they did. The cobbler who decided to spy and was hung for it. There is so much more.The one interesting thing is the famed duel of Vasily and Maj Koenig(from the movie and mentioned in the book). It appears that Major Koenig does not exist. People have looked for him and have commented they can't find records of him. Soviet Propaganda.Now to a reviewers comment that the Soviets are portrayed with vile contempt. I did not get that from the author. He spoke to many veterans and even drank shots of vodka with commando commander as he toasted his long lost men. The so called contempt might be the stories of the Soviets killing prisoners. They did. There is no discussing that fact and it was even shown in the records after the USSR collapsed. Never mind the fact that 120000 Italians marched to prison and only 12000 came out. Over 100000 Germans marched to Prison and only 5000 made it out.Overall, it's a great book but as with history you have to read many accounts.The next book I will look into is Beevor's Stalingrad : The Fateful Siege: 1942-1943"},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Enemy at the Gates, A Battle for Stalingrad, by William Craig brought out the truth. He described one of the bloodiest battles in World War II through the eyes of the people in it, not ones that looked at it after. This is one of the many books I have read about World War II, among even more about military acts, but it left a deep mark behind, even after the black back cover was seen. It caused such a deep impact on me. It made me feel that these people were role models, they inspired me to courageous and believe that I should have hope, for they did. The book did this because William Craig brought in stories of the people in there, but he didn&iexcl;t use it as an excerpt, but as part of his words. He brought in what I thought were imagination about war, to be cold hard facts about war. Another reason why I liked this book was that he never grew soft like some of the authors do. When an infantry hops in with this left leg in this hand, he described it well. He never lets you out on any fact or story about this battle.I also like this book because he had touched me like no other book had. Many books left you with hatred on why humans were so stupid on having wars, but he didn&iexcl;t. After you finished the book, you feel that you want to help those trapped men. You want to help them meet their wives, kiss their kids. He does not create an atmosphere with a feeling you should have, but he tells you the facts about the men, reads you their letters of despair, writes the quotes of worried captains and allow you to feel the way you will feel. He touched me using the words of the people there, not of his, but survivors amongst the thousands of victims. He touched my heart, and after reading this book, I too, feel more proud and feel that even in the worse should I have hope."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"This is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is very well written and reading it moves at a fast pace with the feeling that you are there in Stalingrad (at times with the Russians and at times with the Germans.)Any potential reader should be warned that this book has very little to do with the recent movie of the same name. The sniper duel that is the plot of the movie is briefly covered in the book. The movie is more closely based on the fictional novel \\"The War of the Rats\\" (which in turn uses this book for a lot of its information). I have read this book twice, the War of the Rats once and have seen the movie once. This book is far superior to the other two.The book is mostly personal recollections of various Germans, Russians and Italians and their experiences in the battle for Stalingrad from August 1942 to January 1943. When the Germans first arrive in Stalingrad you feel the horror of the Russians through their eyewitness accounts of the German occupation and the destruction that the Germans wrought on them. Alternately when the German High Command sells out the German Sixth Army trapped in Stalingrad you feel the horror that the Germans have to endure as the Russians slowly overun them. The narratives of starvation and eating dogs, horses, and later in captivity with russians of even Cannibalism are horrific. The freezing cold, the lice, the rats, the constant threat of being shot by a sniper are quite horrifying!Most of the Germans who endured to surrender at Stalingrad perished enroute to POW camps or in the camps themselves.World War 2 was the most brutal war in human history, the Russian front was the most brutal theater in that war, and Stalingrad was the most brutal battle of the whole war. The Germans treated the Russians with incredible brutality when they invaded Russia, the Russians repaid them with incredible brutality all the way back to the fall of Berlin.A very good read of a very dark period in human history."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"William Craig has written a piece of literary and historical excellence. This book was written detailing the Battle for Stanlingrad, a mainly industrial city on the banks of the Volga river. Stalingrad was a city of ideology and Hitler wanted to bring the city that bore his rival's name to its knees.The writing is very vivid and detailed, referencing true accounts through interviews and other documents. The storytelling follows the lives of mere citizens of Stalingrad, to the highest ranking officials of the Third Reich and the Red Army. The grotesque details will, at times, make you cringe with disgust and others leave you in awe and wonderment as you read about details of tactical movements and strategic planning. This book manages to capture the reader in a way to feel empathy for both Soviet Union and Nazi soldiers, who both suffered in unspeakable conditions.If you enjoyed the movie, the book will be ecstatic reading the book. It must be mentioned however, that this book follows the war as a whole and not just the sniper Vasilli Zaitsev. This book is excellent for readers new to war, as well as seasoned history buffs. Enemy at the Gates is a true gem."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"If you are interested in the Axis forces on the eastern Front, then this is a book not to be missed. It tells it straight and leaves you under no illusion that life on the eastern front for the common soldier was hell. Many first hand accounts give the harshness of the terrain and of the weather and the tenacity and brutality of there opposition. The 6th Army was a proud army when it marched into Russia, Stalingrad changed that and the fields of bones that know surround the city pay testimony to this event."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"If you really want to know how it was, you ultimately have to ask those who were there.So Craig did. We have Russian snipers and Italian doctors and German sergeants and many, many more, with their personal stories all woven into the greater tapestry of the history of the siege. Not only does this method make this one of the most interesting history books I have read, it also ranks as a real service to society: as I write, probably many of the men interviewed are now no longer available to interview. How much history did Craig preserve that would have been otherwise lost? I'd say plenty.There really isn't any excuse for this book ever being out of print. It's like reading Stephen Ambrose but with a higher excitement level."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"An avid amateur 20th century historian, I was simply floored by Craig's ability to draw the reader into what was possibly the greatest battle in the history of modern warfare, namely the siege of Stalingrad. Painting a detailed picture of the progress, moral, an setbacks within both the German and Soviet ranks, Craig manages to give you a 360 degree view of the battle from the initial attack all the way through the Nazi's final surrender.Complete with numerous asides regarding the efficacy of Soviet snipers and the almost unthinkable cannibalism which was prevalent among both sides in the battle's final days, I've little doubt \\"Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad\\" ranks among the greatest historical accounts of WWII."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"What I found incredible about this book is the facts can be traced back to sources authoritative on Stalingrad - the people that were there - and survived! Mr. Craig really did his homework on this one, taking the time to travel to Russia, Germany, even Israel, to speak with the men and women who were there. I thought he did a nice job of describing the brutal combat, and sadism both sides inflicted upon one another. Overall, the book provides a soldier's-eye view of the world, but it scales the ranks from the lowly private, all the way up to Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin. The flow from the battlefield to High Command can be confusing to follow, but it really is a nice relief from the more grizzly scenes depicted in the novel. Maps are provided, but they are very basic and confusing in B&amp;W. Nice illustrations for those who are non-conversant on German/Russian WWII hardware. Best parts of the novel are the Epilogue, and the story chronicles what happened, without the author &quot;interpreting&quot; it for the reader. I'm waiting for a film producer to make a &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; out of this one!"},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Craig's history of the fateful battle of Stalingrad is accessible, at least. It is not nearly long enough to pay attention to all important aspects of the first attacks that reduced the city and its population so dreadfully; the destruction of the German Sixth Army is given much more space.All in all, a decent introduction for the casual reader or the reader just beginning to learn about Stalingrad, but one I would get from the library. I would recommend Antony Beevor's highly readable work on Stalingrad for serious students or for those whose interest is merely piqued by the morsels Craig holds out here."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"A gripping and detailed history of the battle for Stalingrad in 1942-43. The book gives a good account for the reasons why the German high command and Hitler placed so much at stake in capturing the industrial city of Stalingrad in southern Russia in their 1942 campaign. The level of detail and research into what can only be described as a great human tragedy will be greatly appreciated by any reader wishing to learn more about the much misunderstood war between Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany"},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"By far, on of the definitive works on the Battle of Stalingrad. A grudge match between two depraved dictators, and two evil political ideologies, the Battle of Stalingrad was quite arguably the definitive turning point for the outcome of the World War II in Europe. The battle for Stalingrad was in fact entirely avoidable by both sides. Nevertheless, it became a savage maelstrom of death and destruction, merely to satisfy the egos and political will of the opposing regimes. The author interviewed a large number of people on both sides of this battle, German and Soviet, military and civilian. The recent movie loosely based on this book, focuses on the famous Russian sniper, Sgt. Zaitsev, but typical of Hollywood, they warp the historical facts in order to ...\\"improve the plot?\\". Read the book instead! At the end, there is a brief section describing what became of many of the people interviewed. one of the most heart-rending stories is the account of Tanya Chernova, one of Zaitsev's fellow snipers. She had loved Zaitsev, and looked forward to marrying him at the end of the war. She was badly injured in an explosion, that rendered her incapable of bearing children. Zaitsev had heard she was dead, and never saw her again. Chernova, had also heard a rumor that Zaitsev had died in battle. Years later, she found out he had in fact survived, and married another woman, but had long since passed away after a heart-attack. In addition to this, Chernova's exploits as a soldier are quite fascinating. She was very deadly with a rifle, and just as dangerous at close-quarters, despite being of tiny stature! She was one of many female soldiers who fought with great skill for Russia.Some of the heroic defenders of Stalingrad, of Jewish heritage, left the USSR years later, and defended their new homeland of Isreal just as valiantly. They put their experience to good use in a noble cause.Most of the accounts seem to cover the experiences of Wehrmacht soldiers, and their allies. They were the ones who ultimately suffered the worst of the ordeal. Their logistics failed, their leadership failed, and the harsh winter weather took maximum toll. They were completely written off by their Nazi leaders. The majority of Axis personnel who became prisoners of war in the Soviet Union, never went home. Those that did, returned only after many years of vindictive abuse by the communists."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Lots of research and interviews resulted in a very detailed account of this pivotal battle. The movie of the same title focuses mostly on sniper operations, which the book covers only sparsely. So you will be disappointed, if you are looking for just sniper tactics. Most interesting to me were the details on how Stalin and Hilter micromanaged the battle from many miles away."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"This rather old (1970s) account of the Stalingrad battle is still interesting because of the numerous personal accounts derived from an impressively long list of interviews of survivors by the author. It can be a bit confusing as one may forget the earlier passage in the book about one of those individuals but at the same time that's the source of the charm of that book.This is not a book about strategies or tactical operations as you will find with Glantz (To the Gates of Stalingrad: Soviet-German Combat Operations, April-August 1942 (Modern War Studies)) (Armageddon in Stalingrad: September-November 1942 (The Stalingrad Trilogy, Volume 2) (Modern War Studies)) or Beevor (Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege: 1942-1943) but it has its own merits. Some interesting sidelines about Von Manstein. The exchange of teletypes between Paulus' staff and Von Manstein's staff was very interesting (some of them are in the appendix of Von Manstein's memoirs (Lost Victories: The War Memoirs of Hitler's Most Brilliant General)but most are not (at least not in the condensed English translation).Particularly irritating to me was the reference to General Paulus as General Von Paulus which is incorrect (Paulus was not from an aristocratic family which is the meaning of the \\"von\\" in German or \\"de\\" in French). It's hard to understand how the author could have made that error.Still I quite enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"Great informative book on how the advantage of war was lost by hitlers armies in Russia.Fast delivery and great price!"},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"This is an easy to read book that anyone interested in WWII history would enjoy. A personal story of the battle of Stalingrad, it goes into great detail about the actual people who lived through the terrible conflict. You get to know the characters on both sides and while it's very honest about the tragedy of war, it's never gory or bloodthirsty in a graphic kind of way. Just the facts of this brutal conflict during a troubled time in the world 70 years ago. This book would be great compulsory reading for school kids in history classes wishing to hear the story of a great battle from both sides of the conflict."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"I generally gravitate toward the tactical / operational books of WWII. Books written by David Glantz, Steven Newton, Stephan Hamilton, Carlo D'Este, Werner Haupt, Alex Buchner etc but am very glad time was taken to read this important, superbly crafted documental novel. It's the best of its kind and anybody that is interested in WWII and especially Stalingrad should read it.It didn't take long to know the author went to great lengths to research this campaign and this theory is confirmed when you look at the impressive Bibliogrphy of primary and secondary sources used. If your well read on Stalingrad, you recognized many passages the author describes that are also in other books, assuring me that the text is history and not the figment of the author's imagination.The author doesn't give much background, doesn't start his story leading up to Operation Blue, only touching on the first month of the campaign and doesn't get down to more serious coverage until Gen Paulus approaches the Don River. Mr Craig does show the hardship that General Paulus, a relatively newcomer to an Army command, receives from an impatient, unreasonable Hitler when he drastically changes battle orders. Hitler changes the orders to actually take the city which wasn't in the original plans and he takes most of Paulus' armor away to fight in the south. The battle coverage does pick up after the 6th Army crosses the Don and heads for Stalingrad where Russian resistance dramatically increases but the tactical coverage is no where near the level of detail in David Glantz's books.The tactical coverage is good, probably good enough for many people but where this book shines is how the author blends the tactical concerns with the human element.The author skillfully blends the tactical aspect of the fighting with the personal as well as the tangential aspects of battle. The communications between the front line and the general's HQ or the communications of the field general with Berlin or Moscow. The espionage and partisan aspects are included as well as the logistical concerns.You read about the personal side of Paulus and other officiers as well as the front line soldier and the civilians that get caught in the way of two massive, uncaring monsters. The book has coverage of German and Russian aspects of the battle but the German is more prevalent. And the author clearly shows the brutality of one side for the other. The importance of air power is mentioned but not sufficiently.Mr Craig also covers the battle up to the final surrender in early Feb 1943. This coverage includes Operation Uranus, Little Saturn, Winter Storm and Ring. In other words he covers all main aspects of the destruction of 6th Army in the pocket, the attempted relief of that pocket and the subsequent account of the Russian counter offensive to destroy Manstein and the preparation to destroy AG A in the south.Mr Craig doesn't provide many maps but there are some interesting photos. There is an impressive Bibliography if the reader wants to learn more about this pivotal battle. There is also a Notes section but no true footnotes. The book ends with a helpful Index. This book is a classic and without exaggeration a must read and is highly recommended for any library."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"I first saw this book back in the early 80's and it is still one of my all time greats. The way William Craig puts you behind both lines in the battle makes you almost feel the cold as winter sets in and the fighting gets harder and harder. For those of you who have only seen the movie based off of the book this is a must read. The movie only covers several pages that are spread out in the book, but there are just so many different story lines going on besides the snipers. Please read"},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"While I'm neither historian nor reviewer, as one who can read, write and think, and who's recently read Craig's history of the battle of Stalingrad, I can say assuredly: If you're eager to learn about WW II and/or the Russian front and/or how the Nazi war machine and/or the Russian defense of the motherland worked, and are put off by difficult or unengaging prose, read this book. Only if you are a WW II or siege-of-Stalingrad buff already steeped in the blood-drenched lore of that pivotal battle will you be disappointed. For everyone else, after wading through only a very few pages of stage-setting, you will be drawn in by the incredible and horrific drama that was a major portion of WW II's carnage, well told by an historian who obviously had respect for his craft and who as a writer chose a style that was telling while understated.I'm aware of criticism, both academic and subjective, about elements that might fairly be found wanting in this work. While not in a position to knowledgably judge it, I'm quite sure of this history's value as an eminently accessible and generally truthful re-creation of the event that is thoughtful, detailed, nuanced, balanced, and authoritative. Mr. Craig took great pains to admix and juxtapose not just the Nazis with the Soviets, and the Russians with the Germans, but the strategies of politicians and generals with the ad hoc struggles of foot soldiers and peasants; official communiques and orders with remembered anecdotes; photos and three key maps with terse descriptions of topography and cityscape; and spoken word with written accounts, so as to create a three-dimensional accounting that is palpably human and honest, complete and polished, even if imperfect.The lives of so many of the players in this hell-on-earth contest come alive in Mr. Craig's telling, even, as is often the case, when he can afford but little time and space for their individual tales in the service of telling the overall story. But he paints a full enough picture -- for example, of the German veterinarian turned physician, striving to save his gaunt but beloved horse amidst his beseiged countrymen as they literally starve to death -- that the reader is led inexorably to understand at once the humanity and monstrousness of the soldiers who comprised Hitler's legions.Not often can it be said that a history that attempts to be thorough (if not comprehensive)is a page-turner; this one is. And I can't think of many praises greater than these: that I think I have a solid understanding of the basics of what unfolded a thousand or so miles east of Berlin on the Volga when Hitler tried to extend his empire and reach within and through Russia in 1942-43, and that I am looking now for other works by Craig to read, such a master at the readable and graspable telling of history was he.If this subject at all interests you, and you are eager to learn, read this book. You will not only not be sorry, you will be grateful for the author's effort, so easy will it have made yours in reading his work."},{"Title":"Enemy At the Gates: The Battle For Stalingrad","review":"This book is written with a journalistic approach. That is, the author -thank God - is not interest in proving any historical theory or promoting an ideological agenda. He just was the reader to feel and vividly imaging the pandemonium that more than a million persons live in the battle of Stalingrad. This is done not just by means a perfect description of the tactical decision taken by the field commanders and headquarters of both armies, but also by using hundred of first hand accounts of the combatants, with an acute description of their fears, wounds, hate and delusions. No page in this book will left you unshaken. No silly patriotism, or self aggrandizing feast are poured onto the reader, on the contrary it achieves a fantastic balance featuring both sides of the conflict, while showing the folly of war. Maybe the best work about WWII that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"I have been studying Abraham Lincoln for nearly 40 years. I do not know what happened when Perret wrote this book about Lincoln since his books on three other presidents are fair or better, but Perret really &quot;dropped the ball&quot; on this one. A large amount of Perret's information is untrue, and LINCOLN'S WAR has a huge number of inaccuracies throughout it. Just a few examples are his information about the battle of Chancellorsville, the military importance of terrain and geography. He confuses rivers and direction of their flows and gets the specifics of some battles wrong, and then draws conclusions on this inaccurate information and lack of knowledge. He confuses some of the battles and has units in places they were not. Perret claims that Lincoln created his own currency for the Union which is not true. The Legal Tender Act was passed by Congress and Lincoln's participation was just to sign the bill since he was the president then. That act of Congress was constitutionally legal. Perret states that no black troops were raised in Kentucky when records show that 23,700 black troops were soldiers in Kentucky. Perret also writes that Lincoln was obsessed with the capture of the Confederate capitol, Richmond. Although capturing Richmond was one of Lincoln's overall three military strategies, the truth is that for at least a year Lincoln repeatedly told some of his generals that at least hurting or better yet, defeating Lee's army wherever it was engaged by Union military was his (Lincoln's) objective, not capturing Richmond. Perret also misunderstands Lincoln's strategy for emancipating slaves. In conclusion, Perret did shamefully sloppy research, and therefore his conclusions about Lincoln mean nothing since they are based on inaccurate information and the author's lack of knowledge of historical facts and realities during Lincoln's era. James M. McPherson who is considered by some to be America's most eminent Civil War historian, states that he found a minimum of 120 errors in Perret's book, LINCOLN'S WAR. If you want to read McPherson's review which is more detailed than my review, you can read McPherson's review at http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20040614&c=1&s=mcpherson"},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"Lincoln's War chronicles the leadership of America's greatest President during its gravest crisis. The author provides an account of how Abraham Lincoln held the Union together and led its military as commander-in-chief.The book is neatly organized. There is a general progression from before the start of the war until its conclusion, but many-if not all-of the chapters are organized thematically. And these chapters are well written and highly engaging. Many readers and reviewers have complained about some historical inaccuracies concerning some of the details, how major battles and events are given little attention, or that the portrayal of U.S. Grant is all wrong. Perhaps they detractors are correct in those regard, but one has to keep in mind the book's overall focus upon Lincoln as Commander-in-Chief, and in that regard I believe this book succeeds. (Perhaps this book deserves 3.5 stars instead of four, but because the one-star ratings for this book are so undeserved, I'll stand by my four-star rating.)Since much of Lincoln's time and energy was focused upon the Army of the Potomac and the struggle in the East, much of the book focuses upon that. However, ample attention is also paid to the war as it was fought in the West. A recurring theme (or assertion) throughout the book is that the Union's emphasis upon the East and marching the Army of the Potomac on the Confederate's capitol was misguided, and that more attention should have been paid to the Western front. This point is controversial, but at the very least the author does an adequate job in backing up this notion throughout the book.The author's portrayal of Lincoln as a man and as a military leader comes across as very sympathetic and positive-quite deserved, in this reviewer's view. The war was a tragedy for the nation, and all of the death and destruction took a heavy, heavy toll on Lincoln. His struggles with intense pain and sadness are remarkable.There was clearly a political dimension to Lincoln's role as Commander-in-Chief. After reading this book, I am further struck with how absolutely essential the political dimension was in prosecuting the war. Lincoln's political calculations were essential to keeping the borders states from joining the Confederacy and in keeping the voters of the North committed to candidates who supported the Union. One of the surest ways to dissolution would have been for the North to have elected a Democrat who would have sought a truce. Matters were further complicated by Lincoln's perpetual struggles with Union generals. The generalship problems appear to have persisted until near the end of the war.A few chapters stand out in my mind, which I found personally insightful. One chapter was devoted to Gen. Winfield Scott's contribution to the Union cause while serving as General-in-Chief at the beginning of the war. Another chapter is devoted to the U.S.S. Monitor, and another focuses upon Lincoln's acute interest in military and weapons technology. (For some reason, I find the image of Lincoln wearing his stove-pipe hat and firing rifles rather amusing.)I enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"This is one of those books I wanted to be good, and was sorely disappointed when I read it and found it wasn't anywhere near as good as I hoped it would be. While the writing's good, the history is hopelessly inaccurate. This is one of my rules: if you catch errors, significant ones, in a book of history, then you must wonder if any of the facts that you accept are correct. Some may be: my knowledge of Civil War history is pretty good. But in some instances, I am not familiar with the anecdote Perret recounts, and since his accuracy is in doubt, I can't take anything the author says seriously. This makes the book essentially worthless.To recount just a few of the errors: (for those who doubt) the Prince de Salm-Salm is identified as an Austrian (how did he get killed in the Franco-*Prussian* War, then?); O.O.Howard commanded the XII Corps (in reality the XI); and John Bell Hood wins the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, only to see his army annhilated at the Battle of Franklin by George Thomas. If you don't see the inaccuracy of the last assertion, get yourself a copy of Battle Cry of Freedom, or something (anything) else on the Civil War.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, and I think Perret needs to look into a new editor."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"While I found the author's style a bit florid for a history and analysis book, I have enjoyed it nonetheless. His analysis of Lincoln's military genus has been describe in a more condensed way then Shelby Foote's \\"The Civil War\\", but in doing so brings it to the forefront of the readers attention. Great battles are reduced to a page or two, which may disappoint many readers who love the details of all the various military units and commanders. This book concentrates on how a lawyer from Illinois becomes, in the course of three years, one of the greatest military minds of the 19th century. One note that is bound to create controversy is the statement that U.S. Grant was the greatest general the United States ever produced. The R.E. Lee and T. Jackson fans are sure to be angry for that. I highly recommend buying this book and intend to purchase another as a gift for a dear friend."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"I've read the reviews below and McPherson's review, and yes there are errors in this book. It is clear that Mr. Perret does not know a whole lot about the Civil War, but does that mean he doesn't know about Lincoln? On the contrary, I found this book to be interesting and enlightening on Lincoln and I've read other books on our greatest President. Some of the interesting items that I learned from this book are as follows. Lincoln saved numerous soldier's who deserted from firing squads and by executive decree he saved a lot of men from this fate. He continually visited hospitals to talk to wounded soldiers. His focus and concern was with the individual soldier, and visited the army to meet them and talk to them. This book studied Lincoln not the Civil War. And, the input on this Lincoln study was from the perspective of the Library of Congress. So what if Mr. Perret didn't recognize that more than two regiments of sharpshooters beat the Confederates on July 2nd, 1863 at Gettysburg. This isn't a history of the Civil War. It is a historical telling of Lincoln's role in the Civil War. More importantly, to me, it highlighted what a good man he was. We were lucky to have him as President during this trying time. If you are interested in learning about Lincoln, I recommend this book. It is good at delving into his personality. If you are interested in learning about the Civil War, don't read this book. It is as simple as that."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"The author's style is catchy; reminds me a bit of Fletcher Pratt. But there are errors of fact on almost every page! Save your money."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"Perret has a knack for putting complex social realities into thoughtful context. He is not a traditional academic or military historian. Instead he writes well and pushes the reader to think new thoughts (and even learn a new word or two). My advice is to make the investment -- which is made easier because the writing is so good. Reading this digestible summary of Lincoln as the main force in the civil war was made even richer for me because I had read Perret's essential bio on U.S. Grant. In this period of nostalgia about World war II and doubts about Iraq, I also recommend that readers search for copies of Perret's &quot;There's a War to be Won&quot; (on WWII's army) and &quot;A nation made by war&quot; (on the important ways our nation's wars have had on US history."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"As the author or editor of fourteen books on the Civil War and Indian Wars of the American West, I understand that errors of fact inevitably creep into the best of books. But I have never encountered a work of history with so many egregious errors as this one. On nearly every page one finds misstatements and historical lies of the most enormous sort. No, Mr. Perrett, President Lincoln did not dream up the idea one summer day in 1862 to issue paper currency; he merely signed an act of Congress, passed several months earlier, that called for paper currency. No, Mr. Perrett, the Federals did not walk up Marye's Heights \\"like tourists\\" during the Chancellorsville campaign; they encountered bitter resistance and lost heavily. No, Mr. Perret, Corinth, Mississippi, is not on the Mississippi River - not even close.The author may have some intriguing conclusions. But it is impossible to give them the slightest credence when they rest on a foundation so factually shaky.I could go on, but I heartily recommend the reader to Pulitzer Prize Winning Historian James McPherson's review of this book in The Nation. He properly relegates it to the historical trash can.If it were possible to give zero stars to a book, I would do so here. I've written dozens of reviews for journals and magazines, and this is the first completely negative one that I have ever felt compelled to put forward.By the way, I noticed one reviewer offering as an excuse for the scores of errors possible lapses by \\"administrative staff,\\" or by research assistants. Baloney. And if that is the case, and these erros slipped past him, than Mr. Perret is hopelessly ignorant of the subject matter."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"A disappointment.A book on Lincoln's role in the Civil War might have gone deeply into the controversial issue of the suspension of habeus corpus, or the history of civilian and military relationships in Europe and America, before and after Lincoln. But contrary to the claims on the dust jacket, there is little real discussion of any of these issues in Perret's book.In fact, this book is mostly just another quick survey of the history of the war. Why do we need to be told again about the battle of Pea Ridge, or Chattanooga, or even Gettysburg, for that matter? All this is covered in many popular histories. Perret should have used his pages to expand his case about technological innovations, for instance. This is indeed a fascinating topic, but Perret just gives us dogmatic pronouncements about iron-clad ships and repeating rifles being the wave of the future, really saying nothing that hasn't been said often before.I give it the lowest possible rating because Perret makes a huge mistake in his brief discussion of war financing (pages 201 and 202) The controversial \\"Greenbacks\\"were not interest-bearing notes. They were \\"fiat-money\\", the now familiar paper currency, legal tender for all depts public and private, their values fixed by government authority. Interest bearing bonds were something completely different, with a long history: Samuel Chase, I find from the encyclopedia, apparently pioneered the idea of issuing them in low denominations, twenty five or fifty dollars, targeted for sale to the general public, not just wealthy investors. There is an interesting story here, but in flying over it so fast, Perret has garbled it completely. I wonder who David Taylor from Ohio really was? Somebody could write a book.... If Perret gets this wrong, how can one rely on the rest of his scholarship? (Except when he is repeating familiar material)Perret exemplifies a style of history-writing that I find annoying. I want a historian to tell the story of what was done in the past, and expand on it by exploring what options were available to the people back then, and why (maybe) they chose as they did, and what it was all like for them. But Perret is like an editorial-writer. He wants to tell us, dogmatically, where the people of the past made mistakes, and what they should have done instead. Perret tells us that Lincoln should have ignored Richmond, and focussed on the western theater. Well, maybe so, and maybe not. The famous benefit of hindsight only tells us how things actually did work out, it doesn't tell us how things would have worked out if different decisions had been made. For a variety of reasons, I am much more interested in how Lincoln, and even how McClellan and Burnside, actually made their decisions at the time, than in how Geoffrey Perret thinks they should have decided."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"I found this a very moving account of Lincoln's presidency which focusedon his wartime decisions and his relationships with his cabinet, generals, soldiers in the field, and more. For a longtime reader of books on Lincoln and the Civil War it brought several new insights and anecdotes. The author obviously did a great amount of research into correspondence of the time, newspapers, diaries, etc. He is obviously well read in his subject because he doesn't repeat the accounts offered so often in other works.I don't understand the many uncharitable reviews here of this book, and the poor rating. It sounds like part professional jealousy from other historians, part just plain churlishness. It may be that the title has attracted statistical students of troop movements, constitutional law analysts, who may well find some factual mistakes. Certainly there are NOT errors on every page, poor man!A very astute, even astonishing work from a learned writer (who sent me quite often to my dictionary) who has not forgotten how to feel."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"Before buying this book you should read James McPherson's scathing review in the recent issue of The Nation concerning the multitude of factual errors which permeate this book.Caveat emptor."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"In my opinion, this book is much better than the reviews on Amazon indicate. The theme of the book isn't to present the order of battle and provide an in depth military analysis of the war. For those looking for this level of accuracy and detail, look elsewhere. I agree with the other reviews that the author was not well served by his editor, and there are obvious errors and inconsistencies that should have been caught and addressed.Putting these, perhaps significant, issues aside, the book does provide great insight into the development of the modern presidency and the role of the president as commander in chief. Lincoln transformed the wartime office of president into a role that we see today as strategist, administrator, commander and policy maker. Lincoln's background and involvement in the war created a new approach to the presidency and the war department that included the development of the Army Chief of Staff and the decentralized command structures we see today. His involvement in the strategy to modernize the infantry and cavalry firearms from muzzle loading rifles to repeating breech loading ones is a largely overlooked significant impact on both the Civil War and modern warfare in general.Perret tries, somewhat successfully, to get to the man behind the myth/legend of Lincoln. He does provide insights and elements that are largely ignored in most traditional Civil War histories. This book is worth the read if you have interest in the Civil War, in military-political history, or in Lincoln. While the inaccuracies and glosses may annoy, the overall picture the book gives and the insights Perret calls forth are definitely worth exploring."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"When I first started reading Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander In Chief by Geoffrey Perret, I thoroughly enjoyed his writing style. But the more I read, I started to realize that any points that Perret scored for writing, he lost for accuracy. How sad as Lincoln's War had great potential.Much has been written about Abraham Lincoln, but his serving as commander in chief is often under-emphasized. Shortly after his swearing-in, Lincoln was confronted with seceding states and the possibility of civil war. The new president set out on a crash-course to educate himself in all things military. \\"Lincoln invoked \`the war power' of the presidency, even though there is no reference to any such power in the constitution.\\" So between these two things, Lincoln created the modern war-time presidency.Perret's short chapters describe many different aspects of the war and how Lincoln dealt with them. The topics include munitions, soldiers, generals, battles and campaigns, his cabinet, etc. Some I found very interesting, including the Invalid Corps and the Hatchet Brigade. I was especially fascinated in how Lincoln took a personal interest in armaments. Inventors and businessmen would bring rifles and guns to the White House, where Lincoln and his staff would inspect and test fire them. Lincoln was largely responsible for the purchase of Sharps Rifles, Spencer Repeating Rifles, and other state of the art weapons. Lincoln was finally forced to remove Chief of Ordnance, James Ripley, who displayed lack of foresight when it came to new weapons and lack of organization when it came to ordering anything for the military.But for all the compelling information that Perret provides, much of it is riddled with errors. Many previous reviewers have gone into such mistakes in great detail, so I won't repeat them. But as a stickler for accuracy, I will give one example: In writing about Stonewall Jackson at the Battle of Chancellorsville, Perret states that \\"Jackson, riding forward in the darkness, was killed by friendly fire.\\" Jackson was definitely shot by his own men on May 2, 1863. But he did not die until eight days later, on May 10th. Perret's sentence is misleading.I did enjoy Lincoln's War, but I feel that the author should have been a little more careful in the facts that he presented."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"Despite some of the previous reviews. My husband is thoroughly enjoying this book. He is a Civil War buff and says that this book is tying together much of what he has read in the past regarding the Civil War."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"Geoffrey Perret's _Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief_ tells the story of Lincoln's presidency in a readable, entertaining style. As a prelude to Lincoln's presidency, the early chapters describe Lincoln's formative experiences first as a volunteer soldier during the Black Hawk War, then as a successful country lawyer, and finally as a Illinois Congressman. Establishing this background, the biography develops the following thesis: Lincoln's presidency defined our understanding of the scope of the modern executive branch, extending executive power and, to some extent, inventing the role of Commander in Chief in order to defeat the South's insurrection.Perret portrays Lincoln's humanity and, in particular, his deep affection for the Union soldiers, who looked upon him with reverence even during the most troubled days in the Civil War. Perret also focuses on Lincoln's day-to-day involvement with the military campaign itself, including battlefield visits when Lincoln placed his own safety in risk. Lincoln's studious, perspicacious interest in the new technologies of warfare is a major theme. Perret argues, for example, that Lincoln's personal requisition of multi-loading carbines for a sharp-shooter brigade may have saved Washington, DC, at Fort Matthews, during a Confederate assault in the middle of the war. Throughout the book, Perret chronicles Lincoln's vexations with the commanding generals in the Army of the Potomac prior to Ullyses Grant's accession.While concentrating on these themes, Perret conveys a sense of the desperation that Lincoln felt during the war and the precariousness of the Union's preservation, especially in the early years. Far from idealizing Lincoln, as the title of Perret's biography might suggest, we see his flaws as well, which make him an ever more impressive historical figure. For instance, Winfield Scott, the aging Commander of U.S. forces at the outset of the war, argued for a strategy of slowly dividing the Confederacy--cutting off supply and communication lines--rather than the quick capture of Richmond. Scott's plan was, in fact, how the Confederacy was ultimately defeated despite the fact that much of Lincoln's attention, from 1861 onward, remained on the Northern Virginia campaign and rapidly seizing Richmond.A number of reviewers have pointed out the historical inaccuracies in this account and allude to James McPherson's critical review of the biography. I can imagine how for a reader with a detailed knowledge of the Civil War these errors could be quite distracting and/or exasperating. Because I am not an expert on the Civil War or the specifics of military history, much of the book refreshed my memory of the U.S. history that I learned in high school. This was quite enjoyable. My own belief is that a general reader, like myself, still can profit from this book, despite its faults, and likely will not be seriously mislead about the broad historical picture."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"Lincoln's War hit the mark as far as Lincoln's efforts to define the role of Commander in Chief. It was very informative."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"Historian and author Geoffrey Perret has succeeded in writing yet another brilliant book!This work brings together one of my favorite military historians and my favorite President. Perret can always be counted on to write great history. His works are always well written, researched and compelling.In \\"Lincoln's War\\" Perret shows how Lincoln seized war powers, reserved for Congress by the Constituation, and made them his own. By the end of the war, the President evolved into an effective Commander and Chief who controlled all aspects of national strategy - political, economic, military and even informational - in his hands. The President was driven, as no other American politician was, to first preserve the Union and then to abolish Slavery throughout the United States.Lincoln succeeded in both, due mostly to his talents as Commander and Chief and the backing of the Union Army. As a result, the modern Presidency owes its war powers to Abraham Lincoln.This is truly a great read!"},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"I rented the movie \\"Cold Mountain\\" the other day and was impressed with it's depiction of the Battle of the Crater at Petersburg, Virginia, in 1864. I was also reading Perrett's book at the time, so I flipped ahead to page 387 to compare his Battle of the Crater with the movie's. I Found: \\"Thousands of black soldiers found themselves pushed into a pit 30 feet deep.\\"... \\"Hundreds were slaughtered and hundreds more captured.\\" Actually General Grant had been stricken with a bad case of \\"political correctness\\" just before the attack and had replaced the black division, specially trained for the assault, with white troops unfamiliar with the objective. Grant hadn't wanted to be accused of uselessly sacrificing black troops. He wasn't. The Civil War has been over now for almost 150 years, but apparently Perret still hasn't gotten the details on this battle. Apparently the editorial reviewers also failed to notice the sloppiness in Perret's \\"research\\"- that was left up to the Amazon costumers. The book is also superficial with nothing new except the errors. I would like to say something good about the book but nothing comes to mind, so back to \\"Cold Mountain.\\" Except for the battle scenes at the beginning, it might have been written by Perret-it's bland and boring. Whenever it got too boring a bunch of really nasty guys would ride in and rape, murder and/or torture, just for the pleasure of the viewing audience. If you liked the book you might even like the movie."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"Perret's books are frequently terrible and always atrocious. His book on Ulysses S. Grant was so bad I burned my copy. I also threw into the flames his books on MacArthur, Ike and Kennedy. This book on Lincoln is similarly bad and as always, he makes mistakes on just about every page. Never trust anything this man says or writes. His knowledge of Lincoln is extremely tiny and his writing style is something out of Jane Eyre, only worse. I'd rather eat glass than read anything Perret writes."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"I got this book cheap, fortunately, and read it before I saw the scathing reviews here and elsewhere. As I was reading I wasn't aware of the myriad alleged factual errors mentioned, but I was disturbed by the idiosyncratic writing style, an odd attempt to be \\"folksy,\\" I supposed. There were also passages which seemed abrupt and poorly edited. While the book was fairly easy to read and had some interesting things to say about Lincoln's role as military leader, I cannot recommend the book due to the apparent sloppy research and editing, and knowing there are undoubtedly much better works available. So I won't say don't read this book, but I will say don't spend any money on it!"},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"Reading Geoffrey Perret is like going out with what you think is Jessica Simpson. At first, it all looks good, even immaculate: the snazzy dresser, bright teeth, urbane wit ... and then you begin to delve into what's there ... the empty head, the superficial smile, the sense that you are being conned by yet another effort to separate you from your hard-earned money for some more Civil War fluff. And in this case, you finally discover that it's not Jessica Simpson across the table after all, but some dyed blonde wannabe who's invested a lot of money with her surgeon, dentist, and makeup staff ... as you find out when the foundation peels off and the liposuction gives way. He's a combination of Michael Caine and Hugh Grant, minus any real sparkle, charisma, or brains, and not quite as visually appealing. But if you like that sort of thing, then Perret's the man for you.Perret's ignorance about Ulysses S. Grant is known to all who are familiar with his book, in which he becomes the author who couldn't write straight (there's a double meaning to this phrase, revealed in his musings about the homoerotic appeal of John Rawlins, whom he likens to James Dean and River Phoenix). Perret's an effete fop who has personal issues to work out (he once wrote about MacArthur's &quot;member&quot; as a little crooked thing). Now he returns to the scene of his previous crime, hopeful that his smooth prose and turn of phrase will entrap those who don't know any better (although his prose fails to sustain that promise). There's nothing, nothing new here, the reviews by non-experts for LJ and PW notwithstanding. My goodness, the poor chap even botched up his description of the Kennedy assassination, although at least it was corrected in the paperback (he had the Kennedys sitting FACING the Connallys -- hello, have we seen the Zapruder film?).There are better books on Lincoln, and even T. Harry Williams did a better job in the badly dated LINCOLN AND HIS GENERALS. People who are impressed by pseudo-urbane flash (usually those with self-esteem issues) may find Perret an intriguing character, but anyone who suffered through his C-SPAN Booknotes interview knows his work is plagued by some serious problems that can not be smiled away. I imagine he thinks he's Edmund Morris or a good-looking Henry Adams, except that he's already at work on his next fatuous opus. As for this book, you'll come away aware that you've read this all before--except, of course, where it's hilariously wrongheaded--and that you've been snookered. BUYER BEWARE!"},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"I have been a staunch fan of Mr. Perret's prior works, recommending them to many readers. I have not read this work, but it makes me wonder. Does success necessarily lead to a decline in literary quality or worse? My mind immediately flys to the late Stephen Ambrose, populist historian, and the noted presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. Both were plagued by charges of plagiarism. Do the pressures of popular success lead to shoddy work. My first assumption was poor fact checking by administrative staff, or at worse, depending on their circumstances, poor proofing on the part of the author of work done by others and attributed to them. I did expert witnessing and had to evaluate technical reports that were sworn to by credentialled professionals, that in the event were actually authored by graduate students and \\"signed off\\" by the credited author. The factual errors in the reports were easily refuted at trial throwing the competence and testimony of the opposing expert into question. Back to Mr. Ambrose. I found numerous factual errors or stretching of the truth in his popular book, \\"Band of Brothers\\", to the degree that I could never read another of his books without questioning everything he wrote.I am sorry to hear the reviews of this most current work by Mr. Perret as it now calls into question his previous works, some of which I have read more than once and number as my favorite reads."},{"Title":"Lincoln's War: The Untold Story of America's Greatest President as Commander in Chief","review":"Perret's knowledge of the Civil War is woefully lacking, as anyone who has read his biography of Ulysses S. Grant knows. I expect scholars will pick this volume apart as well."},{"Title":"The Ancient World: A Social and Cultural History (5th Edition)","review":"I have used this textbook, along with the companion volume of primary source readings, in teaching a freshman level university course on the ancient world, and found both books to be excellent. _The Ancient World_ is written in a style that is accessible to college students while still preserving the complexities that by necessity characterize historical writing. In addition to covering traditional political and military history, Nagle's text includes substantive discussions of social, cultural, and intellectual history.Having read the previous reviewer's comments, I must disagree about the relative weight given to the different civilizations covered. Every textbook on the ancient world allocates more space to the Greco-Roman world than to the Ancient Near East, and for valid reasons. First, there is a far larger amount of primary source material, both literary and archaeological, on Greece and Rome, with the result very simply we know more about these cultures than about the Ancient Near East. Secondly, part of the function of an introductory history such as this is to familiarize students with the civilizations that have had an impact on our own culture, and for better or worse, more of our Western, and American, history is rooted in the Greco-Roman world than in the Near East. Including China and India in this text would make it another sort of book altogether, a *world* history rather than what it is, a history of the ancient Mediterranean world. As such, it succeeds admirably."},{"Title":"The Ancient World: A Social and Cultural History (5th Edition)","review":"Nagle provides us with an interesting and highly readable work on those \\"ancient\\" cultures from which \\"western\\" and Anglo-American civilization originated.Part One, dealing with Mesopotamia, Egypt, early Asia Minor (largely dealing with the Hittites) and the sprawling Persian Empire, sets the stage for the rise of the Greco-Roman world.Part Two deals with the early origins of the Greeks, including the Minoans and Myceneans, the conquests of Alexander and the rise of the Hellenistic period. Unfortunately, the section on classical Athens, by far the most important period in Greek history as far as it relates to the development of Western thought and philosophy is a fairly small section - although still quite enlightening and descriptive.Part Three takes us from the Etruscan period (with its important influence on Rome) through the Republican period, the Punic Wars and the fall of Carthage, the Empire, the rise of Byzantium and the \\"fall\\" of Rome.The Ancient civilizations of China, India, Kush and Axum had far less direct impact on the development of Western civilization than did Mesopotamia, Egypt, Persia or Greece and Rome; therefore, they were not included in this work. Similarly, Ancient Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations were much further back in time (3000 years passed between the time of the rise of Sumerian cities or the unification of Egypt and the reign of the first Roman Emperor while only 2000 years have pass since the reign of Augustus). Since Greece and Rome not only transferred ancient knowledge and culture but also added so much more to it, the book rightly focuses most on those two cultures.The whole is a lively and worthwhile introduction to the classical origins of modern Western culture."},{"Title":"The Ancient World: A Social and Cultural History (5th Edition)","review":"If you are taking Greek and Roman history, or any ancient history class for that matter, and your syllabus requires this book,don't get the newest edition(7th at the time of this review)unless you want to pay extra dollarsfor very limited changes.I used the 5th edition, which cost me less than 10 dollars, compared it to a classmate who had paid over 100$ for a new edition in the school bookstore, and there were no changes that i could notice, except there were different photos, and the topics were on different pages, but the information was the same.Also i was able to obtain an A in the course."},{"Title":"The Ancient World: A Social and Cultural History (5th Edition)","review":"This book is easy to read and it covers all the topics about Ancient cultures that you will ever need. I am really enjoying it."},{"Title":"The Ancient World: A Social and Cultural History (5th Edition)","review":"I'm using it as an adjunct to a classic history textbook. It provides more detail, more cultural history, more \\"personality\\" than a typical textbook. This is for AP World History course -- the book does a nice job of providing information on topics that exam cares about, such as the changing role of women. To me, the book does a nice job of walking the line between \\"a general history text of interest to an average (non-academic) reader\\" and \\"a book for a history course.\\" It's fairly fun to read while remaining comprehensive and rigorous. To be honest, I doubt many will read it just for fun, but for a required text, it's engaging.As the title correctly indicates, a good amount of the book has to do with cultural elements, such as plays, philosophy and so on. Again, I enjoy this, but if you just want to know who conquered whom when, well, stick with the textbook. I also like the heavy use of primary documents in this text.Please note that the 1-star review for this book has to do with someone who takes the Bible literally."},{"Title":"The Ancient World: A Social and Cultural History (5th Edition)","review":"I also have used this book, along with the primary source companion, in the classroom. I found these texts to work very well in an introductory setting. While this book is organized into a rough chronological order, it offers students much more than a bland re-iteration of major historical persons and events. This text provides a comprehensive look at how social, cultural, military and political institutions worked together to build and drive ancient societies. Somewhat counter-intuitively, by focusing on societal institutions rather than the &quot;Great Men of History&quot;, this work highlights how the often overlooked common folk of the ancient world (both men and women) contributed to the creation and continuation of their own societies.Another major contribution of this text is Nagle's challenge to his readers to recognize not only how modern people and societies are similar to the ancient world, but more importantly, how we are different. By pointing out these differences, Nagle encourages students to explore how our unfounded familiarity with the past has often distorted our understanding of the ancient world. I believe this is not only an important history lesson for students - but a life lesson as well.Finally, I must concur with the reviewer Brigette's explanation that the weight given to the Greco-Roman world in this book is determined by source availability as well as by the continuing impact of the Greco-Roman world on our own society today. Moreover, practically speaking, in order to maintain the tricky balance of breadth and depth, essential to any textbook, one must set parameters. It seems unreasonable to fault Nagle for choosing to focus on the relatively self-enclosed world of the Ancient Middle East, Egypt, Greece and Rome. I would recommend this book highly to anyone preparing to teach an introductory ancient history class at the college or high school level."},{"Title":"The Ancient World: A Social and Cultural History (5th Edition)","review":"My school's bookstore didn't have this and I needed it for one of my classes. As it turned out, I didn't end up using it for my class at all. The book took longer than I was expecting to arrive, around two weeks or so.

Other than that, no complaints."},{"Title":"The Ancient World: A Social and Cultural History (5th Edition)","review":"i bought this book very cheap and as used. The book was in perfect condition like new. Very happy with everything."},{"Title":"The Ancient World: A Social and Cultural History (5th Edition)","review":"This is a revision, a very expensive revision, of Nagle's earlier book on the ancient world. Finding a single book that does a decent job of discussing several civilizations is difficult and Nagle's revision does a better job than the last four versions. The book has four division: ancient Near East, Greek world, and Roman world. Saddly the book is really focused on the Greek and Roman worlds and pathetic 87 pages looks at the variety of cultures in the Near East. By the way, neither India, China, or a few other civilization about as ancient as the Near East, Greece or Rome or presented. However, what is include is well-written and decently organized, primary sources and images supplement the information well."},{"Title":"The Ancient World: A Social and Cultural History (5th Edition)","review":"After reading the excellent reviews about this book, \\"The Ancient World,\\" I was very excited to receive a copy to start reading. Unfortunately as I read the book I noticed that some dates were in conflict with each other. On one page a date was given concerning a certain matter, but then on the very next page a differnt date would be given resulting in conflicting information. This happened more than once in his book.Also when the author wrote about the historical events of the Bible the author's information is incorrect. He states that during the time of King David the Bible was first written - stating that Genesis and other books were first authored and written during King David's time. Moses is the author of the first five books of the Old Testament; he wrote those books during the time of the Exodus when he was in leadership. There are many things the author has written that are in conflict with the Old Testament of the Bible. Thus, I threw out my copy of this book since I consider it a piece of trash.If there was a time under King David that the Bible was compiled, he should not have stated that that was the first and only time the Bible was ever written. The author's Bible history is dramatically incorrect and he appears to be stating that there is no differnce between idols, false gods, and the one and only true God, Jesus Christ.My final comment, I do not believe the people who wrote the good reviews actually read the book, since how can it be that they missed such obvious mistakes?Signed,Very dissatisfied."},{"Title":"The Star Scroll","review":"I love these books.

While first book in this series was a bit slow, this book takes you back to what got you hooked on fantasy novels.The characters are developed down to the smallest detail. They almost become personal friends. You feel all the excitement, fear, anger, and happiness that they feel.The story is a typical adventure story, but Ms. Rawn has developed a way of throwing you of the predictable path with many different twists and curves to her plot. Some of which are so far off you want to start over to see if you missed something that could have predicted this event.The only real issue with this book is that it takes time to develop.

Whenever I remember that this world isn't actually real, that's the biggest shock, because Ms. Rawn just writes so well. You MUST read the entire series! She's also got out the Exiles trilogy, pick that one up too! It's just as good as this one!"},{"Title":"The Star Scroll","review":"The storyline is going well so far, set a few years after the previous novel The Dragon Prince. And while the world is vibrant in its colours and its own unique brand of magic, the frequent use of exclamation marks make the characters sound as if they're speaking like high school girls. On an average page of conversation, you will find five to six sentences spoken by adults with exclamation marks, when it's merely a remark about a son coming home, or wearing a yellow dress instead of green. It starts to grate on nerves after a while.What is even infuriating is the lack of variety amongst the characters. EVERYONE is beautiful, as if it's impossible for the residents of this world to be ugly in any way, shape or form; EVERYONE (on the good side, anyway) is wise and talented, and as for the High Princess, she is just a walking bundle of awesome who looks age twenty at age forty (which is kind of creepy, if you think about it). She is clever, wise, talented, beautiful, [insert laudatory adjective here]... and pretty much loved by everybody. And her beauty description beats you over on the head. E.t.c. In writers' world, that's called a Mary Sue, and High Princess Sioned scored a whopping 97 on Original Fiction Mary-Sue Litmus Test (which ranks as \\"Kill It Dead\\"), even without me taking the author-character identity section.It IS possible to make a female character beautiful, clever, and virtuous without making her a Sue. Unfortunately, Rawn fails utterly in this regard. Pretty much everyone around Rohan and Pol who's a female is virtuous, clever, wickedly witty, and beautiful, with the only exception being Andrade, whom everyone seems to despise most of the time. You can only read so much about \\"legs up to her ears, long fire-gold hair and dazzling green eyes\\" before you want to scream. The only redeeming lady character in the book is Andrade, and she barely shows up.Some of the scenes were absolutely amazing, so much so that it gave me ideas for MY novel, but overall, the main characters set my teeth on the edge."},{"Title":"The Star Scroll","review":"I wanted to give it three stars because for a couple hundred pages in the middle it is extremely slow. However I've read it more than once and my cover is bent. That means I genuinely liked the novel.Rohan and Sioned have to deal with the challenges of ruling together, and the intrigue and drama grips you and won't let you go.For me this was the Dragon Prince's 'happily ever after' explored as being the continuing challenges of life. Rawn weaves a rich world with great characterization and political intrigue. If you liked volume one of the Dragon Prince, buy volume two. You won't go wrong."},{"Title":"The Star Scroll","review":"I would have to say after reading Lackey's Valdemar Series I was excited about reading Melanie Rawn's Dragon Prince and Star series. The story is great with enough action to get you through the whole book. They follow a typical theme through each book. I think Melanie is up there with Raymond Feist, Harry Harrison and other great writers."},{"Title":"The Star Scroll","review":"From what I have read of Melanie Rawn's books is that she is good at developing characters and provides good plots, but takes a little too much time describing how perfect and beautiful everyone is. Not everyone can be beautiful and perfect.

Really he is one of the essential poets of the wonderful romantic era which includes Wordsworth, Shelley, Blake, Coleridge, and Keats. Why is this just about the only book of his work being published? I think you're lucky to find this one, and you can find many poems of his on the web to see yourself. Cheers"},{"Title":"John Clare Eman Poet Lib #27 (Everyman Poetry)","review":"I completely agree with the previous reviewer -- John Clare's poetry is unjustly neglected, and definitely deserves to be ranked with that of his Romantic contemporaries. More so, in fact, as Clare was the authentic voice of the country & its folk that Wordsworth aspired to himself. Perhaps it's that Clare's mental breakdown later in life & his confinement to an asylum has overshadowed the simplicity, freshness & precision of his poetry -- his life becoming the focus of attention, rather than his work.This is a pity, because Clare not only has a distinctive voice & a discerning eye, he has a deeply feeling, sensitive heart. In fact in more than one poem, he allows the countryside itself to speak, detailing both its richness & the irreparable damage men have done in their hunger to exploit it. Yet he never becomes mawkish or overly sentimental in the manner of the blatantly artificial pastoral. Born & bred in the country, he's just as aware of its harshness & petty cruelties as he is of its beauties. He describes both the homely & the fleetingly lovely.From \\"Sheep in Winter\\" -The sheep get up and make their many tracksAnd bear a load of snow upon their backsAnd gnaw the frozen turnip to the groundWith sharp quick bite and then go noising roundFrom \\"The Ragwort\\" -Ragwort thou humble flower with tattered leavesI love to see thee come and litter goldWhat time the summer binds her russet sheavesDecking rude spots in beautys marigoldThat without thee were dreary to beholdFrom \\"Hedge Sparrow\\" -In early march it into gardens straysAnd in the snug clipt box tree green and roundIt makes a nest of moss and hair and laysWhen een the snow is lurking on the groundIts eggs in number five of greenish blueBright beautiful and glossy shining shellsMuch like the firetails but of brighter hueHe captures the habits & traits of every living thing he sees, simply describing all with a clear but lyrical line. His hatred for needless cruelty towards other animals is evident in many of his poems -- as one who never quite fit in, not among his fellow country folk nor among the sophisticates of town, he often felt the sting of loneliness & quick mockery himself.This superb collection also includes excerpts from his letters & other prose writings. Editors Merryn & Raymond Williams provide the basic biography & timeline, a thoughtful appreciation of his style & work, and informative notes on individual poems. There's also a useful glossary of the now-archaic dialect words that came so naturally to Clare. I don't think you could find a better introduction to this wonderful poet, whose work has only grown in immediacy & meaning since his death.Most highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Antonov's Turboprop Twins: An-24, An-26, An-30, An-32 - Red Star Vol. 12","review":"A wealth of information about the Antonov medium range cargo/passenger turbo-prop aircraft.

She is honest, very funny and, sometimes, brutal as she recounts the life that led her to her psychiatric diagnosis, and what she did next is no short of revolutionary. I am a twenty year veteran psychotherapist and social worker, and I think this is a must read for everyone in the field and everyone considering the field. Her writing, like the poet she is, is carefully wrought to carry us along with her on this perilous journey. I can't recommend this book highly enough. This woman is the very definition of brave."},{"Title":"The Heart Too Long Suppressed: A Chronicle of Mental Illness","review":"This is a remarkable work - I don't think I've ever read anything quite like it. I was, first, impressed by Carol Hebald's raw openness and courage in writing it, and appalled as many other readers and reviewers were by the misdiagnoses and ego-driven blindness of her supposed analysts. Even more inspiring was the thread of the struggling artist running through her entire history, finally emerging in full force toward the end. But I think the real power of the work was how she captured mental illness - I hope she will accept that term - itself. It was like reading a journal of an alternate reality, a dream-life, fully detailed and explored and exposed. Her capturing in such detail and openness and honesty the lacerating pain of everything she experienced is itself a full expression of her genius, artistry, and quiet triumph as a human being. At the end I felt thankful to her for writing it, and for sharing it with us."},{"Title":"The Heart Too Long Suppressed: A Chronicle of Mental Illness","review":"For anyone who doesn't believe that it's possible for a person to overcome severe emotional problems - ones that get labeled with words like \\"schizophrenia\\" or \\"schizoaffective disorder\\" - and get off all associated psychiatric medication, this book is for you.Carol Hebald grew up in a childhood of hell: sexual abuse, emotional torture, physical violence, neglect, and abandonment, repeated and re-repeated for years. Her adulthood - into her 30s and mid-40s - became a replication of this, with the added horror of her entering the mental health system and getting treated to the triple-play of twisted (and often perverse) psychiatrists, mental hospitals, and anti-psychotic medications (and shock therapy too).Yet somehow, through it all, with almost no allies (except perhaps her own beauty, which actually seems to work mostly against her, as it induces come-ons from men and jealousy from her mother), she perseveres. She achieves success as a Broadway actress and she becomes a talented writer and college professor - all under the weight of a thousand pounds of emotional torment and the often enervating effects of her medication.I've read many \\"mental illness\\" recovery tales, and what struck me as particularly special about this one was Hebald's honesty and forthrightness, primarily about her abuse history. For this I give her the highest praises. This material - the material that laid the foundation for her multiple breakdowns and suicide attempts - is blunt, ugly, and painful, and yet she doesn't shy away from it. It gives the book a strong root in reality. So many similar books I've read gloss over the horrors of childhood trauma, mostly, I suspect, because their authors are still psychologically blocking them out (or just remain in too much pain or shame, or retain the desire to protect their abusive families). You never really understand why they had so many problems, and those big gaps weaken the book. Not here.Carol Hebald tells it like it is."},{"Title":"The Heart Too Long Suppressed: A Chronicle of Mental Illness","review":"Carol Hebald's brave and honest memoir is one of the best memoirs I have read. Her words affected me deeply on many levels, and her struggle and triumph both are a testimonial to what it means to be human. Her voice, powerful and compelling, must be heard. Her insistence on living her life honestly and with dignity, her will, and her courage are inspiring for any reader. I read the memoir in one sitting, unable to put it down, and I will recommend it to my students, to my friends, and to anyone who will listen as a work which must be read. I have also read Ms. Hebald's collection of poetry \\"Spinster by the Sea\\" which is also a testament not only to what she has to say but also to the skill and beauty with which she says it."},{"Title":"The Heart Too Long Suppressed: A Chronicle of Mental Illness","review":"I first met Carol when she gave a reading from The Heart Too Long Suppressed at our hospital, at which time I purchased her book. As a mental health professional I was especially interested in learning from a patient's perspective. I was not disappointed. In her story, Carol reaches into the depth of her being to give us an honest account of her memories and experiences. In so doing, she has given us the opportunity to follow her journey through the mental health system. It leaves us wondering, who really advocated for her? And in the end we find out, it is she. In my opinion this book should be required reading for anyone training to be a Psychiatrist, Psychologist, Counselor, Social Worker or Mental Health Nurse.Diane Boaz, R.N., Psychiatric Home Health Nurse, Allen Hospital, Waterloo, Iowa"},{"Title":"The Heart Too Long Suppressed: A Chronicle of Mental Illness","review":"Blown away by the sheer magnitude of childhood problems. But as another reader pointed out there was not a lot of oversight in those years. As long as you had parents no one was going to care if they were rapists or psychopaths. There was no one to talk to and no where to go. It is no wonder Carol was dissociative, that was actually a healthy response to the hell of her life. It is probably the tool that built her brilliant artistry as actor and later poet/writer. That other realm of being gave her access to some ray of hope, a deep understanding of the human condition, and a depth of feeling.That she survived at all is miraculous, many don't. It takes a strength and innate knowledge of your own worth to have the faith that you are worth saving, that you have a unique voice and value in the world. I also lived in 1950's and 1960's, and it was in many ways brutal towards women (we were all hysterical). The honesty of her story of abuse is also stunning. My first awareness of Carol's talent was her book 'Spinster by the Sea' I still keep picking it up and reading it every once in a while. It is not one of those books you read and then store in your bookcase for the next 20 years. It is sort of a living thing. This book is a gift that you should give yourself. A heartbreaking tale of brutality and beauty (Ying and Yang). Can't wait for the next poetry installment.Thanks Carol"},{"Title":"The Heart Too Long Suppressed: A Chronicle of Mental Illness","review":"This is a haunting, disturbing account of a woman's struggle for sanity and self-possession in the \`50's and \`60's, an era rife with invisible abuse in families and institutions alike, and perhaps especially in the all-powerful medical establishment.

I should add that I met the kind and courteous author once, when I interviewed her for my biography about Isabella Gardner, like Hebald an actress and poet with a difficult childhood.

Others from her mom to her baby-sitter to her lovers to her doctors made her feel that life is miserable. For instance, as a teen a psychiatrist acclaimed she was a sure shot suicide. A series of hospitals and a bunch of losers with psychiatrist degree provided Ms. Hebald little solace, plenty of unhelpful advice and turned her stomach into a chemical processing plant. Finally at forty-four, she decided it was time to recycle her life starting with dumping her drug paraphernalia into the ocean.Readers should understand this is not an easy memoir to follow as Carol Hebald goes deep inside her brain to her soul to explain four decades of mental illness highlighted by several suicide attempts. The author is all over the place with the influences in her life turning her autobio somewhat into a NYC rush hour train. Though it is difficult to follow her narrative, the audience will find it worth the time for anyone dealing with mental illness or a family member because overall this is a powerful condemnation warning for the buyer to beware.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Heart Too Long Suppressed: A Chronicle of Mental Illness","review":"This is a book of adolescent confusion from a borderline personality, does not have a literary value.She describes the consequences of her sexual abuse at young age but it is repetitious and pointless.

Nice to know there are good-hearted and fair people in this business."},{"Title":"Contemporary Theologians","review":"James Bacik put together this volume largely from his own academic and theological experience; the people included here represent most of the major strands of theology during much of the twentieth century. There are twenty theologians included, as follows:Hans Urs von BalthasarKarl BarthMartin BuberTeilhard de ChardinYves CongarMohandas GandhiGustavo GutierrezMartin Luther King, Jr.Hans KungBernard LonerganJohn MacquarrieJacques MaritainJohann Metz\\\\John Courtney MurrayReinhold Niebuhr\\\\Karl RahnerRosemary RuetherEdward SchillebeeckxPaul TillichAlfred North WhiteheadOne of the first things one will notice from a list like this is that there are very few women represented. Another aspect is that there are very few people who are not from the dominant white-Western culture. The enterprise of formal theology is only now breaking free from the academic enclaves of German, English and American higher education to include people outside the academy as well as people who look different from the standard, German/Germanic theologian of the nineteenth century. If this book is revised in the next decade, the balance will shift considerably.To his credit, Bacik included some atypical choices for a book on contemporary theologians. The inclusion of Martin Buber (who is Jewish), Mohandas Gandhi (a Hindu), and Alfred North Whitehead (more a philosopher than a theologian) show Bacik's willingness to stretch beyond the boundaries of typical theology. The inclusion of Martin Luther King, Jr. shows Bacik accepts that theology that is practiced is equally deserving of attention as the more theoretical, systematic sorts.The sections are designed to be read as independent units - each theologian merits a chapter, and they do not build upon each other, but rather can be used in any order the reader desires. They are arranged as groups, however, with Catholic systematic theologians, broader Catholic theologians, Protestant theologians, etc.Bacik provides a postscript looking at common features and areas of contrast. One distinction Bacik makes derives from David Tracy's classification based upon the audience of particular theologians: some address the general public, some address the academy, and others address the church. Bacik also brings in George Lindebeck's ideas from \`The Nature of Doctrine', looking at the changing models that guide theology in a post-liberal world. Bacik continues from here with short analyses of the different theologians in contexts often used in categorising and interpreting theology.Again, given the reservations of the limitations on represented voices, this nonetheless is a good guide to many theologians, readable and accessible, going into sufficient depth for a general guide, and providing suggested further readings for each theologian. It will serve the undergraduate or seminary student well, and also be helpful for interested laypersons, clergy and general readers who want a quick introduction to these several key thinkers of twentieth century theology."},{"Title":"Too Busy Not to Pray: Slowing Down to Be With God : Including Questions for Reflection and Discussion","review":"Purchased for my wife and she has not started it yet.

It is straightforward, motivating and encouraging. Inspires you to connect with God every day. We all have something always going on in our lives and we forget that we need to be still and know He is God. And even when we think we can't take time out to pray, there is always time in the check-out line at the supermarket, while we put gas in our cars, drive to and from work, while we take a shower. I think most of us think we have to be on our knees to pray. Kneeling while praying is an act of respect, love and surrender but don't let that keep you from talking to God every day throughout your day because you're never too busy not to pray.

The first time you read this book it may seen a bit boring towards the beginning, but don't be put off by this keep reading and you will find that it gets better as the pages go on. If you are like me after the first three chapters you will want to stop time to read it over and over again, but that can't be done which is a great shame. The book look at prayer from all angles and quotes short passages from the Bible, with all the meanings thoroughly explained. The book also looks at how God reacts and responds to all prayer. The book is called \`Too Busy Not To Pray' but take some time out of your busy day to sit down and read it. While you are reading it you may be very surprised what you find hidden in the pages.

Yet, despite this dependence on self, most people pray. Prayer, Hybells states, is the most intimate form of communication we have with God and is essential to receiving His prevailing power in our lives.I like that his book is biblically based. Hybells develops his arguments from the actual text of Scripture, stating that a prayer warrior is someone who is convinced that God is omnipotent and is able to intervene in the lives of his people. This book is far more pragmatic, than theological. Hybells gentle humor is a refreshing change and a wonderful tool to capture the readers attention.Like most of Hybells earlier books, it was predictable-every chapter follows the same format. One gets the impression we are reading a sermon series; but despite this one failing, it is one of the most practical book on how to develop one's prayer life I have read."},{"Title":"Too Busy Not to Pray: Slowing Down to Be With God : Including Questions for Reflection and Discussion","review":"We used this book as a short-term 6 week study in my church.

Chapter 7, entitles \\"Mountain-Moving Prayer\\" is by far my favorite chapter in the book. I walked away with an \\"Ah, that's what I've been missing in my prayer time\\" response to the chapter. The cost of $10 was worth this chapter alone in my opinion.Chapters 8-10 deal with hinderances to prayer, our impatience with prayer and burnout. Chapter 9 on \\"Prayer Busters\\" I felt I needed to spend a couple of weeks on to truely analyze and understand what actions I may be taking to degrade the process of prayer. Very convicting and very necessary chapter.Chapters 11-15 are all about listening to God. He gives some practical ways that are \\"foreign\\" to our culture. He highlights Brother Lawrence's \\"Practicing the Presence of God\\" as a resource, but Hybels is a lot more readable for the masses than Brother Lawrence.Overall:Very easy to read. I was able to read a chapter a day as a preview to when my men's group starts this book in a week or two. I really liked how in the back there are discussion questions that even if you are reading this on your own please consider thinking through the questions and answering them with some honesty.It didn't go heavily into praying scripture or claiming the name of Jesus as that was not the intent of the book. His chapters made references to scripture and had some real life examples.Pet peeve #1 of mine:I expect a \\"Christian\\" book to have pleanty of Scripture to support the points and less opinion. I felt this book had just enough to satisfy.Pet peeve #2 of mine:I also expect to have content and not filler in the form of 15 life examples per chapter. One or two examples and he moves on to the next point. Thank you Bill for keeping the meat of the content and not hiding it in filler!As an \\"intro\\" to prayer, that is what it is.

Do you think you are too busy to pray? Well, this book shows you the benefits of an active prayer life, an action plan for starting or restarting a prayer life, and also some reasons why we should pray.The author has broken the book down into 4 major sections with a few chapters each. God calls us into his presence, God invites us to talk with him, God breaks down the barriers between us, and God speaks to our hearts.The first section is all about who God is as a listener and a grantor of our prayers. The author wants us to see the character of God throughout scripture and also the reasons God wants to grant our prayers.The next section speaks of the ways in which we should pray. What sorts of things should we be praying for and why that is important to each of us. \\"God doesn't want us to pile up impressive phrases. He doesn't want us to use words without thinking about their meaning. He wants us simply to talk to him as to a friend of fatherauthentically, reverently, personally, earnestly.\\" (p. 54)The third section speaks about barriers to our prayers getting through. In the chapter on prayer busters (ch. 9), the author gets to the heart of what could be standing in the way of answered prayers. \\"For each unanswered prayer, its important to check out three possible hindrances...the request may be inappropriate...the timing may be off...there may be a problem in the life of the person who is praying.\\" (p. 100)The last section is where the rubber meets the road. This portion of the book is laid out in a practical manner and speaks to the heart of what we should do if we really want to start or in some cases restart our prayer lives.In the chapter \\"Slowing Down To Pray\\", the author speaks of our lives like that of a race car engine. For most of us our engines are revved to the maximum output. We are constantly racing off to the next event, class, bible study, or church service with never enough time to stop for prayer.He asks a very pointed question, \\"Where does the still, small voice of God fit into our hectic lives? When do we allow him to lead and guide and correct and affirm? And if this seldom happens, how can we lead truly authentic Christian lives?\\" (p. 125)What I loved about this book is that it not only enlightened me as to why we all should be praying more often, but it spoke the importance of listening (ch. 12), how to hear God's leadings (ch 13), and what to do with leadings (ch. 14)If you are a person who is wondering where we should pray, when we should pray, why we should pray, how to pray, or what to pray for then this book will be of real use to you.If you have never started your prayer life or are looking to rekindle the flames of a once fruitful prayer life, then I highly recommend you read this book.God is waiting daily to hear from you.

He doesn't use it to earn \\"brownie points\\" with God, but as a valuable means of maintaining significance so that when he is busy he knows he's accomplishing something of value, i.e., God's will.God's ways are mysterious. Hybels notes, \\"Some of the most important decisions in my life have made no sense at all from a worldly perspective.\\" He goes on the give examples of how, in following the Holy Spirit's leading, he went about what he perceived as one thing, while God brought about a different result altogether.Chapter 13 is a highlight. He discusses his method of hearing from God in prayer. Using Psalm 46:10, \\"Be still and know that I am God\\" as his theme, he describes how he activates that in his own life. He goes on to offer suggestions for people who may be wired differently. \\"Power comes out of stillness; strength comes out of solitude. Decisions that change the entire course of your life come out of the holy of holies, your times of stillness before God,\\" he adds.The ancient Greek philosophers taught that the unexamined life is not worth living.

I knew my prayer life was fizzling, largely due to the non-stop speed of my schedule, so I stuck it in my purse to read... on the go. What I really appreciated about this book is that it's not filled with pious, over-used Christian catch phrases and fluffy, vague proclamations of reverence. Hybels works within the realm of God's reality. Furthermore, while I never think God should be reduced to formulas, the practical structure Hybels suggests is so helpful in nurturing a relationship with the one who keeps Jupiter spinning. At a few points he suggests writing out prayers, which I found works extremely well for me as this is how I best express myself. I resent the fact that some may disregard the value of this book because of it's \\"simplicity.\\" I believe it is practical and to the point, something everyday people can work with. And I don't remember religious scholarship ever being a requirement to come before God, where we are only children."},{"Title":"Too Busy Not to Pray: Slowing Down to Be With God : Including Questions for Reflection and Discussion","review":"If u are a xtian, u should read this book, it explains (IMHO) in a very simple and easy to understand way to any xtian, be it long time xtian or recently converted... i could not stop reading it once i had begun..."},{"Title":"Too Busy Not to Pray: Slowing Down to Be With God : Including Questions for Reflection and Discussion","review":"informative and basic; essentials are talked about in this book."},{"Title":"Too Busy Not to Pray: Slowing Down to Be With God : Including Questions for Reflection and Discussion","review":"This book would be useful for someone who is starting a prayer group or for people who are new to (protestant) Christianity and (protestant) Christian prayer. The chapters are short and this is a quick read - good thing because people who are too busy to pray are probably too busy to read a lengthy book about prayer. Religious scholars will find this book too elementary. The language is largely simple, conversational, and accessible to a wide audience. They support their material with stories from their personal experience. It reads like a long sermon. While Hybels and Neff loosely support their material with biblical passages, they do not demonstrate how these ideas are linked to Christian tradition and liturgy."},{"Title":"Too Busy Not to Pray: Slowing Down to Be With God : Including Questions for Reflection and Discussion","review":"This is a very good book on prayers.

I was really impressed with about a quater of this guide to prayer. The rest was kinda dry/wordy."},{"Title":"Too Busy Not to Pray: Slowing Down to Be With God : Including Questions for Reflection and Discussion","review":"One good thing that can be said about books by Bill Hybels: he hits the nail on the head with how Christians are today. In Too Busy Not To Pray, he accurately points out the flaws that many Christians have today in their attitude and approach to prayer. For example, Hybels asks why do we pray &quot;Lord, be with us today&quot;, when we know from Scripture he's always with us? He suggests we pray &quot;Lord, make us aware of your presence today.&quot; This small thing has helped me focus on what I'm actually saying in prayers, helping me to eliminate the jargon and have a more authentic and focused time with God. If you are a busy person like most of us, you may not be taking the time to actually know God, to pray, to know His will, to confess specific sins, to praise Him. This book gives good solutions and reasons for making prayer a priority above everything else. Good book, good scripture references, fast read. I recommend to anyone serious about knowing the Living God. - SCF."},{"Title":"Too Busy Not to Pray: Slowing Down to Be With God : Including Questions for Reflection and Discussion","review":"This straightforward volume revolutionized my prayer life when I first read it ten years ago. I have read a number of Hybel's works, and I must say this one is the best yet. His points are simple yet profound as he makes his case for the necessity of a strong and systematic prayer life. This tenth anniversary edition reinforces and elaborates upon the truths Hybels illustrated previously.In the first portion of his book, Hybels focuses upon God and his willingness to answer prayer. He then moves to the role we play, describing various challenges and obstacles to effective, life-changing prayer. The best part of this work is the third portion, in which he emphasizes the importance of listening to God, responding to His leadings, and living in His presence.There are many books available on prayer, a large number of which I have read. I cannot think of one other single volume however, that describes the vital nature of prayer, and offers practical tools for prayer, than this book.Get it, read it, then see for yourself the difference God makes in your own prayer life!"},{"Title":"Too Busy Not to Pray: Slowing Down to Be With God : Including Questions for Reflection and Discussion","review":"13 chapters and a group of study questions to provoke thought and/or discussion leads the reader thru the author's own discoveries regarding prayer. Hybels, by his own admission, acknowledged what many of us don't: that &quot;praying on the run&quot; does not properly develop or nurture a relationship with God. In a fast-paced, super sophisticated world where we can barely escape work and a host of other stresses because of today's technology, we suffer from &quot;ultra-business&quot;. Barely having out enough time to brush our teeth or eat properly, prayer for many of us, is a &quot;back-burner activity&quot;. The discoveries Bill Hybels made can help all of us examine our own habits, and enrich our prayer life with God, such as &quot;how to slow down to pray&quot;, &quot;how to listen to God&quot; and &quot;how to overcome barriers&quot;. Readers must approach this book with honesty and a willingness to examine their own thoughts and habits. It would do all of us well to consider that even Jesus took time to slow down and be with God, alone. Jesus, tempted by all as we are, was Himself perfect, and yet found in Himself a need and desire to seek the Father's face. When His life became public, and His ministry active, many clamored for His attention. In the midst of that hectic activity, Jesus took time out to spend with the Father. In that we are imperfect, and do fall into temptation, how much more do we need to seek the Father? This eye-opening book offers insightful answers to those questions."},{"Title":"Too Busy Not to Pray: Slowing Down to Be With God : Including Questions for Reflection and Discussion","review":"This is a refreshing an honest look at an important topic from a person of sound theology, personable style and some hard won experience. He does a beautiful job of painting a scriptural portrait of the heart of God and how prayer is the lifeline to experiencing his heart.He also does a nice job in exploring the necessary components for realizing the full potential of this powerful spiritual activity. In addition to this he wrestles with some of the toughest prayer challenges like: The hurt of unanswered prayer, Prayer busters and Hearing God's leading. I felt he treated these subjects relatively well considering the immense implications of each topic. The book also includes some great questions arranged by chapter, as a means to reflect upon the aspects of prayer in your life. I am finding these particularly useful in my journaling and prayer time as I work at developing this area of my walk. A very good book on prayer...I recommend it without reservation."},{"Title":"Too Busy Not to Pray: Slowing Down to Be With God : Including Questions for Reflection and Discussion","review":"I had purchased two other prayer books: Lord, Teach Me To Pray by Kay Arthur and Releasing the Prayer Anointing by Larry Lea (both of which are excellent books), but neither was giving me what I needed.Besides knowing HOW to pray I had to WANT to pray. I just couldn't figure out why I never made time for prayer. This book has changed the way I look at prayer and how I approach prayer. I'm excited to pray instead of burdened by the thought of having to pray.The most profound idea that stands out to me in this book is the idea of reflecting upon your day. How can you grow/be delivered or even know what to pray for when you haven't taken the time to really assess where you are in your walk with God and where you want to go.If you just can't get into prayer, but you really really want to, this book it for you."},{"Title":"Too Busy Not to Pray: Slowing Down to Be With God : Including Questions for Reflection and Discussion","review":"I purchased this book in the hope of ending the unnerving silence I sometimes encounter when I don't know what to say to God. Not only did Pastor Hybels help me on this issue, but on many others as well. He asks very thought provoking questions, and answers them with honest Biblical truth. What does it take to have a quiet time with God every day? How do you listen to God effectively? How do you know if a spiritial leading is from the Lord or someting, or someone, else? God has unending ways of reaching us, and through Hybel's own experiences we see some of the Lord's methods. I particulary liked the study guide at the end of the book. Each chapter has anywhere from 8 to 10 questions challenging you to think back on your prayer life and ahead to finding a more enjoyable and sincere relationship with God. I'm looking forward to reading my notes in a few years and seeing how far I have come in my journey with Christ. Bill Hybel's book should be on any person's shelf who is yearning for a solid prayer life with God each and every day."},{"Title":"Too Busy Not to Pray: Slowing Down to Be With God : Including Questions for Reflection and Discussion","review":"This is a great book because Bill Hybels doesn't just tell you how to pray but gives you pointers on how to design a pray journal and quiet time that will work for you. If you want a prayer plan to discipline you in your prayer life pick this book up. A Great Read."},{"Title":"Too Busy Not to Pray: Slowing Down to Be With God : Including Questions for Reflection and Discussion","review":"Bill Hybels does a wonderful job showing the Christian that it is impossible to live the Christian life if you do not have a consistent, real prayer life. Bill talks about how he read 14 or 15 books on prayer and then he did the most amazing thing He began to pray and it changed his life in a dramatic way. Prayerlessness is a major sin in the body of Christ, this book goes along way in helping believers overcome this sin. Bill truly is a church Father who imparts such a fire into the body of Christ through this book. The only book that comes close to this on prayer is Alice Smiths book &quot;Beyond the Veil&quot;. This is a must read for every Christian who is looking for authentic Christianity. I cannot recomend this book any more highly. You will not be dissappointed."},{"Title":"Too Busy Not to Pray: Slowing Down to Be With God : Including Questions for Reflection and Discussion","review":"Bill Hybels takes a hard look at prayer in this book. He is straight forward about spending time with God. He stresses making a regular habit of prayer and &quot;custom&quot; designing a time with God that it just for you. This book opened my eyes to my own spiritual life and relationship with God. &quot;It's amazing how many coincidences occur when we pray.&quot;"},{"Title":"Too Busy Not to Pray: Slowing Down to Be With God : Including Questions for Reflection and Discussion","review":"One thing I have agreed with the other reviews on, is that this book is a quick easy reading book. I have really enjoyed reading this. Hybels has a way of bringing things down to a level of simplicity that everyone can understand. The last few chapters of the book have been the best to me. In them he talks about what might I be doing to mess up the prayer process. What sins have I not confessed, what extra noise is going on in my life to make it harder to hear Gods voice. THe book is not super deep, but is practical."},{"Title":"Too Busy Not to Pray: Slowing Down to Be With God : Including Questions for Reflection and Discussion","review":"\\"Too Busy Not to Pray\\" is an excellent challenge by Bill Hybels to Christians everywhere to take time out of their busy lives to commune more with the Lord who loves us enough to want to spend time with us.The book is around 150 pages and has 13 chapters with the following titles:1. The Adventure of Prayer2. God Is Willing3. God Is Able4. How to Pray Authentically5. A Pattern For Prayer6. Mountain-Moving Prayer7. The Mystery of Unanswered Prayer8. Prayer Busters9. Slowing Down to Pray10. The Importance of Listening11. How to Hear God's Leadings12. What to Do With Leadings13.

Moreover, it is one of the very few books that places voluntary simplicity in a wider social and political framework. To change only ourselves does not suffice; we also need to help change the culture we breathe.The book's chapters focus on twelve major aspects of VS, including our focus on stuff instead of on non-material things that would bring us far more joy; our difficult relationship with money and how much we actually make per hour (a la &quot;Your Money or Your Life&quot;); how we can increase the time we have available to pursue our passions; the importance of community; the role of spirituality; the joys of passionate work; the importance of keeping our nest, the Earth, clean and healthy for future generations... and more.Pierce included an inspiring quotation on every page (by itself a wonderful read!). Her statements are supported with careful research and citations, and she provides extensive lists of updated further resources, in print and on the web. Hers is quite an impressive accomplishment, to offer this depth of scholarship expressed in a writing style that is so clear and easily comprehensible.&quot;Simplicity Lessons&quot; was written to be used as a workbook -- there are intelligent, useful, and challenging assignments after each of the twelve lessons. Whether you go through the book by yourself or, even better, with a Simplicity Circle (consisting of 8-12 adults who support each other), you'll find it a wonderful resource. If anyone wants to study this book with me in the Washington DC area, please feel free to contact me at &lt;LRR@mindspring.com&gt;. I'd gladly read the book again within a circle."},{"Title":"Simplicity Lessons: A 12-Step Guide to Living Simply","review":"I am both happy and not happy with this book. I purchased it hoping to find different ways to simplify my life. I found that I am already doing many of the suggestions and have already evaluated much of my life in the ways that the author suggested. This provided me with positive reinforcement that I am hopefully on a good path.I think this would be a good book for someone just starting to evaluate their life or looking for a new approach.I don't like the way the author seems critical of many choices people make in their lives and find many of her suggestions to be of no value to me and my life. I try to be friendly to the Earth and its inhabitants. I buy locally, recycle everthing possible, and generally try to be as respectful and mindful of my place and purpose in life.It is neither practical nor feasable for me to sell my house and move to a pedestrian friendly city so I don't need to own a car or can share one with a neighbor.I make no apologizes that I drive a SUV. My life more than occasionally requires this vehicle making renting one when I needed one financially stupid. If I didn't live in an area that was snow covered several months of the year perhaps I could ride a Vespa or have a \\"commuting car.\\" However how is having more than one vehicle simplifying my life? If I didn't have co-workers perhaps bicycling to work would be possible. I can neither shower at the office I work at nor am I willing to carry a full change of clothing to put on after I arrive.I am not going to opt out of health insurance on the hopes that I won't need it. Of course I hope I won't need it but I am not going to bet my finaicial future on it. My job may make me crazy but I can't see how its worse than perhaps incurring a huge medical bill and losing my home.I value old friendships and keep a place in my life for those people who may not share my feelings on many issues. The value of a 27 year friendship far outweighs our political or social differences. Is it simplier to discard people who \\"complicate\\" my life or to find a way to fit them in?In the end its all about the choices you make. Ms. Pierce does a good job of showing you do have control in ways you might not have considered. Just because I don't agree with some of her conclusions doesn't mean she is wrong in asking the questions."},{"Title":"Simplicity Lessons: A 12-Step Guide to Living Simply","review":"In a country that overspends, overworks, over accumulates, and wastes precious resources, it is refreshing to read Simplicity Lessons. Not only does this book address the issues on a philosophical level but it has many practical ideas on how to enhance your life by following many of her options. If you are looking for more passion and spirituality in your life, quality of time and relationships, ways to connect to community and nature, this book will show you how to accomplish it. Linda Breen Pierce doesn't preach but rather invokes ideas with a variety of solutions. I particularly liked her ideas on organizing study groups and providing worksheets to help make change. There is no question that the quality of your work-life will improve if you follow a few of her practical suggestions."},{"Title":"Simplicity Lessons: A 12-Step Guide to Living Simply","review":"Great workbook and should be used with a group of people if possible.Makes you think about living more fully, enjoyably, and calmly in this hectic have to have everything world."},{"Title":"Simplicity Lessons: A 12-Step Guide to Living Simply","review":"Voluntary simplicity has some features to it that would benefit most people in the United States, and that I am actively trying to incorporate into my own life. These include less consumerism/materialism, financial \\"modesty\\" (for lack of a better term), less cluttered living, etc. When we speak of the priorities, however, we must not forget the \\"voluntary\\" aspect.I can sum up my problem with this book with a single quote from page 170, \\"Simplicity is not about imposing beliefs on others or judging their actions... except, of course, by enacting and enforcing laws that mandate...\\" Throughout the book, every topic ends up with a discussion of how to tax, fine, or otherwise manipulate and coerce people into adopting the practices that the author believes would be best for them.This sanctimonious, condescending attitude was so offensive that I found it difficult to draw anything positive from the book."},{"Title":"Simplicity Lessons: A 12-Step Guide to Living Simply","review":"Linda has done a good job with this book. It offers clear, accessible advice on how to simplify your life and live it more deliberately. She has drawn from a range of works and her own experience. Her voice is more confident than in her first book, which is to be expected.I found the book helpful."},{"Title":"Simplicity Lessons: A 12-Step Guide to Living Simply","review":"The title of this book should be \\"Proclamations of an Environmentalist Evangelist\\".While I am all in favor of Voluntary Simplicity and in being easy on the environment, I found very little useful information in this book. The author declares in the housing section that we should all agree on an amount of square footage per person as acceptable for our housing needs. She gives the example of 500 square feet per person with enough room for hobbies. Those who choose to live in more square footage will be punished for being a pox on the environment by paying huge taxes. I question this philosophy as someone would have to decide that 500 square feet is an appropriate amount for each individual and I'm guessing that would be the government. If you live in a 1600 square foot house with your spouse and two children you would be within the acceptable range. However, once your children grow up and move out, then you would be in violation and be heavily taxed as punishment for your misuse of environmental resources. Of course, you could always move, but then you would have to use EVEN MORE environmental resources to adjust your living space to meet the requirements and not be taxed. This is only one example of the ideas in this book designed to 'simplify your life' that really dictate how you should be living according to the author's vewpoint. Don't waste your money on this book if you are looking to simplify your life. Check out Elaine St. James' books and read Don Aslett's \\"Clutter's Last Stand\\". You'll get helpful information without being made to feel guilty for having the nerve to be a human living in America. This is the viewpoint of a former Professional Organizer who values freedom and being able to decide what is an appropriate lifestyle for myself and my family."},{"Title":"Simplicity Lessons: A 12-Step Guide to Living Simply","review":"This was a gift on a Amazon Wish List so I know very little about it except the receiver was very happy to receive it."},{"Title":"Simplicity Lessons: A 12-Step Guide to Living Simply","review":"Linda has done an outstanding job putting this book together.

Shipping was very quick."},{"Title":"The Wilderness Walk","review":"This is an intriguing book, which worked magnificently as a Georgian murder mystery. I cannot say too much about this book without creating a lot of spoilers. But the book does not begin conventionally. The heroine is, we think, the wife of a well-to-do London solicitor, the daughter of a ruined City banker. She dreads returning to her summer home of her childhood, for fear of meeting a man who jilted her after hearing that she had lost her dowry. But the heroine is not this lady, but her younger unmarried and dowryless sister. And the hero is - well, slightly unusual.You will certainly be led up the garden path, or the wilderness walk (a theme in the mystery). The only straight-forward people in this book are the young Marquess (whose intentions are transparent if naive), the brother-in-law of the heroine, and a few other people. Everyone in this novel has secrets to keep, some for better reasons than others. And at least one person must change considerably in this novel to win the approval of others.The problem I had was that the book was really short. It ended before all the characters had been fully fleshed out, and before I had time to believe in the essential decency of the hero or the romance between the hero and heroine. While the motivations for keeping secrets made perfect sense, the whole plot seemed a little rushed (as far as the romance went).Read this book as a mystery with a romance thrown in, not as a romance. As a romance, I must rate it 3.5 (with reluctance), but as a mystery, I would have to rate it far higher (about 4.7). The average rating is about 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Wilderness Walk","review":"Sheila Bishop opens The Wilderness Walk with a picture of Caroline Prior living with her married sister after their father's bank has collapsed.

Some characters and situations remain underdeveloped, which is a negative since I enjoy Sheila Bishop's ability to create realistic people and relationships for its own sake.

Our heroine quickly discovers that it is much more satisfying to help her suffering family (they lost their money, parents are in poor health, younger siblings need her to caretake) than to pursue the elevated social life into which she has been invited, thanks to a wealthy college friend. Enter our struggling hero, who as good as becomes one of the family. The hero and family members are appealing, and one wants to see them succeed. The heroine is beautiful, tired, and works all the time at home and the office--not much warmth or dimension. It's rather exhausting to read about her. A persistent, wealthy suiter, who provides some lightness in her life, leaves the heroine on the fence for awhile. One part of the plot is somewhat racy for GLH and the time in which it was written. Both main characters come to know God in the course of the story. So, this is a good family story, with romance, humor, suspense, spiritual content, and a plot twist. In the end, the moral is that by giving up selfish pursuits in place of duty, one in fact gains everything. It's also a love story that takes its time, with the hero and heroine getting to know each other as good friends long before there is any romance between them."},{"Title":"Happiness Hill","review":"This was my favorite book through my teen years. I know, it's outdated and a little corny, but when you consider it was written in the 30's, you have to give Grace Livingston Hill credit.

I give Grace Livingston Hill all the credit for my love of English and History, and she probably deserves some credit for my happy marriage as well - because she instilled (deep in my subconscious mind) the importance of family and friendship, and not just romance.

Some people say the book is schitzophrenic, having been started in Mexico City in 1956 and completed around 1962. However, I believe the result is not two books but half of the book being thoughts and feelings and the other half being a thoughtful man reflecting. In any case, the book is wonderful, and reading the entire novel does take some work but well worth the effort!"},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"Desolation Angels is by far my favorite Keruoac book. I own eight other Keruoac books, and this was one of the quickest reads, most emotional, spriritual, honest books you'll ever have a chance of experiencing.

I did not get the same amount of excitement from it as I did from On The Road. It was a satisfying read, but he did better."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"Perfect, absolutly perfect. Just like Dharma Bums, I had to take my time reading this book because every WORD is so important. Kerouac is a god."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"There are usually two types of Kerouac readers. There are the \\"On the Roaders\\", as I call them. The ones that enjoy his style, his way of placing his friends' lives into the context of their own troubles, their loneliness their love-- all the while with a literary pace likened to a old pickup speeding across the straightaways of the vacant Montana backroads. And then there are the others, who like the former, enjoy the style-- but they also look for the sadness in Kerouac's writing. His ability to deconstruct people with one look (in Desolation Angels he watches a waitress in a bar and tells her entire life story in snapshot events that underlie the sad look in her eyes), to find the hidden sentiments in people's actions-- whether he's right or wrong we really don't care.Desolation Angels is the book for the second group of people. It is tortuous at times-- like his solitude atop the mountain staring Hozomeen in the face every morning which reveals Kerouac's own struggle to deal with himself and his past. But I believe among all of his novels it is the most rewarding. The book takes us to all of his major haunts- London, New York, San Fran, Paris, the Mediterranean- with many of his closest friends - Neal, Allen, Williams S. Burroughs, Joyce. There's even a small part where Kerouac is face to face with Salvador Dali.If you are looking for Kerouac-the-humanist at his best- this is the novel for you. Where the novel lacks in adventure (On the Road) and joyous affirmation (Dharma Bums) it makes up in sheer descriptive character study and sad observation, of a man trying to grapple with what he sees as the emptiness of all things, and the reality of his own personal struggles with life, love, and death."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"This book may come as a real shock to those whom have a preconcieved notion about what the \\"Beats\\" were all about, and it may also be a shock for those more familiar with the jubilant ecstatic life affirmations of On The Road or even The Dharma Bums.In this book Jack goes on the road (with Mom), has sex with a fourteen year old mexican prostitute, meets up with a Neal (Cody) whom is a far fly from his On the Road days and is tied down with a wife + three kids and a job, meets Salidore Dali + William Carlos WIlliams + Carl Sandburg, gets his book published, is constantly compulsively depressed, has a paradigmatic consciousness flip after a huge dose of opium, meets up with junkie Burroughs in Tangiers (whom is lovelorn over Ginsburg), and kicks Buddhism down a notch for a more hardcore return to Christianity.As others have noted, this book follows directly after the Dharma Bums and that book should be read first. What follows is Jack's experiences on the mountain which, contrary to his expectations in Dharma Bums, is almost like a nightmare prison sentence.After he leaves the mountain, we enter into the first half of the book (his return to California), which is a bit ponderous and slow (but never boring). We are treated to a tortureous description of his day of betting at a race track with Neal and Corso.The book picks up speed bigtime when he goes back on the road and then travels internationally.His prose is brilliant and poetic and his observations remarkable and I think this book is brilliant; but it is also tremendously sad, deeply frusterated and lost, spiritually drained and destitute, and there is little ecstacy to be had. By the end of the book, and with the return of his compulsive obsession with Christianity, one can really sense the beginning of his psychosis and alcoholism and mommy obsession which would spell his death by age fourty seven.I'm not sure to whom this book should be recommended- for I'm not sure whom would care about this descent of an icon for joy. It should definetly be read by those whom have read On the Road and the Dharma Bums, but also by those whom think that the counter cultural movements were all done by joy seeking thrill addicts without a care in the world. After reading this book, it would seem that caring is something that was not is short supply amongst these bands of fellow travelers on the way.Also, those whom felt that the beats were all leftist radicals, anarchists and communists would be very suprised to read in this book that Jack almost seems like a rightist in many regards. He reads a book on the atrocities of communism on the mountain, he constantly is remarking about totalitarian regimes (in particular- Russia), brings up Mao (at a time when some on the left felt he may have been a hero and the crimes against \\"reactionaries\\" hadn't yet come into light) and Castro (while others went off to visit Cuba jack said \\"I'm not concerned with the Cuban Revolution, I'm concerned with the American Revolution.\\") and even Zapata is discussed in negative diatribes. He was also a fan of Ike. He spends far more time bitching about leftist than he does about rightists. He also has some special scorn put aside for the common hipster, the mass of \\"beats\\" whom came after.Very moving, sad, beautiful, profound, funny, poetic- a treasure from a real man at the start of his turn into a caricature by the mass media. By the end, when he drags his mother to california and he doesn't have hardly a nickel, he truely does seem like a little boy lost, crushed still by the death of his brother Gerard and his father whom he found, crushed by all the love lost, by all the dreams evaporated.Evey place he goes, he believes that happiness may lie at the next stop- but once he gets there, there is only sadness once again. At first he wants to return to the mountain on which he'd felt so trapped, but by the end of the book, he just wants to return to the womb."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"Wonderful novel by Jack Kerouac. We sense his deep loneliness and reevaluation of his life during his 63-day stay atop Desolation Peak in Mt. Baker National Forest in Washington State. Once down from the mountain, he sees how much life has changed once his novel &quot;On the Road&quot; is published. For those of you who loved &quot;On the Road,&quot; &quot;Desolation Angels&quot; is a book you definitely must read--it's by far Kerouac's best and most personal novel."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"Somewhere in the 409 pages of this book you'll find buried a truly great work of American literature. It is hard to fault Kerouac for his devotion to spontaneous and unedited writing; though these methods imposed limitations on what he could accomplish as a writer, they also contributed to what makes his books so fascinating. If Jack had lived in Hemingway's time, he would have submitted Desolation Angels to the publisher and would have been handed back a 300 page masterpiece.The most problematic section is the first one, \\"Desolation in Solitude.\\" I understand that Kerouac wanted to convey the sheer insanity of his isolation as a lookout, but considering that he already devoted about 30 pages to this in Dharma Bums, he essentially retreads the same mystic nonsense for another 70 pages without giving much new insight into his experience. The one interesting bit that comes out of the whole ordeal is the gradual dissatisfaction that Kerouac feels for Buddhism (which, through his interpretation, seems to fall a bit close to nihilism) and his reacceptance of Christianity.But after this first section, things pick up and Kerouac delivers one painfully sad and and transcendentally beautiful insight after another (one of my favorites: his frustration at receiving a $3 jaywalking ticket on the way to a job, costing him half his day's pay-- but you have to read the way he puts it to understand, of couse). It is worth noting that Desolation Angels really is two different books written almost 5 years apart. The first half he wrote while in Mexico City (during events he describes in the second half, Passing Through), while the second half was written in Florida (I think) while he lived with his mother. Thus, Kerouac's interpretation of life radically shifts when you begin the 2nd half. He also suddenly becomes a lot more candid, talking about his life as a writer, his use of drugs, and the homosexuality of his peers in a lot more detail and honesty than he could manage before. It is also important to understand that \\"Desolation Angels\\" (part 1) was written BEFORE On the Road was published, while \\"Passing Through\\" (part 2) was written AFTER. His sudden brush with fame can probably account for this shift in perspective.I don't want to go into too much detail about the multitude of spiritual revelations within the book, as its better to hear it out of the mouth of the mystic. Reading the book, one can't help but notice that Kerouac, even when past his literary and spiritual peak, was not the embittered and impotent wreck that he's usually considered-- not based on his touching insights in \\"Passing Through.\\" He clearly has a lot of faith in humanity, and of the necessity that people act out of love and respect rather than hate and fear. Many critics quickly dismiss Desolation Angels as a \\"lesser work,\\" but I think that if you're willing the persist through the dense opening section, the rewards are nearly as profound as those of his more famous novels."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"This book has been described as the journal of Jack losing himself. Some critics state that when he came back down from his time of solitude on Desolation Mountain begins his spiral downward into madness, alcoholism and loss of artistic edge. I disagree - but it is most certainly a showing of a break in his persona - as he describes the beauty and horror of having nothing to do but face one's self when that's all one has. The lies you tell yourself are strong, but give way when you have no one else to reinforce them for months on end...and this may have indeed driven Jack to the edge and beyond.The pre-eminent voice of the Beat movement, who both gave it its name and disavowed his involvement, is at his most exposed and honest self in this work. This is not a book to read for a relaxing afternoon, in my opinion. This is a book that will burden you - but you'll be better for it."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"Jack Kerouac's 'Desolation Angels', written about a period of his life roughly 10 years before his death, acts as a nice bridge between 'On The Road' (which was awaiting publication during the course of events described in \\"Angels\\") and a subsequent publication, Big Sur, both of which I've read.During his two month self-imposed exile to work as a fire ranger on Desolation Peak, Jack Kerouac was forced to confront many of his pre-existing or emerging demons. The location for this period of his life is especially apropos for the 'desolation' surrounding Kerouac, much of which was self-created, as he sank further into depression and alcoholism.The book covers more of his life than just the two months on Desolation Peak, but as Jack re-emerges into society, you get the sense that this 'loner' was only comfortable being 'alone' amongst others...that while he could see, smell, and wander amongst others, and feel tolerably 'isolated'...he could not stand the true isolation he could achieve, to remove himself from society altogether.Jack wanders from the American Northwest to Florida, to Mexico, to Tangiers, to California with his mother in tow, and eventually back to Florida, when his mother grows further depressed with their cross-country move after only a month.Many players from Kerouac's former novels appear in this one as well, albeit with different names...the poet 'Gregory Corso,' to whom Kerouac lost 'Mardou Fox' in \\"Subterraneans\\" is called 'Raphael Urso' in \\"Angels\\"...'Dean Moriarty,' from \\"On The Road\\" is 'Cody' in this incarnation.Kerouac's detachment from the Beat Generation, his status as their reigning 'king', his fame, and his Buddhist beliefs all come into focus during this novel, one of his finest, in my opinion. If you rode shotgun with Kerouac for On The Road, explore his life further, and you will uncover far more about this dark, troubled, but fascinating author."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"I have been reading Kerouac for about twenty years (but still haven't exhausted the canon). After reading Desolation Angels I think it might still be a while.You have got to love Kerouac to get through much of this book (and I do) and it is ultimately worth the effort, but what an effort! Too much of this book is &quot;we did this, then we did that&quot; and Kerouac's lack of contextualizing all this can get to you.But there are always small epiphanies that make Kerouac worth reading. There are about six in this book, the best being his brief account of his sea voyage to Tangiers on a Yugoslav freighter in a storm. &quot;It scares a seaman to hear the Kitchen scream in fear.&quot; And Kerouac's lamentation on the unfortunate popularization of the 'cool' ethos: &quot;But all I could do was sit on the edge of the bed in despair listening to their awful 'likes' and 'like you know' and 'wow crazy'...All this was about to sprout out all over America even down to High School level and be attributed in part to my doing!&quot;Much of what makes Kerouac one of the American Big Three is that nobody else could get away with writing like this. It ain't pretty and it's often exasperating, but what a Great Soul."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"Let me tell you a story. I had just come down toSan Francisco after a couple of years of bummingaround the Great Northwest. It was a Monday morningand I had picked up a newspaper; bound and determinedto scour the want ads until I found prospects for anhonest job, with the full intention of becoming morerespectful. I went to a cafe in North Beach and had aseat at one of the outdoor tables. As I began to unfoldthe newspaper, I noticed that someone had left a copyof &quot;Desolation Angels&quot; on the chair. I picked it up andstarted to read it. Several hours later I abandoned myfaint tries at redemption and walked over to WashingtonSquare to work on some poetry. The man can flat out write.That's why they call him the King of the Beats."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"I disagree with the 5-star consensus of the previous reviewers - Kerouac's writing is not 'faultless prose', as he characterizes it himself in this novel. But 'Desolation Angels' is another fascinating glimpse into the heart of this daring and nomadic - literally and spiritually - author. One star gets shaved from my review for the unfocused, enigmatic opening section of the book, 'Desolation in Solitude'. A rethinking of 'Alone on a Mountaintop' from 'Lonesome Traveler', this section only thickens the fog in both the reader and in the author, it seems. It's not that it rambles - all Kerouac's writing does, and to point it out as a flaw is like insisting that Bob Dylan's voice sucks. Of course it does, that's the point. But Kerouac characterized the Desolation Peak experience before and did it better in 'Lonesome Traveler'.However, once Kerouac makes his descent and rejoins the world in the second half of Book One and through all of Book Two, the way that his mountaintop experience informs his perspective in places like New York, Mexico, and Europe is engrossing and surpisingly intelligent. Drawing from a wide variety of influences from St. Paul to Buddha to Hemingway, Kerouac revisits familiar places and people with a broadened and more cynical point of view. Desolation Angels is more candid, forthright, even explicit, than its predecessors about drug use and sex. But it also reveals a more exhaustive spiritual hunger in Kerouac, and leads the reader to conclude that the author, in his quest to meet God, realized he had indeed found Him.By turns a thoughtful, pensive, funny and risk-taking novel, Desolation Angels is canonical Kerouac."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"it oozes oh so slow and when it is on it is on. sometimes i have trouble with kerouac as he makes references to things that leave me scratching my head. every so often in this book i would turn back a few pages to see if i remembered what i read. i think 60% of the time i didn't. like the slow reading however, i know these pages have oozed into my subconscious. these concepts may take a few years to be fully realized.welcome to the wonderfull world of jack kerouac outside of \\"on the road\\". do i love it? i'm not sure, that's why i didn't give \\"desolation angels\\" five stars. is he passionate? no doubt. is this book well-written? not even a question.but this is kerouac to me. it's about patience and reward. this is not a fast read. in fact at times, i'll read four pages and feel exhausted. did i expect a quick read when i bought it? hell no.bottom line: was it an enjoyable read? some parts yes, some parts no. but this begs the question, is it supposed to be enjoyable? i'd say same answer. definitely thick on the emotion so in that sense, I hold it in high regard. one part of the book i was singing the prose aloud. strange, isn't it?:o)"},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"If you've read On the Road, then this is a must read.

The very mention of his great cool name that just rolls off the tongue will, at a mere mention generate the most passionate explanation from any book lover, historian, critic, or a \\"lost,\\" unenlightened victim of an educational system plagued by the three letters which spell Satan; GOP.This book was written in 1965 while the Beat Generation was minglling with the hippies and Kerouac had distanced himself from his friends Allen Ginsberg and Neal Cassady, sadly.It's more like a diary of Kerouac's most deep thoughts while he lives by Desolation peak and in that case, it's like the Walden of the twentieth century.

Kerouac had a short relationship with Weaver in 1956 followed by a longer relationship with Johnson. In \\"Desolation Angels\\", Kerouac describes his relationship with these women from his own perspective. There is much more to the book.\\"Desolation Angels\\" is the most literally autobiographical of Kerouac's novels, with the author frequently only slightly changing the names of his friends and supporting characters. The book covers about one year in Kerouac's life, from the summer, 1956, to late 1957, just before the New York Times published a favorable review of \\"On the Road\\" which took Kerouac from obscurity to fame. The book is in two large sections (called \\"books\\") written at different times and in different styles. Kerouac wrote book one titled \\"Desolation Angels\\" in 1956-1957 shortly after the events it describes. The book is written in the spontaneous, associative stream-of-consciousness style that characterizes Kerouac's best-known work. It was rejected for publication in 1957.In 1961, when Kerouac was in the middle of a long decline, he wrote the second book of what became \\"Desolation Angels\\", titled \\"Passing Through\\" while living in Mexico. Kerouac's writing in this second book, which includes his relationships with Weaver and Glassman, is more narrative and straighforward in character than in the first book. Kerouac thought of publishing each part as separate works but decided to combine the two together. The result is \\"Desolation Angels\\" first published in 1965. The current edition of the book, which dates from 1995, begins with a valuable introduction by Joyce Johnson.The book is long, rambling, and autobiographical. It lacks a formal plot. The book is held together by themes stated in the opening section \\"Desolation in Solitude\\" and developed throughout the book. In the summer of 1956, following the events recounted in his novel \\"The Dharma Bums\\"The Dharma Bums, Kerouac worked for two months isolated on Desolation Peak in western Washington in a fire tower. He thought he would be able to use this period of isolation for meditation and gaining control of his life. He soon found himself, however, missing friends, companionship and every day activity. Kerouac reflects on his surroundings, on his family, and on his earlier life in short, stream-of-conscious sections before he comes down from the mountain to rejoin the world. A sense of religious and philosophical meditation, which includes a great deal of Buddhism, also pervades Kerouac's discussion of his time on Desolation Peak and the novel as a whole.The section of the book describing Kerouac's experiences and thoughts on Desolation Peak is overall the strongest in the novel. The remainder of book one describes Kerouac's descent from the mountain and hitchhiking through Portland to San Francisco. He spends a riotous week with his friends in the middle of the San Francisco Poetry renaissance, but the best scenes are of Kerouac and his friends having fun and walking the streets. Neal Cassady, Allen Ginsburg, and Gregory Corso, with slightly changed names, play important roles. The sense of disatsifaction and the need to move on, whether alone on Desolation Peak or with friends, is critical to Kerouac. Unhappy in San Francisco, he sets off for Mexico.The aptly titled \\"Passing Through\\", book two of the work, describes Kerouac's continued restlessnes, spiritual questioning, and dizzying journeys to Mexico, New York City, Tangiers, France, back to New York, California, and New York again. When he wrote \\"Passing Through\\" in 1961, Kerouac was famous but in decline. He was seriously troubled by the faddish attention given to the so-called \\"Beat Movement\\" which he had not intended to create. In \\"Passing Through\\", \\"On the Road\\" is accepted for publication, but relatively little is made of this. In many places, Kerouac addresses his readers directly and intimately. Thus, early in book two he cautions his readers:\\"And also dont think of me as a simple character-- A lecher, a ship-jumper, a loafer, a conner of older women, even of queers, an idiot, nay a drunken baby Indian when drinking--- Got socked everywhere and never socked back (except when young tough football player)-- In fact, I don't even know what I was-- Some kind of fevered being different as a snowflake....In any case, a wondrous mess of contradictions (good enough, said Whitman) but morefit for the Holy Russia of the 19th Century than for this modern America of crew cuts and sullen faces in Pontiacs--\\".The scenes in Mexico City, with Bill Burroughs in Tangiers, and particularly with his mother in a long, disastrous trip to California are as good as the scenes with Weaver and Johnson.This book captures a great deal of Kerouac and his contradictions. It shows a man who loved and tried to savor the common experiences of life, his friends, lovers, and food, and yet suffered from an inner loneliness and restlessness. Wherever he was, Kerouac felt he had to be somewhere else. Alcoholism and drugs and wandering inexorably took their toll. The story is told in \\"Desolation Angels\\" with strong religious overtones. The spirituality in this book is complex and unsystematized. It includes Buddhism, Catholicism and simple living in the here and now but does not reduce to any formula. I found the spiritual quest theme of this book challenging and moving.\\"Desolation Angels\\" is a difficult mixed book, with eloquent writing mixed with portions that are less successful. The work gradually won me over as a read into it. This book will be of greatest interest to readers with a strong passion for Kerouac who have read, for example, \\"On the Road\\", \\"The Dharma Bums\\" and \\"Tristessa\\". These three novels are all available in the Library of America's excellent volume of Kerouac's novels.Jack Kerouac: Road Novels 1957-1960: On the Road / The Dharma Bums / The Subterraneans / Tristessa / Lonesome Traveler / Journal Selections (Library of America)Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"This is the one novel by Jack that scares the S**t out of me.

I think this novel brings him full circle in a quest for spirituality (or confrontation with it). All his novels I have read (count 'em on one hand) and his poetry are excellent.

Though Kerouac is \\"depressed\\" through most of the book, sickened by the people and places and travel which he once found so necessary, he finds mental respite in his mother and her unconditionally warm spirit, among other things. Another point which Kerouac strives to raise is religion. Though he and his friends more oft than not live a wild and consumptive life, Jack still remains devoted to the idea of God and the genuine goodness of people.

When I learned Jack Kerouac spent sixty-five days manning the peak's fire lookout in 1956 and wrote about his experiences there, I wanted to read them. Desolation Angels is Kerouac's account of his time in the rugged North Cascades, but I found the book to be much, much more than that.For the reader who expects to read about fire lookout culture, routines, and working for the U.S. Forest Service, as I did, Desolation Angels is a letdown. Of the six chapters in the two section format, only the first couple address Kerouac's impressions and experiences of his time on Desolation Peak and the North Cascades Wilderness. Although the \\"Beat\\" author stated the motive for his remote summer employment was to have a \\"spiritual\\" adventure--come down from the mountain an enlightened man--he intended to be paid for his time and to use this pay to fund further adventures in the country and abroad. Aside from Kerouac's frequent stare-downs with Mt. Hozomeen, participation in shortwave chatter, and a night spent recording lightning strikes, most of \\"Desolation in Solitude\\" is a lament about how he yearns to \\"...go where there's lamps and telephones, and rumpled couches with women on them, where there're rich thick rugs for toes, where the drama rages all unthinking for after all would That-Which-Passes--Through-Everything ask for one or the other?--What'm I gonna do with snow...?\\" The second chapter, \\"Desolation in the World,\\" shares his return to the world from the wilderness. Once off the mountain, Kerouac sets out to travel and seek those adventures he fantasized about during his sixty-five days on Desolation Peak: first to San Francisco, then Mexico City, off to New York, and finally abroad to Tangiers, Paris, and London.Much of the book is written in typical Kerouac stream of consciousness style--as if James Joyce had converted to Buddhism. His mystic, frenetic musings leave the reader breathless and puzzled at times, but in the midst of these bursts of \\"enlightenment,\\" Kerouac's \\"imaginary gardens,\\" (in the words of poet Marianne Moore) have \\"real toads\\" in them, stories that reveal Kerouac's true self, his insightful profiles of friends and adventures:the author's killing of a mouse in his lookout cabin, the Mexican City brothel and the fourteen year-old prostitute who charges him three pesos for her services, his description of and relationship with the beautiful Alyce Newman, the author \\"Bull\\" Hubbard, the nightspots of San Francisco and New York, the \\"jazz\\" joints, the exotic ambience of Morocco and Tangiers, and concludes the book with a narrative of the trip cross country with his mother as he moves her from Florida to Berkeley.What makes Desolation Angels a novel, I'm not sure. Kerouac's Buddhist ramblings, perhaps? The characters' \\"fictional\\" names? To me, the book is a thinly veiled cosmopolitan \\"On the Road\\": Cody Pomeray is Neal Cassady, the Beat gang's savant chauffeur; Irwin Garden, Allen Ginsburg (his book of poetry \\"Howling\\"); Raphael, the poet Gregory Corso; Bull Hubbard, William Burroughs (\\"The Nude Supper?\\"); Julien, Lucius Carr. The author's girlfriend Alyce Newman is the Joyce Johnson whose introduction is included in this edition. And Jack Duluoz is Kerouac himself.Kerouac saved the best of Desolation Angels for last. In the book's final pages the author's moving portrayal of his mother (Memere) during their cross country trip to Berkeley is most telling and reveals a devoted, loving son whose prodigal behavior and capricious peregrinations riddle him with guilt. What mother's son hasn't at times felt the same way?"},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"Some of the general points made below have been used in other reviews of books and materials by and about Jack Kerouac.\\"As I have explained in another entry in this space in a DVD review of the film documentary \\"The Life And Times Of Allen Ginsberg\\", recently I have been in a \\"beat\\" generation literary frame of mind. I think it helps to set the mood for commenting on one of Jack Kerouac's major works, \\"Desolation Angels\\", essentially a series of \`real world' job-related reflections on his time as a forest ranger in Washington state, and his subsequent \\"decompression\\" from that isolating job by travel abroad and in America with his mother in his well known spontaneous writing method at a time when he was trying to keep body and soul together, that it all started last summer when I happened to be in Lowell, Massachusetts on some personal business. Although I have more than a few old time connections with that now worn out mill town I had not been there for some time. While walking in the downtown area I found myself crossing a small park adjacent to the site of a well-known mill museum and restored textile factory space. Needless to say, at least for any reader with a sense of literary history, at that park I found some very interesting memorial stones inscribed with excerpts from a number of Kerouac's better known works dedicated to Lowell's \`bad boy', the \\"king of the 1950s beat writers\\".And, just as naturally, when one thinks of Kerouac then, \\"On The Road\\", his classic modern physical and literary \`search' for the meaning of America for his generation which came of age in post-World War II , readily comes to mind. No so well known, however, is the fact that that famous youthful novel was merely part of a much grander project, an essentially autobiographical exposition by Kerouac in many volumes starting from his birth in 1922, to chart and vividly describe his relationship to the events, great and small, of his times. Those volumes bear the general title \\"The Legend Of Duluoz\\". That is why we today, in the year of the forty anniversary of Kerouac's death, are under the sign of his book of essays \\"Desolation Angels\\".Sometimes one, including a frustrated writer like Kerouac who was on to something but could not get published in the early 1950s, just has to get away from it all. And what better job that a ranger in a far off mountain range where one can think, save money, and contemplate the nature of the universe. For a while at least. Then, a social being like Kerouac (at that time) needs to get back to civilization. In this case the \\"wilds\\" of San Francisco then to Europe and North Africa. And then, along the way, has to under some mysterious internal compulsion has to fulfill his self-appointed obligation to take care of \`mere\\" (his mother) by transporting her across the country by bus to start a new life. That is the outline of the mental and physical travelogue that Kerouac, a master of this kind of descriptive writing, takes us on. In addition there are cameo appearances by many of the \\"regular\\" who we have come to know through this \\"Legend\\" saga, including the above-mentioned Allen Ginsberg and Neal Cassady. This one rates just below \\"On The Road\\"."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"Desolation Angels is a sentimental story which takes place in the time leading up to On The Road being released. To me, this is a great story of adventure and personal reflection for Kerouac. I won't rant, but my favorite part takes place with William Burroughs in Tangiers while he is working on his masterpiece Naked Lunch. Must buy for Kerouac fans."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"This book actually made me dizzy: fast paced, crazy, emotional, funny, crude and touching. I've never read anything like it. Kerouac reels you into his life, mind and heart. I'm hooked."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"This book has to rate as one of the most profound Kerouac novels, although they all seem to give you that feeling. That feeling that your life is wasting away at school or work. Why aren't we loving nature on the top of a mountain? Why aren't we grabbing a bottle of port wine and our backpacks and just going where our heart leads us. This book makes you want to pray! This book speaks straight to your souls, it makes you cry, or it makes you curl up and wish you could."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"For some readers who found this book after reading some of Kerouac's more conventional literary works, this novel may come off as a bit tedious. Kerouac wasn't that great an experimental novelist, or at least not as graceful with spontaneous prose and extra-sensory perceptive description as his pier William S. Burroughs, as exemplified by the book's more incoherent and often undermanaged meanderings. As a piece of creative autobiography, however, the novel is a symbolic giant of originality, fearlessly defying traditional literary convention and organization. For those seeking out Kerouac for more traditional entertainment, however, the novel proves far more complex than a single reading may warrant."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"I covet my copy: a crazy paperback filled cover to cover with pronouns (and margin to margin with scribbles of my own). _Desolation Angels_ is a book for anyone who has sat about and watched _people_, itched to shed the grammatical ball and chain, or found themselves enthralled with 'beat' vernacular (whatever that is). Don't go looking for a plot, 'cause there isn't one: it is a story of the everyday... the meticulous... the monotonous... and it _can be_ just that if you're not fascinated by jack's lunatic need to describe people and their habits/situations/souls with such ravenous lucidity. Yea, I worship it."},{"Title":"Desolation Angels","review":"I fell upon this book having never heard the title before. In the beginning it was hard to get into and long-that lasted not two days before I could not put it down-their was so much feeling and meaning behind the discriptive nature of Kerouac's words that it literally made you laugh and cry out loud. It's a novel that changes your life when you come to the realization that what youve known to be true up until this point represents such a small portion of the possibilities. IT SCREAMS LIFE-EXPERIECE ALL-SEEK TRUTH. My personal favorite river of the Kerouac ocean."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"This is an excellent kindle book on the Sovereignty of God.

This book needs to be made available with an active table of contents."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"loved it!! never read any calvinistic ideas before, only got the book because of a want to learn about god's sovereignty --- it isn't a book about calvinism, but the writer's views are calvinistic, which after studying the points made by the author, and the verses to back it up, i think the author has it spot on. loved this book!! spiritual depth that really helps you to know god better. strong meat. you will not waste your time when you read this, it does not ramble. i read a LOT!! and this book, along with the sovereignty of god by spurgeon and also knowing god by packer are my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"This book was recommended to me by my pastor because I was finding predestination difficult to fathom. The first five chapters were challenging and slow to read: I often read the same sentences over numerous times before I absorbed the content. (I loaned the book to my mother and she said that she had also been struggling with comprehension up to chapter six.) However, in spite of the initial \\"slow read\\", I liked A.W. Pink's writing style; he writes with depth and passion and all points are supported by scripture. After reading \\"The Sovereignty of God\\", I totally understand predestination and how God is truly sovereign in ALL things. I highly recommend this book; it should be a \\"must read\\" for seminary students."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"I read this book when I was first being introduced to the reformed perspective of the sovereignty of God. As a new Christian I was still warming up to the idea of buying books for something other then school, so the fact that this volume is free online really helped. One thing I wasn't expecting was for my whole world to be rocked. If you have been used to a man centered theology this book may indeed shock you. With God's grace your eyes will see the world completely different. God is in control. He's not sitting back idle, but intimately involved with his creation.The book has a warm devotional feel on top of hundreds of references from scripture regarding God's sovereignty. One thing that I appreciated from this book was how he showed that God is in control of every thing that happens. He governs the whole world and everything that comes to pass by his providence. He covers election and the controversial doctrine of reprobation. He also gives practical application within each section including chapters based solely on what the implications of this doctrine are for our life. If you know anyone struggling with this doctrine or would like to introduce someone to the majestic sovereignty of a God who is passionate for his glory, I strongly recommend Pink's volume."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"Pink, A.W. : The Sovereignty of God (G)This is a great book. Pink explains not exhaustively but concisely and very helpfully what the Bible teaches about the sovereignty of God. If you are confused or find the doctrines known as Calvinism offensive this is a book that could be very helpful. The author does not water down the Bible's teachings but also does not go beyond the teachings. For those who embrace the sovereignty of God this book will show you again the importance of this doctrine and how it is practical in the Christians life. The book is a fairly simple read apart from a small technical part discussing the will of man, but even this section could be understood I just needed to focus more.

Pink write in easy to understand terms that aids in the often misunderstood doctrine of God's sovereignty. He takes on the controversial subject without apology."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"In 1930, A.W. Pink wrote The Sovereignty of God, an earthshaking book that awakened readers to the absolute and kingly control of God over all things. I read the book for the first time in 1991 and have read it several times since.Pink defines sovereignty in the first chapter: \\"To say that God is sovereign is to declare that God is God. To say that God is sovereign is to declare that He is the Most High, doing according to His will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth, so that none can stay His hand or say unto Him what doest Thou? (Dan. 4:35).\\" Pink argues, \\"In a word, to deny the sovereignty of God is to enter upon a path which, if followed to its logical terminus, is to arrive at blank atheism.\\" He continues, \\"Sovereignty characterizes the whole Being of God. He is sovereign in all His attributes. He is sovereign in the exercise of His power. His power is exercised as He wills, when He wills, where He wills.\\" Indeed, there is no limit to the sovereignty of God.Pink surveys God's sovereignty by emphasizing His sovereignty in several areas including creation, administration, salvation, reprobation, human responsibility, and prayer to name a few.The Sovereignty of God should be required reading for every Bible College student and every Seminary student. Pastors should return again and again to this treasure. And Christians of all stripes should be encouraged by this marvelous book.5 stars"},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"This book is one of the most beautiful pieces of literature ever written!

I recently read somewhere that this classic work remains one of the best defenses of Calvinism. Indeed, Pink is mostly a strong thinker, grounding himself consistently in Scripture. A frustration I have encountered when talking with people on either side of this issue is that they base their positions on what others have said or what they believe makes the most sense emotionally or logically. Pink rightly encourages Christians to read verses in context, which often lends a great deal of clarity regarding the extent of God's sovereign will.There are times when I think he casts some arguments out of hand without considering them carefully enough. The difficulties and objections chapter, for example, could provide a more robust detailed defense of his position. I still think that R.C Sproul's Chosen by God remains a better read regarding God's sovereignty for most readers, but Pink's work is a classic for God reason."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"This is a really great book! Well worth the money and is great for a Bible Study. You really should read this book. Right now, it is being used in a Men and Women's Bible Study Group and is wonderful."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"When first published in 1918 this book was very controversial. The reason for this is probably due to the fact that in Pink's day the doctrine of God's sovereignty was almost completely ignored, misunderstood or rejected. Why read or study a book on the doctrine of God's sovereignty? The author believed that this doctrine is the second most important doctrine taught in the Bible, the first being the Divine inspiration of the Bible,which is the title of Mr.Pink's first book that was published. Pink has this to say about the importance of this Biblical truth on p.19 &quot;It is... the key to history, the interpreter of providence,...and the foundation of christian theology,p.215...it is designed as the sheet anchor for our souls amid the storms of life. The doctrine of God's sovereignty is a divine cordial to refresh our spirits. It is designed and adapted to mould the affections of the heart and to give a right direction to conduct. ...It affords comfort for the present and a sense of security respecting the unknown future.&quot; A right understanding of this doctrine places God on the throne where he belongs and under His blessing produces humility in His people. The Sovereignty of God is the most comforting doctrine in the Bible to a christian in the midst of trials. This reviewer is convinced that 'The Sovereignty of God'by A.W.Pink is one of the most important and influential books that has been written in this century."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"This book, and this edition of the book in particular, is Arthur Pink's full discourse on the sovereignty of God. It is a book that has been a source of intense controversy and impassioned views. Not everyone will agree with what Pink argues here. In fact, most will probably disagree with some portion of this discourse. Nonetheless, he presents an immensely powerful and mostly persuasive argument on the sovereignty of God within a high Calvinist theological framework.Pink's discourse is thorough, very well documented Biblically, and passionate in what it seeks to present. When he wrote this book, Pink was clearly concerned about the elevation of man and his abilities at the expense of the sovereignty of God throughout Christendom. He understood that presenting a high Calvinist view of God's sovereignty would not win any popularity contests, and he was certainly right about this. But even while not agreeing completely with Pink's views here, I have to say that I found this book to be the best systematic treatment of this issue that I have yet read.I felt that Pink did a good job of clearly establishing the sovereignty of God in all things, including election. I also felt that Pink's discourse on human responsibility and accountability for his actions was utterly outstanding. The reconciliation of human responsibility or 'free-will' in light of God's sovereignty has been a central issue in Christianity throughout its history. I felt that Pink's attempt at reconciling the difficulty is a very significant achievement that moves the discussion in a very positive direction. Throughout his discourse, Pink's Biblical exegesis is thorough and often compelling.I mentioned at the start of this review that this particular edition of Pink's work is a source of great controversy. The reason is because of two main arguments put forth by Pink in this edition that were deleted by the Banner of Truth edition. The first is Pink's argument in favor of limited atonement that argues that Christ did not die for the sins of the whole world on the cross, but only for the sins of God's elect. This is by far the most controversial and debated point of the 5 points of Calvinism. Many self described Calvinists reject this point in favor of a modified form of unlimited atonement, but Pink argues forcefully for the limited atonement view here. Second, and even more controversial, is Pink's lengthy discourse on what is known as 'double predestination'. This is the view that God not only actively elects certain people to be saved, but also actively condemns people to torment. Again, most Calvinists today reject double predestination, but Pink, in the longest chapter of this book, strongly affirms this doctrine. This chapter is the single most controversial aspect of this book, among many controversial aspects, and was deleted in its entirety in the Banner of Truth edition of the book.While I don't think I personally agree with the doctrine of double predestination as Pink presents it, I found myself nonetheless grateful for having read Pink's views on this topic. It has caused me to dig deeper in my thinking to arrive at my own theological convictions. As a result, even though I disagree with some of what Pink wrote, I consider this book to be among the most profitable I've read, and highly commend it to readers who want a clear-cut, unapologetic presentation from a highly Reformed perspective on the sovereignty of God and how it manifests itself, as well as human responsibility in light of God's sovereignty. A classic treatise that will challenge the reader mightily."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"This little book has helped many to come to accept that God is absolutely sovereign over His creation. But this will only happen if one is willing to really consider this issue. And the way to consider it is to look up the Scripture references Pink cites in this book. And Pink references many, many such verses.In fact, this book was one of the sources I used in developing the chapter on \\"The Sovereignty of God\\" in my book \\"Scripture Workbook: For Personal Bible Study and Teaching the Bible.\\" My book also has two additional chapters addressing other aspects of Calvinism.But be forewarned, studying this subject can be very distressing. I know of people who have gone through much emotional struggle when reading books like Pink's. It is simply hard to accept that God is in control of our destinies, not us. But that is why it is absolutely essential to consider carefully what the Bible teaches on this subject.So yes, get Pink's book and look up the Scripture verses he cites. And for even more verses to consider see my \\"Scripture Workbook.\\""},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"This has been my introduction to the Reformed doctrines of Grace, or Calvinism. I have always been a dispensational Baptist, not quite Arminian all the way, but also not Calvinistic all the way. I have always been disturbed by some of the verses in the bible that clearly talk about predestination and never heard a clear explanation of those verses; now I have. While I would have always said I believed God is Sovereign, now I really have a fuller understanding of that. While I have always believed humans are sinful, I now have a much more clear sense of how God sees us. And I have always been uncomfortable with Christians who proclaim Christ yet do not seem to even want to contend for the faith. This book validates my concerns. For these things alone, the book is worth reading. Pink is very scholarly and logical and makes many excellent points on these issues and more.However, I am still struggling with the doctrines of people being predestined for hell and that Christ only died for a select few. There are many verses in the bible that seem to me to refute these two beliefs, Pink's excellent arguments withstanding. Pink does a great job of presenting the Calvinistic viewpoint, but I keep thinking of the verses to the contrary that I have always known.Am I predestined to become a 5 point Calvinist? Right now I would say I am not irresistably drawn, but I will say I did get a lot out of this book and have decided to let God show me if I am to change my mind. In the meantime, I would like to read more of Pink's books because of his evident love for God and excellent expository skills-but I will read with caution."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"There's nothing like the doctrine of God's sovereignty that can cause a man to be humble and yet at the same time confident of his salvation. When I first read this book, I must admit that I found it hard to accept the doctrine of calvinism. Like many Christians in the charismatic churches, I was taught that I could lose my salavation, that Jesus Christ died for every person, and that free-will triumphs over God's sovereign will. Even so, this precious book has made me reconsidered my arminian beliefs until finally I began to see that salvation is from the Lord from the beginning to the end. How God has caused this book to impact my spiritual life is beyond measure to me. My whole outlook of life has changed dramatically, now that I know that He is in control of my life and my salvation. To Him alone then, be all the glory."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"A.W. Pink does an excellent job of portraying God's sovereignty from a Biblical perspective. This book is packed with Scripture, and will impact any serious Christian reader with a view of God that demands his/her whole-hearted reverence, adoration, love, and worship. Realizing the sovereignty of our God will accomplish peace in the hearts of His people like nothing else can bring. Knowing that God is sovereign will allow the Christian to truly walk by faith - Biblical faith in a God who loves him and sovereignly works all things according to His good pleasure. A sovereign God is truly the only kind of God who could ever carry through on a promise to work out everything for the good of those who love Him, and are called according to His purpose. It is this doctrine that will give God's children faith and motivation to pray - after all, there is no point in praying to God if He can't do whatever He wishes. Pink does a marvelous job of expositing both the Scriptures that teach this wonderful faith, as well as those Scriptures which seem to contradict. I very much recommend this book to anyone seeking to know God more accurately and intimately"},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"The apostle Paul wrote in the book of Romans that God is not the &quot;author of confusion.&quot; As you listen to Christian radio and TV programs, another picture emerges; a picture of a Christ that is a product of antinomian folly, and mawkish sentimentality who is reduced to the status of a beggar pleading with recalcitrant, stiff-necked worldlings to &quot;accept Jesus,&quot; when the Bible teaches no such doctrine.Enter AW Pink, an oftimes tart-tongued pastor who puts for the question &quot;Who is regulating affairs on this earth today-God, or the Devil?,&quot; then meticulously embarks on a scriptural study that provides the answer &quot;...though the world is panic-stricken, the wod to the believer is 'Fear not! All things are subject to His (God's) immediate control: all things are moving in accord with His eternal purpose, and therefore, all things are working toether for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to His purpose.&quot;Rev. Pink himself knew that &quot;It would be foolish for us to expect that this work will meet with general approval.&quot; He saw the trend in modern Christendom (so-called) as being toward the &quot;deification of the creature rather than the glorification of the Creator.&quot;This book presents a relentless defining of not only the sovereignty of God, but also His sovereignty in Creation, Administration, Salvation, Reprobation, and in Prayer, to name a few. Arthur Pink exposes the modern gospel as a weak, apostate faith that has &quot;relagt(ed) God to the background.&quot;After reading this book, the Bible will become a new book to you.

The blessed Trinity then works in unity to preserve the elects to be faithful to the end, hence the doctrine of perseverance of the saints. Moreover, St. Paul certainly had in mind the deceitful heart of men when he wrote the third chapter of the epistle to the Romans, as well as the beginning of the second chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians, to deliver a crushing blow to all vain human boastings of their free-will, by hammering on the utter inability of the fatally-corrupted will of men to do any good in the sight of God in and by themselves, so that \\"every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God\\", hence the doctrine of total depravity, which, though discussed in this book, but not as comprehensively as in Martin Luther's \\"De Servo Arbitrio\\", a.k.a., \\"The Bondage of the Will\\". To deny all these, as Pastor Pink puts it, is \\"to undeify\\" or \\"to unGod\\" God of his God-ness because two essential must-have attributes of God's God-ness for him to be God are his omnipotence and omniscience. Embracing Arminianism also dangerously elevates men to the level of the sovereignty of God; a realm where if men insist to enter, would render them blasphemous to God. Finally, in my view, Pastor Pink, though he did a marvelous job in distinguishing between natural and moral ability, might have done a little too much in attempting to explain the missing link between the sovereignty of God and human responsibility, as well as other objections, to the point that it sounds like he ended up begging the questions. Perhaps there is indeed no humanly answer to this great mystery, which then all we can do is to affirm, adore and rejoice in its truth. \\"The secret things belong unto the LORD our God.\\"As a related side comment, I would like to add the following thoughts. Prof. Mark Talbot points out during his address at 2005 Desiring God National Conference in Minneapolis, MN, (he explains it in the context of Opentheism, but I believe it is applicable here as well) that the doctrine of autonomous-self teaches that God values man's free-will so much that he is willing to pay any price. God is really good in cleaning things up to the point that the alternative plan B that he executes looks even better, more perfect than the botched plan A that man has frustrated. So in a way, the doctrine of autonomous-self treats God like a lackey or a genie in a bottle whom man can stir as he wills. I regard this Arminian stand on the free agency of man and God as the most self-centered among man-centered doctrines, even more man-centered than opentheism. Opentheism at least admits the future is unknown, even God has no control over it and anybody could change it. The Arminian doctrine in regard to the free-agency of men, particularly as stated in the first article of Remonstrance, that faith is the condition of election, is worse than open-theism because it teaches the future is already known, at least in regard to salvation, who is saved and who is not, and who makes this decision before the foundations of the world is men. Then God responds to each individual decision either by saving or condemning. Everything God does is for the benefits of man, and here is man, the center of the universe and God's idol. This, I fear, may God forbid, is the desire behind those who embrace the doctrine of autonomous-self which is nothing but the very ambition of Lucifer to be exalted above God (Isa 14:13-14) because the resemblance between the two is striking.If it is to be inquired how the Arminian doctrine of autonomous-self or free-will could exist and what the spirit behind it is, where men insist on being the captain of their destiny, it is helpful to study the account of the fall of Lucifer from grace whose account was given in the fourteenth chapter of Isaiah, \\"Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee. How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.\\" (Isaiah 14:11-15)We learn the cause of him being eternally condemned by God from v.13 and 14 is that he is so filled with pride and self-adoration that he declares himself to be worthy to ascend into heaven and be exalted above the stars of God. He considers himself to be as equally valuable, as equally worthy, if not more valuable and more worthy than God himself that he should be like the Most High. In response, God removed him from his original state and declares that his splendor be nullified and brought down to shame, and he himself be brought down to hell, to a place of eternal torment which is the lake of fire (Rev 20:10) forever as his eternal destiny. When Lucifer was removed from heaven, his name became Satan, and was cast to the earth.In the account of the Fall in Gen 3, after which God offered the promise of deliverance through the atoning work of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross implied in v. 15, we may observe a correlation between Satan's sinful ambition to what he tempted Adam and Eve with, which eventually led the couple to sin against God and caused the entire humanity to be totally and hopelessly depraved under the same condemnation that Lucifer has as a result. The correlation is clearly seen in Gen 3:5, when Satan, disguised as a serpent, said to Eve, \\"For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\\" Here are the double lies offered to Eve springing out of the same principle behind his botched coup attempt; first, that she would be like gods, and thus independent, able to rule over herself apart from God, and secondly, there is not one God, but many gods; each is sovereign over himself or herself.From this train of thoughts, we may observe that first; the doctrine of autonomous-self, or often referred to as \\"free-will\\", whether it be \\"Christian\\" or non-Christian one, though may not appear explicitly, originates from the same spirit by which Lucifer rebels against God, that is, the spirit of self-idolatry. Secondly, the doctrine of autonomous-self is indeed a non-Christian doctrine because there is nowhere in the Bible that teaches such a doctrine and therefore, should be rejected by all true Christians, as Pastor Pink affirms in this book."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book. Pink uses persuasive arguments and scriptural foundations to establish his points on an issue that has been neglected in American Christianity. He is a bit extreme, however (by comparing some writings of John Calvin to this work, I've noticed that Pink is more Calvinistic than Calvin). Nevertheless, the book is a great help not only in doctrinal but also in practical matters.

I remember thinking as I was reading this book \\"man we need another Pink today.\\" He ripped apart the way that evangelism was being done in that day. Every little false illustration and such. This book was written I believe in the thirties and what is amazing is he talks about problems streching back to the turn of the century that we are still having today.

Pink does not mince words, and cuts through the smoke screen of God's 'universal love' and 'desire to save all' that sadly clouds the vision of many, if not most, of the Reformed theologians and seminary professors since the late John H. Gerstner and Gordon H. Clark went on to glory.Do not buy the sanitized edition published by the Banner of Truth Trust, which has censored the unpalatable chapters. If you read Pink carefully and prayerfully, the scales will fall from your eyes. They fell from mine. Soli Deo gloria!"},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"In many ways this book comes as a refreshing antidote to much of the slush that is being published for the Christian reader. We live in a day when, because evil abounds, the love of many has grown cold. Frighteningly large numbers of church folk no longer want to hear of discipleship, discipline, long suffering, brotherly love, self control and denial of self. Instead, God becomes a kind of mentor to help you become \\"whole\\" - whatever that is meant to mean! This aim, which is just another fixation with self, makes God simply an accessory to our selfish ambition.A W Pink's book redresses the balance and has God on the throne, where He truly is. That of course must be good. However, if you are going to buy this book let me offer a brotherly warning. Firstly, this book represents a refined doctrine. By that I mean that, just as the radium the Curies extracted became, in its concentrated form, a highly dangerous substance, so, this focus on God's Sovereignty, though a wonderful and necessary subject for meditation, can also lead into many dangerous and off balanced positions.Though there are many good things in this book, it is not the complete picture of God. It is not irrelevant to state that this book tends to be championed by those who believe that if we lived in the 17th Century - or at least adopted the doctrines and life styles of 17th Century Puritans - we, the church, would be doing very well today. In reality, these people have brought little refreshment to the church.OK, then, I'd say the short of it is this: Yes, read the Banner of Truth version (even they cut out some of the original material because they thought it was extreme - and later in life A W Pink himself thought he'd gone too far as well). Get excited over the Great God who Rules in the Heavens, just as Isaiah did. But remember that God is not remote and He really does answer prayer. Indeed, some things will not happen unless we pray. Furthermore, balance this vision with another - for instance Frances Roberts devotional \\"Come Away My Beloved\\" (also available at Amazon). There you will get a Sovereign God and a God of intimacy.Although in many Christian camps God has been depicted as standing pathetically by seeking to beg sinners to come to Him in a way that is not worthy of Him, do not allow strongly worded descriptions of this tendency to block out what may be true here. Many times the Sacred Writings picture God as pleading with His people, and sinners, to come to Him. \\"All day long I have held out my hands to a rebellious people but YOU WOULD NOT\\" is just one example.Mr Pink is one of those writers who digs channels for you to go down. You aren't supposed to climb out of the channel and look around but simply to follow his line of thought until you are convinced that there is no other way of viewing the truths he deals with. For instance, I think he takes the illustration of being dead in trespasses and sins too far. The same figure of death is used for the Christian also (in his being \\"dead to sin\\") but if Mr Pink were to press that application as far as the other, he would be forced to conclude sinless perfection. Indeed, this sort of exaggerated reasoning forces many, from his camp, to make saving faith a total gift of God in order to avoid the slightest involvement of man in salvation (which involvement they term synergism). In order to extricate faith from human energies a teaching is developed which puts regeneration before faith. This flies in the face of the true Reformers who taught the biblical doctrine that a man is justified, by faith, while he is still a sinner. These unbalanced types, however, believe that we are justified by regeneration - it is an inescapable conclusion. Since regeneration is a kind of washing or cleansing, it follows, if regeneration came first (which it doesn't), that men are justified because they are justifiable rather than justified by the death of Christ. Voila: the first step toward Rome! The Biblical Christian need merely point out (from Romans 4) that the reason God chose faith as the door to salvation is that it is not reckoned a work of man (synergism) anymore than a man who holds out his hand to take money can be said to have, by so acting, earned it."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"I ran across this book while searching for material relating to Free will and Predestination and their interplay (or lack thereof) which each other. It came highly recommeded so I bought it and read.It is very apparent that Mr. Pink has a deep passion for the pursuit of God and is a herald for what he believes to be the truth. His committment to Christ is above reproach. That said, however, he presents his arguments with less tact that I would expect from a person so intent on persuading people to subscribe to a certain doctrine. Instead of building a case and leading the reader to draw the intended conclusion desired (as C.S. Lewis wonderfully does) Pink seems to drag you across the dividing line between the two camps of thought and prevent from crossing over to the other side. There is little respect or empathy for arminianism in any form - it is treated instead like a disdained and sinful idea with the power only to corrupt and denigrate the minds of those who hear it.Specifically, he insists on maintaining the \\"Balance of Truth\\" between the ideas that God is both sovereign and man is responsible for his behavior but gives little real credence to the latter. His argument in the end boils down to merely asserting that man must be responsible even though it is logically inconsistent with his argumentation. Most disappointing of all, however, is his treatment of the problem of evil. If God is completely sovereign in the manner that Pink maintains then His control of evil is congruent to that sovereignty. It would have been understandable and even acceptable to merely say that God is both good and sovereign because Scripture maintains both but he goes on to attempt a solution and ends up destroying the little credibility the reader has left at that point.Finally, his insistence on avoiding the label \\"hyper-Calvinist\\" is a bit like someone downplaying the title \\"fundamentalist\\" merely because he does not like it - in both cases the vast majority of people would agree to the label despite personal opposition. In the end, Pink left me not so much a picture of a completely sovereign God but a God who operates only in the most carefully constructed of boxes."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"This is a very well written book with much that is God honouring. It would have to be since much of it is Biblically based.However, this book has become a kind of tract for higher Calvinism. The Banner of Truth used to publish testimonies of Pentecostals who had been \\"saved\\" from Pentecostalism by reading this book. But the Banner of Truth left out the chapter on double predestination and in one of their publications they gave the reasons for this. It would seem that Mr Pink himself had moved away from his former position - or at least the Banner felt that he had.This is not surprising of course. When we are young we like things black and white. Also, when we are angry at worldly tendencies in the churches, we long to find some cause or teaching which exposes such as sham - a stick with which to beat them. We are then on a pendulum swing and it is all so clear and easy. But often it is a slow, difficult and painful climb back to a more correct position. In our \\"battles for the truth\\" we are like bull-seals fighting over territory, oblivious of the calves and cows that are bruised and squashed beneath us.Dear brethren, has this modern Calvinistic trend really brought about revival? Are the folk in your church any more holy, loving and righteous than any other sect? Do you love Jesus any more than you did before you got switched on to this philosophy? Or, is it a constant pressure to keep up with the book reading plan? Do you need a wheel barrow every time you visit a reformed convention; to bring all the books back? And with all the talk of preaching amongst this group have you ever come across more boring preaching? No, I'm not trying to be rude but lets face it, most of us got turned on to this tendency by Martin Lloyd Jones, only to find that he was a one-off in his generation.Now look, art and literature are ok aren't they, but do you really need me to spell out the dangers? Look at the Koran. Moslems say that in the Arabic it is sublime. Yes, but look how it translates! It is the same with English books. A writer can write in a way that sweeps all before him. At the end of reading the book you say \\"Wow, that's great, his reasoning has really convinced me\\". But you can't relate it to others so you say \\"Ah, you just have to read the book\\". Reasoning can be very subtle and much of this book is of close reasoning. Take this syllogism for example:\\"Most people like ice cream; I am like most people: therefore I like ice cream\\". I admit that the error here is obvious: I might be like most people in most things but not necessarily in the specific case of being an ice cream fan. But the syllogisms aren't always so obvious.Look what you are led to believe in reading this book:1. God chose certain people to be saved before time began and the rest He CHOSE to go to hell.2. We are so dead in sins before getting saved that we can't choose one good thing - not even to want God.3. God regenerates us - that is, gives us the new birth - before we believe, in order that we shall believe (this is nonsense: the life is in Christ. He that has the Son has life - you get the life by receiving Him)Now in John 3, the serpent lifted up on a pole is spoken of as a picture of how God gives Jesus to the world (note that He is offered to the world as the crucified Saviour). In closing, lets just look at this incident from Moses' time. Here are the Israelites being bitten by snakes. They cry out to Moses. Moses goes before God and God tells him to make a bronze snake, put it on a pole and whoever looks at the serpent will be healed. Let's imagine the scene:Moses (to the crowd): look at the serpent and you will be healed from the effects of the poison.Joe: What me too?Moses: All of you...yes, you too.Joe: It can't be for all of us, some of us have already died. The serpent could never have been for them specifically.Moses: Look, this is a matter of life and death...believe or perish!Joe: I need to know what warrant I have to believe. Surely this latest judgement is meant to kill some of us. How do I know it wasn't meant to kill me? Who am I to be presumptious!Moses: God has said look at the snake, as the only provision for your deliverance, that's all the warrant you will get. But if you persist in your folly it is because you have no regard for what God says, but only for foolish philosophy.Joe: How could I have any regard? By nature I am unable to look at the serpent. By nature I don't even want to be saved. By nature I cannot even utter one word that pleases the Lord. By nature my looking would be an attempt to earn my healing rather than rely on total grace.And so it goes on. And so it has gone on for centuries. We virtually invented this doctrine in England. Come and see the barrenness over here my brethren and then think again.On the clock we are seconds from judgement. Our western nations beg destruction. Pray. Seek the Holy Spirit. Seek God and let nothing get you off track."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"Mr. Pink is very deep and insightful in all of his books. I have several. He tends to spiritualize a bit much, but the pros greatly outweigh the cons in most cases. However, this is not the case with &quot;The Sovereignty Of God&quot;. Before you read any of his books, you must realize that he was (admittedly or not) a Hyper- Calvinist. The most dramatic error of this theology is to say that certain people on this earth have been predestined by God for Hell and that there is nothing that they can do about it! This theology does not agree with countless Bible passages. Romans 8:29 says &quot;For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.&quot; Predestination is based on God's omniscience. He simply knows who will accept Christ and who will not because He knows everything. He did not predestine anyone for Hell. Man chooses Christ or rejects Christ. That choice determine his destiny. God simply knows what people will choose. The following Scriptures will clearly tell you that Jesus Christ died for everyone, and not just the elect! Isaiah 53:6 - John 3:16 - Romans 10:13 - I Timothy 2:3-6 - I Timothy 4:10 - II Peter 3:9 - I John 2:1-2 - Revelation 22:17 - God wants all to be saved and that is why He sent His Son to die for all! The result of this poor theology is lack of concern to tell people about the Savior's ability to save. Because if a person is predestined to Hell, they cannot be saved (according to the Hyper Calvinist). This is not a book for the Browse-Through-Bible-Student! If you are not strongly rooted in the Bible Doctrine of Salvation by grace through faith, I cannot reccomend that you read it! As a matter of fact, I discourage it! Many a weak Christian has fallen prey to the Deadly T.U.L.I.P. through Mr. Pink's work on &quot;The Sovereignty Of God&quot;! Be very careful and prayerful! I was not allowed to rate this at less than 1 star otherwise I would have."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"I feel sorry for those who believe in this teaching,for sadly I did for many years in my christian life,and taught this as a Christian Minister. This theology was denounced as heresy in the early church by all the early church bishops for 350 years until Augustine came along and brought it to the church. The Gnostics taught this same devil inspired teaching,and all the early church Bishops denounced them as heretics. those who teach and believe this today are simply believing and teaching the same heresy as the Gnostics taught in the fist century. All the early church teachers taught holiness or hell. the false teachers taught eternal security and predestination. Use common sense. People like Polycarp were taught by the Apostles,and all his teachings which can be found free online verify that holiness or hell is what everyone taught for the first 300 years except the heretics. Read the dictionary of early christian beliefs (here at amazon),and you will have your eyes opened to realize this teaching was clearly denounced as heresy by all the early church Bishops."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"A.W. Pink's excellent work on the sovereignty of God is one of the best twentieth-century treatments of the subject. It is a carefully reasoned, Scripture-saturated, heart-probing, man-abasing, God-exalting book. It is theology with a view to doxology. This exposition will lead you to exaltation!Pink begins by defining God's sovereignty. Then he applies this understanding of God's sovereignty to creation, administration (providence), salvation, reprobation, operation, the human will, human responsibility, and prayer. He ends by looking at what our attitude towards God's sovereignty should be, answering objections, and emphasizing the value of the doctrine. There are four appendices dealing with the will of God, the fall of Adam, the meaning of \\"world\\" in John 3:16, and the meaning of I John 2:2.This book is a supralapsarian Calvinistic look at the doctrine of God's sovereignty. I do not agree with Pink in every point, but I commend this book. I know for a fact that God has used this for the conversion of sinners. And regardless of whether you will accept all of Pink's interpretation of Scripture, you cannot help but walk away from this book with a higher view of God than you had before. I count this as one of the most important books I have read. Read this book. Study this book. And adore the God of this book. Be satisfied with sovereignty!"},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"I read this book in the last year of my undergraduate education (last year, 2005). I wish I had read it earlier - there is absolutely no doctrine of Christianity that causes one to be at peace quite like the Sovereignty of God! I picked it up while doing a study on various attributes of God and, thankfully, it became one of my favorite books. It goes well hand in hand with his \\"Attributes of God\\", even comparing it with A.W.Tozer's \\"Knowledge of the Holy\\"; in fact, I would suggest you read those two, especially Pinks book, before you begin this one, it only helps...Many people hate Pink because of this book. It was the \\"famous\\" chapter on \\"The Sovereignty of God in Reprobation\\" that gave many Arminians and some Calvinists that twitch that is associated when his name is mentioned. Be careful what edition you buy, avoid the Banner of Truth copy because they deliberately omit that chapter (and a couple others), claiming that Pink abandoned his veiws regarding that chapter. Whether he did or not is irrelevant; you should get your moneys worth - what he wrote is what you should get, not what other poeple think he believed and would have taken out. I have the Sovereign Grace Publishers copy, its a good copy, complete. I like the ample space they leave for margins, great for note-takers like me.The first few chapters are a little slow going but necessary, I must admit. The exciting part really starts at chapter 4: \\"The Sovereignty of God in Salvation\\". He splits up the chapter into three parts, each three devoted to how the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are Sov. in Salvation. Its got one of the better defenses I have seen for a strictly limited atonement. One thing I loved about this chapter is that Pink made sure he always brought the attention back to God; in fact, this is typical of Pink in almost everything he writes!The next chapter, \\"The Sovereignty of God in Reprobation\\" is one that was, for me, the 'life changer', in the word of one of the commenters below. From my understanding (im not an educated theologian, yet), this is one of the greatest defenses for a supralapsarian position I have ever read. He also calls to mind many Scriptures to point out that God is sovereign even over the death of an unbeliever, and that \\"The Lord hath made all things for Himself; yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.\\" (Prov. 16:4). He says (p. 105) \\" In the Day of Judgement the Lord will say unto many, \\"I never knew you\\". Note, it is more than simply \\"I knew you not\\". His solemn declaration will be, \\"I NEVER knew you\\" - you were never the objects of My approbation. Contrast this with \\"I KNOW (love) My sheep, and am known (loved) of Mine\\" (John 10:14). The \\"sheep\\", His elect, the \\"few\\", He DOES \\"know\\"; but the reprobate, the non-elect, the \\"many\\" He knows NOT - no, not even before the foundation of the world did He know them - He \\"NEVER\\" knew them!\\" This is difficult stuff for people to swallow, but it clearly is what Scripture teaches in Romans 9 (for example, where Pink leads us to immediately after that quote). It is certainly an eye-opener, to say the least! At this point, youre either going to love him or hate him, this is usually when you make up your mind. Either way, you really should hang in there and be honest with yourself and God; ask yourself the question \\"could Pink possibly be right? Is this what Scripture says?\\" One has to ask that because if he is, many of us, like me before reading this, would be commiting Idolatry: worshipping a kindly old man rather than the roaring lion of Judah, the God of the living and the dead. The scary thing is, I dont know of a singlle person who's found mistakes with his exegesis. Whether they agree with the final result or not, the man is right in his analysis. Thats why many love him.Chapters 8 and 9 do a great job at reconciling the Sov. of God and the Human Will and Responsibility. He contains a typical response but spelled out with many Scriptures, examples, and images - almost reminds me of Thomas Watson in the use of his imagery. It also contains some paragraphs that, to me, are worth the price of the book. These four chapters (4, 5, 8, and 9) are gold mines in and of themselves! Whether or not God is Sovereign over every aspect of our lives we are very clearly commanded to \\"preach the Gospel to every creature\\" as Pink points out. Whether or not we understand every nuance of God's plan of redemption, we MUST obey and preach the Gospel. To neglect this duty is to miss the point incredibly. Not only does he emphasize this point but he goes on to make a very needed explanation of what freedom truly is: \\"...the holding in check of sin, the preventing of the exercize of the carnal mind ... was not a DESTROYING of their 'freedom,' rather was it the inducting of them into real freedom\\" (p 184), ... WOW! (p. 185) \\"True liberty is not the power to live as we please, but to live as we ought! Hence, the only One Who has ever trod this earth since Adam's fall that has enjoyed perfect freedom was the Man Christ Jesus, the Holy Servant of God, Whose meat it ever was to do the will of the Father.\\" That concept is liberating! When you realize what freedom truly is you, naturally, become humble and suddenly dont have a problem with God electing you! You might wonder \\"why me, why not the next guy?\\" Pink would tell us, \\"The secret things belong to the Lord...\\" (Deut, 29:29) redirecting our attention back to God, where it belongs, dwelling on ourselves is pride - an act of \\"unfreedom\\". We would be instructed to say \\"even so, Father, for it seemed good in Your sight\\" (Matthew 11:26).Anyway, I just thought I'd put out a couple of bits of this book out there. Its beautifully written with many many Scriptures. Almost every single paragraph of the book has a verse, many have more. The appendices in the end are VERY useful. I whole-heartedly recommend this book, buy it and be nourished!If you want more resources for studying free-will, responsibility, and the sovereignty of God, I would like to direct you to \\"Bondage of the Will\\" by Martin Luther (the one translated by JI Packer and OR Johnston) - and if youre really into hurting your self mentally and training your soul hard - \\"Freedom of the Will\\" by Jonathan Edwards. Classics ... very hard-core. The second book is so good, but only if youre prepared for a bit of slow and difficult reading (its worth it). If you want a rather simplistic, yet thorough, introduction to Calvinism and the Reformed Faith before tackling any of these books, might I suggest \\"Putting Amazing Back Into Grace\\" by Michael Horton."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"I have studied this book twice so far, almost 15 years apart.

It's not so much written about us, it's written about God, and it convicts us and reminds us of who God is and has to be, or He wouldn't be God, someone or something else would be. It can be a hard truth, but it is a neccesary truth for His own to gain strength and security. Read the book if you need help or want to help someone else."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"Excellent! Such a clear explanation of sovereignty and the doctrines of grace. This is a 'life-changer'. I read it along with the bible and saw that every doctrine he explainded was clearly validated with scripture! Every christian reading this book will see their understanding deepen and their priorities change as they see God's plan with greater light!"},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"I personally enjoy Pink's style of writing. His invective against arminianism is powerful and does have it's amusing side. If only he were with us today to say a few words about the modernist liberal and his/her disgraceful and shameless compromising of the Gospel and watering down of the Church's standards.However, rather than focus on the controversy, we should focus (with the assistance of Scripture and good books like The Sovereignty of God) on the God who is totally in control. Revell in this comfort. Show confidence in his plan. And most importantly, if you are a Christian, rejoice that he chose you from the beginning of time.Before you really believe in God's total sovereignty, you believe in half of Christianity. You believe in half a God. It is questionable whether you really believe in what could be described as \\"a god\\" or \\"God\\" at all.If you go Pink's way, which I have, don't expect popularity. Pink was at times rejected (by arminian & calvinist alike). But you'll rest with the assurance that:1) God is totally in control of your salvation and life (as abovementioned).2) God expects evangelism, but doesn't expect you to behave like a lunatic in the process. Salvation begins and ends with him."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"Next to the Bible, this book changed my life in 1966. I believe it should be read by all thinking Christians. It is biassed. The author admits that in his preface, but it is biassed deliberately to focus upon the greatness and grandeur of the Godhead. After reading this book, your understanding of God will never be the same again."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"Search the scriptures and you will see there is a Sovereign God near you.After doing just that and reading this book,He pulled back the veil and revealed himself for who he really is to me. In the midst of persecution,trials, and blessings he's still in total control of this universe!"},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"This is a life-changing book! It challenges you...no, forces you to consider just how sovereign God really is! It's not bed-time reading. By the time you exit the back door of this book I guarantee you will not be the same. Get ready to grapple with some heavy thoughts. Biblical truth is not toyed with here. This is one of the most important books of the century."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"If you have not studied this topic, be prepared for positive adjustments in your view of our Sovereign God.While this book was written quite some time ago, no one has developed a better introduction to the real meaning of God's Sovereignty. This book covers topics like sovereignty in creation; sovereignty in administration; sovereignty in salvation; sovereignty in reprobation; sovereignty in operation; sovereignty and human responsibility; our attitude toward God's sovereignty. Mr. Pink discusses those problem passages that many of us stumble over."},{"Title":"The sovereignty of God","review":"While Pink is an excellent writer and theologically sound I am somewhat dissappointed. I have come to find out that there are two editions, by different publishers, and I got the wrong one. I purchased the edition butchered by the publisher that is ironically named Banner of Truth. Looking at the description I click the look inside and view the table of contents. What I see online is NOT what I have purchased.Amazon needs to make these things clear:Title of the textName of the authorPublishers nameI am not excited to purchase the same book twice, so I am looking locally through family friends to find a proper copy to borrow. I have not decided what to do with this bad edition."},{"Title":"From Grandmother With Love: A Life Recalled for My Grandchild","review":"This book is a great way to organize your own life as a gift to your grandchild. Price is reasonable so each child should have his/her own; just a bit more personal. Hunting up accompanying photos brought back many wonderful and sad memories to share. I had sooo many extra photos to include that I numbered the pages, marked photos A, B, C, etc. on each page and taped a special 3 page layered index at back of each grandchild's book withpage number and A,B,C, etc. referring to the photos. My grandchildren especially like seeing my school photos taken Kindergarten through senior year of high school. This is an excellent gift for a Grandma-to-be when she tells you her child is expecting. It will give her a few months headstart organizing her thoughts. I think there should be an accompanying book for Grandpas and Great-grandparents."},{"Title":"From Grandmother With Love: A Life Recalled for My Grandchild","review":"My wife loves this book and has completed one for the granddaughters of all our kids.

Good clues to the mystery stimulate young minds. The language is easy to understand without talking down to the audience."},{"Title":"Scooby-doo On Zombie Island","review":"My four year old loves scooby doo books and movies. At the book store, I let him pick the book he wanted and I purchased it without reading first. It is scooby doo, they are all the same right? It isn't real and everything ends happy. In this book, they decided it would be fun for the zombies to be real, a true mystery the gang couldn't solve. Scooby doo and shaggy actually start becoming zombies with a horrible picture associated with it! We read to my son once and immediately returned it. He got another scooby doo to add to his collection. This book should have never been written!"},{"Title":"Scooby-doo On Zombie Island","review":"My 4-year old loves Scooby Doo. One of the great things about the franchise (at least the part I've been acquainted with) is that the mystery spook is invariably unmasked at the end of the show (or book). Not this time. Real zombies, real magic. Not the message I was looking for."},{"Title":"Scooby-doo On Zombie Island","review":"Gail Herman once again takes the helm and provides ample entertainment and a deconstructivist view of the beloevd Hanna-Barbara cartoon characters. At the beginning, this book introduces the protagonists through a flashback, once again unmasking a perpetrator only to find that it is not a supernatural force but a human being (undoubtedly offerring the cliche exclamations: \\"you meddling kids!\\") Bringing the story to the present, we find that the group of friends has disbanded (cf. the common social fracturization of post-pubsescent social circles.) Daphne longs for her old friends (ie. nostalgia for returning to the uncomplicated latent period childhood) and calls her friends up to join her on another impeteous adventure. Velma is working in a darkened bookstore (signifying a repressed Id), and in an ironic twist, the inseperable Shaggy and Scooby are luggage inspection agents, undoubtedly helping their friends get their international agricultural imports into the country unhindered. The story reunites the entire gang, and an episode follows, better written than most of the original animated editions.Herman remains faithful to the original's Massachusetts valley educational instituion symbolism of Shaggy (Hampshire), Scooby (UMass), Velma (Smith), Daphne (Mt. Holyoke), and Fred (Amherst). The \\"don't ask-don't tell\\" alternative lifestyles of Fred \\"the scarf\\" and Velma, as well as the unspoken herbal indulgences of Shaggy and Scooby are just as subtle as in the original. No new developments are made in the Velma > Daphne > Fred love triangle, but the underlying tension remains. The author refrains from the later-day commercialization of the infamous Scrappy character, which unbalanced the chemistry of the original fab five.This Scholastic edition brings the reader a handsomely bound oversized paperback with coated paper, allowing full page treatments of the gorgeous animation. The presentation allows the the dark, subtle tones of the Third World-crafted animation cells to come across beautifully.In the end, this is a delightful book, full of depthful characterization and boundless symbolism. I put the book down after reading with renewed hope for modern literature."},{"Title":"Meaningful Mentoring, A Handbook of Effective Strategies, Projects and Activities: Helping You Become a Co-Pilot in an Adolescent's Life","review":"Definitely worth the cost and the time to read.

The ideas about how to teach your baby about where his foot is, or how to sit up, or that bubble float, are terrific, and the look on his face when I do something the book recommends is just pure joy! My only recommendation is that you stay at least one month ahead, and do things from that month which you think your child is ready for."},{"Title":"Your Child at Play: Birth to One Year","review":"I have a 4 month old baby. I'm a stay-at-home mom and while I know \\"everything is fascinating\\" to such a young baby, the fact is, we have to do something to fill in the hours. I do not think that certain exercises will help baby roll over faster, or that watching Baby Einstein videos will make baby smarter. I DO think that activities are invaluable for bonding with the baby.Enter this book. This is the book I have been looking for! Other books with activities for babies tend to focus more on the toddler ages--aka after walking, or at least after crawling. This book has fun activities even for pre-crawlers--even for babies who cannot yet move their head! And the activities are grouped month by month. O fcourse, take these monthly guidelines with a grain of salt--every baby is different, and as another reviewer mentioned, crawling at 6 months is a little ambitious. Having just found the book, I've gone back and pulled some activities from the youinger ages as well.Finally, while the activities may seem simple, even the most creative caregiver cannot think of everything. For example, in the 4 month section, Dr. Segal recommends placing baby on a blanket and picking up the blanket to cause them to roll over. I've been playing rolling-over games with my son, but never thought to use a blanket to roll him over, and it turns out he LOVES it. The activities mentioned have also sparked my imagine for other activities, and at the very least, are invaluable in the middle of the afternoon when baby is on napping strike and the day seems to drag on....HIGHLY recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Your Child at Play: Birth to One Year","review":"We have a library of books to help us understand what we can do to best understand and stimulate our childs growth/development(i.e.- What to expect series, Brazleton, Baby book, etc).

Only warning is that relative to other books this book generally is a bit aggressive in its projected milestones (assumes baby will crawl at 6 mos)."},{"Title":"Your Child at Play: Birth to One Year","review":"This book is a little dated and a lot of the info and ideas are fairly obvious. As a first-time parent, I did find some of it useful as far as having an idea of what stages where coming up and what to expect, and a few of the play ideas were useful.

While it gives good generic weight training and programs, to my mind it did not include enough discussion about why the given exercises are recommended for soccer, as opposed to generic weight training, and there is no discussion about integration with other soccer-specific training, like ladder work, stairs, etc. There are a couple of chapters written by soccer trainers, but they seem disjointed form the rest of the book.

The Crossway Classic Commentary Series, carefully adapted for maximum understanding and usefulness, presents the very best work on individual Bible books for today's believers.The apostle Paul's epistles to the church at Corinth are masterpieces of spiritual truth applied to crises within the church - crises of both belief and practice. In his first letter Paul gives the Corinthian believers an honest inventory of their spiritual strengths and weaknesses - fully gifted and yet divided; believing foundational Gospel truth and yet condoning immorality and doctrinal distortions - and urges them to fully commit themselves to Christ.This classic commentary is a treasure for all who desire a closer walk with God. Whether used for supplementary reading or for careful study, it will prove profitable to every follower of Christ who opens his or her heart to its gems.--- from book's back cover"},{"Title":"The Shadow: Blood & Judgement","review":"Having Howard Chaykin write and illustrate THE SHADOW: BLOOD AND JUDGMENT was a master stroke - he was born to tell this story. This 1986 miniseries pulled the Shadow from the darkened alleyways of the 1930s to the mirrored towers of the modern world, setting up a 19-issue series that raised eyebrows among purists and likely Conde Nast Ltd., owners of the character. This version of the Shadow is darker and more intense than the familiar mystery man of the pulps and radio serials (or even DC's original Shadow series from the \`70s, for that matter). Attempts to bring pulp characters into the present are often ill-conceived, but BLOOD AND JUDGMENT actually makes sense and fits the character perfectly.Chaykin's Shadow is a machine-gun-toting angel of death who returns after a thirty year absence when news gets out that his former agents, in their old age, are being targeted by an assassin. The Shadow, not looking a day older than when he disappeared in the early '50s, is accompanied by agents both new and old in solving the mystery behind the murders. Along the way, we learn more of his mysterious origin and the reason for his retreat from crimefighting. The Shadow is depicted as a product of his time who is very out-of-place in the modern \\"enlightened\\" world. In fact, his inherent dark nature is brought to the fore in this story and is challenged by those aiding in his mission. True to form, Chaykin fills the story with violence, sex, racism, and of course, a healthy dose of misogyny. The character is cast in a negative light, and I feel that it suits him well; however, I can picture Conde Nast, having seen the results of their licensing deal with DC, thinking \\"oh lord, what have they done?\\" This trade collection, as well as the followup series, will likely never be reprinted, so grab them where you can find them."},{"Title":"The Shadow: Blood & Judgement","review":"A mini-series released in the late 80's by DC Comics. This one presents a somewhat 'revisionist' version of the Shadow(he has his pulp magazine background, but his personality is different), written by Howard Chaykin. Despite the differences, this is still a great read for Shadow fans."},{"Title":"The Shadow: Blood & Judgement","review":"A pretty decent rendering of The Shadow, by Chaykin, certainly better than some comic versions."},{"Title":"The Shadow: Blood & Judgement","review":"This book does have a decent story, even if the execution was pretty bad, but this story should have been told using a different character, not the Shadow. The Shadow should never be modernized because he fits so perfectly in that distinct and specific 1930's to 1940's period. This is more like the Sam Raimi creation, Darkman. Modernizing the Shadow and his world doesn't make sense because if he was to exist in 1985 (when this story was published) then he would be a feeble, old man. You don't modernize the pulps. You may be able to do it with Doc Savage, via a time machine, but the Shadow is considered sacred ground and just shouldn't be touched. Howard Chaykin admits that he wasn't much of a Shadow fan or pulp reader. Apparently that is true!I recommend the Shadow Strikes, In the Coils of Leviathan, Hell's Heat Wave and the Denny O'neil/Mike Kaluta run.

I used to hear this was a good read.Growing up story, with the father at the center helping the children have good moral values. How it is hard for Scout to see her brother grow before her eyes, and they are no longer at the same level. There is a rape trial which is said when you do research on Harper Lee, that there was a real trial. That alot the book is based on true events.I would reccommend this book to be read alone and then discussed with others."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In 1962, To Kill a Mockingbird won a Pulitzer Prize. After reading it, I agree that it is a great book that deserves its fame.Harper Lee creates lovable, compassionate characters. Atticus Finch is the PERFECT man, therefore unrealistic, but hey it's a fictional story. Of course, there is no secret Lee modeled the characters in Mockingbird after real people in her life in Alabama. Lee is obviously Scout, her brother is Jem, and their childhood buddy Dill is Truman Capote.Even though much is made about the rape trial, this is really the backdrop story to Scout's, Jem's and Dill's plan to make the town recluse, Boo Radley, come out of his house. This sounds trivial, but Lee makes it work. It's actually interesting despite the fact nothing eventful happens until the end. One thing that bothers me is that Dill was not there when the \\"big thing\\" happened. Seems like Lee could have had it occur in another part of the season when Dill would be in Maycomb considering his invested interest for the previous two years. Other than this small nit-pick, Mockingbird is a warm, great, uncomplicatedly written, yet very complicated book. It's not complicated because of any great complexity. It's complicated because of the senselessness of racism and the seemingly helplessness of those who try to be fair."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Atticus Finch is the best role model for a father of any novel I have ever read. He is also the best role model for what a noble,decent and heroic human being would look like in every way that you would measure such a man. It is quite simply one of the most stirring, emotional and thought-provoking novels ever written. And depicted, as seen through the eyes of his children, in brilliant, humorous and touching ways.This is a must read for all who have lost faith in the goodness of the human spirit. A spirit that will live on in literature in the man called Atticus Finch."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Just re-read this book for the second time. I love this book. I LOVE this book. This time around I really found that Lee was reminiscent of Mark Twain. It makes me think of growing up and summertimes in north west Florida.I'm bumping it up a star. It was a great reminder of what I started law school for.25 Jun 2009I shockingly had never read this before. I picked it up because it was recommened as so-called 'legal fiction', and while I probably would fail to categorize it that way, it's still an amazingly elegant and brilliant book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a literary classic on many levels. The book was a landmark work written in the context of the burgeoning civil rights movement. Harper Lee was a born and bred Southerner and she provided detailed descriptions of what is was like to grow up in the South. Her analysis was not autobiographical, but she clearly explained the peculiar mores, religion, academic institutions, and social norms of the era. Her detailed descriptions had a great deal of authenticity.She described the pervasive institutional racism of 1930's Maycomb County, Alabama. Tom Robinson, a black man, was falsely accused of raping a white girl, Mayella Ewell. Atticus Finch was the lawyer who defended Robinson at the trial. Robinson was convicted despite spurious evidence and contradictory, inaccurate testimony on the part of the defendants. Scout and Jem finch were Tom's children. The story is written from Scout's perspective. She was a young grade school girl who came of age. Scout and her brother were forced to learn the sad reality of inequality and racism of the time.Lee was a talented wordsmith who described the setting and characters with intricate details. She was able to maintain suspense throughout the novel, especially regarding the recluse neighbor Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley. The story was always coherent and even minor characters in the book were memorable.In short, this book was a masterpiece of the highest order. It is a compelling tale from a narrative perspective. The social implications of the book are as relevant in the present day as when it was written. This is a tale about how children come to the realization that the world is not always fair and there are people who are victims of discrimination and violence. This is a phenomenal book, one of the very best and most significant novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It's been a very, very long time since I read To Kill a Mockingbird - maybe since I was in school myself. But teaching it to my students gave me the chance to explore the novel all over again and to remind myself just how masterful it truly is. What almost everyone remembers about the novel is the trial at the heart of it, and that's for good reason; it's still infuriating, disheartening, and effective, even all these years after the book's publication. But there's so much more to the novel; after all, the whole first half of the book is more about life in Maycomb, from the perils of the first day of school to the difficulties of navigating the complex social strata that make up the town (from middle class to the working poor to the white trash, from the whites to the blacks, from the foot-washing Baptists to the more moderate Baptists elsewhere in town). More than that, though, To Kill a Mockingbird immerses you in the perspective of a young girl who is only just beginning to understand the world, and that choice - to let Scout tell the tale, instead of the rapidly maturing Jem or the wise and thoughtful Atticus - is what really makes To Kill a Mockingbird so remarkable. Without Scout's narration, the novel could easily become any other novel about a Southern town, and the trial just another book about racism as perceived by the white folks who were almost entirely unaffected by it. But in letting Scout tell the story, it becomes a way of exploring the complexities of the world through the eyes of someone who understands none of them - and even more importantly, accepts none of them. That dramatic irony between what we know and what Scout knows makes the book even richer to explore, as we begin to realize that so much of what we take for granted flies in the face of the way we raise our children and expect them to live. If that sounds heavy-handed and moralizing, well, that's me, and not the book; in fact, To Kill a Mockingbird soars by telling its story without ever resorting to preaching, hectoring, or belaboring its points. Instead, it simply shows us a young girl who is forced to look at the uglier side of human nature, only to see that there may be more good in people than we think. It's a book that's rich in humanity, life, characterization, language, and so much more, and it's a tragedy that Harper Lee never wrote anything else in her life. But what could compare to such a perfect gem as this?"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Excellent classic book! One of my favorite classics.

Heck, none can. Like most people, I was introduced to this classic while in high school; it was one of the few books I was \\"force fed\\" that I ended up enjoying immensely. Over the years I've returned to this inspiring tale about growing up in the Depression South--a place that could be downright ugly and archaic, if not for the innocent point of view of 9-year-old Scout Finch. To Scout, life pretty much consists of trailing big brother Jem and Dill Harris--who spends summers in Maycomb with his aunt--in their adventures \\"outing\\" the local boogey man, Boo Radley. The harsh realities of intense segregation are lost on Scout; she's just a tomboy living in a small town with Jem and her attorney father, Atticus. It's not until Atticus agrees to defend a young black man accused of raping a white woman that Scout discovers a disquieting truth about her town. . .about the culture of racial prejudice. And Scout and Jem even become victims of this ugliness, until they are saved by a most unlikely hero.My goodness, can Ms. Lee write. Her prose is simple and direct--with this author less is definitely more--but her passages, descriptions, observations, and dialogues are mesmerizing. From a spinster neighbor showing Scout her bridge work, to the courtroom loft of African-Americans rising to their feet in tribute to Atticus, Lee's story brings Maycomb and its people to rich, dynamic life. Atticus Finch is a literary icon, and rightly so; a gentle, patient, and loving father to his motherless children, Atticus never does things because they are expedient, he does things because they are right, and because, as he tells Scout, he could never hold his head high if he didn't do the right thing. This is a character who flows through the narrative leading by example in the eyes of his children--in the eyes of the reader. I always feel it's redundant rhetoric whenever I hear someone lament that Harper Lee only wrote one novel. As flawless and as timeless as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is, what more would Lee have to show or prove?--D. Mikels, Esq."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"What makes a great book is great characters and that's what I found in Harper Lee's, To Kill a Mockingbird--great characters!

It's a classic novel that I am so glad that I took the time to read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this when I was 19 and I was completely blown away. By the end of the first chapter I didn't want to put it down. The characters, the conflicts, settings, descriptions -- somehow I felt as though I could not only picture it all, but that it had happened in my childhood neighborhood and that I had even witnessed some of the events, perhaps even participated! I'm sure that if I read it again today, I'd have a different reaction to it, seeing some of its flaws, like the lack of moral ambiguity demonstrated by some of the characters. For instance, Atticus is a one-dimensional saint. Tolerant, patient, understanding, unassuming and overflowing with integrity -- he's the father everyone wishes they could point to proudly, at least looking back from adulthood. No, he doesn't play football with Jem, but even Jem comes to realize Atticus is different somehow, better than everyone around him. Atticus never says anything even remotely questionable. Does he have a single flaw? Not unless you look under the surface.Lee and most readers (me included) gloss over the fact that Atticus has to be chosen to take the Tom Robinson case. Herein lies a crack in his shield of integrity -- and I don't think Lee intended for us to see that crack. I don't think even she knew it's there when she wrote it. If Atticus really did have so much integrity, he'd have volunteered to take the case. But given that it's the 1930s, no white lawyer would have done this. Not only was he guaranteed to lose, but he's guaranteed to lose with dishonor, even outright physical danger. It wouldn't have been believeable even for Atticus to volunteer. Still, if he had volunteered, how much more moral courage would he have shown? How much more grief would he have had to endure from his neighbors and relatives? I think Lee missed an opportunity there. But she also needed to have shown some of Atticus's flaws. Didn't he ever lose his temper with Scout? Didn't he ever do something he could have apologized for? No, Atticus is a superman.Nevertheless, the first time you read &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; the story and its telling are so good, the characters, their emotions and conflicts so universal, that you are completely distracted from any literary analysis. And that's what any good story does well, it makes you lose yourself in it.

My real reason for re-reading it, however, was for the purposes of comparison with Faulkner's \\"Intruder in the Dust\\", which deals with a similar theme. Indeed, I recently came across an allegation that Harper Lee's novel was essentially a plagiarism of Faulkner's.The book is set in Maycomb County, Alabama, during the depression era of the 1930s. It is a first-person narrative told through the eyes of Jean Louise Finch who, for some reason, goes by the nickname Scout. Although she is only a child at the time of the events described, the narrative voice is that of the adult Jean Louise looking back at her childhood from some point in the future. The action of \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" is set over a few days and tells the story of one single incident, the murder of Vinson Gowrie; \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is set over a period of about two years and essentially tells the story of Jean Louise's childhood between the ages of six and eight, although it concentrates on one crucial incident. The main characters, apart from Jean Louise herself, are her brother Jem and their friend Dill (another unexplained nickname; his real name is Charles).Jean Louise and Jem are the children of Atticus Finch, a widowed lawyer. The book's central incident is the trial of a black man, Tom Robinson, for the alleged rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell; Atticus is Robinson's defence attorney. Like Faulkner, Lee uses a classic thriller plot- the fight to prove the innocence of a man wrongly accused- to explore racism in America's Deep South. Although Robinson is clearly innocent of the charge, the all-white jury nevertheless vote to convict him, largely because to admit that a white woman, even one as sluttish as Mayella, was capable of making false accusations would force them to abandon their cherished ideas about the purity of Southern womanhood.Harper Lee's concerns are wider than just the race issue. The book also has a lot to say about attitudes to social class among the white community, contrasting affluent middle-class families like the Finches with the likes of the Ewells, who can quite literally be classified as poor white trash. The family live in a shack next to the town's rubbish dump, where Mayella's father Bob earns his living as a scavenger. A favourite saying of the liberal, tolerant Atticus, who believes that most people, when you get to know them, are essentially kind, is that you should never judge a man until you have stood in his shoes and walked around in them. (At times the tone seemed quite preachy, as though Harper Lee were writing an extended sermon on tolerance).Atticus applies this principle of non-judgementalism not only to racial issues but also to various acquaintances whom his children dislike or disapprove of for one reason or another. He applies it to Boo Radley, a simple-minded and reclusive, but inwardly kindly, neighbour, to the cantankerous old Mrs Dubose and to the Cunninghams, another poor white family but one who have retained a greater dignity and self-respect than the Ewells. The title of the book refers to a saying of Atticus that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird because they never do any harm, but it is a phrase which also refers to his philosophy of life. At various times several characters in the book- Robinson, Boo Radley, the children- can be seen as \\"mockingbirds\\", harmless creatures in need of protection.One problem with the book is that Lee never really explores the tension between Atticus's liberal philosophy of life, and the problem of human evil as exemplified in the book by Bob Ewell, who is neither misjudged nor misunderstood but just plain wicked. Not only does he give perjured evidence in the hope of getting an innocent man sent to the gallows, and encourages his daughter to do the same, he also makes a vicious and cowardly attack on Atticus's children. Trying to stand in such a man's shoes would not, I feel, be a very productive exercise.My other criticism of the book would be that it explores the question of racism from an exclusively white perspective, albeit a liberal one. For a number of reasons I think that \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a better book than \\"Intruder in the Dust\\", the most important being that Harper Lee's prose style is much more fluent and readable than Faulkner's often impenetrable sentences. Nevertheless, Faulkner creates, in Lucas Beauchamp, a black character who is much more well-rounded than any of those in Lee's book. Tom Robinson is little more than a plot device; the most prominent black character is Calpurnia, the Finch family's maid, who is that common literary stereotype, the faithful black servant. The book would have been better if Lee had given us a black perspective on the events she describes.Those criticisms apart, I found this an excellent book, with a number vividly drawn characters, especially the spirited, loveable young Jean Louise and her father, who was memorably played by Gregory Peck in the brilliant film adaptation. Despite the limitations of his world view Atticus is an admirable character, who shows, in his defence of Robinson, not only great moral courage but also great physical courage as well. The immense improvement which has taken place in race relations in America since 1960 is owed, in part, to men like Atticus Finch, and also to women like Harper Lee who were prepared to confront the endemic racist attitudes of their society."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is an amazing book.

The main conflict in the book was about Atticus trying to win a rape trial including a black guy.The book was very exciting to read. I thought it was exciting because the trial kept going back and fourth and I never knew who was going to win. I was not able to feel in the book because the time period was way off and I couldn't make many connections to the book. The main conflict was very interesting because I never knew who was going to win the trial and it always kept me guessing. I thought that characters in the book were very realistic because the author explained them perfect and made them face real life situations. I thought that the ending was a bit disappointing, but it was what I was expecting. I wasn't so happy with the ending because the person that won in the trial wasn't the one I wanted to win.The author wrote with a narrative southern voice. The author's voice was southern like the characters. The author uses vocabulary in a very interesting way. He uses difficult words through out the book but they aren't to difficult that you can't understanding them. I think the author wrote in a very unique way. It was really unique when the author talked in a southern voice like the characters did. The author also explained everything so perfect which made the book one hundred times better. The author used a lot of dialogue in this book. The author had to use a lot of dialogue because of the trial and there were a ton of people talking at different times. I thought that this author wrote this book perfect. He explained everything perfectly for me and I always knew what was happening.I would give this book an eight out of ten. I give it this rating because I am not very satisfied with the ending but it was overall a great book. I recommend this book to kids thirteen and older because they will understand it a whole lot better. I also recommend this book to people who want a very good book that is challenging.Overall I thought that this was a great book. I really thought the author did a good job writing this book and I am looking forward to other books written by him. I think the greatest thing about this book is how the author always keeps you guessing through the trial and never gave away who was going to win during the book. Something I didn't mention in previous sections was that Atticus' kids were afraid of the neighbor's house because he never came out and they never saw him and they thought he was like a mass murderer or something. The neighbor was overall a great guy and the kids noticed that during the book. If you want to know more about the book then go out and read it yourself because if I told you more I would give the book away."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I loved it.

This book is full of wisdom and tolerance far before its time, and has detailed, colorful characters. Sure, the movie's good, and Gregory Peck does make a wonderful Atticus, but you'll never know what a truly unforgettable character Atticus really is unless you read the book. Because Atticus Finch IS the heart of the book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The best way I can think of to describe \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is that Harper Lee has managed to take a period of time from the 1930's Deep South and transform that into a novel. From the reviews I've seen, the depth with which this novel is written is often understated. The setting and the characters are so well drawn, and done so subtly, that I couldn't help but be pulled in.I also find that reviews understate the scope of the story. Alot of the time people focus on the trial, and the theme of racism, but it's so much more than that. The story touches on issues of gender, class, and religion. It touches on compassion and empathy, and justice. But, as with all detailed, complex, and well-realised stories, there's a greater depth to things, despite how simple everything seems on the surface.There are two plots here. The first, introduced in the opening chapter, spans the whole novel. It's through this plot that the entire story moves. We get to see and experience life in Maycomb, as well as the children's quest to see Boo Radley. Basically, this plot is character-driven. This story is subtle; it's something you'll probably understand from the read, but will have to think about to articulate it.The second plot is the trial. While this is, essentially, the heart of the book, it couldn't be written this well without everything else. This is introduced subtly, and is built-up over the course of the story. This is really done quite well; Lee starts with small details, then the details and events get increasingly larger, more immediate, more important. More background is established, and everything is made clear. One event leads to another, and I was dragged along with it. Even when the narrative isn't focused on the trial, it has a purpose, albeit an indirect one. It's like easing into a warm bath.The writing is consistently tight. I don't recall seeing an unnecessary word, or a poorly written sentence, and I'm a pedant about these things. Everything on the page, every scene, has relevance; the amount of space given to it is, more or less, directly proportionate to the importance of what's happening. And even though long periods of time are often skipped or reduced into a paragraph or two, the shift in time is worked smoothly.The characterisation is also great. I found almost all the characters compelling in their own way. They're complex people, and almost all the character cast are sympathetic in one way or another. There's also alot of conflict, and moral dilemmas on top of that. All of the main characters are written excellently, with a resonating solidity. And when these characters are going through tough moments, and being torn apart inside, we're not beaten over the head with it. It's handled delicately, yet the narrative doesn't wallow in it, and Lee isn't concerned with emotional dramatics.And the social commentary is great. Some may complain about preaching to the choir, but I feel an ever-present reminder is appropriate given the frequency with which the message can be conveniently ignored. But again, we're not beaten over the head with the themes, they're just often present. Not to mention that the message is conveyed precisely, and with such an underlying strength to add to the book's power.Combine all these together, and you end up with a formidable book. I thoroughly enjoyed this, found the story engaging, and looking back my fondness of it only grows.5/5"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Liked this copy of the classic novel because it was hardback (which I prefer)but it was used/cheap which I like better!The story is classic and I read it 50 yrs. ago when it first came out.It's a great 'snapshot' of the south during the 30's and isesp. unique because Dad was a single parent.

Scout and Jem adore their father, Atticus, who is a lawyer. Their mother has died and Calpurnia is their African American housemaid who cares for them most of the time. They have a friend who visits each summer and the three of them have plans to get their reclusive neighbor Boo Radley out of his house. Scout is a precocious narrator whose innocence leaps off the page. Scout is a pants wearing, tree climbing, tough girl much to her aunt's chagrin.Around 1934, a black man is accused of raping a white girl. Atticus Finch agrees to defend Tom Robinson in court even though he knows he is going to lose. This is a hard lesson for Scout and Jem. People call them names and start fights but Atticus is firm in the belief that you must fight for truth and what you believe in, no matter what. The trial of Tom Robinson is convincing and like the children, the reader roots for the defendant. As Scout and Jem lose their innocence and learn the world is not a fair place for all, the reader is reminded of history and injustice.To Kill a Mockingbird is historical fiction at its finest. Maycomb, Alabama may be a fictional place but the reality of a southern small town, full of racist attitudes and a social class system that perpetuates a hatred of the lower class, is and was very much alive across America. Lee has written a book about the loss of innocence children face as they grow up and discover the world is not equal. To Kill a Mockingbird is at times, funny, poignant, and heart-breaking. It is truly an American classic.To Kill a Mockingbird won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961. It is the only book written and published by Harper Lee. The book is currently read nationwide in schools. However, I never read it in school or college.My son Max brought a copy of To Kill a Mockingbird home and said his English class was reading the book. I was shocked that he was assigned this book as a 7th grader. I read To Kill a Mockingbird about 20 years ago and decided it was the perfect time to reread it alongside my son. Reading this book as a parent gave me a different perspective. What age did you read To Kill a Mockingbird? What is the right age or grade to assign To Kill a Mockingbird to students?"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"If you are only to read one classic book in your life, this is the one to read. Harper Lee beautifully describes life in Maycomb, Alabama and creates characters that jump off the pages. With the narration of Scout Finch, the novel has a childlike innocence, but still deals with serious topics. The idea that a story can be told through a child's eyes, stripping away all adult jadedness is remarkable and deserves all the praise it has been given.It is a must read for anyone who considers themselves well-versed in literature.I also suggest reading the book prior to seeing the movie, but both are great!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In, To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, we see two parts with two problems that are developed over time. In Part 1, we see the setting of a \\"sleepy Southern town,\\" in this case, Maycomb County in the year 1935. This part talks about mainly Scout and Jem coping with the people that they do not particularly favor and trying to get along with them. There are three important characters that have major roles in this story. Scout is an eight year old girl who cares for her brother and father and is expected to grow up. Jem is the older brother of Scout and also copes with growing up. Atticus is the father of Jem and Scout and is a righteous man and lawyer. In Part 2, we see a real visible conflict in which there is a young, black man named Tom Robinson who is convicted of raping white Mayella Ewell, the son of Bob Ewell (who also has a relatively big part in this story). We also see the scene where Scout is at the school play and things start to unfold.The pace in this novel is not too slow and not too fast; events happen at a realistic pace. The characters in this story were likeable because you have the conflicting sides of good people and bad people. The good people in this story, such as Scout and Atticus, are troubled with the people who claim to be let's say innocent but nobody knows what to think. I think the theme of this novel is to respect the dignity that belongs to us all and/or respect those who may not seem respectable.I would recommend this classic novel to those who are looking for an example of human rights offenses and defenses and those who are looking for a fantastic and classic read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I really love this book.

I bought several copies, this one the mass market paperback. My grandkids won't have trouble seeing it, but after getting used to reading on my Kindle, I don't think my \\"old\\" eyes can read mass market paperbacks anymore!

I enjoyed it a lot b/c it showed the discrimination down in the south in those days. Stuff like that still happens today, but probably not as much as when it happened then. My favorite character was probably Jem Finch, b/c he was a good character, and always looked over for Scout. Scout, I liked a lot because she was the narrator, but told such an indepth story of what it felt like living in that prejudice town. As for Boo Radley, he was a good character as well. You just had to know who he was before you made any comments about him. All in all, this was one of my favorite books because no one ever has a fair life, and in this story is it true."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harpee Lee has proven to america that great literasture exists. In this novel I found myself crying, suprised, laughing and in awe at the ending. I was shocked at the way the world could have actually treated someone becasue the color of their skin but at the same time be unbearably sick that not many protested it. In many ways it made me laugh, the several attempts the children made to try and get Boo Radley out of the house and the stories that they seemed so facinated over(especially the one about Boo stabbing his father in the knee as if nothing and then just continuing his normal life). Lastly I was in shock because after all the evidence brought to the jury they still seemed to find the black man guilty. This book proved to be amusing when Boo finally came out and the son was not around to see him. I must admit that I also cried when the old lady died and the son was trying to stay mad at her for making him read to her but couldn't because before she died she made ammends. This is a great, classic, novel and would read it to my children or just for my own pleasure in a second"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, is an excellent novel. I found it touching, sorrowful, and humorous. It is about two children's experiences with prejudice and racism as they grow and mature in a small southern town. Their father, Atticus, is one of the few open minded people in Maycomb, their town. He is appointed to judge a black man in a case where the black is charged with the rape of a white woman. Even though Atticus does his very best, reason and truth can not hold out over racism and hatred. However, the trial is not the only focus of the book. Another important theme is that of &quot;Boo Radley,&quot; the town recluse, who has not been seen in years. The children, Jem and Scout (Scout is Jem's little sister), are interested in seeing Boo, and try several times to give him a note or look in his shutters to see him. At one point in the story, soap dolls and other presents show up in a knothole in a tree for the children. One of the important parts of the story is when Scout and Jem see their father, Atticus, who they percieved as old and useless, shoot a mad dog that is coming down their street, thus learning that he &quot;was the deadest shot in Maycomb County in his day.&quot; All in all, this book, with its themes of growth and maturity, hatred, pride, and love is one of the best that you could read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It was a really excellent book.

It is the story of a white family living in the rural south during the 1930s. This family is faced with many challenges in such a short span of time. The reader gets to see how the family grows both together and apart and also how it copes with its day to day life. This book deals with such issues as racism, neighborhood togetherness and the bonds that either grow or are lost between parents and children as they grow together. This book focuses on the strength of the family institution and it gives insight into the way we (and the world at large) were. Life has definitely changed since this book was written 37 years ago, but in the same respect, it has changed many people who have read it. This is that people for ages to come will both love and enjoy."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Ren Marc SerranoEnglish Acc. 10 pr.2August 16, 2006A Book That Influenced My LifeA book that influence my life would be the book To Kill A Mocking Bird by Harper Lee.This is a book that took place in a small town in Alabama some where between the 1800's - 1900's the days when blacks were supposedly free but were still segregated from the whites. In the story, we are taken in by thoughts of what seems to be an old women looking back to her childhood. The book which is in the first view point of view, uses the mind of a child to relate with the reader. As the narrator describes her life when she was a child and one important event in her life which will be highlighted for the rest of her life, the story continues to represent and express so much that will teach a valuable lesson to the reader.This book has influenced my life in many ways, one way that it has influenced my life was from the topic of the story. Following from the plot itself, this book teaches you the value of life and how even though we try so much to make life fair, there are still people who will keep it unfair for their selfness reasons. Considering a moral like this, it may see as if the book was not good or is very gloomy, well this is not the case. This book still has many morals to it as for respecting others and teaches about growing up. Before I read this book I was a person who thought fairness was the key to having the \\"right\\" life, as I was told while growing up. After reading this book my perspective of life changed, knowing that life can't always be fair, but as to live life to the fullest and to never look negative among things, but to respect what happens and keep moving.To Kill A Mocking Bird brought me the attention of what people use to be back in the times of the book and what people still are now a days. Covering the issues or racism, segregation, rape, and death all explained to the narrator which is only 5 -8 years old. This shows that you cant hide the truth about what some human beings are and the situations of life that occur almost everyday some where around the world.After finishing the book you will come to realize that the world is a crucial place and it brings you to a reality that everything isn't always safe. That in which in the end keeps the reader filled with questions and wanting to know more in the real world.From this book I have learned the following things that will guide me in the future and my life. I have learned the values of life and that every human being should be treated as equals. There is no need to segregate others because of the color of ones skin or what class they are in society. I have also learned that life is not always going to be fair, and that the world goes around but not the people, meaning everyone is similar in some ways and we all live in one world but no one is exactly the same, and because of this there won't be all kind hearted people in the world. Some are heartless and that is why there are kind people who help keep control over these people who can be heartless and ruthless.The style that Harper Lee uses in To Kill A Mocking Bird, revolves around the narration of the book. Using first person point of view, she begins to describe what a five year old girl would see and becomes that five year old girls. Most of the story is told in first person in the eyes of a five year old, but the narration will then switch to the omniscient point of view for the reader to understand what is going on in the society. Because Harper Lee uses this as her style the reader begins to understand what goes on in the mind of a little girl."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In the book, To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee shows the values in life that we should all go by. Scout, a young girl, her brother Jem, and Atticus Finch are a family that lives in the early 1900's in a small town called Maycomb. It's a racist town that discriminates against black people. Their father takes on a trial of defending a black man, Tom Robinson, who has been tried with rape. He feels that is morally right, and that it would be a sin to not do it, just like killing a mockingbird, one of the most harmless animals on earth. My reaction to the Novel was that I feel like we all live life in the way that we shouldn't. We should use the sang \\"It's a Sin to kill a mockingbird\\". To me, it's a way of expressing how we should treat each other. We should all help each other out, even in the worst possible situations. We should help someone, even if the people around us will hate us for it. It would be something that would be right to do and it would be a nice thing for our life. It also makes me take life a little bit slower. We shouldn't rush through things just to get it done, and we shouldn't rush through it so we don't have to experience the pain/sorrow. We should all help each other. I recommend this because we could all learn something from it. How it can help us later and now in life. How we can help people in need. It's a very good book that anyone would enjoy. It will take you to a place that you would least expect to read about in the active life we live today. It would teach us true meanings about life. Anyone can read it, and they will probably like it. I didn't want to read it at first, and it thought it would be boring. But I got into it quickly and it taught me something and I never expected to."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee is set in a small town in Alabama called Maycomb. This book is told in first person through a young girl named Scout's eyes. Scout's dad, Atticus is a lawyer who is fighting for a black man accused of rape. Scout notices how all of her white neighbors think of Atticus and the black person he is defending. This perspective shows how cruel, racist, and unjust this small town in Alabama really is, and how it seems her family is the only white family to notice. She is taunted by her fellow acquaintances and everyone teases her about her family, and especially her dad. Her family must cope through many different people with all the same opinion, in order to achieve justice. This influential book shows both how atrocious and great human nature can be. I really enjoyed this book, and the powerful message that it conveys. I thought all of the characters were likeable in all different areas, no matter how mean they appeared. This book showed me just how much human nature can both help and tear apart even the smallest community, and only with knowledge can communities be mended."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I absolutely adore this book.

This allows for the perspective of an innocent eye initially in the novel, though as time progresses and matters become more serious this outlook it easily taken aback because of the increasing maturity of the child. Harper Lee takes her time in getting to the story, though this sort of writing, which first builds a familiarity with the characters before setting the personalities they contain into conflict, allows for a more rich experience in the climax."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This was an awesome book! At first I thought it was going to be boring because it was thick and it had small print, it was also a in literature assignment, but when the class started reading it was eye opening.

The thing that really made me think was all of the prejudice. I couldn't believe that people would do such things. So, if you are looking for soemthing eye opening, exciting, and just plain funny i would suggest that you read this book. It was one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Well I loved this book.I was travelling around in India at the time of reading, didn't have much choice of literature and just thought I'd read a bunch of classics. This was one of them, and for the people who said this was difficult to read...I cannot understand where you are coming from. This was a dream to read, I couldn't stop myself, I stayed up at night just to read this. The characters - Scout, Jem, Atticus, Dil and Miss Maude being my favourites - are captivating and it is so easy to empathise with them.Some weird reviewer boasted having an IQ of 140 and not liking TKAM. That is completely irrelevant - how can you imagine your review is more reliable simply because you have a logical mind? Artistic appreciation is not measured in a number. Just like your musicality is not measured by your ability to read music.This is human drama at its best - if you're interested in people and their relationships then this will be a most rewarding read. If you're looking for an action-packed book, I wouldn't say this is it, but there are some intriguing plotlines and twists that I enjoyed very much.The reason that this book did not get five stars from me is simply because it didn't make me cry or laugh out loud that much. It did stir considerable emotion in me, but it is not the best book I have ever read. I loved the character of Atticus - although he may be a little bit too good to be true in the given context. But you never know :-DHaving said that, I enjoyed reading this book profusely and would recommend it to anyone in search of a modern classic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's classic novel about Southern injustice during the 1930's provides a memorable read. The story is told through the nostalgic eyes of Scout Finch, who describes her days as a young school girl living with her brother Jem and father Atticus Finch, a widowed attorney and very humane and courageous man. Scout is a combination of still-innocent school girl and analytical thinker, and as she is puzzled by the cruelties and irrational feelings of certain adults. The story centers on several themes, the most notable of which is Tom Robinson's trial. Robinson is a black laborer falsely accused of raping a white woman. Atticus Finch is appointed his public defender, and during the course of the trial Robinson's innocence becomes obvious to Scout and Jem (and to the reader). But will evidence clearing a black man be enough to persuade the all-white jury in Alabama during the segregation era?This moving narrative was made into an equally good 1962 movie starring Gregory Peck and Mary Badham. The book and movie both arrived as the Southern establishment was still opposing racial fairness. Some complain that this book is largely irrelevant given the realities of today's ghettos, but it remains a moving read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is a must read. Harper Lee has just actually drawn out the entire book by using descriptive scenes, Southern dialogues, and a variety of mood. She also vividly described the 1930s typical town environment that mingles with the Great Depression. Harper Lee has placed herself in a 6 year-old child's feet, giving the readers a funny and enjoyable perspective of what a little girl would think of reality and the cruel world.The story begins when Scout (the narrator and the major character) introduces and brings us back to her past during the year where her brother broke his arm. The book portrays Scout as a child who is advanced her age. Her behavior and actions are barely like a girl, but more like a carefree boy. Instead of crying and screaming when she is upset, she punches people. During the story, many conflicts happen. Scout and his friends try to force a spooky and notorious man out of his house. They later also witness the case where his father defends an African American who is accused of raping a white girl. This case hits disturbing waves in the town, causing his father's reputation to go down.Even though this book is nearly 300 pages, it becomes very short when one starts reading. Other than the major conflict of the \\"Rape\\" case, the book contains paragraphs anecdotes, characters' analysis, and setting portrayals. And because of these, the entire story seems more like a picture rather than a literature. Reading the novel, you can see many elements such as the problem of discrimination, prejudice, class, and sex. This novel is like 2 books in one: an adventure and a history book. I would advise people to read this book for sure. It wins a 100% of my approval and recognition!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"TKAMB is a story full of lessons to learn. I first read this book in the first or second grade. Since then I read it once a year. One of the most in depth lessons is the one To Kill A Mockingbird. WHen Jem and Scout get air guns for CHRISTmas their father tells them to shoot as many Bluebirds as they like but to never shoot a mockingbird. WHy?? Because a mockingbird doesn't do anything to hurt anyone or anything. Although ugly don't kill it. All it does is sing beautiful music. You can apply this to 2 situations. Tom Robinson resembles a mocking bird because he is innocent and didn't do anything to hurt anyone and he tried to help yet because of his race he was found guilty and murdered. Then, when Boo Radley saved Jem and Scout, Scout came to the conclusion that putting Boo on trial for killing Mr. Ewell would be just like killing a mockingbird so therefore it was wrong.

KhauP. 5Scout Finch is the main character of the book. She lives with Jem and Atticus, her brother and father. She has no mother because her mother died. Scout meets a boy named Dill and they become friends. Scout, her brother, and Dill act out stories together. Dill hears about a house on their street called the Radley Place. One day they find mysterious presents left for them. The children guess that it is from Boo, who is Mr. Nathan Radley's brother. Then one day, the three children sneak into the Radley Place and lots of trouble awaits them there. They get shot at by Nathan Radley, and try to escape. After they escape, a fire breaks and a blanket is slipped onto Scout's shoulders. She thinks that it was Boo and she tells her father about it. After that, Atticus gets involved a trial involved Tom Robinson. Tom was accused of raping a white woman.I liked this book because there were many surprises in it. One part that surprised me was when the children snuck in the Radley Place and heard a gunshot. \\"Halfway through the collards I tripped; as I tripped the roar of a shotgun shattered the neighborhood.\\" This sentence was from the book and it was described well. It told exactly what happened with good details without confusing the readers. I was getting a little bored because there was not much going on. It didn't have much war and fighting like some of the books I read before. The book had more complicated situations, and was about how some white people could be racist.Most of the book was interesting although I disliked the fact that this book was pretty long. I had to rush through the book and finish it in time to write this review. I also don't like the way the book has a lot of parts where there is nothing much but conversations and I get bored. An example of this is near the very beginning. \\"We stared at him until he spoke:\\" After that sentence was when I started to get bored. However, there are some parts in the book that you read and suddenly jump up and get really interested.My favorite part was near the end when Boo saved the kids. It showed how the evil and prejudice in this world can be stopped. Boo stabs Ewell, but he does not get arrested. The sheriff tries to protect Boo and lies that Ewell tripped over a root and stabbed himself."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I LOVE this book. One of my all time favorite books.

Not knowing exactly what it was about except for the rape of a white girl and the charge of a black man it sounded like &quot;a time to kill&quot; to me, but it is anything but that book.i found myself laughing at this novel because of Lee's quick wit and clever characters. Calpurnia i found made me laugh the most. She was so blunt and hard on the children and always had something smart to say to them.Beginning the book i thought the two children were boys. Lee never mentions (or at least i didn't notice) that Jean was was a girl. They called her scout and she didn't want to seem like a girl when she played with Dill and Jem. I was pretty amazed to find out she was a girl and i loved the way she acted. Always wanting to follow her older brothers lead and wanting to marry dill.Boo Radley (the scary man that haunts the town of Maycomb, who never leaves his house and might be dead) fueled the beginning of the book. Lee writes amazingly about children and their comical antics. It reminded me of the way i used to be.While the town of Maycomb thought Atticus (the children's father) was not fathering his children right, i came to love him. His sence of reasoning and hearing each of the children out before making any rash decisions. He was always so calm no matter what happened and could never be seen without reading. he was an intelligent man that the town should have looked up to instead of looking down on him. He let his children do what they wanted, but for their own good. With this freedom the children could learn right from wrong (of course with guidance) and be who they wanted.To Kill a Mockingbird is also about the hypocrisy that faces us. During the middle of the book it is brought to Scout's attention by her teacher that it is wrong to kill Jews because they are so law abiding, faithful and help out their communities so well, but Scout wonders why her teacher could feel this way about Jews and not feel this way about blacks.This novel reaffirmed my appreciation for how far we have come with civil rights. The book does not only deal with this, but it is a strong vaild point. In order to get where we are now (and we still have a long way to go) we needed people in communities like Atticus who would take the looks and stares from his neighbors in order to defend what he thought was right. He defended a black man when the town said he shouldn't have just so he was able to look in his children's eyes. He wanted them to see that everyone is equal and sometimes the right thing is the hardest thing to do.OVERALL: To kill a mockingbird is a novel everyone should read. Its wit and humor make the message of this book even more brighter to see. While i did not find this book suspensful till the end (which i must add had a GREAT ending) i found myself wanting to turn each page because i was enjoying myself while reading about the city of Maycomb. Lee makes you feel as though you live right next to the Fitch's and are sitting on your portch watching the summer days go by."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The more I read of this book, the more I learned to love it. Who has read enough John Grisham books but is still interested in reading about law and justice and the means to oppose these, try this book, that fascinates by its great emotions that let the reader feel with little Scout."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This unforgettable novel told through the eyes of a child is moving, compassionate, and touching. It expresses innocence, love, and kindness, but at the same time, shows cruelty and hatred. It's a masterpiece of literature!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is in my opinion is about the mockingbirds that we never are never considerate too. In this book you experience the true racism there was in the south. Lee does a great job of describing the settings and original characters. But there is one critical mistake the author makes she makes Atticus to be such a good character and not believable. Attius is made out to be the perfect character the flawless one. HE is tooooo perfect. Anyways it was a great book and i recommend it to ages 11 and up. It is a great book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This was a great book that leaves the reader touched. Im only in 8th grade and enjoyed it tremendously.

Thank godness Ms. Lee didn't give up, and continued re-writing this novel for the more than five years it took to bring to fruition. Some people grow up and become famous; Scout, Jem, and Dill never grow up, and they are immortal. Like HUCK FINN, each time I pick it up, I don't find more in the book, I find more in myself, and I am sure this is true of everyone who reads it. I have taught this book to students for more than 20 years, and it is without a doubt the one book that is overwhelmingly positively received among all those that I have shared with my classes. More than one student has come back years later to remark that he/she has reread it over the years, and continues to be enriched by it. This would be THE book to share with your own children, and both you and they would be far better for having done so than spending those hours in front of the television."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I too was first introduced to Scout by an English teacher and in a way was introduced to myself. I am so greatful for reading To Kill A Mockingbird at such a young age. It was not until I read it again as an adult that I realized how it helped to shape my life. Trying to explain what the book is about is like trying to explain how it feels to be happy or sad or angry. A summary tells you the story. You need to read To Kill A Mockingbird to get the feeling. It helps replace the innocence we lose as we get older. I read it every so often to keep me in check."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"From begining to end this book gave me a sense of relating to other people and the way other people live and feel and some of the tragedies if this world. It was truly a mind opening experience, i had to do a book report on this book and i found it most interesting. Scout was like the link between you and the book, you almost forget shes a fictional character. To actually be able to see the world through the eyes of this little girl is truly amazing, sometimes we take people we know, or think we know for granted. This book is th best example of misjudging people we love. i've done my best to tell you how good this book is .... you'll have to read it for yourself to really understand. this book is for people of all ages.I recommend it to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"From begining to end this book gave me a sense of relating to other people and the way other people live and feel and some of the tragedies of this world.

I don't like it that much, becuase there is to much drama. The main reason I read it is because my teacher made our class read it for a grade and I really do not need a F on my report card. It's full of rasism, and takes place a Long time ago in a small town in Alabama. I would recommend it to people who are addicted to drama."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In my opinion, this book suffered from various major problems. First of all, the plot line was weak, The characters did nothing but wonder around the town tring to coax Boo Radly out of his house. Second of all, the characters interaction seemed forced, they behaived like they could not stand each other. The Third and final deterant is the ending, for almost 200+ pages(out of 281)the almost unbearable wondering ends with the description of a boring trial and an obscure presentation of the final climax and resolution. Half way through the book I was just wishing a bunch of mockingbirds would fly in and end everyones misery (mine included)."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Classic books are like chicken-pox, I think - if you aren't exposed to them as a child, they hit you much harder as an adult.So maybe that's why I liked this book: for some reason, it was never foisted upon me while I was pupating in high school (which is the kiss of death for any good fiction, really - even if by some miracle you like it on first read, you will HATE it by the time you and 29 other inmates finish beating it to death as part of a six-weeks unit.)I have a different notion, though. See, we all know that To Kill a Mockingbird is right there next to Uncle Tom's Cabin, the Jungle, the Grapes of Wrath, and Silent Spring on the shelf labeled \\"Books That Changed America.\\" We wouldn't force-feed it to legions of teenagers otherwise.Having suffered through a number of these Very Important Books in my time, I've come up with my own yard stick for quality: if you can still enjoy the book without giving a fig about the message, then what you have in your hands is fine story-telling beyond a doubt. That's the hard thing with novels like this one: they were written for a generation for whom this conflict loomed huge and divisive and massively controversial, while we in the 21st century (well, most of us, anyway) already know that \\"because he's all kinds of black\\" isn't a valid reason to convict anybody. In a sense, some of these seminal writers might be victims of their own success: because they worked such a number on generations previously, we the current crop of humanity have been indoctrinated with the message so long and effectively as to resent seeing it spelled out for us yet again. It's enough to make any Clearasil consumer throw up his or her hands and say \\"I get it already - GOSH!\\"So I guess what really won me over with this book is that even going into it knowing that there would be a fellow named Tom Robinson who would be wrongfully accused because of his skin color, and a family of Finches who would endeavor to demonstrate why that was unfair, I still enjoyed myself from start to finish. (I remember being on about page 80, actually, thinking \\"boy, all this Boo Radley business sure is entertaining, but how can she get away with messing about with all this funny redneck kids'-stuff when she hasn't even got the plot started?\\" - little realizing that I was already hip-deep in it!) The fact that the author avoids a lot of the high hurdles of \\"classic literature\\" - no pages upon pages of scenery-chewing introspection and endless ten-dollar vocabulary words here! - probably doesn't hurt either.And that's about the size of it: as Very Important Books go, this is a great one to read of your own free will. If you were beaten about the head and shoulders with it during your formative years, or had it ruined for you by the endlessly orgasmic praises of English teachers and high-nosed literary types, then I would submit that those folks owe you and Harper Lee a sincere apology."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I know more than one person who considers To Kill a Mockingbird their favorite book. My friend Bob cherishes his first edition and speaks glowingly of the time when the author signed his copy. Ms. Lee, who grew up in Monroeville, Alabama, was a young child during the famous Scottsboro, Alabama Case (nine black men were accused of raping two white women). This apparently had a significant influence on her as she wrote the book in the late 1950's. It was published at the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961, and two years later was made into an Academy Award winning film with Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch.It's an endearing story told through the eyes of a nine year old girl, Scout, and it meant several things to me:It affirms that goodness ultimately overcomes evil, but always at a cost.It condemns racial prejudices--as well as the fear and prejudices directed toward the Boo Radley's of the world (who in the end becomes the protector and a symbol of goodness).Innocents can and do suffer from man's stupidity, e.g. Tom Robinson. The title is really about innocence, as Miss Maudie explains: \\" Mockingbird's don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\"It reinforced a personal belief--that people are not basically good--a worldview leading to the assumption that everything bad a person does, is society's fault. I believe that people are born innocent and we grow up absorbing, learning, and understanding that good and evil are a part of us, if we ever grow up to maturity, that is. What Atticus Finch teaches his children is to understand that evil is a part of the world and we should treat people with empathy, as though we were \\"walking in their shoes.\\" His understanding and treatment of crass old Mrs. Dubose was a lesson in patient understanding--her life was mixed with great courage yet she was openly racist, which Atticus abhorred. Like most, she was a person blended with both good and bad qualities of personality.I found it interesting that, in the end, the protection afforded by Boo Radley was built on a lie of what happened on that dark path from the school pageant to home. It raises unanswered questions....I read in an old magazine that Harper Lee lives half her time in New York and half in Alabama. She is no recluse--she can be seen in shops and restaurants--but she rarely gives interviews and most people wouldn't recognize her if they saw her. She has always lived a normal and comfortable life, not the life of a celebrity author. To Kill a Mockingbird is her only published book and one gets the sense that she doesn't really care--she said everything she had to say about life in her one great book. I think I would like this woman."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"When I was in high school, many of the English classes had this book as required reading. For some reason, my English class did not cover this book in their curriculum.I read this book later in life (after college, etc.). Harper Lee wrote a book that is not only interesting in its topic but her style of writing is concise- yet very clear and descriptive. \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is a great book for anyone to read- but I wish I read this book when I was in high school (or even younger). Why is that the case?

CGR"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I highly recommend this book to all people. Even though it is a book that it is required in most school district curriculums, To Kill a Mockingbird is very entertaining, and also has many benefits to society. Instead of getting the indecent values that the regular media tends to give on the radio, television, and the internet, this book will inspire people to be virtuous. Atticus Finch is the hero that children need. The youth of America will learn about being courageous, considerate, and most importantly candor. This will be a refreshing change when compared to Tiger Woods, and the members of Jersey Shore. Not only will this increase responsibility and virtue, but by reading a book instead of watching television, attention spans can be lengthened. This novel will entertain, it will inspire many, and it will provide a change. I thoroughly enjoyed reading To Kill a Mockingbird and would urge many of you to read it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I have spent a lifetime avoiding reading \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" The idea of a novel told from the perspective of a child was not appealing, and every time I would pick it up to read it I'd be repelled by back-cover blurbs hailing it a \\"masterpiece of American literature,\\" an \\"unforgettable novel of childhood\\" that \\"takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos.\\" Something about the endless encomiums in lieu of an actual plot description made me suspicious. I was thinking, \\"Yes, it won the Pulitzer, I'm sure that it's well-written, blah blah blah...but it's probably really boring.\\"I'm here to tell you that it's not boring at all. To me, the great surprise of reading \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" was the discovery that it is a fast-paced and exciting story. The action takes place in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, during The Great Depression. The narrator is a young girl named Scout, a tomboy who spends much of her time beating other kids up. There are two plots, really. The first, a mystery of sorts, centers upon the neighborhood recluse, Boo Radley, whom hardly anyone has seen since he committed a violent crime against his father as a young man. The second plot follows the story of a black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a local white woman. Scout's father, Atticus, is the town's lawyer and has been appointed by the court to defend Tom. In a small, Southern, racist town, Atticus's willingness to serve as Tom's attorney and his obvious desire to defend his client to the best of his ability doesn't go over well with Maycomb's white residents. This second plot (breathlessly described by the book's back cover as \\"the crisis of conscience that rocked a sleepy Southern town\\") easily could have followed a predictable trajectory. I was ready for the pat ending in which all of the loose ends are tied up and everybody goes home happy and all the of the racists realize that they were wrong. The author, Harper Lee, doesn't stoop to this. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" doesn't offer easy answers. The reason why this novel is a classic is because it recognizes the complexity of human character as it addresses fundamental issues of right and wrong, but it does so in such a way that the reader isn't aware of being carried \\"to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, etc.\\" The reader is just thinking, \\"This is some damn good storytelling.\\"The characters seem real for good reason. The character of Dill is based upon Harper Lee's childhood neighbor, Truman Capote. I just learned from Wikipedia that Lee's father was an attorney who defended two black men accused of murder. Intriguingly, \\"down the street from the Lees lived a family whose house was always boarded up; they served as the models for the fictional Radleys. The son of the family got into some legal trouble and the father kept him at home for 24 years out of shame.\\"This is a great book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I bought this book because I had downloaded \\"Hey, Boo...\\" which discusses the story in detail.

I wanted to download it to my ipod or Kindle -- no such luck. Which is my only complaint. So, when my desire to read the book overcame my need for a high tech version, I bought the book.

Thank you so much for the nice packaging and quick shipment."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"One of those classic pieces of literature that I just finally got around to reading, \`To Kill a Mockingbird' is everything people say it is and more. Yes, hype and praise and accolades and, well, the undying respect for this novel is more than well deserved. I'm just ashamed that it has taken me this long to finally read it. Harper Lee's highly recognizable story is one that completely grabs you from its opening and keeps you in its grasp until the very end. This is coming from someone who has seen the movie multiple times and has even seen it performed in live theater. I know this story inside and out and I was STILL completely engulfed in the novel; every sentence strung along to perfection.The prose may seem rather simple on the outset, but it is the morality play between the lines that really ignites this fantastic slice of American literature.\`To Kill a Mockingbird' tells the story of Scout Finch. Scout is a precocious little girl with a big heart and a big imagination. She lives with her father, an older lawyer named Atticus, and her older brother Jem. Living in Maycomb, Alabama during the 30's, Scout and her family saw their fair share of injustice, especially when race was concerned. Atticus was a fair man, and he was determined to keep his children noble and moral individuals. He encouraged diversity and refused to allow his children to express any form or prejudice, whether it be racial or social. The story basically revolves around two specific events, or circumstances. The most notable would be the trial of a black man accused of raping a white woman. Atticus is appointed as the young man's lawyer, and it is apparent to most that the man is innocent. The second, and possibly the most powerful, is that concerning a man by the name of Arthur Radley. Arthur, known as Boo by the neighborhood children, is a recluse who is never seen, but who has been immortalized by the stories, rumors, that have been concocted by the children in order to insight terror into the hearts of others. The children make attempts at trespassing onto his property for the mere thrill of it, concluding that Boo is either savagely crazed or bitterly abused; or both. Throughout the story, while focus lay heavily on the trial, one's attention is brought to that of Arthur Radley quite often, as small details about his true persona are revealed gradually, until the dramatic conclusion.\`To Kill a Mockingbird' is a flawless essay on the power of racism and the strength it takes to combat it. As shown by Lee's impeccably detailed story, prejudice is never limited and it is a fault that many, possibly all, can become caught up in without even being aware. Injustice is unavoidable in this world because selfishness is far from being rooted out of man, but through the eyes of a child, Lee was able to bring these matters to a light that is alarming and effectively moving.Key to the novel's success is the way in which it is richly detailed. Each character feels real and authentic, and their actions are all mapped out with precise motivations and consequences. You can feel as though you know these people inside and out; and yet Lee never writes in a way that feels wordy or \`heavy'. The pages blow by as one becomes engulfed in every word, and it takes great skill to make something so emotionally weighty feel so light.At the end of the day, most of us know that racism is wrong. What Harper Lee addresses is far deeper than that though. Lee brilliantly uses the voice of a child, the voice of innocence, to expose the preposterous attitudes that surround racism. Lee shines a light on the childish nature of racism and the illogical stance many made in its defense.So, not only is racism wrong, but it's also very stupid."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee is a literary genius. She takes us into a quiet, hot summer day, one of which will break open in controversy ending in death, as told through the eyes of children. They must explain racism, sexual desire, implied incest between a father and daughter, alcoholism, poverty and ignorance. Atticus Finch is the protagonist; however, Scout is the main character and she will be changed by Boo Radley at the end of the book. I have lived in Mobile, Alabama, and my friend told me that Scout represented Harper Lee and Truman Capote was the boy who visited next door with his aunt. I knew in real life they lived in adjoining counties.One of my favorite themes is brought through the old lady next door. Atticus makes his son read to her, even if his son finds her to be mean and ungrateful. But Atticus reasons with him, explaining that she was sick. She was in a lot of pain, but did not want to be addicted to her pain medicine. He said that strength was not shooting a gun; she was one of the strongest people I ever knew - she was beholding to nothing or nobody. .My high school Advanced English teacher Mrs. Scroggins, said that one should read a book, and read it again maybe one to two years later. And it may seem as if it is a different book. She said the book did not change, but our experiences changed. Those were some of the most sage words I have heard elicited, and this book I can re-read and never become tired."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Buy it to cure your insomnia as it will certainly put you to sleep.

I strongly urge you not to even read this book for free at the library; your still getting ripped off."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To keep it simple, To Kill a Mockingbird is more boring than watching people answer phones on PBS during pledge drives. The book's plot basically goes no where, and does not take any opportunities to make itself great. Instead, it takes the route of pure boredom, shallow characters, and an asinine plot that is so lame and so boring, a Lucky Charms commercial has a more compelling plot. I was barely able to keep myself awake during the time I read this book, and when I was able to stay awake, I was mostly spent that time imagining what else I could be doing with my time. God only knows how this book even is considered one of the greatest books ever, it's only a book of pure suckyness.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The time is the 1930's, some years after The Great Depression. The story is told in a narrative by main character; Scout Finch; as she describes the racism and prejudice in her town somewhere in Alabama. Her father; Atticus Finch; is chosen to represent an African-American man accused of raping a girl named Violet Ewell. She talks about all of the experiences she, her brother Jem, and her father go through during this time in which racism was the norm and they receive much prejudice themselves. The main moral of the story is that if you kill a mockingbird, it's a sin and this book uses that moral to describe prejudice. How touching, too bad the book as a whole desecrates that moral with a horribly put together story. What ruins this book is the terrible dialogue, boring, shallow characters, a premise that goes no where, and much more. You can try and discredit my opinions all you want folks, you can't sway me. A lot of you already hate me for my review of the movie version, and basically looked at me as if I had just taken a leak on the Holy Grail (Hmm... maybe this explains why Bible verses were thrown at me). After my review of the movie I was basically called a racist, a swine, mentally ill, and unappreciative of art. I honestly laugh at how many people try to insult me and what they throw at me (Try and call me something I haven't already be referred to as). My opinion stays as it is, you can't hold it back. This book is worthless, asinine, a mockery of American literature, and completely boring... SO LET IT BE.THE GOOD: Some interesting moments.THE BAD: The rest of the book isn't interesting, the movie is better, but not by much."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Looking for a sappy, cliched, novel to read? One predictable as most young-adult books and more degrading than harlequin romances? Well, To Kill a Mockingbird is your book. In this novel, all Harper Lee gives as a theme is &quot;life isn't fair.&quot; I think most of us couold have figured that out without a book that should have started where the first &quot;part&quot; ended. Ms. Lee merely portrays a terrible, biased, southern society that seemingly places its main goal on ruining everyone elses life. Her female characters are flat, simple-minded women. Wether or not this is due to its setting is irrelevant. Lee places guilt on a group of people instead of individuals (the Ewells) as it should be. Thank God Ms. Lee only wrote this book; surely her next would degrade society even further. I'm sure it too would be deemed a classic as long as it dealt with politically correct subjects that are far too worn out to remain interesting."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is so horrible, it's not even funny!

I don't like these kinds of books anyway, but I was assigned to read it! Yuk! Try to avoid reading this book as much as possible. Every thing in it is confusing. It talks about one subject, and, all of a sudden, out of the blue, you are in another subject! It is hard to follow, and there is too much information given at one time. Try to avoid it!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I can't believe someone would actually resale this book .

It's a taste of Americana then and now--what a timeless story."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is my favourite book of all time. It's full of emotion, suspense, and action. When I first came across the book it was bound in the classic black cover. I instantly assumed that it'd be boring. Please don't make the same mistake I did!The story is narrated by Scout, a young girl who tries desperately to try to come to terms with the cruelty of the world. Her words are sometimes haunting, sad, and humourous. She encourages you to think differently about certain issues, and she opens you up to a different world.Harper Lee writes so flawlessly that it's no wonder this book won a Pulitzer Prize. My English teacher once said that the world is divided up between those that have read the book and those that haven't. I think that might've been a slight exaggeration but do pick up the book anyway. It's rare for a book to transcend time and still be relevant 45 years after it was first publised."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"As others have stated, I can't believe I wasn't forced to read this book during my school years. I guess it's because we Australians would be outraged if American literature took precedence over our home grown 'talent'.Anyway, besides the great moral inherent in this story (which never makes for a great book without being well written), the character development is second to none. I've never read a book before or since which convinces you that characters you are reading about are so real. Not only that, you just fall in love with the ideosyncrasies of each character.This book is a 'classic' in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee is a novel intended to inspire and bring about the childhood innocence that is contained within everyone. The story takes place in the small town of Maycomb County in Alabama. Being raised into a modest lifestyle, Scout Finch lives in a world that, in the beginning, she knows very little about. Her only concerns are the time spent playing with her older brother Jem and her best friend Dill (while wondering what really is inside the Radley home) and listening to the wisdom of her father Aticus Finch.Over a short period of time Scout is forced to grow up very quickly and she learns some of life's most important lessons. From witnessing first hand the unfairness of racism, she also learns a great deal about others and how you don't really know someone until you have walked in their shoes. Scout also learns to view people for who they truly are. She looks for the \\"mockingbirds\\" in society, those who are truly good at heart and don't deserve the cruel punishment that society imposes upon them.I would rate this book a 5 out of 5 stars because it is although it may be a simple book to understand the messages sent are great in importance. I really liked this book at would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"My Review on To Kill A MockingbirdI am fifteen years of age and I read \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" by Harper Lee as part of my English course. When my English teacher first gave us this title, I must admit I was far from delighted. I was not very optimistic because \\" To Kill A Mockingbird\\" was completely different to the type of book I would usually read. At the library I used to quite happily breeze past the shelf crammed with classic novels such as these, on to my preferred light hearted teen books about romance etc... However after reading this novel I can gladly say I have been completely converted. The novel, which I had thought would be dull and boring, has become one of my favourites. My opinion of \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" has changed entirely and I have nothing but absolute respect for its author Harper Lee.The story of \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" takes place in the small close-knit town of Maycomb, Alabama during the 1930's, a time when Negroes were still segregated from white people. It was also the same time as the \\"Great Depression\\". The story is narrated by the truly, loveable character, of Scout Finch, who is only six years of age when we first meet her. The story begins quite slowly, telling us how Scout, Jem (her brother) and Dill (their friend) spend the summer before Scout starts school and the different attics they get up to, such as their unsuccessful efforts to get the neighbourhood recluse, \\"Boo\\" Radley to come out of his house. When school starts Scout finds herself getting into trouble very often and she is even given out to by her teacher for being able to read and write!!The story up till this point has been fairly light-hearted and even humorous. Suddenly, the novel changes and increases in its dept, dealing with serious issues such as racism, prejudice and violence. Scout and Jem's father Atticus, a lawyer in the town is asked to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Scout and Jem have to deal with many crude and disapproving remarks about their father from their classmates and the people of Maycomb. The children are forced to mature quickly and they begin to see the true colours of their neighbours, who up till now, Scout and Jem had thought were the best kind of people in the world. They start to see that the people of Maycomb are deeply racist, prejudiced and hypocritical. The children also develop a newfound respect for their father when they see his bravery and moral courage to do the right and just thing.This fine novel is truly captivating and a masterpiece of writing. The author cleverly uses the innocence and curiosity of a small child to tell this story. Through Scout's young eyes we see what she sees and hear what she thinks. \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is so compelling; I just couldn't put it down! I kept finding myself turning the page to see what was going to happen next.I would recommend \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" to men and women, boys and girls, both young and old. I would definitely give this novel the \\"Big Thumbs Up\\" and the most possible \\"Stars\\" any review could give! I don't think I can say much more about this book to persuade you to read it, but let me just say I promise you will not be disappointed. \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" really is a timeless classic that you will be truly proud to see sitting on your bookshelf, among your collection years form now!!Enjoy! * (\\",) *Gill Moore"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This superb book contains several moral lessons and subtly points out faults that many of us share. Most importantly, we must follow our conscience and do what we know is right no matter the possible cost. That takes a great deal of courage and most of us have at one time or another failed in this respect. Harper Lee's Atticus Finch on the other hand was more than up to the task even though most of the town and his family were against him. Lee makes no effort to hide the fact that often there will be consequences for those who take a stand and those consequences will not always be pleasant.Atticus Finch is not the main character of this story however. The main characters are Atticus' son Jem and his daughter Scout who tells the story. I advise that you forget looking for the moral implications of the story for they are evident and it is much easier to enjoy this book if you just read it and don't try to dissect it. Jem (Jeremy) and Scout (Jean Louise) are probably the most interesting literary children since Tom and Huck and some of their adventures will remind the reader of Twain's creations. In short, this book is just plain fun to read and I regret terribly having waited so long to read it!During most of the story the children's adventures tend to revolve around the Radley house and it's most sinister occupant, Boo (Arthur) Radley. Boo is a recluse that hasn't been spotted out of his house by a reliable source in many years and of course the rumor mill in a small town has turned him into a monster that eats raw squirrels. In the end, the Boo Radley story line presents the reader with yet another moral lesson but the trail that leads to this lesson takes many interesting twists and turns.One will also find a very good description of the twentieth century South in Lee's work. From sleeping on the porch in the Summertime to watching the old men loaf around the courthouse I can honestly say I have been there and done that. Class distinction has always been very important in the South and Harper Lee works hard to bring that distinction out. Thankfully African-Americans are currently judged on their merit and not their race so that they fall into the caste system all up and down the ladder. In the 1930s though things were much different. The three lowest rungs on the ladder were poor white trash (the Cunninghams) and low down white trash (the Ewells), with blacks at the bottom. The significance of this being that at that point in time even the lowest whites would be believed over any African-American.Atticus Finch was for his time and place a fairly odd bird and thank God that there really were Finches out there to look out for the mockingbirds of the world."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's classic novel To Kill a Mocking Bird is about a family in a racially divided town of Alabama in 1932 that is going through harsh times. The youngest Finch, Scout, is the main character and narrator of the story. You see and feel the whole story through the eyes of the daughter of Atticus Finch, who is representing the accused Tom Robinson. Tom Robinson, a crippled Negro, has been accused of the rape and abuse of young Mayella Ewell.Scout tells the story of her adventures with her brother Jem and their neighbors nephew Dill. The three children were very frightened, but also curious about their other neighbors, the Radleys. It was said that Boo Radley was crazy, stabbed his own father, and was chained up in the house. Their adventures include a visit beyond the gate of the Radleys, putting on skits of what they thought was going on in the Radley home, and trying to stick a note on Boo's window to find any means of communication possible. All along, the children were assuming that Boo was dangerous and crazy. Little did they know, in the end he would be the one to save their lives.While the children were fascinating about Boo, Atticus was being criticized and even his children were being threatened, all because he was defending a black man. Atticus was a smart man with strong beliefs, determined to set a good example for his children and the people in his community. Tom was falsely charged guilty because, unfortunately, the community he lived in was still filled with racism. Even though Atticus had promised Tom that he would find justice and bring fairness to the town, Tom's inability to trust Atticus's sure word led to a frantic panic, and then death.Both stories tie in together. Atticus once said in the book that you never knew a person until you put on their shoes and walked around in them a little bit. The children were judging Boo Radley without having ever seen him before, and definitely never got to know him at all. Tom Robinson was being judged by the jury and town because he was black. Nobody knew who he was, and just stereotyped him to be a bad, scary man who raped and abused Mayella, even if he did have a cripple left hand."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is a book written by Harper Lee. The story is narrated by a girl named Jean Louise Finch, also known as Scout. The Finch family lives in a town called Maycomb, Alabama during the Great Depression. Scout's father Atticus is a lawyer in town. In the story Atticus Finch has chosen to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. This is a very serious crime in these times especially because Maycomb is a very racist town. The Finch family knows that Robinson is innocent, but the tricky part is getting the rest of the town to believe it too.At the trial, Scout and her older brother Jem sit in the colored section of the court to prove that there is no difference between black people and white people. The book is a very good book about racism during the Great Depression. One family takes matters into their own hands to try and solve the nation's problem and let everyone know that everyone is equal. The family encounters many problems because the rest of the community is not willing to listen to them. The rest of the community feels that Atticus is wrong in choosing to defend this man.Another character in the book is Boo Radley. Boo lives in a big, creepy house on the corner of the street and no one has ever seen him come out. Throughout the book Scout and her brother, Jem, have many encounters with Boo. While they still think he is really creepy, they also realize that he is a person just like you and me.This is one of my favorite books. The book is narrated by Scout, a child. I always admired the innocence of a child. Scout looks at Robinson and doesn't see a black man but instead she sees a man who is being wrongly accused. When she looks at Boo she see a normal man. I think this is a book everyone should read. So many times we judge people without getting to know them. That is what the book is really about."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book has left a mark in my head that I can't seem to get rid of. I read it as part of a class (it was a requirement) and I remember thinking \\"This better not be about a bird 'cause otherwise I'm gonna get bored reading it.\\"...It wasn't...Instead I found a story of a little girl struggling with her thoughts, living with her father and little brother in a town were everything seemed big, but people were small minded. The fact that the way she grew up kept her grounded, I couldn't help but wonder how it would be like to be in her shoes for more that a minute. Growing up around boys myself I related to her and the way she thought. I remember thinking how innocent I used to be because I shared some of her thoughts when I was her age and even thought there's a huge difference between how people lived their lives then and how they live their lives now, I can honestly say that innocence will never change...I love this book and every time I read it I'm reminded of that..."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was curious how a few years might change the perspective I had on this book from the first time I read it, in grade 10. Indeed, I think I have benefitted from having a more grown-up view to this material, given how much weight it carries, even if the story is told from the point of view of a youth.&quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; tells the story of an Alabama family, the Finch's, who get caught up a racial battle in their small town as Atticus, a father and widower, defends a black man against the charge of rape. The story is told rather wonderfully from the point of view of Scout, a naive and hot-headed young girl with a nose for a fight, who wanders among many stories, from the eccentric Radleys, to playground fights, to wondering why her father continues to defend that man everyone seems so intent on lynching.&quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; is a wonderful story. It's sweet and poignant and principled without ever being schmaltzy or loaded with sentiment. Among the strongest points, in my opinion, are the little conversations Atticus has with others explaining why he's doing what he's doing, the court sequences, and the subplot with Arthur Radley. There is a pervasive theme of not judging others before getting to know them which is a lasting, timeless message.Recommended to everyone.Matthew D.

There is nothing else like it. It shaped my childhood; its ideals shape my adulthood.If you're a fan of Star Trek, as I am, you'll see ideals that you see in Trek throughout the book -- for example, this might be the work that comes closest to an Earth-bound expression of IDIC. [P.S.: There are two Trek connections to the filmed version... Paul Fix (the Judge/Dr. Piper in the second Trek pilot) and Brock Peters (Atticus' client/Captain Sisko's father on Deep Space 9).]If you have not read Harper Lee's masterwork, you're poorer for it. No matter your age, it's never too late to learn its majesty and consider its wisdom."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is one of those few books I read in school that I really enjoyed. Students tend to resist being forced to read books (and a lot of them don't have enough wattage in their brains to understand them anyway), but I remember finishing this book and shaking my head at Lee's brilliance.The previous 200+ reviews pretty much summed up the plot and then some, so there's not much more to say... except that what made the book special for me was Scout's comment on the very last page, on the metaphor between what had happened in the book and the killing of mockingbirds, given airtime earlier in the book. That image is moving and sad, and acted as perfect closure to the book, despite what previous reviewers have said. Whether Harper Lee intended to make this message or not, the painful events that have happened in the book were brought home to make a moving statement with those last lines.For all those people who complained about the racism and rape trial in the book: Grow up! That's like complaining about a book on physics being devoted to physics, or an sf novel being set in the future. What do you people expect? Take out the focus of this book and the second half of the book disappears.One more comment: Considering that I once had a review for Amazon.com never accepted because of an afterthought and a factual correction from the review I had just sent in for the same book, I find it amazing (and infuriating) that what was obviously a single person from Massachussetts has _thirteen_ reviews, all submitted on March 1, for this book. One wouldn't think it would be that difficult to notice, say, that the last 5 were obviously coming from one source, when they noticed and rejected a shorter, much less extreme (and more relevant) afterthought from me.

I loved little Scout (the rambunctious tomboy), Jem (the angsty pre-teen), Atticus (the lax single parent), Boo (the enigmatic neighbor), and the rest of the cast of misfits.

This book is captivating!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The daughter of a noted attorney, Harper Lee was born in 1926 in the small town of Monroeville, Alabama. Although she studied law, she became increasingly interested in writing, and in the 1950s she created a series of semi-fictional, semi-autobiographical writings about the events of her childhood. Over time, these writings developed into a novel, and she completed TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD in 1959. Published in 1960, the book not only proved an instant bestseller but received every critical accolade available, including the Pulitzer Prize. It also proved controversial, and almost fifty years later the American Library Association continues to list it as one of the most frequently challenged and banned books in both the United States and abroad.Told in the form of an extended flashback, the novel unfolds in a series of scenes in which Lee seems intent upon evoking the small challenges and quiet charms of childhood in a small, Depression era southern town. We are introduced to Scout, our tomboy narrator, and her brother Jem and their playmate Dill, and we join in their summer games: climbing to the treehouse, rolling in a tire, and most particularly their fascination with \\"Boo\\" Radley, a mysterious recluse of unsavory past who has long been a focus of town gossip.Written with remarkable simplicity, it is a charming, often comical tale--but as the story extends it comes to focus not so much upon Scout and Jem as upon their father Atticus Finch, a noted local attorney who is suddenly appointed to defend a black man accused of the vicious rape of a white woman. And Atticus Finch is a man of rare integrity, quietly but firmly determined to bring the facts of the case to light. In doing so, he places himself and his children at storm center of a controversy that threatens to tear both his family and community apart and which ends in violence and death.In 1960, with the United States of America embroiled in the Civil Rights movement, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was considered a political statement. It proved a lightening rod for controversy, and in truth the novel still speaks to us of the evils of racism. If this were all, it would be a novel of historical interest and little more. But that is not the case.The two threads of the story--the children's fascination with Boo Radley and Atticus Finch's defense of Tom Robinson--are not separate portions; they interweave and ultimately dovetail into a seamless whole, remarkable in narrative, brilliant in clarity, to create a portrait of social bigotry counterbalanced by deep humanity, at times monstrous, at times deeply beautiful as only perfect honesty can be. The characters spring to vivid life; the events unfold with a mixture of the unexpected and inevitable. There is pain, there is suffering, but there is growth as well, and as the children grow in knowledge and understanding so too does the reader. It is a remarkable work, not only capturing the texture of life in a small southern town, but bringing its events to a universal level that transcends time and place and touches something that speaks to the best in all of us.Since the novel's publication, Harper Lee has become almost as much a recluse as Boo Radley, seldom appearing in public, even more rarely speaking or writing for publication. She has never again created a work of this length. Even so, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD places her at the forefront of American authors. This is a great novel. I wish I had written it.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"When I first decided I was going to read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" for an English assignment, I got mixed reviews from my peers.

When I was a kid, a special friend and I would go down to the courthouse and pretend we were Jem and Scout - the balcony is there and the jail's across the street - and there was an big, old abandoned house that we would say was the Radley place. Occasionally, we would see Miss Lee at her daddy's store - but were always too much in awe of her to venture anything more than &quot;hey!&quot;.

There are no other words for such as this."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is awesome! You get to personally know the characters in it, and it imparts so much truth in the story through the eyes of children (which makes hard topics such as prejudice easier to &quot;digest&quot;) It shows how prejudice can destroy families, and how friendship can save them."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I personally liked it. I agree with her profound statements of society's grave injustices and social inequality. It wasn't just about blacks or whites. It was people as a whole. Girls boys all people alike in their own special ways. This book will last a lifetime because of its universal message and appeal."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"My favourite feel good book of all time.It's warm,caring,frightening,saddening,revealing and most of all very real.I felt as though I was living in the south.I could feel the heat in summer and remember those first days at school when your world changes so drastically.Scout's journey shows what it was like to live in a time when toys and fancy cars didn't matter,it was the family you loved and the neighbours who cared and the friends you made really mattered.To kill a Mockingbird depicts a world which also could be very cruel to those that strayed from the &quot;norm&quot;. I could read it again and again and again."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I thought this was a great story. I read it in my junior English class. I loved how caring Atticus was and how he tried to teach his children right. I loved the story, it taught the innocence of children and how caring we are until the outside world corrupts us; hatred is learned, you aren't born with it. I really liked this book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was assigned this book to read in the 9th grade. Opening it for the first time, and seeing the small print, as well as the lack of pictures (!), my heart sank. But I read. By the time I got to the third page, I was hooked. This book changed my life fundamentally; it turned me into a reader. Quite an accomplishment, that."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird was a great book and now one of my favorites. The begining was really kind of boring but as I read on, I just didnt want to put the book down. Jem, Dill and Scout were very courageous in the book. They had a lot of courage for little kids. I just thought that this book was great and more and more people should read it. So if you are a person who hasnt read this book yet, I suggest you go out and either buy the book or rent it from your library. You can also check out the movie &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is one of the classic books of all time. It is written beautifully and the plot is great. This book is a must for anyone, whatever genre you read. The story is told in a masterful way and it makes you contemplate about human thoughts and ideas. Simply brilliant"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee sets her story in the small town of Maycolmb, Alabama. A town that has seen the worst of the depression and still sets its own rules regarding race. An interesting aspect of this story is that Lee chose to tell it through the eyes of an eight-year-old child. The lives of Scout Finch, her father Atticus, and her older brother Jem are followed throughout three hard years. Atticus is a lawyer who has got what many would call an unfortunate job of defending a black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. In a town where a black man in guilty until proven innocent, this means certain punishment for Tom. Soon, young Scout and Jem are rediculed by the town's people, both themselves and their father being ripped of their dignity. Scout learns many of life's lessons in these three years of her life. There is a universal story to be told in this book. Many characters are set apart because they don't follow the norm of the town. But, Scout learns that this is not the way to live life. She learns to not flow with the rest of society at certain times, because sometimes everyone else is not always right."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the best books ever written. It is a classic novel. This book by Harper Lee does a great job of describing events and keeping the reader hooked on the book. I am only in 8th grade and this book is by far my favorite. This book took place in 1933-1935 (the depression) It does a good job describing prejudoce back then and how one thing that a black says or does even if it is the truth can be not true by a white saying something else which is what you'll learn in this book. I would recommend it for all ages."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is truly an amazing work of art. Although I titled this &quot;high school reading&quot;, I think that it's a book that can be read and understood by all ages. It is beautifully written and narrated by the adult Jean Louise &quot;Scout&quot; Finch, as she talks about when she was 8, and how her family(herself, her brother Jem, and her father Atticus) dealt with Atticus defending black Tom Robinson for a crime he didn't committ against a white woman in a racist town. Atticus is probably one of my favorite all time characters. He is so sweet and compassionate, and just like that other review said, a perfect rolemodel. Even though the ending of this book is pretty depressing, I still love it to death. I'll try to not give too much of the ending away for those of you who haven't read it. It just seems upsetting to me that Atticus proved so many times that Tom Robinson didn't do it, and the defense had nothing and they still won, just because Tom Robinson was black. Maybe that's why the book is so good, though. It doesn't give a Disney ending. The ending is harsh and serious, but it's realisic. I have read a few of these reviews, and I was really sad that no one explained the meaning of the title. I wrote a report on it, so I should know this. Tom Robinson, the man falsely accused of a crime he didn't commit, and represented by Atticus, is a mockingbird. When Jem and Scout get guns for Christmas, Atticus tells them the only thing they can't shoot are mockingbirds because they don't do anything but make sweet music for us to hear. This is why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird. Much in the same way, it was a sin to kill Tom Robinson(he dies) because all he ever did was help the girl who accused him of raping her(the crime he was convicted for). I suppose I just ruined the ending, so I'll stop now. But the bottom line is: This is a really great book, and you should read it if you haven't already. Or, if you already have, read it again. It's a great lawyer book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"century. I first read this book when I was in the 7th grade and have returned to it numerous times during the intervening 39 years. It is a story of courage, heroism, and the loss of innocence of individuals, a culture, and a country. Set against the richly satisfying backdrop of the deep south in the early part of the twentieth century, is a story of man's inhumanity to man, and one man's struggle to do what is right against all odds. No syrupy sweetness here. No sense of the brave white man rescuing the poor, defenseless negro. This is a story of the dignity inherent in all men as they seek justice in one small corner of the world. This is must reading for all, preferably before highschool graduation. A slim volume, and deceptively easy to read, it reverberates to the core of one's being for years to come."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is a good book for all ages. It is full of good lessons and morals. I teaches you to follow your conscience and be a person of compassion. The setting is a sleepy town in 1930's alabama. It is mostly about two children growing up in this town and learning about the evil in the human heart and losing their inocence. They also learn to be children of compassion and conscience. They learn this mostly through the character of Boo Radley their next door neighbor. The town treats him as a disgrace and blames him for most of the problems. The children finally learn of his situation and realize they should have compassion for him. It also centers on racism in a way through the case of Tom Robinson it show how hunams can be cruel and unfair to one another. Overall this was a good book and i recomend it to all ages of readers. ...."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird was an very marvelous and entertaining book. The book is told through the eyes of a 5 year old name Scout Finch who lost her mother and lives with her brother Jem, and father Atticus. This is a wonderful novel with a great plot and many little events that go on around the man plot. Harper Lee uses very good time and setting for this book. The time is 1930's and Scout is 5 and Jem is 12. There father, who they call by his first name, is a lawyer who takes care of Scout and Jem all by himself till his sister moves in to help. Atticus is a very moral man and a good father to his children. back in the 30's racism was every where and especially in the town of Maycomb. Maycomb is where they live and where the play. Atticus is put in charge of a very difficult case that involves a black man who is accused of rape. Atticus has to defend this black man against Bob Ewell, who is a very mean cruel individual. Most of the town is for the white man just for the fact that he is white. The town is against Atticus because he is representing a black man. This novel is great display of how the world is today and shows the qualities of good and bad individuals. THis is a wonderful book that I recommend to everyone. I give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird was one of the best books I've ever read. This story does a number of things to you at the same time. It educates you as far as how things went back in times when blacks and whites were seperated and were enemies. It also takes you through the life of a young girl and gives you a view of the world from an innocent child's eyes. The only flaw in the book is that the author takes her knowledge of the vocabulary and instills it in an eight year old girl. There are two main themes in the book. The first is the need for compassion. This is the most important, and is mentioned several times throughout the book. Atticus is Scout's(the narrarator and main character) father and he is constantly reminding his children not to discriminate or make fun of anyone else unless you have &quot;been in their shoes.&quot; The second theme is the need for conscience. Atticus is the local town lawyer and he takes a case defending a black man, knowing that he won't win. He has a good, clear conscience and wants his children to be proud of him as well as be like him. This book makes you not want to put it down because there is action in every chapter. I would definetly recommend this book to anyone who has a spare $6 to spend. The end of the book goes like this..... Wait a minute, if I told you then there wouldn't be a point in you reading it. I guess you'll just have to read it for yourself and find out."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird has always conjured up the image of Gregory Peck in the courtroom. Not that I have anything against courtroom dramas, but I always wondered what the fuss was about. Now I can only say that I really wish I had read this book as a teenager, even though it was still a wonderful read for this 40-something year old.It is an eloquent testimony to growing up in the South during the depression. However, unlike so many &quot;Southern&quot; novels, this isn't a depressing book. Tough, difficult things happen but the reader comes away inspired. It reminded me a little bit of Angela's Ashes. Perhaps this feeling derives from the narrator being a child but it works.I won't bore you with the plot. Simply said, this is a classic for good reason. It has lots to say and it says with style and grace. It also has enough plot to be chosen by the International Mystery Booksellers Association as one of the 100 best mysteries of the 20th century."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Well Harper gives us a gripping story of Ethics and philosophical intrigue, but doesn't lose the story line and make it unentertaining. A classic that's an easy read at any age and one you should come back to periodically in your life for a new viewpoint."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"BRILLIANT! That's what I thought when I finished this book. The depiction of small town bigotry, coupled with the &quot;myth&quot; of Arthur (Boo) Radley made for a spectacular and eye-opening read. It couples several themes, as well. Love and Hate, Innocense and Experience, Right and Wrong. All come together for a spectacular finale which the movie fails completely to display at it's utmost meaning. Don't just sell out and watch the movie. If you have not read this masterpiece yet, I strongly suggest that you do. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"An extraordinary novel that shows us the South that existed several decades ago through the eyes of a child. Scout Finch's world is full of wonder and mystery. When her father, the lawyer Atticus Finch, takes the case of a black man who has been falsely accused of raping a white woman, she begins to see and understand both the ugliness that exists in the world and the meaning of true heroism. Harper Lee's novel must be one of the most perceptive narratives from the viewpoint of a child ever written."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Wonderful story! Many topics to discuss such as: raising children without a mother; the black nanny as the caregiver; the different way that the nanny acts with the white community versus her community; the views of the school teachers towards children that are taught at home; the boogie man who lives next door....."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"As soon as I began To Kill a Mockingbird during the summer of eigth grade, I was skeptical. Being someone who had NEVER enjoyed any of the books we had to read in school, I was not looking forward to it. I began it after a sour experience of reading &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; and was expecting the worst. I could not have been more wrong.The simple but meangingful experiences of Scout Finch et al touched me on a personal level. The deeper meaning of this book is something we can all learn from. In the first half of the book, no huge events really take place, but it's the smaller ones that set the tone of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. There are a few incedents where people try to get Scout to conform, like when her first grade teacher is upset that she can read already and thinks she shouldn't be able to. Throughout the story, the motif of thinking for oneself and separating from the crowd pop up in different scenarios. This book may seem to move more slowly than you might like. I think Harper Lee did this for a reason. Don't buy the cliffnotes, folks. See for yourself."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book during my freshman year of high school and really enjoyed it. It was the first book I bought in a long time because I liked it so much.As the reader we are brought into Maycomb County, Alabama through the eyes of Scout Finch, a young girl who has yet to lose her innocence. Through the book she matures greatly as she learns, much from her father Atticus Finch, to see through others' perspectives, one of the biggest lessons I've ever learned in my sixteen years of existence.&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a classic story that should be read by all."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was required to read this book over the summer for an Honors English class for next year. I finished it the week after school was out. It was so full of plot, and so intruiging, that I couldn't put it down. It was so incredible. I never imangined I would enjoy it so much. Harper Lee does a wonderful job setting the scene, especially with the dialect and character development. You see Scout Finch's world just as she would as the events unfold. This is one of the few times I am glad I was required to read a book. If not, I would have never known what lies beneath the cover."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I found this book to be quite original and a great portrait of strength and courage. I liked the style that the author used in writing this novel and applaud his choice of a narrarator. Truly a great read and a must for everyone."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"With all the reviews for this book, another surely isn't needed. But if you've never seen the movie version, you definitely won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In the novel, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, by Harper Lee, a young girl named Scout learns that life isn't fair. Scout is very different from all the other girls because she doesn't want to wear dresses with big frills. She would rather climb trees and go on big adventures. Scout's dad is a lawyer and he has o defend a black man for the rape of a white woman. Word gets around, and soon everyone is telling Scout that her dad is a \\"nigger lover\\". Scout has many different friends, but one of her best ones is really poor. Because of this, he gets descriminated against. But Scout respects him, not because of his riches, but because he respects her. Overall, this book is a wonderful story about the hardships of that time. You really get to see what sexism, racism, and classism, was like for people in the 1930's."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I just finished the book today. I have read some of the reviews others have left for it and will not try to echo their excellent reviews of this wonderful book. One main thread of a lot of the reviews I have read is the regret of not having read the book when one was younger. I thought I agreed with it until I realized, I would not have appreciated or been as moved by this wonderful book when I was a young person. I am glad I waited to read this classic in middle age. All I can say it moved me deeply, made me consider my own views I have held about others and made me desperate to be even a small portion as good a person as Atticus Finch."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book was my favorite as a teen, and it was still touching to read it as an adult. Scout and Atticus are two of my favorite all time characters. Scout is lovable because she is honest and earnest. Atticus is the ultimate role model for all of us to do the right thing regardless of the danger involved or what other people think. Besides all that great stuff, it's a fun and touching story to read. It should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Finally, a classic that I enjoyed! Ms. Lee's voice resonates with truth and character. Scout is an unforgettable young lady.The phrasing, especially the southern dialect is written in such a way that it conveys the sound of the words, but is not confusing.The plot is satisfying and worth the investment.I wish I'd read it sooner."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I enjoyed reading this classic story and found strong moral undertones present. I enjoyed the ideas presented by the characters as well. However, I also thought Lee droned on about seemingly trivial matters in certain cases. It was almost like reading an aside at times. After getting accustomed to her style, I trained myself to skim these sections that were not central to the plot."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book many years ago and of course watched the movie. I bought it this time for my grandchildren to read and hope they will enjoy it. It is not a great novel in any artistic sense of the word, but it is a great book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Although you tend to be forced to read it in grade school there's no doubt about the reasons why. A book full of lessons and beautiful prose it's frightful if it's not on your list. Sometimes it's slow like a southern drawl and other times it's as quick as a motorcycle. It's sure to keep you interested if you give it the time of day."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Small mixup in shipment; but when it was brought to the seller's attention. Readily and quickly took care of it. Book as advertised."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was very pleased by the quality of this book when received. This is one of my favorite books and will be passed along to my wife as a gift as she loves this story also."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Here are a couple of quotes that appealed to me:I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.A mob's always made up of people.Just some facts about the book -* Lee spent two and a half years writing To Kill a Mockingbird* the book was published on July 11, 1960; it was initially titled Atticus, but Lee renamed it to reflect a story that went beyond a character portrait* Dill is modelled on Truman Capote (then known as Truman Persons)In a 1964 interview, Lee remarked that her aspiration was \\"to be...the Jane Austen of South Alabama\\". Literary critic Jean Black lists the priorities shared by the two authors - \\"affirmation of order in society, obedience, courtesy, and respect for the individual without regard for status\\".An absolute must read if only for the amazing courage and determination of the characters - Oh and the delightful humour!!!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I first read this when I was about 12 and thought it was great. I'm 53 now and just reread it, and my appreciation has only increased.It's not just the beautiful evocation of life in a small Southern town (with delicious pies and cakes constantly coming out of someone's oven), the poignant moral dilemma of racism, the tight plot, or the unforgettable characters. For me it's the pitch-perfect voice of Scout, one of the great characters in literature. Of course Atticus is great too - this should be required reading for all expectant fathers - and the movie places much focus there, but the novel puts you inside Scout's mind and that is a fine place to be.When I was looking for a copy I stopped in a small used book store, having found that many regular stores were sold out (I guess because of the recent publicity). The used bookstore was sold out too, but the woman there said \\"Harper Lee only wrote one book, but she said everything she needed to say in it.\\" That feels about right."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"There isn't much I can say about this novel that hasn't been said by a few hundred other reviewers.Harper Lee created a classic novel about a little girl named Scout growing up in Alabama with her brother Jem and her father, Atticus Finch. Through the eyes of Scout we encounter the injustice and hatred that lives in her small town. Scout uses her father's wisdom and her own intuition to decide for herself what's right and what's wrong in the world.Mayella Ewell was caught by her father trying to seduce a colored man. The only way to protect herself from her father's wrath is to accuse the innocent Tom of raping her. The instant the town hears that a black man raped a white woman, they can't wait to execute him. Atticus, a local lawyer, is asked by the judge to take the case. Both the judge and Atticus doubt that Tom is really guilty but in the Jim Crow South, they fear that his case was decided long before it came to court.Taking this case ends up becoming dangerous for Atticus and his family because Mayella's alcoholic father doesn't like anyone who doesn't play by his rules.To Kill A Mockingbird is an incredible look at pre-civil rights Southern living where facts are often skewed by blind hatred. One of the best books of all time, I think every child should read this book. Even beyond being a book about racism, this is a prime example of learning for yourself the difference between right and wrong."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee has created a timeless masterpiece, by using the eyes of a ten year old child, as the story teller this makes it easy to read and get lost in. Creating one of the most noted litary figures of all times, Atticus Finch. A man of convection, courage and compassion through him, his children see how unfair life can be while teaching them by example how to overcome the challanges of life in a small southern town. Every fathers day many shows rank the best fictonal fathers, and Atticus Finch has alway been number one. For a good reason.Every adult needs to read this book even though you probaly already have at one time or another. I believe everyone should see the world through the eys of a ten year old child every now and then."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Taking place in the Deep South during the 1930's, the story is told through the eyes of a young girl nicknamed Scout. Over the course of a few years, Scout, her brother Jem, and friend Dill grew from trying to draw out the town's mysterious citizen, Albert \\"Boo\\" Radley to learning the dark truth behind racism and hypocrisy.While being drawn into the anger of the townspeople at having her father defend a black man in court, Scout learns how great the weight on her father's shoulders was. The weight is shifted to Scout and Jem following the trial which brings about an unforeseen savior. From their experiences, she and her brother discover there's more to life than the simplicity of childhood and the pleasant covering their home town wears.A timeless classic, the underlying message in To Kill a Mockingbird is as apparent today as at any time in our history. If you get the chance, you should check out Mr. Lee's book. You may surprise yourself at how little some things have changed."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Having read To Kill a Mockingbird MANY years ago --[ I think it's even been a long time since I saw the movie ]-- this summer I read the book again. I was struck anew by what a fantastic story it is, and impressed even more with Harper Lee's amazing skill as a writer. The Boo Radley subplot is brilliant, the characters are extremely well drawn, and the dialogue and descriptions are note-perfect. And all of that stands beside the value of the book as a moral lesson.I also read The Help a couple of years ago, and reading Mockingbird this year revealed exactly how heavily Ms. Stockett was influenced by Ms. Lee and the legendary 1952 novel. Stockett doesn't like comparisons because she doesn't feel her work is worthy to be put alongside the earlier book, but The Help almost moves beyond homage into imitation, in my opinion."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was very pleased with the condition of this product. I have always wanted to read this book and was unable to find a version of it without a lot of extra commentary used by teachers. By having this on CDs, I am reaping the benefits of \\"reading\\" the book. Sissy Spacek has a wonderful voice that adds to the enjoyment of listening to the book. I recommend this product for anybody that loves a great story."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"When Julie suggested this novel, I was apprehensively curious. I hadn't read. I know many people were required to read To Kill A Mockingbird in either grammar or high school. I wasn't one of them. I didn't know anything about it. I thought Harper Lee was a man. Yes, I was clueless.What strikes me the most about this novel is that I know every time I read it (and I will read it again), I will get something else from it. This time I was moved by the flow of the story, by the courage it took Ms. Lee to write and publish it at one of the darkest times in US history. I was moved by the inspiration she weaved into the pages, for her wisdom in human emotions and how truthfully she conveys them in black and white (no pun intended). This novel is a gift to readers.Ms. Lee brings together a cast of character that reflects the time with stark honesty. I loved Scout, she was full of moxie, spirit and truth. Told from her point of view, she made me laugh out loud at times. I loved Jem. It was a joy and heartbreak watching him mature right before my eyes. Atticus has such strength and peace. He did what was right, what was fair. He believed in justice and loved his children more than anything. Miss Maudie was straight up ballsy. She had class and was a force to be reckoned with.This novel is classic, it's perfect. It's the kind of novel that everyone must read. I'm ashamed it took me this long to read it. And I'm happy Julie choose this novel.The final thing I will take away from To Kill A Mockingbird is what Atticus says about Mrs. Dubose.\\"I wanted you to see what real courage is....It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.\\"This novel is a winner."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books. It deals with many important issues, exposes the ugly ignorance of prejudice, the innocence of children and the influence adults have over them. Everyone should read it, especially children and even more so in an age where bullying and taunting is so prevalent. The writing is beautiful, the theme of tolerance is moving, and the relationship between Atticus Finch and his children both loving and entertaining. The book leaves its reader feeling good. Thoroughly recommend it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is a classic and is absoutely a must read. It is a very easy read and you will find yourself finishing it faster than you expected or wanted. PBS recently had a program on Harper Lee on American Masters that is worth your time also."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The online reading group I belong to chose this book as a group read for June in the Classic category. I had read it many years ago when I was in high school but I doubt I had the appreciation of it that I have now reading it as an adult.It is both a coming of age story of a brother and sister and the engrossing tale of their father set in a small southern town. It is the story of a simple man who strives to do the right, if challenging, thing on a daily basis both in his home and as a citizen of his community. In doing so he must face the ignorance and bigotry of the times they live in.The novel is timeless and truly a classic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I don't know why but I waited a very long time to read this book. I think the film is one of the best ever made, although it never seems to make into the top 10 of any critic's list, but is certainly in my favourite 5. I think it might have been this that prevented me from taking it down from my bookshelf where it has lain unopened for at least 20 years; the fear that it might disappoint and, in some way, diminish my love of the movie and Elmer Bernstein's heartrendingly beautiful score. I need not have worried; if anything it has enhanced my appreciation of it.The book, of course, stands on its own as a sublime evocation of the lost innocence of childhood and it is Lee's great skill that she is able to elicit, through her prose and Scout's narration, a child's truth, which produces a wonderful portrait of, what surely must be, one the great literary creations; Atticus Finch, in all his glory: the father of Scout and her brother Jem, struggling to bring up his children in a time of great hardship, both economic and moral, the latter struggle epitomized by the seemingly endless patience he shows in pointing out to them, in the face of apparently overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that their lives should truly be lived according to the dictum ensconced within the Declaration of Independence: that \`all men are created equal'. Thus we observe the children's growth in understanding of this teaching as they witness the horrible injustice perpetrated by the laws constituted to, among other things, safeguard the rights of all men. This is illustrated, beautifully too, through the, ironical, persecution of Boo Radley and their growing realization that, perhaps, the \`boogey man' they have long feared is not their reclusive immediate neighbour but the evil, ignorance and hatred ineradicably woven into the fabric of the everyday lives of all but a few the people they have long taken for granted as representing the norm.When first in print perhaps it had a great influence, along with the movie and others, such as Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and In the Heat of the Night, on fair minded people in America with regard to questions of race, colour and creed, even while the riots in Detroit and elsewhere were raging - who knows? One thing I do know is that this book is a masterpiece of imaginative writing and will endure for decades to come and beyond when we can only hope that the issues at its core are a distant memory."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I've lived in the Deep South for all of my life and I've always heard about this story, \\"To Kill A Mockingbird,\\" by Harper Lee, a Monroeville native but have never read the book until I purchased tickets to go see the play within the next couple of weeks.I must say Mockingbird is a great read.

Harper Lee sets the tone of the times perfectly!!!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The only thing special that I can tell about the 50th anniversary issue is the name, there aren't any extras. Great book but don't bother about the 50th anniversary issue."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is a wonderful book. It's of many different elements. It has mystery, suspense, and adventure. My fave part when at the end when the shy Boo saves the kids and Scout finally gets to meet him. It also teaches not to believe everything you hear and not to judge a man by his color."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Like most Americans, I was first introduced to Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" as a high school student. At the time, I had no idea what it was about, nor could I have ever imagined how much this book would come to mean to me. Like other classics of literature, it is still as resonant today as ever.The plot is fairly well-known, but if you aren't aware of it, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a coming-of-age story. Scout Finch is a young girl growing up in a small Alabama town during the Great Depression. She spends much of her free time playing with her older brother, Jem, and, during the summer, a neighbor's nephew, Dill. One summer day the three children get the idea to try and get a reclusive neighbor, Boo Radley, to come outside. It becomes a near-obsession for them, but despite their best efforts, Boo remains unseen.The Finch children are raised by their father, Atticus, a widower and a prominent lawyer in the town. He's an unconventional parent at best; his children call him by his first name, and he doesn't seem as concerned with appearances as other parents. However, he is trying to instill in Scout and Jem a sense of honesty and integrity, and this becomes evident when he is assigned to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman.Though many educators (my high school English teacher included) have focused on the racism aspect of the story, upon re-reading it many times since, I don't think that is the main focus of the novel. Yes, it is a huge part, but it's almost the backdrop for the events contained therein. This is a story of that moment where the innocence of childhood is lost. It's about the realization that the world is a complicated, sometimes ugly, place. Adults are not infallible, and parents are not granted superpowers. Courage can take curious forms, and those who may seem to be dull can actually be the heroes of a town. Life exists not in simple black and white, but in varying shades of gray. And not every decision that is made by society is necessarily a good one.Fifty years after its original publication, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is as heartwarming and heartbreaking as ever. And that's the mark of a truly classic novel."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Book is as described and came promptly.Book in near perfect condition.Thank you for a nice transaction!Satisfied customer."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"There's a reason this book is considered a classic.The author manages to capture the time period perfectly and I was extremely impressed that she did it was honestly, and held nothing back no matter how ugly it read.This one's a keeper!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was prompted to read this book again after a lot of years after a comment at breakfast by my son who said that I was pouring syrup on my pancakes and sausage in the manner of Walter Cunningham. When I asked him who Walter Cunningham was, he replied, of course that he was a character in \\"To Kill A Mockingbird.\\" I decided to pick up the novel again not only to find out more about Walter Cunningham but to reacquaint myself with this Pulitzer Prize winning book by Harper Lee. Not surprising I found that I was drawn not only to the characters but to the style of writing. I couldn't believe that this required book of highschoolers could be so enjoyable to read. Atticus Finch, the small town lawyer of a small Alabama town is a very quiet, understated, scholarly looking man who is widowed with a small daughter, Scout, and a son Jem. The other member of the household is the African American maid Calpurnia who is more like a mother to Scout and Jem. They also have a summer friend, called Dill. Then there is a recluse neighbor named Boo Radley. Mainly the story deals with Atticus defending a black man who is accused of raping a white young woman. Naturally there is an outcry in the community and threats which prompt Atticus to sit at the door of the jail with a rifle holding off a gang of folks only too happy to lynch up a black man. One of the men happens to be the father of Walter Cunningham who is kind of a poor, \\"white trash\\" type of kid who Scout also picks a fight with in school because the teacher has singled him out for not bringing his lunch and offers to give him some money for lunch. Only Scout tells the teacher that Cunninghams don't accept money from anyone, and incurs the wrath of the teacher for being insubordinate. Walter goes home with the Finch kids for lunch and this is where he does his syrup thing, pouring it all over the meat and potatoes thus getting more grief from Scout who brings this to everyone's attention. This shouldn't be a big deal but Atticus and Calpurnia take her aside and scold her for not respecting other people's ways no matter how strange they might be. This theme of respect for human beings also applies to Boo Radley who is harassed by the Finch kids and their friend, Dill, but in Boo's own manner he tries to communicate with them in various ways. Even though this book deals a lot with the racial tensions of the South during the 1930s there is a lot more in the pursuit of not only justice for everyone, but also recognizing people for who they are and knowing that everyone has a contribution to make. This all becomes very evident towards the end of the story when Scout and Jem really find out who really cares for their welfare and safety and who their friends really are!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"At the December 2011 meeting, a very nice sized group met at the NYC LGBT Center to discuss \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" by Harper Lee.We had a dozen readers (but no new members, which surprised me) to discuss \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" About half the group had read the book before (usually in high school) and about half had seen the movie in the past few years. We originally put the book on the list because I read that it was often viewed as a lesbian coming of age story - but it didn't pan out that way.Everyone either liked the book a lot or loved it. Everyone was clearly charmed by the language and the story. There was some discussion about how Scout expressed herself - can any child be that smart? General agreement was that the novel is actually in three parts: (1) Scout's growing up with her brother Jem and Dill (Truman Capote in real life); (2) Atticus' trial and its aftermath, and (3) life in a small Southern town with Aunt Alexandra and various neighbors (including Boo \\"Arthur\\" Radley). While the novel centers around Atticus' defense of the clearly innocent Tom Robinson, two episodic minor events stand out in the narrative: a snow day in Alabama and Atticus shooting a mad dog. But the three sections of the novel melt together like a confection during a hot Southern summer so that they cannot be separated.I think that the book is full of new-found and evolving sexual knowledge as Scout learns to act (but not necessarily be) a woman. I persuaded absolutely no one that Scout is a gender-variant young woman (lesbian? FTM transgender youth? butch transvestite?) coming of age in a traditional setting that could not quite accept her difference but loved her anyway. (I think that Atticus' unmarried brother, Jack, is also gay, which Atticus recognizes and serves as another reason why he goes so easy on Scout's tomboy ways.)This a charming book with little gay content (but it's there- look for it) and plenty of character and excellent writing for young or mature readers."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read To Kill A Mockingbird years ago but was inspired to read it again after seeing the movie Capote (he was Harper Lee's best friend).

Amazon delivered this anniversary edition to me very quickly from the U.S. to Australia."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The is an excellent book and I am very satisfied with my purchase from Amazon.

It is a classic for good reason. Great story for the young and old."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird ReviewIn the classic novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee expressed the events of a small, rural town, Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1930's. The story was centered around the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man being defended by a well-respected lawyer, Atticus Finch.Maycomb's economy was based primarily on agriculture. It seemed to be an enjoyable community but had its share of problems that included Mayella Ewell's accusation on Tom Robinson.Throughout the story, many different themes were presented in their own, compelling way. Racism played an important role as blacks were discriminated within the community, received worse jobs than the white community, and had separate churches. In the case of Tom Robinson, racism led to his conviction and ultimately to his death. The title of the book itself was shown as a theme. Mockingbirds were described as peaceful animals that provided humans with pleasant music and didn't do anything that made people upset. Tom Robinson can be seen as a mockingbird because, as proved in his trial, never harmed anyone and did things only in a positive way. Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley was also considered a mockingbird because he performed unknown deeds that helped the town.The tale was told through Atticus's eight year old daughter, Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch. Along with Scout, her older brother, Jeremy Atticus \\"Jem\\" Finch always seemed to be getting into some kind of trouble. Their neighbor's nephew, Charles Baker \\"Dill\\" Harris, joined in Scout and Jem's incredible adventures during the summertime. They had a strong fascination for their neighbor, Boo Radley, a strange fellow who only left his home at night. The many characters in the book were what made it such an interesting story.To Kill a Mockingbird was broken up into two parts. The first part described Jem and Scout and their experiences within the community. Some of these events included their first day of school. Scout got in trouble with her first grade teacher, Miss Caroline. In addition, she had a fight with a boy named Walter Cunningham. Another was the fire at Miss Maudie's home that attracted the entire community, who all helped in some way. It was there that Jem and Scout unknowingly had their first encounter with Boo Radley.The second part to the talked mainly about the trial of Tom Robison, which all led up to the ending. From lies in the courtroom to almost the death of Jem and Scout, the second part sorts out all that was unknown in the book and created a suspenseful way to end the novel.In conclusion, To Kill a Mockingbird really captured the reader's attention. It showed some problems that went on during the 1930's but explained how communities came together in times of struggle. It was definitely a book I enjoyed reading. If you like a book full of adventure that keeps you on the edge of your seat, this book is certainly for you. You will not put it down until you have read every last page."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Modern literature has a polarizing effect. For every person who declares Catcher in the Rye a classic, there is someone else who will tell you it is a waste of paper and that it's teenaged protagonist is a whiney little brat (okay they might use a harsher term - but I'm trying to keep this family-friendly). For every fan of Faulkner, there are a few (maybe a few hundred) who will say the Sound and the Fury is incompressible rubbish.And then there is \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".Readers fall into two camps: those that will tell you this is a great American novel and those who say that not only is this a great American novel - it is the best novel ever written. I fall into the first camp. This is a splendid novel, one of the best 100 of all time, but not the best novel ever written.Over 1,550 people have reviewed it so far on this website so there isn't much more I can add. It is a complex, richly rewarding novel. Without becoming overwrought and sentimental it addresses difficult issues of family, racism, and standing up for what you believe in.A novel everyone should read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is the great American novel. Its characters are solid and believable, moving fluidly through a finely honed tale of love and sorrow. I remember the first time I read \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\". Flying through it in order to get my English paper done, I missed a lot. One summer later I found myself reading it again out of boredom. That boredom didn't last. In the years since I have reread the story three or four times; once even staying up all night. The power of the story lies in the words for me. The simple descriptions of complicated actions from the perspective of a small girl have incredible power. The final line of the novel regarding the fact that Atticus would be there when Jem \\"waked in the morning\\" exemplifies this by simply showing the love this man has for his son with out relying on overt emotionalism. In its' simplicity it avoids sensationalism and therefore comes across stronger and clearer. Yet in my rereading, I have always found a new level of understanding for the words and actions, growing to love the novel more each time.To Kill A Mockingbird is a sensational book to read for yourself and pass to others. Atticus Finch is a wonderful role model for all ages. He stands up for what he believes in without giving into pressures placed upon him during the story. Jean-louise Finch, also known as Scout to most people who know her, is a wonderful role model for all young and old children. She is placed in situations that many of us at one point are. She learned many lessons through out the book along with Dill Harris and her Brother Jeremy Atticus Finch. The children had their own goals set for themselves. They were \\"after\\" Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radly, and the story behind him.Harper Lee's love for people swells from the pages of this book. Her characters are exquisitely drawn, their story is believable and thrilling. Read this book and see the movie! It's too bad she went into seclusion after she wrote this book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Great classic book. No matter how the world changes, this story will always ring true. Easy read on a lazy afternoon. You'll fall in love with the characters."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee writes this book and the way she wrote this book was real nice. The setting of this book happened around the 1930's when blacks are still discriminated.This book starts with a girl name Scout telling her story about her summer days in a small town called Maycomb. She acted more like a boy but the way she acts she is more mature compare to the kids with the same age. So this story she tells has two important parts, the frightened neighbor that live beside them, which later save her at the end and the rape case. The rape case in my opinion was the most exciting part of the story. When Scouts father defends for the black in the rape case. At that time, when a white is helping a black, it would be awkward.Overall this book really a must read book not because its a classic but it really tells you what happened during the south's at that time."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is set in the 1930's when the country was in the Great Depression. This book deals with the intense racism of the time. Good book for required reading in school."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Who is innocent, and who is not? To Kill a Mockingbird, written by Harper Lee, is a perfect example to prove even with an outstanding defense in court, we cannot ever be sure how a case will turn out. Jean Louise Finch (referred to as Scout in the book) is the main character in this story. Her problems are not the most complicated, but she was considered young to start going through them: watching Atticus, her father, try to protect an African American man who was accused of raping a white girl and more simple- lessons about life. Scout faced difficult feelings for being a \\"young girl\\". She would become angry at life and anything else in it when she did not understand something or when it was not fair. That is how life is, right? Sharing some of the same problems with Scout are other characters Jem, her older brother by four years; Charles Baker Harris (Dill), Scout's boyfriend who was introduced early in the book; Atticus, her father and an excellent lawyer; Calpurnia, the African American housekeeper in charge of the children due to their mother's death while Scout was two; and Aunt Alexandria, a mean sister of Atticus that tries to teach Scout how to become lady-like.Throughout the tale, Scout learns how to live the \\"civil\\" way from her Aunt Alexandria. Scout was completely stubborn with her ideas because whatever she saw, she took in, would then comprehend it, and finally form her own opinion. Jem, Scout, and Dill were extremely determined to see \\"Boo\\" Radley release himself of his house because rumors proposed the idea of him being ghost-like, when all he did was keep to himself. This realistic fiction's theme in my opinion, we have to live life for ourselves because no one can live it for us. If that includes standing up for ourselves, then by all means do what we believe in. The way Harper Lee wrote this novel (flashback form told by Scout) reminded me of how Zora Neale Hurston wrote Their Eyes Were Watching God because they were both written in flashbacks.To Kill a Mockingbird had an unbelievingly shocking ending and was written flawlessly. The book kept me reading until the end, where multiple surprises were waiting. Depending on the part of the story I was in, I felt happy or other sections had made me feel horrible. These emotions were mostly based on how life used to be with racism and how life is today with racism. Although Harper Lee published this as her only book, she wrote a few articles for American magazines. An all-around excellent book with several lessons dealing with the different aspects of life, I recommend this to all who are old enough to understand and enjoy."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"There are some books that are so good they make you a better person by just reading them and 'To Kill a Mocking Bird' is one that does just that. From the prose, to the characters, plot and sub-plots, it is an utterly enchanting book. Atticus Finch is one of my most beloved characters in all of literature. I find the book excruciatingly gentle and pure, due in part to the corruption of the main plot contrasted with the tender setting. Kids don't know any better, as Jem and Scout represent, that they are not supposed to like others for the color of their skin or the cloths that they wear. Only the adults infect the world with hatred, even though Scout's got some bad temper; it, too, is simple anger. As with all great stories there is an overwhelming sense of suspense about Boo Radley, the town and even the fact that Atticus is the best shot in the county. Although the gentleness of the setting and some of the characters,e.g Scout, Jem and Dill, there is yet an over arching sense of tragedy that hangs over the book. It almost seems that Scout is recounting, through the narration, an unimaginably horrible time of her life that only recently healed enough to recount. And yet the summer days with Dill and Jem are told with misty nostalgia of a better time and place, that could neverlast, but that is for grown-ups. Race is one of the main issues that faces America still, that dare to live up to the words \\"that all men are created equal.\\" Just as pertinent today as when the Jim Crow laws were still in effect. Childhood is a time of innocence and forgiveness; where adulthood is hard and unjust. As Scout and Jem learn, even physically with Jem's twisted arm,the illusions of youth are ripped away, and the harsh realities stand out in stark contrast."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Hello i am Rachel a 13 year old I read to kill a mockingbird over the summer and I really liked it. It was sometimes boring but very good. With To Kill A Mockingbird you have to be patient and it takes a while to read but in the end it is worth it. I found the Characters very well developed and the ideas profound, it gave me a good look at a sleepy town during the deppression. It was told at an 8 year olds point of veiw so it combined daily life and games with the worries of the town.

But the fact is that so many of the women I've been meeting mention this as one of their all-time favorites that I figured I should read it: also, it is a legal thriller of sorts, and I love legal thrillers. Well, I read it, and I loved it. The eyes of a child are the window through which we see the events unfold in this tale, and that child's viewpoint is honest, open, and innocent. The town comes alive, as do all of the characters, and you start to feel as though you're also part of the town. This novel will have you laughing, crying, and tug at your heart-strings.

I had very high expectations, but found myself utterly disappointed. I don't really understand why this book has become so famous. First, rather than being a story on racial discrimination and moral injustice in the South(as advertised on my edition of the book), it's really a sequence of different stories/events in the life of a 10 years old, that develops rather slowly. The title itself is little revealing. Even after who knows how many pages into the book, I did not fully grasp the main story line or point about the book - I kept on reading, hoping that it would eventually reveal itself, but it never did. Instead, it seems to be a loose narrative of different events in the life of a 10-years old , and none of the stories are really brought to an end or illuminated/analysed from a moral standpoint. Everything was just too obvious and cliche-ridden. Second, it was poorly written and bar of any signs of great literature that would deserve the Pulitzer Price. Someone just please explain this to me."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Of course this is a well-known novel that has made the best seller list a long time ago.

I would definately reccommend it to anyone who is mature enough to understand the complexity of the novel. My favorite character is Scout because she is so innocent and she speaks her mind. Harper Lee brought up the subject of racism in a very unique manner. I case you don't want to read the book, you could always watch the movie which is also excellant and sticks to the plot very closely.

I have this thought because the events in this book are based on racial issues that happened in earlier years, and as younger readers we have no recolection of what is happening. As for the older readers these kind of issues are are not hard to recall beacause in the time period they were growing up in racisim was not uncomon so while reading this they have empathy for what the writer is saying and know where she is coming from. So when i was reading this book some areas were hard to undderstand having never experienced the racial remarks and racisit actions that the characters go through and participate in. So i think that if i was older and had any reference to what is happening i think that i would enjoy this book but as a kid i do not recomend it to the younger audiences."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I give To Kill A Mockingbird 3 stars because of several reasons.

I still enjoyed reading (just) the beginning part and when there was \\"sudden\\" action taking place. However I believe the lowest part of the book was the ending. there were most parts where I didn't understand or like, Even though I didn't really enjoy the book, the best part about this book was the them; the theme was how racism was taken into effect.

For Lee Harper only writing onw book, she did a terrifantisticalful job by all means. The characters were life-like and full of warmth. She describes each event as though she was actually living in Alabama at the time. I would definitly recommend to other people. This book offers life lessons every person should learn. And each chapter holds a different surprise for the reader to discover. This book offers a great opportunity to read an awesome piece of literature."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I am still reading this one, but I have to say that it's phenomenal. Scout (the narrator telling about her childhood) is a great kid and so is Jem (Scout's older brother). And their father is so smart! Atticus is a great dad. I get so involved with the book; I've started dreaming about it! It's a great book that a parent could read to their kid. Actually, it's more of a teen book. I started reading it when I was 9 and I didn't really get much out of it. But now that I'm 13, I am understanding more and loving so much that I want to go and read it right now! It's very smartly stated and I can't wait to finish it. The movie is good too! It's a sad book, but it's a great book so READ IT! Got to go and read some more! I love it. I really truly do."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I think many people have missed the point of the book. The book is a classic coming of age story about two young siblings in the south. It's told from the point of view of Scout, a preteen girl. The different events in the book are relevant because they lead to Scout's maturity. She goes from an innocent child, to a maturing preteen. Example: In the begining of the novel, Scout and her brother Jem are obsessed with the idea of Boo Radley. They don't view him as a human being. He is this scary thing that they don't quite believe is real. They come up with ideas to get him to come out of the house. They even try to look through his windows to catch a glimpse of him. Later, when Boo saves Scout and Jem from Mr. Ewell, Scout feels ashamed of she and her brother's previous treatment of Boo Radley. She realizes that he's just another human being. He's nothing to be afraid. He deserves to be treated the same as everyone else. That moment was when Scout left her childhood behind. The rape trial is also another turning point in Scout's maturity. It's not about rape or racism. Those themes help to shape the person that Scout will become. I loved this book and I plan on buying it so I can read it whenever I feel like it. I've read some of the reviews here. I think it's sad that many people missed the point of the book. I also think that this book might not be for everyone. I think southerners will relate to the book better than anyone else. I found Scout and Jem's way of life to be very much like my own growing up. I think the book is a must read for everyone, but people need to open their minds and look deeper. Look past the rape and racism. The book is about so much more than that."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This story is about a 8 year old girl named Jean Louise (Scout) Finch that lives with her father Atticus and her brother Jeremy(Jem) Finch in the little town of Maycomb.This book was really interesting and touching and made me think about what colored people had to go through to live in the south.My favorite part was the Tom Robinson trial.I also liked the movie too.It didnt show all the details that were in the book, but it was a great reselmblence :)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Somehow I made it through high school AND college without being required to read this book. I've heard nothing but good things about this book and thought I should go and pick it up.I can see why people do nothing but rave about this book. It is truly wonderful; a real work of art. It is amazing that Harper Lee never wrote any other books.This is the story of Jean Louise, known by her loved ones as Scout, and the experiences of her family and her home town of Maycomb, Alabama back in the 1960's when blacks were still largely oppressed by whites.You fall in love with Scout, her brother Jem, her father Atticus, and most of the residents of Maycomb throughout the first half of the book. Through the eyes of Scout, you really see how things used to be during that time. Also, through the upbringing of her father, you begin to understand why some people do things that don't make much sense on the cover. You learn to try and see things through there eyes before passing judgment.However, in the second half of the book, judgment unfortunately come to Tom Robinson. He is standing trial for raping a white girl and the events of the trial will unveil the true character of nearly everybody in Maycomb. It is sad, but it is a real character piece. While it is slowly paced, especially at the beginning during the characterization part of the book, it is still hard to put down. The characters in this book become as alive and real as the people in your own town.It is a book that will cause you to reflect on your own life, and how you treat those you meet. It is a book that will make you realize the ugliness and terrible results of racism. It is a book that every person should read whether forced to in school or not. It is a book I will read time and time again. It is a book I highly recommend."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mocking BirdLee, HarperA PandeyPeriod - 5A great book by Harper Lee! This book takes place in Maycomb, Alabama during the 1930's ,or else known as the great depression.The book is about the society when white people and black people didn't get along that well. Scout our main character in this book is a tomboy. Everyone in the society use to tell her your dad, is a nigger lover beacuse he is helping a black man in court for false rape charages against him. The blace man who accused of raping a Mayella a white women, Tom Robinson, but no one beliefed him except scout's dad because Tom was black. This whole book is about Scout learing about the terrible society when black and white people didnt get along.I liked this book because it explains about the society in which different color people didn't get along very well. I also learned that you should not judge people until your in their shoes, and view life in their point of view. Boo Radely was a great character to me because everyone thought he is an evil person, but he turns out to be a great soul who always cared about Jem and Scout.Jem is a very protective and wise brother of Scout. I liked this because it taught me about racial differences back in the 1930's. I liked the quote Atticus said,\\" You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view . . . until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.\\"I liked everything in this book except for some racial comments by the society. I disliked the part when Mrs. Gate's told her 3rd grade class how mean Hitler is tormenting the Jews. Later, Scout overheard Mrs. Gates talking to another teacher that black people should be treated like this not Jews. This quote really touched me and was my favorite one, \\"Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy . . . but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\"My favorite part of this book was when Scout, Jem, and Dill are running to Radelys house to have a glimse of him, when they see a shadow of his from the window. Suddendly there was a gunshot the three tried to runaway from the fence when Jem pants get stuck in the fence and rip. When Jem father asks him where his pants are Dill says \\" We were playin strip poker\\" this part was interesting because it showed how Dill helped out in times like that. Later on that night at 2 o' clock when Jem goes to look for his pants he finds it sewn and nicely folded it for him as if someone knew he was going to come. This also shows another example of kindness from Boo Radely. Overall this was a excellent book to read for me."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; takes place in Maycomb, Alabama, during the Great Depression. There was a lot of racism during this time and it's expressed in this book. The Finch family includes Jean Louise, aka Scout, Jem, and Atticus. Atticus is the father of Scout and Jem. They're mother died when Scout was young, so Scout is quite a tomboy. During the summer, Dill stays in town and plays with Jem and Scout. Most of their time is occupied wondering what happens beyond the Radley's door. The Radley's are neighbors of the Finches and are very mysterious people. Arthur Radley, aka Boo, is the most mysterious of them all though. None of the kids have seen him. But that is one thing Scout, Jem, and Dill intend on changing. During all this, Atticus is appointed to defend a black man on trial for raping Mayela Ewell. Most of the town and county look down on Atticus for taking this case. Jem and Scout even get bothered by this. But through all of it, the family sticks together.I highly recommend this book.

When is this going to end?' but once I hit the last 4 chapters, they flew by. The surprise ending was amazing, and at the end, I found myself thinking 'No, it can't be over yet!'.

It had never occurred to me that a book written almost half a century ago could actually be entertaining, but To Kill A Mockingbird was an exception. I was intrigued by this powerful piece of literature that had touched the lives of millions of readers. After having enjoyed the book, I went out and rented the Academy-Award winning film that was also considered a classic. Could the film really capture the book in all of its essence? I had never seen a film that had actually been better that the book, but I gave it a try. Overall, the film had been exceptionally good and had captured some very important and meaningful parts in a stunning and excellent manner. It had brought the action and emotion to life. Yet, as one would expect, the book was still superior to and more entertaining than the film.I have never liked the fact that filmmakers usually must exclude some small parts of the book save time, but normally I just let it go and enjoy the movie in all of its brilliance. I could have done the same when viewing To Kill A Mockingbird the film, but the filmmakers had cut out some outstanding parts that had great significance in the book. I was annoyed that they had cut so many parts. For example, in the book, Miss Maudie's house catches fire and an old fire truck, killed by the cold, is pushed from town by a group of men. All the men of Maycomb bring Miss Maudie's furniture out of the house and onto a yard across the street as the flames devour Miss Maudie's home. In the midst of all of this emergency, as Scout and Jem watch in awe, Boo Radley comes up behind Scout and puts a blanket around her without her even knowing it until later that night when Atticus sees it. Still, Scout and Jem are not convinced that Boo Radley could ever be a kind person, let alone a friend of theirs. This part shows Jem and Scout still not being able to see the real Boo Radley, both physically and mentally.The film also did not include many of the small details that illustrate the fact that Jem and Scout are growing up. The book shows some evidence that Scout and Dill are \\"engaged\\" and are to be married when the time comes. However, the film only portrays the two as being merely friends. Also, the film gives no mention of Aunt Alexandra, Atticus' sister, who wants Scout to become more of a sophisticated young woman and takes action when she invites Scout to a tea party that is only took part in by the mature and experienced women of Maycomb. Alexandra also has some arguments with Atticus about not to letting Scout \\"run wild\\". The latter parts of the book suggest that Jem is becoming a young man. He becomes slightly grouchy and less kind to Scout and begins to grow hair under his arms. The film disregards these details that contributed so much to the meaning and quality of the book. The book suggests that, during Mr. Gilmer's (Mr. Ewell's lawyer's) cross-examination of Tom Robinson, Scout and Jem take Dill out of the courtroom when Dill starts to cry because he is disgusted by Mr. Gilmer's arrogant attitude toward Tom Robinson. The three children begin to realize the hatred and inhumanity of the world they live in. The film completely ignores the fact that Scout is trying to deal with all the problems of the growing up and maturing of herself and others in the book.To Kill A Mockingbird the film had never really matched intensity that the book had so often portrayed. The film never touched the core of all human behavior and dignity. However, I was not disappointed or surprised that the film had never reached the level of passion and heartrending that the book had. A film can never reach that level of authenticity and heart. It will only try and fail. Today, To Kill A Mockingbird may be, to some, a book too old and dull to find enjoyment in, but that, in any circumstance, will never be true with an enduring masterpiece such as this."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful book. I especially love the child's perspective it is written from. Somehow, putting it that way makes the racism and cruelty portrayed all the more horrific.The characters are very realistic (which is a big issue with me!) and the plot, while simple, is very intriguing. This is a sad story for the most part, but it also has great hope, because it shows that there are courageous people in the world who are willing to stand against culture and fight for the rights of those whom no one cares about.If you have not read this book, you must; it is well worth it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Scout, a young girl in a quiet southern town, is about to experience the dramatic events that will affect the rest of her life.

The book narrates the story of a young girl named Jean Louise Finch, also called &iexcl;Scout&iexcl;. Lee presented this book through the eyes of Jean Louise.The story takes place in Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1930&iexcl;s or so. The plot is about Scout&iexcl;s father, Atticus Finch (a lawyer), trying to defend Black suspect Tom Robinson for accused of raping a White girl in the Maycomb County of Alabama. The plot incorporates several issues that people were struggling during the time of the story, including racism, injustice, and prejudice. The entire novel circulates around Scout and her family. Many situational conflicts arise, from trying to make Boo Radley come out of seclusion to dealing with family and community difficulties.Lee did a miraculous job of telling the story through the view of Scout. The characters were depicted hardly by their appearances, but by their personality traits, which showed advanced style in writing. The setting and the time periods had a great impact on the story, as people those days lived quite close to each other and knew their neighbors well. I was amazed how natural and realistic the characters were made. Scout and her older brother, Jeremy (also called Jem), reacted to situations exactly as many of the children now days would act. Almost every character in the story had a crucial role at some point of the story. The character development was beyond imagination. From Dill (Jem and Scout&iexcl;s best friend) coming to visit the Finch family in the summer, to Jem trying to make it past the Radley&iexcl;s gate, to Calpurnia (the house cook) scolding the children for not coming home, this piece of literature truly elaborated on pivotal character details. After reading this book, one would think he knows the characters quite well.Overall, this was a fantastic novel to read and I was truly impressed with the quality of writing and development presented in this story by Harper Lee. To Kill a Mockingbird will truly be an American Literature classic for as long as it will be remembered."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In post 9/11 21st America, kids can't go two feet without holding their parents hands. If they do, they risk rape and mutilation at the hands of the products of late 20th century political correctness. Harper Lee's brilliant novel gives us a view of what is what like at the other end of the pendulum swing, and lets us see what life was like back then - through the eyes of a very young, precocious tomboy named Scout. All of the ills that plague our society are there... rape, prejudice, fear of the unknown, and just plain meanness. Ms. Lee confronts these ills, but leads you slowly through a gentile, scenic picture of Maycomb County, Alabama during the Great Depression.I was first introduced to this story by watching the movie on TV in the late 1960's and was fascinated with the story from the children's point of view. Later, when reading the novel in the 10th grade I realized that Ms. Lee had given us a compelling masterpiece dealing with crime, ignorance, prejudice, innocence, and community that stands out as one of the most enduring classics of the last century. Children were still allowed to be children back then. We follow the adventures of Scout, her older brother Jem, and their friend Dill until their adventures bring us into the rape trial of Tom Robinson, a black man being defended by her father. It is against the backdrop of the a 1930s rape trial that we are introduced to Atticus Finch, one of the best written father figures to ever spring from the mind of an author. His client is a black man accused of raping a white woman. It is through his relationship with his children that we experience the need to transcend social injustice with courage and compassion. The dialect of the characters, the colorful locals, and the rhythm and pace of the story is perfect. It is seasoned with humor, suspense, and some of the most wonderfully entertaining narrative prose I have ever read. I just re-read this book for the 15th time, and still highly recommend. Whether you're 15 or 95, To Kill A Mockingbird is still a sensational reading experience. After reading To Kill a Mockingbird you'll wish we had more people like Atticus Finch to make us feel safe and protected."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is perhaps the best written novel in American History. Author Harper Lee takes readers back to the deep south with her descriptive writing. Jem, Dill and Scout are unforgettable characters along with Atticus providing a positive role for the three careless youths. This book will take one back to their childhood days where everyone lived by an old spooky house such as the Radley's. Harper Lee vividly describes the innocence of the children through Scout who is the narrator for the novel. This book is a must read. One that you will want to read again and again."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is about the life in a southern town back in the early days described through the eyes of a little girl named Scout. Scout and her brother Jem face many obstacles because they are the children of a lawyer who is defending a Negro. During this time many people of the town could not accept that. The children were also caught up in the mystery behind the man next door, named Boo Radley, who never would come out of his house. Scout and Jem also experience the difficulty in understanding just how life was. As a reader I could feel how the children were affected by the situations in the story. Scout was the youngest and most vulnerable making her the most exciting character in the book.In the first chapter, I could see how much I could relate to Scout. I was quickly drawn to the description of her character and the fearless attitude she portrayed. The games she and her brother played are the same games most children play today. It was easy to relate to her way of understanding and going about things because she was so young. When Scout wanted to know the who, what, when, why, and how of everything and would not give up until she understood is the way every child is when they want to know about something. Scout's curiosity and intelligence makes the reader become more involved.This story makes the reader go through a series of emotions. One minute we enjoy seeing the children play together, then the next minute we get a suspenseful feeling trying to understand the situation behind Boo Radley. It was interesting to read this book and get the chance to picture the days when prejudice was a major issue even to the point of costing the life of a character. My favorite part in the story was when Scout got into fights. She was always protecting her family and herself from anyone who would say bad things about them. Her father tried to show her the lady like way \\"on going about things\\" especially when people would talk about him. Because she respected her father, she tried to keep his wishes.I recommend that this book continue to be a selection in reading assignments in school everywhere. I encourage students to read this book because I believe it can change a person's view of prejudice. The younger the reader is, the more they can relate to the story and picture growing up in those days. It is educational to read on the subject of prejudice and how it was viewed in the past."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is another one of those books a lot of kids have to read in school. The title of the book kind've sets teens off like many books do. But really this book is wonderful! It took me a while to get into it but in the end I did. The book is about growing up and facing that people aren't all the same. Little kids see everyone as equals but when they grow up they see that isn't true.The book's main character is Jean Louise or better known as Scout. The book follows her and her brother Jem's adventures. They may live in a small town but any child can find something to do even in the most boring towns and that's exactly what Scout and Jem do. They bug the heck out of the Radleys, a quiet family in the town. Scout has to face her fears of going to school.The main conflict in the story is the case of Tom Robinson, a negro.

Must read!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee is a master of the human heart. She knows just how to portray the love of Atticus for his children. She expertly weaves the story courage both of Atticus as he defends Tom Robinson, and indeed of Tom Robinson himself and his fears. Tom's fears are very real and you see the prejudice and hatred of our society clearly, with no attempts to mask anything. There are deep themes in this book, themes which we can not just read about but learn and apply to our lives to enrich them. The story of Tom Robinson is sad, very sad, but it can be prevented and this story gives the way to answer it. Also, we learn so much about the love of a father for his children. It is beautiful and should not be missed when reading this story.This book is a classic and just a great, great story!If you don't have it, BUY IT and enjoy it for years to come."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Hi im Dan and im 15 years old. I have just finished reading this book for my tenth grade english class. I thought this book was a very good book. I liked how this book relates to everyday life and even though this book was written many years ago, people still deal with the some of the same everyday issues that this book deals with. This book dealt mainly with racism and although racism is still around us, alot of poeple have learned to look beyond the color of a persons skin. I thought this was a well written book and would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"We've all grown up in worlds we didn't understand; the dos and don'ts us grown-ups define for our children's lives are projected through the innocent eyes of a six-year old girl trying to figure out our world.The book starts with a rough portrayed picture of the American South during the Depression years through the eyes of a child, who though surprisingly intelligent and far beyond her years, is still too young and too innocent to comprehend the world as it is. As we proceed through the pages, the facade drops only to reveal that, what lies beneath is a world of hypocrisy, social lies, prejudice, and ignorance.A handful of ideas occupy the reader's mind while at reading the book: innocence, education, bravery, prejudice, fear and justice.Education is the weapon through which the widowed father arms his children to fight society. He treats them as equals, adults and of a certain level, thus producing a charming yet troublesome duo...It soon becomes clear why he thinks education is so important. Education is the key to unlocking the ignorance that causes such prejudice. Lessons regarding bravery and cowardice are also taught in an effective way and in a much wide spectrum than not just children but also adults would think of. Atticus's children find out quite early in their young lives that guns do not make men brave and that any fascination with guns is unfounded.Instead, fighting with one's misfortunes, especially when the battle is by fact lost, is the way of making true men, men of honour. His children learn that it takes more bravery and self-restraint to avoid a fistfight than succumb to the temptation of going through with it. Some adults never do...The most important issue of the book is prejudice in all of its forms. Through the eyes of Scout, her father is the liberal approach to human relations and her aunt is the respective conservative. Gender roles, class distinctions and skin colour are the facts imposed on the children growing up in the average southern town of yesteryears. The belief that a cast of people are better, is confronted by the father's stand, that one should sympathize with others and \\"walk in their skin\\" before judging or criticizing them.Innocence. As hunters kill mockingbirds for sport, people kill innocence, or other people who are innocent, without any remorse about what they are doing. Killing innocence is like amputating the spirit, projecting to the young hopeful minds of tomorrow that all is vanity, thus killing any hope in their minds and hearts, and wiping out any chances that our society might have to adopt, adapt and improve...Then comes fear. Small town folks fear that they should adhere to what others think they should do, act within the margins the social rules command, or be isolated. \\" Cursed is the mutant by God and men...\\" Even nowadays, fear of rejection dictates the social status quo and keeps individuals from standing up for that which they believe. Coming from a Greek society, I have been many times confronted by my immediate or wider environment about things I felt, thought or imagined of being right. I think that the lesson learned here is that until we are able to comprehend and absorb other people's ways, we are just slaves of our own prejudice, fear and hypocrisy......"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I liked this book because it shows how life used to be. It shows you how racist those times were. Another reason I enjoyed this book was because it had a female that always stood up for what she believed in and didn't care what anyone thought about it. I don't think it was fair that Tom Robinson got convicted because he was black."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"There does not seem to be much to add to this book's numerous, and well-deserved, accolades--so all that I will say is that this is a novel that has withstood the test of time.TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD became a classic because of the stories that author Harper Lee intertwined, and the morals that she imparted. The tale itself is complex and Lee's telling of this tale is graceful.One cannot call oneself a student of American fiction if one has not read TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee published a book about racism seen from a child\`s view.The story takes place in a southern state of the USA in the 1930's.The novel is about a man called Atticus Finch, a lawyer, who lives in a small town and who is considered to be well off.He lives there with his daughter called Scout, his son Jem and their cook Calpurnia, who is black.Atticus doesn't see any place for prejudice of any kind.He is called to defend the black man Tom Robinson who is accused of raping a white girl.He knew this case would be difficult to win and could totally change his life.The story seems to focus on the representation of the mockingbird as a symbol of innocence.Atticus was portrayed as a man who thought compassion and honesty to his children.He brings himself and his children into a dangerous situation by defending a black man, but he is convinced that it is very important to show the residents of Maycomb that Tom is innocent and that they are stupid not to believe him.To my mind This novel is really worth reading because this theme is present everyime."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"By reading Harper Lee's over 30.000.000 sold novel, which also won the Pulizer Prize, the reader can explore the prejudices against the unknown and the racism of a province in the 1930\`s trough the eyes of the young girl Scout, a laywyer's daughter. Scout and her brother Jem are frightened of Boo Radley, who isn't known by the people in Maycomb, although there are a lot of rumors about him. The lawyer Atticus Finch defends the afro-american man Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping the poor white girl Mayella Ewells.This book fascinates me, because it shows the racism and hate of this world from another perspective than the most other novels do. It shows that it is wrong to judge people only because they are different from you."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The story To Kill A Mockingbird, is a story that is set in Maycomb, Alabama during the 1960's, when blacks and whites still didn't get along too well. The author, Harper Lee, wrote this book as if it was 8-year-old Scout Finch telling the story. This makes the story more emotional to the readers because it tells about the hard times of growing up, going to school, and dealing with life.The story starts off as everything going pretty well in this little Alabama town with her brother Jem Finch, who is a couple years older then her, her father, Atticus Finch, who is a lawyer, and their maid, Calpurnica. In the summer one year a boy named Dill Harris was visiting with his Aunt Stephanie, and met up with Jem and Scout and from that summer on Dill would come and stay with them. Down the street from the Finch's there was a old house, which the Radley family used to live in. The people said now that only the father of the family, Boo Radley lived there and he was crazy. Each summer the children would try to make him come out of the house or atleast get a little look at him. They never got this wish, but they still believed that he was in there, and alive.As the story continues, the children's father, Atticus, is appointed by the judge to represent a black man, Tom Robinson, in court. The people said that Robinson raped a girl named, Mayella. Her father said that he saw Robinson do it, but with Mayella and her father testifying they came out with differnet sides of the story.The book To Kill A Mockingbird, I think, is a very good book. It tells about racism, how hurtful people can be, how loving others can be, and how no matter what someone says or does to you, that you can never stop believing in what you think is right just because someone else tells you to. I think that everyone should read this book because it really makes you think about what is important in life."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of my favorite novels. The author, Harper Lee, takes readers to the roots of human behavior: kindness &amp; cruelty, love &amp; hatred.The story takes place in a small Alabama county. The main characters are a brother &amp; sister named Jen &amp; Scout--and their father named Atticus Finch. Their mother had died when the kids were younger. They also have a friend named Dill. The kids have lots of things happen to them. Down the street there is a house that looks deserted. All the kids call it the &quot;Radley House&quot;. They think a guy named &quot;Boo&quot; Radley lives in it. So they act out skits and try to be the Radleys.About halfway through the novel their Dad (who is an attorney) takes up a case and defends an African-AMerican, accused of raping a local lady. In trying to help a black, Atticus loses his reputation in the white community. Everybody starts hating him and his kids. But he sticks to what he believes is right.The story climaxes when the family actually discovers the truth about 'Boo' Radley. Likewise, the community (&amp; the reader) discovers the truth about the accused, the accuser, and themselves. This book is a true classic. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I'd be surprised to hear of any American who hasn't opened the pages of this classic Harper Lee novel. Yes, we have Boo Radley, Atticus, Jem, Scout, and many more characters, but the truth behind this novel is sometimes doing what's right isn't about doing what's easy.This is a lesson we should all take to heart again and again.I have read this book again and again throughout my life. I shall continue to re-read it to my children and hope the cycle will continue."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I'm in 8th grade right now, in the advanced English class. We're reading this book for class. I was entranced quickly, and finished the book before the 'class' got to part 2, like many of my friends on the same level. This book is absolutely astounding: It has everything: beautiful writing, morality, humor, and the recognition of discrimination: Both against black people and against people with mental disabilities (like my sister). It shows the racist ways that were law in this age, and speaks against them. I loved reading it: One of the things I love about the 9X class is that we anilize the text: We see hints and foreshadowing, we notice small details. The two sides of good and evil are very easily defined, which is part of the beauty of the book. It shows love among children and of adults. It clearly puts good and bad face to face. Last, but not least, it shows that part of the niave fool, the mockingbird. Definitly one of the world classics, it will stand within it's own time, and I'm sure it won't be forgotten. Anyone who is intersted in great literature must read this."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird was the second book that I ever read about a family in the South that encounters racism. This book is absolutely amazing... so amazing that I read it three times. Oh, I don't mind telling you that all three times, I fell asleep reading the beginning. However, the story, the emotion, the characters are just... WOW! No one reads this book and doesn't LOVE it !^_~"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is told in the first person by a six-year-old girl with the prose style of a well-educated adult. The book's setting is a small town in Alabama, and the action behind Scout's tale is her father's determination, as a lawyer, liberal, and honest man, to defend a Negro accused of raping a white girl. The most important theme of To Kill a Mockingbird is the book's exploration of the moral nature of human beings-that is, whether people are essentially good or essentially evil. The novel approaches this question by dramatizing Scout's and Jem's transition from a perspective of childhood innocence, in which they assume that people are good because they have never seen evil, to a more adult perspective, in which they have confronted evil and must incorporate it into their understanding of the world. As a result of this portrayal of the transition from innocence to experience, one of the book's important subthemes involves the threat that hatred, prejudice, and ignorance pose to the innocent: people such as Tom Robinson and Boo Radley are not prepared for the evil that they encounter, and, as a result, they are destroyed. Even Jem is victimized to an extent by his discovery of the evil of racism during and after the trial. Whereas Scout is able to maintain her basic faith in human nature despite Tom's conviction, Jem's faith in justice and in humanity is badly damaged, and he retreats into a state of disillusionment.The moral voice of To Kill a Mockingbird is Atticus Finch, who has experienced and understood evil without losing his faith in the human capacity for goodness. Atticus understands that, rather than being simply creatures of good or creatures of evil, most people have both good and bad qualities. The important thing is to appreciate the good qualities and understand the bad qualities by treating others with sympathy and trying to see life from their perspective. He tries to teach this ultimate moral lesson to Jem and Scout to show them that it is possible to live with conscience without losing hope or becoming cynical. In this way, Atticus is able to admire Mrs. Dubose's courage even while deploring her racism. Scout's progress as a character in the novel is defined by her gradual development toward understanding Atticus's lessons. There is a maturity in Scouts observation as she finds contradiction in Mrs. Faust's intolerable racist manners towards blacks, but utmost compassion towards Jews massacre by Hitler."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read To Kill a Mockingbird in high school. When the books were passed out, I thought that it was going to be another boring book that was mandatory to read. However, once the themes were discussed, they made me realize that such problems go on in the world even today - racism, social status, etc. This book showed the parochial views of the citizens of Maycomb. I loved how the Finch family overlooked the rumors that were spreading and Atticus defended what (and who) he thought was right. I definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book was so good. i really liked how interesting it is. It has so many life lessons that everyone needs to learn sooner or later. You might as well read this book and enjoy it while learning. The main characters are Scout, Jem, Atticus, Boo, and Tom Robinson. This book is so interesting so i suggest you read it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Alas, this was another school book for English, but I must admit, my English teacher has good taste. This book, To Kill A Mockingbird, centers around Scout (or Jean Louise) and Jem (Jeremy) Finch. It is told through the eyes of Scout as sort of a reminiscence, beginning when she is six and he is ten. I found this book amusing and touching. It went through the lifestyle of the moderately poor in Maycomb County, Alabama in around 1930 and so forth. It also described deeply the feeling of racism between the whites and Afrian-Americans at the time, how far it went, and it is a charming story of a little tomboy girl's life. That sounds strange, haha, but it truly is a classic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I somehow have managed to miss reading this wonderfull book throughout my school career. I decided to read it now to see what I was missing over the years. What I ended with was a book I could not put down. It is truly an engrossing book stocked full of believable characters.The story works on many different levels and is weaved together masterfully. The story is told through the eyes of the little girl Scout. She tells the story about her hometown and the happenings in it. The reader learns about racism of which her father is the defense attorney for a black man accused of rape. The entire town knows he is innnocent, but he won't be released because of the color of his skin and the social mores of the time. The reader also learns of a neighbor with mental illness that facinates the children because he is a mystery. The best part of this book is that Scout explains the social workings of a small town during the great depression. It is both humorous and sad at the same time.This book is both a Pulitzer Prize winning classic and an easy read. It is wonderfull and entertaining. You will not be able to put it down and you won't want to either."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A MockingbirdI really enjoyed reading the novel, To Kill A Mockingbird. This book not only captured and held my interest, but I was also able to relate to and understand a lot of what the characters were going through. I felt as if I could relate to this book because it highlighted and gave a realistic description of human nature and behavior.One aspect of human nature that is shown in this book is how as people we are born innocent and blind to most of the wrongdoing in the world. As time goes by, we are subjected to different people and situations and our so called rose-colored glasses become darkened. The characters Scout and Jem illustrate this best. As young children, they assume that everyone is good and no harm can come to them because they have never really come into contact with evil in their lives yet. However, as the story progresses, they see, for the first time, prejudice, hatred and the overall ignorance of human beings. In addition to this, the children got to experience the effect that these things can have on people, specifically how they can ruin and destroy many lives. Usually, when hearing about racism or prejudice, we hear the more factual side of how people are affected, such as what rights they are being denied. I enjoyed this book because it gave me insight on how people are really affected, how they feel, and how their lives are changed as a result of the injustices.Despite the fact that this novel highlighted the evil nature of human beings, the author did not neglect to show that there is good in humans as well. The good nature of humans is represented in this book primarily through Atticus Finch. He is the father of Jem and Scout and a fairly well off lawyer in Maycomb. Throughout his life, Atticus has seen the capability of humans to be evil, yet somehow he has not become cynical or lost his faith in the human race. He understands that people are both good and bad, and Atticus does not look upon people with judgement. He, instead, tries to see and understand the reasons that people are the way they are. After reading this book I found myself trying to practice the moral values and ways of Atticus Finch in my own life."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird is a great story detailing important childhood events from the point of view of Jean Louise Finch(aka Scout). Jean is a little girl who lives with her older brother of 5 years, Jeremy Finch(aka Jem) and her father Atticus Finch in a little town in Maycomb county. The novel's main theme is basically the lessons one learns growing up. This theme is centered a lot around the trial of a black man, Tom Robinson, of supposedly raping a white woman. Atticus is the lawyer given the job of defending Robinson and with this heated trial occurring, Scout and Jem have to deal with a lot of oppossition and derision from many of their prejudiced neighbors. But, this story has so much more dealing with just the general complexities of growing up.I think my favorite thing about the novel was the characters. The Finch family comes across as easily liked people. Scout and Jem have a great relationship with their father and with each other. Also, I really liked the character of Atticus, as he comes across as a man you can really respect and admire. It's through him that the reader, along with Scout and Jem, come to learn some lessons in a sense as well. Of course, there are plenty of interesting secondary characters such as Boo Radley who Scout and Jem constantly try to lure from his reclusion in his home and Calpurnia, the woman who's like a mother to Scout and Jem.I'd say this book may get off to somewhat of a slow start and for the first few pages, you may not understand how this is considered to be a classic, but it's a great book as you progress through it and it tells a very simple, yet wonderful story. If you're interested in reading it, go ahead and get it as you'll probably really like it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird was a remarkable read, with little quips and funny stories to bind the book, along with the powerful telling of injustice and prejudice in our nation. Set in the quiet town of Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's-- the aftermath of the civil war, and the incipient prelude to the second World War-- we are narrated by Scout, a quick and innocent girl growing up in the deep south.We see that Scout's father tries to bring Scout up with a pure understanding of the nation, and to veer her away from the awful discrimination that is shown, but she simply cannot turn her face from the terrible hate and bitterness that is slowly bubbling in Maycomb. All these complex feelings are brought to a climax when a black man is accused of raping a young white girl. Scout's father must defend the man, and in doing so, endangers his own children.In order to truly understand, a reader must put him/herself in the shoes of Maycomb County's residents, and walk the painful steps of racial prejudice. You will find that the walk is almost unendurable; you'll question how this came to be, and what the consequences were. A delighting, yet sorrowful read, I'd recommend this to a serious reader, who is willing to learn of the past."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I liked the novel because it was about a town that was poor in wealth but rich in life. The worked hard for their money and didn't squader it for lifes pleasures.To Kill A Mockingbird follows three years in the life of eight year old Scout Finch, her brother, Jem and ther father Atticus. Who defends a black man who is accused of raping a white women.Like the slow-moving occupants of her fictional town, Lee takes her time to the heart of her tales. First, we meet the Finchs the summer before Scout's first year at school. Scout, her brother, and Dill Harris, a boy who spends his summers at his auts in Maycomb, while away, he spends his time reenacting the scenes of Dracula and plots ways to seek a peek at the town bogyman, Boo Radley. In the bigining what it boils down to was that the alleged rape of Mayella Ewell, the daughter of a drunk and violent white farmer, barely gets through to the children's conscious. Then Atticus is called on to defend the accused. Tom Tobinson, and soon Scout and Jem find themselves caught up in events beyond their understanding. During the trial, the town exhibits its ugly side, but Lee offers plenty of counterbalances as well dealing with an eldery woman's problem, the heroism of Atticus, and finally Scout's hard-won understanding that most people are essentially kind \\"who you really see them.\\" But turns funny, wise, and heartbreaking, To Kill A Mockingbird is one classic that continues to speak to a new generation and deserves to be reread often.Like I earlier stated I like this novel. I like the way Lee blends everything together and makes everything to story easier to understand. This novely with no mildew on its magnolia leaves, a funny, happy novel written with great precision. To Kill A Mockingbird is about conscience- how it is instilled in two children, Scout and Jem Finch and how it operates in their, Atticus, a lawyer appointed to defend a Negro on a rape charge. This is what I love about the novel, the lessons it teaches us, the lessons that we can take with us for the rest of our lives.I like how Lee combines two of the most common thesis of Southern writing-child's recollection of life among people in a small town seemly untonched by the twentieth century adn glaring in justices of racial prejudice to create a comtemporay American classic. It seems as though it could happen in real life back in its day. Everything seems as though this could really be a story based upon truth.I would recommend this book definitly to anyone who can appreciate a good book. I enjoyed reading this great novel in my spare time, so you know it must be worth reading, knowing how much i read this must be a good book.

It has been banned in some places for sexual themes and I think that's a shame! This is a nuce book that you will enjoy."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Author ofAfinidad: A novel of a serial killerTo my mind, this is the best book ever written. It has everything in it that a novel should have: unforgettable characters that you come to love, especially the two children at the heart of the novel, Scout, who narrates the story over a period of three summers, and her brother, Jem, but an erstwhile villain, Bo Radley, comes to find a place in your heart in the end as well; so descriptive of place and time (Alabama, 1930s) that you have to re-orientate yourself to your own surroundings when you put the book down, and the superb regional dialogue plays no small part in that; and a truly interesting storyline that keeps you deeply involved until the last page. The central story is the defence of a black man who is accused of raping a white woman by Atticus, the children's father. However, there is much, much more to the book than that. There is the innocent play of children in the blistering hot Southern summers; there is the angst they experience as they mature, especially poor Scout failing to conform to the accepted notion of a young Southern lady; and overall, there is the love and respect of a father for his children. There is also great drama in the book. Scout's father is forced to confront a mob set on lynching his client; Jem gets stalked by some terrifying presence one night; a rabid dog goes beserk and needs to be shot. The writing is so powerful that you are on the edge of your seat as these scenes unfold, and that includes some terrifc courtroom ones as Atticus roots out the truth behind the accusation of rape.There is a persistent rumor that this book was written by Harper Lee's great childhood friend, Truman Capote, and that wouldn't surprise me at all. I didn't get to Truman's books until years after reading and loving this one, but when I did, I thought the style of writing was exactly the same, and just as brilliant. So I personally think that there may be some truth in the rumor, or at the very least, that he gave a great deal of assistance.....As a bonus, it is a must for anyone who wants to gain insight into the Southern way of thinking seventy odd years ago."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is one of a kind.Harpler Lee really showed how life was like in the 30's.This book potrayed the life themes of innocence, honesty and justice."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"As part of my reading list this year I have decided to return to some of the classics I read in grade school, and \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" was at the top of my list. At this point I'm not quite sure how I feel about the novel - I neither liked it, nor disliked it. The choice of narrator was brilliant on Lee's part, and I greatly appreciated seeing such poignant events through the eyes of children.

All the Atticus', Scout's, Jem's, Tom Robinson's, Calpurnia's, Mrs. Dubose's, Heck Tate's, Boo Radley's, Mr. Cunningham's, and even the Bob Ewell's. Atticus was the perfect example of this, getting to know people as individuals and not as a member of a group. He helped Scout and Jem to see Mrs. Dubose not just as an angry old lady who shouts terrible things to them, but as a woman with an addiction trying her hardest to overcome it (and does). Scout innocently helped the mob outside the jail (or at least Mr. Cunningham) to view Atticus as a man with children instead of just someone trying to stop them from getting to Tom.In respecting all people, Atticus was respected by almost all (obviously not Bob Ewell), even though they may not agree with his choices.I read it with three of my children. I got a little nervous about the book choice when I remembered what the trial was about, but knowing the message of the book isn't rooted in the rape, I went for it, sometimes reading it as such, sometimes replacing \\"rape\\" for \\"hurt\\" (because of some of their ages and understanding). I'm glad we read it. They enjoyed it and we talked a lot about the messages in it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee weaves a coming of age story with its own everyday heroes. Scout and her brother, Jem, learn valuable lessons about life from the colorful characters around them and a society fraught with hard economic times and racial tension. Set during the depression in rural Alabama, Scout leads us through her world with the innocent eyes of a child. Not always understanding, but ever seeing.When Scout's father Atticus Finch is chosen to represent an African American man accused of raping a white woman, the stage is set for these children to learn some very valuable lessons about life...and the greatness of their father's integrity. When things are rough and the family may lose its innocence, a most unlikely hero steps from the shadows to save our young heroine and her brother in their time of need.To Kill a Mockingbird may be a classic for many reasons, but it will remain in this reader's heart for its character, its integrity and its willingness to step outside of the societal norm and see the goodness in people regardless of what the world at large may think or be told to believe. You would be hard pressed to find a classic book more easily entertaining and heart warming as this one.If you are not a reader, I highly recommend watching the 1962 movie of the same title, with Gregory Peck starring as Atticus Finch. If it is possible for an actor to capture the spirit of a character and bring that character more readily to life, I have not seen it yet.Enjoy!To Kill a Mockingbird"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird, written by Harper Lee, is a childhood memory told by Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch. The story begins by mentioning Jeremy \\"Jem\\" Finch's broken arm, but then takes us farther back to tell us the whole story.Jean Louise remembers her first day at school and bearing the unexplained wrath of her teacher. Her father, Atticus, lets her know that she'll be okay and either way she can't stop going. Jem also does his best to comfort his sister.Then, Jean Louise takes us to a large part of the story, summer time. Jem, Scout, and their neighbor, Dill, all make several attempts to get Boo Radley to come out of his \\"haunted\\" house. When Scout finally does meet Boo at the end of the book she finds him to be rather normal other than the extreme paleness of his skin after staying indoors all his life.The story then tells us of Atticus' case for Tom Robinson, a black who was accused of raping a white woman. Tom Robinson's case loses even after evidence of his inability to rape someone was shown. The jury was all white and would never let a black man win a case over even the white \\"trash\\".Mr. Ewell did have the satisfaction of knowing that Tom had died in a mad dash for freedom from prison. He had seen an opportunity to run and grabbed, but when he tried to vault a fence he was to slow and was shot in the back.But some truths were exposed of the Ewells (the family accusing him of rape), and Mr. Ewell held it against the Finches until his accidental death in which he killed himself when falling on a knife he planned to use to kill Scout and Jem finch. During his scuffle with Jem, he threw Jem at a tree and Jem's arm was shattered. This brought us to the close of Jean Louise's story.I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone who is considering reading it.I have heard a lot of people saying that the ending is no good, but I actually found the ending as pleasant as the rest of the book.The entire book teaches good morals on doing what you know to be right rather than what would be accepted better.

Atticus believes that since the trial is over and Tom is 70 miles away that Bob Ewell will be done with the whole thing and put it behind him. Aunt Alexandra who helps take care of Atticus, Scout and Jem thinks that a man like Bob will do anything to get revenge. Throughout the book, a sense of foreboding is felt due to wondering whether the Finch family are safe from Bob. Another character we hear alot about is Boo Radley. He is a man who sits in his house and never comes out. Scout and Jem wonder why he doesn't come out and everyone else tell them it is because he is weird and crazy. They are all scared of him.

Scout is the spunky younger sister who irritates at times, but always wins you over. And Dill, though troublesome at first, soon works his way into your heart until you want to protect.Even the adults are presented with dignity, although some have the mystique of youth. But who wouldn't have wanted a father like Atticus?This book will bring laughter, chills, anger, and tears. This book not only makes a reader think, it makes one feel. And that can be rare. This book will be one I intend to re-read throughout my life."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is my first attempt at writing a book review for amazon or otherwise, so forgive me if there's anything wrong with it.There are a few things that will make an instant good book for me. The first and foremost thing is if I can relate to it at all. No matter how farfetched the situations are, if the characters feel real or I can some how believe what's happening, what they're feeling then the book has achieved a great amount: that's the first sign of a good book. The second sign is the ending. If the ending blows me away and I'll be sitting with the last sentence, mouth ajar for a few minutes I know I've read a good book. The last thing is what it's about: if it feels like fluff or like the author didn't have much of a reason to write the novel other than money then it's hard to read. If the book is expressing a huge feeling that the writer's desperate to get out or if the novel's bringing something of importance to our attention however, then it's worth reading. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" had all these traits.When I first opened Harper Lee's only novel I wondered about it for the first few pages. Jean Louise Finch, the narrator of the novel, was giving the reader a historical timeline of her family, which didn't attract my attention and I was worried I wouldn't like it, but as soon as the story began I couldn't put it down. I have to admit I'm a very slow reader and even with short books that I love, Old Man and the Sea for example (a circa 100 page novella), it takes me about a week or two to get through. I read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" in around 3 days. I'm not bragging or anything I'm just displaying it's grip. It's not a fast moving novel, it actually is slower and it just talks about normal life; but I couldn't leave the characters for too long because I developed such a strong bond with them instantaneously.I can't really go too far into the ending of the book because I don't want to give anything away but I must say that about two pages before the end my heart was twisting, not because it was sad (although it was in a way), because it was so powerful... so good.Now I don't think it's any surprise that \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" has important values tied to it. But I found that most all of the main messages of the book tie back to everyone being selfish and misunderstanding each other. There are numerous occasions of prejudice and you get the chance to see almost every character misunderstand and judge another.The book really connected with me and I would suggest it to people who like books that show real human beings and tell coming of age stories that have much more meaning to them than cheesy TV movies. I can understand people not liking this book however, for its slowness but I didn't find it slow at all: I could hardly put it down. Overall this book has been extremely enjoyable to read and I would call it one of my favourites."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I wish someone had imposed this when I was in High School. This is just the book I would have enjoyed reading back then and enjoyed reading even now. The books just takes you back in time. The characters seem so real.

Part of my class grade is represented by this summary of To Kill a Mockingbird, a part of the book that most people miss. In chapter 10 a mad/rabid dog comes to Maycomb County named Tim Johnson. In this chapter there is a lot of symbolism representing Maycomb County as a whole. In the first chapter of the book there is a description of the town as being a weary, tired old town. People mope around going from store to store at a slow pace. Everything is moving in a very slow pace and it is very signifigant to how much symbolism occurs between chapter 10 and 1. As (tired, old, rabid) Tim Johnson mopes along the old streets of Maycomb, this is where the symbolism occurs. He is infected with the rabies virus. It says in chapter 10 that he is moving in a straight line, not a care in the world where he is going. He is moving slow and steadily. He is dangerous because he is infected with this virus. He is moving at a nauseating crawl. My teacher pointed this out to us in our class. I just wanted to let others know who are reading this book, about this, so they can see the technique of writing that Harper Lee has. She describes old Tim Johnson as being liver colored. This is a sick color kind of reddish like the color of the roads of Maycomb County. Tim Johnson himself represents all of Maycomb county as a whole. The sick minds of people, for ex. the prejudices of the towns people. He is going crazy because of rabies. The town has began to get crazy as the trial of Tom Robinson is coming up. There is a lot of symbolism throughout this whole entire book. This summary is for people who have already read this book and are looking back to see the most important aspects of the story. This is one of them."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I taught this book to eighth graders seventeen times and never got sick of it. Why do I love this book? Let me count the ways:1. The protagonist, Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch, is such a great character Demi Moore named one of her daughters after her.She's funny, smart, and she's got a stronger will than Catherine the Great. Atticus, Scout's father, is almost as compelling. He is willing to defend a black man accused of rape, despite living in racist, depression-era Maycomb, Alabama.2. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a great story we can all identify with. How many of us have known a weird neighbor who refuses to come out of the house? The first part of the book follows Scout and her brother Jem as they try to get a look at \\"Boo\\" Radley. The second half involves Tom Robinson's rape trial and its aftermath.3. The book is simply teeming with great vignettes. Jem and Scout are ashamed of Atticus because he doesn't play football, until he shoots down a rabid dog with one shot. Miss Maudie Atkinson's house burns down. Jack, Atticus's brother, makes Scout laugh and is able to painlessly pull a sliver from her hand. The Footwashing Baptists come to town for the rape trial. There are dozens more.4. The minor characters are simply wonderful. There are over a hundred (I know because I had my students count them). X-Billups has three sets of teeth. Aunt Alexandra tries to make Scout act like a lady. Cecil Jacobs gets into a fistfight with Scout. Dill, Jem and Scout's neighbor boy develops a crush on Scout and asks her to marry him. Calpurnia, Atticus's housekeeper, acts as a surrogate mother to the children. Bob Ewell rivals Simon Legree as a villain. They're all so real you'll want to visit Maycomb to see if they're still alive. Too bad it's a fictional town.5. Many lessons are learned, the most important of which is \\"Don't judge a book by its cover.\\" Mayella Ewell, who accuses Tom Robinson of rape, is actually a sympathetic character. The town's social structure condemns her to a life of drudgery and she grasps at straws. Mrs. Dubois, the old woman down the street from the Finches, who calls Atticus a racial slur, dies brave, refusing to take her medication because she wants to die clean.This book doesn't get enough credit; it's rarely listed as a masterpiece of the twentieth century. A masterpiece wouldn't be so easy to read. Certainly it's taught in just about every junior high in the country, but it wasn't written for teenagers. The book is a flashback, told by Scout as a grown woman; she uses New York Times' syntax, not S.E. Hinton's.Some of my students rented the movie instead of reading it page by page. Big mistake. Not only did they fail the test, but they failed themselves by missing out on the best book they'd ever read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Somehow I managed to avoid reading this book in high school or college. Then, about 10 years ago I picked up a copy at one of those library sales, thinking I *should* read it at some point.When I finally started, I couldn't put it down until I finished. Some books are great, but the prose gets so dense, they can be a struggle at times (Cold Mountain, anyone?). This one was beautifully written, but also a rocket ride of a plot.It's part comedy, part mystery/thriller, part social drama exploring the themes of bigotry and racism, part kids' adventure book, and so much more, all wrapped up in a coming-of-age story.Since then, I've re-read twice more over the years, and given away more than a dozen copies to friends and family members as gifts. I've tried to watch the movie, but it's flat, boring, missing the spark of excitement that runs throughout the book.I can never shake, either, that this talented woman who wrote this has never published a book since. I would read ANYTHING published with her name on it as author..."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I've just re-read this work to see how it stands the test of time. The most impressive feature of the novel is the narrative style. The narrator is an adult remembering or reflecting on the story in a child's voice, a neat juggling act that mixes satire and naivete. The satire is reminiscent of Jane Austen, especially when Lee, through Scout's voice, tackles education, class, bigotry, and the missionary society. The indictment of race in the novel is well documented, especially the casual use of the \\"N\\" word, even by the children. While some may find the portrait of Atticus as hero to be overblown, it is a loving and touching characterization on the author's part. The scene where the children join Atticus to confront the potential lynch mob at the jail still makes me cry. It seems to me that Lee has been pitch-perfect in capturing time and place. My conclusion: TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD remains a classic of 20th century literature."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book when I was in my teens and I was very affected by it. I identified with Scout and Jem, who were full of curiosity and innocence, and were coming to know right from wrong, not just in small matters, but in large social issues such as jurors voting against evidence and for their own personal prejudiced views (despite the evidence). It's difficult for children to understand why adults behave like this, and I think Harper Lee does an outstanding job of depicting children coming to grips with right and wrong. I also loved the character of Atticus, the children's father. Years went by and then I read this book again, as an adult, and was still struck by the power of the story. I can see why this book won all the awards it did."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee wrote a story set in small town Alabama during the Great Depression more than twenty years afterwards in her novel \`To Kill a Mockingbird.' This novel is a favorite among high school teachers because the children in the story mature during the course of the story, and it cogently expresses empathy.The parent of the two children, Atticus Finch, has the trial of his life during the summer of 1935. A local Negro farmhand, Tom Robinson, stands accused of violating the daughter of an indigent alcoholic. The Ewells are as debased by poverty as the Jeters in Erskine Caldwell's novel, \`Tobacco Road.'It seems the whole town is against Atticus Finch, and they sometimes take it out on his kids, Jem and Scout. Part of the reason is that he is defending a black man against the accusations of a white man in the Solid South. Atticus isn't just doing his job, he's playing to win - and he's built a pretty good case to acquit Robinson. There's even a scene where the Old Sarum bunch, feeling the trail against Robinson might not be as stacked against him as it ought to be in the Old South, wanted to resort to vigilante justice. Atticus finds he has some support in town - and that day - it comes from a surprising source.Empathy is the theme of the book. Atticus tells his children several times that they need to walk in someone else's shoes before judging them. Because of their limited life experiences, Jem and Scout need examples - and their father is an excellent guidepost. Sometimes, it's not as easy as you think. In the case of Dolphus Raymond, you only really understand him when you find out the paper bag he's always carrying contains Coca Cola, not liquor as people suspect.It does help to know some of the references in the book before reading it. There are many Civil War generals mentioned in the novel: Braxton Bragg, Joe Wheeler, John Bell Hood, and Robert E. Lee. Harper Lee portrays a South caught between one that's still fighting the Civil War, and another moving toward the New South espoused by Henry W. Grady.A Lane cake is peculiar to Alabama, invented by a homemaker there around the turn of the century. Putting shinny in it is a way to get drunk.An amanuensis is an old word for a secretary. A morphite - used in reference to the snowman - is a child's spelling of a hermaphrodite. And most folks seem to believe the Mrunas are really a tribe in Africa, but it has all the feel of a morphite to me. Could it be possible that the Mrunas are from the Cameroons?There's no misspelling about Lord Melbourne; he was caught in a pair of sexual scandals in England in the 1830s and 1840s which are tame in comparison today. One of them, with Lady Norton, was probably unfounded. The other, with Queen Victoria, was a correspondence that was deemed inappropriate by advisors to the Queen.This book meant more to me today than it did when Bugsy made us read it in high school. Recently we had a nice discussion of the book in the Brooklyn Public Library as part of its summer reading program. Thanks to them for holding it, and bringing this book back to our attention."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's, To Kill A Mockingbird shows a white family struggling for justice in a small town. It's easy to read, but to actually get something out of it is something else. For instance, the meaning of the mockingbird. The story was set in the 1930's during the Depression and the hard times of American people. Diseases were widespread and horses were used for transportation. Prejudice plays of huge part in the story. The trial of Tom Robinson showed this. Atticus, Jem and Scout's father gave his children advice about life and that it's okay to have fun but respect other people even though you might not know them. Scout being the main character and narrator is portrayed by a girl of 5-7 years old. Her names means seeking and finding. Everything that happens is seen through the eyes of Scout. An audience for this book is anyone who has the time and mind to appreciate a book like this of such strong writing. It is for anyone who can understand prejudice and the meaning of the mockingbird. The age group is 14- years old. Overall, this was an excellent book about life. Anyone can relate to this book in some way because we were once a child like Scout Finch and saw the world as we wanted to see it. It shows different ways to look at life. I could read it again and again and still get meaning out of it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is by far one of the greatest boks ever written. It teaches us so much. It teaches us that the only way to ever really understand someone, you must get into their shoes and walk around in them. It teaches us that a child can sometimes know more than the adults ever could. It teaches us that prejudice and racism will always be the downfall of our society, if we let it. And it teaches us that, hey, entailments are bad."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was required in a class to read a classic book of my choice. &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; has been sitting on my book shelf for probably ten years, and I suddenly felt as if this was one of those &quot;great&quot; books that everyone has to read. Well, it was a good book and there were great morals to consider. The plot of the book follows the life of a young, southern, six year old girl. Jem, her brother, who is four years older develops into the young man that is expected of him. Atticus, their father is a lawyer in Maycomb County. The story is set in the 1930's, during the depression when racism was overpopulated in the South. This book made me have to take a personal stand as to what to consider right and wrong. Is prejudice a way of life or is just away to make the inner self feel superior? I asked myself this question over and over throughout the story until an innocent black man was killed for believing in himself and his morals. I also faced the question of what it would be like to live in a small town where everyone knows each other. Jem and Scout had to face the hatred, prejudice, and taunts from their own peers because their father was defending an innocent black man over a guilty white man. Much of the action that took place in this story was surprising to me. It kind of caught me off guard that such young kids would play games about thier own recluse neighbor Boo Radley who eventually leaves us all with a curiosity to know more. I was also suprised of the towns progression through the Depression and how segregation was never questioned. I could not believe that the color of a persons skin can easily take the life of an innocent bystander. Overall this was a fairly easy book to read that read remarkably fast. I would recommend this book only because it gives some sort of an idea of what life was like in the South during turmoil years and how the citizens of this cruel country treated each other."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book in one week.

How this book wasn't choosen as the greatest english book ever written is beyond me. Lee writes with a clarity that even Joyce could only hope to achive.

The stories about him reveal a troubled young man contained in his home by his punitive father. But long after the father's death, Boo stays out of sight.Meanwhile, the town begins stirring over a controversial happening--Atticus Finch, a lawyer and the father of Jem and Scout has taken on the case of defending a black man against charges that he raped a white woman. Never mind that there is no physical evidence, nor are the \\"witnesses\\" even slightly credible. Finch pokes holes in the prosecution's case, and Jem, Scout, and Dill, watching from the balcony, feel sure of an acquittal.What these children learn from this case and the subsequent aftermath is that life is often unjust. But their father tries to help them see that understanding another person can only happen when you \\"walk in his shoes.\\"Empathy, integrity, compassion, and yes, life's injustices--all of these are brought home to these children growing up in a Southern small town during the 30s. When a surprising rescuer saves Jem and Scout from the evil of one bitter man, they also learn that things are not always the way they seem.The ending ofTo Kill a Mockingbird (slipcased edition)was just a beginning, in a sense, as Scout, our narrator, comes to understand what Atticus has been saying all along...most people are \\"nice,\\" too, \\"when you finally see them.\\""},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"My all time favorite book great to have this 50th anniverary addition as a keepsake!

It's a realistic fiction book and I loved it, although it's a bit slow at the beginning, it picks up towards the end and it has a wonderful meaning. To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee is Scout's story, in her point of view, and her family's trying to fight racism in the south. Everything was going fine until the day Atticus (scout's father) is assigned to defend a black man for the rape of a white woman. Things get personal for their family when people start to realize that Tom Robinson (accused of rape) might win his case. People begin to threaten the family and threats are even made on Atticus's life. This is a story that makes you realize what was going on in the south, even after slavery was over, when racism and inhumanity were still going strong."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life.To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I own this book and believe me this is one outstanding book.

I recommend it to people of all ages. This book illustrates two main motifs. One is the need for compassion and the other is the courage and conscience. One of the main character in to kill a mockingbird is Boo Radly. In the begging of the book he was made out to be an evil, scary, mean man. All the kids were scared of him and thought he was a mysterious man. The kids started finding things in a hole in a tree that was right next to the radley house. This shows that he is watching the kid's and likes them. They later come to realizes that boo is there friend and he is not a mean man he is a trapped nice man. The kids learn to like Boo and this illustrates the need for compassion. Later in the book Atticus, that is scout and Jems dad has to defend Tom robinsion, which is a black man that is on trial for rap on a white woman. They go to trial and tom is found guilty even though by the evidence he is clearly innocent but the people are so racist that they don't even look at the evidence they just find him guilty. Jem does not understand the concept of racism and he is confused by the whole trial. After the trial bob Ewell is mad at Atticus because he defended tom and made him look bad. Bob is trying to get revenge so he goes after Jem and scout with a knife he ends up getting killed and boo is the one that saved Jem and scout. This shows that boo cares and illustrates the main motif, the need for compassion. This book is a great book for all ages and really illustrates the to main motifs, the need for compassion and courage and conscience. The main symbol in this book is the mocking bird. Examples of this symbol is boo and tom. They both did nothing to hurt anybody but people are trying to hurt them. This is wrong and and immoral. This was a great book I enjoyed it a lot."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee is an excellent novel that is told from the view of a young girl. Her name is Jean Louise Finch, but they call her Scout; and she is just beginning first grade as the story begins. Her mother died before she ever really knew her, so this left her father Atticus Finch and their cook Calpurnia watching out for Scout and her older brother Jem Finch. They live in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama. The story begins in the summer of 1933 and ends on Halloween night of 1935. At this time the majority of the town is racially prejudice. Scout and Jem are learning from their father how to treat others, and they are gradually maturing from the beginning to the end. In part one of the book, Scout, Jem, and their friend Dill are trying to get their neighbor, Boo Radley, to come out and play. Boo is a grown man that is kept inside their house and isn't ever let out. When Boo was a teenager he got in trouble, and his father locked him inside the house. After Boo's father died, Boo's older brother Nathan Radley comes and takes their father's place. Nobody ever sees Boo, but the kid's gossip describes him as mean and ugly. The kid's attempts are not successful for getting Boo to come out. In part two of the book, Tom Robinson, a local black man, is accused of raping Mayella Ewell. Mayella is the nineteen-year-old daughter of Bob Ewell. Bob is a poor farmer who makes no attempt to live with dignity. He spends his state relief checks on liquor and often abuses his children. When school starts his children go for the first day and don't ever go back for the rest of the year. They live right next to the town dumpsters and they have a garbage filled yard. Judge Taylor assigns Atticus Finch to be Tom's lawyer, because he knows that Atticus is the only lawyer that has compassion for black people. Atticus fulfills his job to the highest of his ability even though the consequence from it is almost unbearable for him and his kids. This was a wonderful novel that I would recommend to anybody. The first thing you will learn from it is the need for compassion and understanding. The second thing it will teach you is the need for conscience and courage. This novel shows how people really treat others, and it teaches people how they should treat others."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I am 14 years old and a student attending Franklin Learning Center.

With most classics it takes me much longer to read. This classic is a must read.

No wonder it's a classic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird was assigned to me by my english teacher. I thought the big would be a waste of time only to find to my surpise how much I enjoyed it. The way it dealed and handled prejuidice was amazing. Most books only include information about racism, To Kill A Mockingbird dealt with Race vs. Race, Woman vs. Men, and Classes vs. classes. I give this book five stars b/c it helps children, teenagers, and adults deal with prejuidce of all kinds. Prejuidice isn't something that can be ignored, and it will never coimpletely go away. However, when you read this book, through the eyes of a young girl. you realize exactly what it does to the world. As a whole."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The classic novel, To Kill A Mockingbird, was a magnificent book. One reason I liked it so much was because it was very detailed. For example, in the beginning of chapter nineteen, just before Tom Robinson was called up to the witness stand, Harper Lee (the author) really gives us detailed information on how Tom is nervous and what kind of actions he played played on. For example, when he reaches under his arm to grab his Bible. Besides details, I also liked the book because it is readable. It is also a book that really relates to our culture and way of living because of the jealousy factor in the book, relates to our life of jealousy. When people are jealous the will try, in any way, to get that quality or trait they are jealous for. A specific element that stuck out to me was the beginning when all the characters are described. Another element that I really like is when the book gets intense and stays intense during the presence of Boo Radley. This is a book for all audiences because it is good and it should be read and maybe researched by both students and adults."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is awesome. I read it in my 7th grade english class, and we got into so many good discussions about it. It's very thoughtprovoking. Of course, it is possible to read this book straight through, and not think about mockingbirds or anything like that, but if you read this book, you must stop and think about how it affects your life, because it does. if you think hard enough, you can think of so many people who bear a striking resemblance to scout, jem, atticus, or tom"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Being a 17 year old teenager I thought that Harper Lee's epicnovel 'To Kill a Mockingbird' would be rather boring. Growing up inan era where science fiction rules every teenagers imagination, I was suprised to find that I enjoyed reading such a classic book. Harper Lee's narrator is young Scout Finch who is a fiesty, outgoing, self reliant young girl who witnesses the hate that the people of Maycomb have towards someone or something that is different from them. Witnessing the telling of the story in a childs eyes shows how innocent and not aware of prejudice children can be.

The first half of the book was a little lacking, but I soon came to love this book! It follows the lives of three children (Scout and Jem Finch and their best friend Dill Harris) in the 1930's, and at the same time follows Scout and Jem's father Atticus in his legal battle to save an innocent black man from the charge of raping a white woman. Over the course of about two years, the kids make mischief, learn life lessons, and try to get their reclusive neighbor, Boo Radley, to come out of his house.

It faces the alarming but true problems of childhood and the prejudice of the justice system in 1930's. Harper Lee's novel is not only groundbreaking, but also heartwarming, mysterious, and disturbing in the way it shows the discrimination in the Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's.The novel's setting and characters are brilliant due to Harper Lee's background knowledge on the many subjects covered in the book. Lee was, like Scout (the protagonist of the book a.k.a. Jean Finch) a girl living in small town Alabama in 1930's experiencing racism, with a father (Amasa Lee to Atticus Finch) who is a lawyer. Lee effectively uses her knowledge to her advantage.To Kill a Mockingbird is a first person narrative from the child's eyes of Jean (mostly referred to \\"Scout\\") as Finch, a poor girl who spends her time with her older brother Jem Finch. One of the main points of the book is that her knowledge of bad in the world increases throughout the book, which I found fascinating. The novel is about their life growing up, and the evil in the world, including their father's case as defending an innocent African American by the name of Tom Robinson who is accused of sexually abusing Mayella Ewell.The title, To Kill a Mockingbird, alone is excellent symbol shone throughout the book. It symbolizes the fight against good and evil. \\"Mockingbird\\" is a symbol for good, so the title symbolizes the many events in the story where something beautiful is killed. I do not want to mention an example though, for I do not want to spoil for those who have not read it.Lee intelligently decides to show the story through the eyes of a child, and with this smart choice, we get to experience the horrors of racism in an interesting, effective, way. For the child's increasing knowledge of the evil in the world is amazing. The book accurately depicts the mind of a child so precise reading the book felt like being a small child again and learning about the world.Normally, this paragraph I would have reserved for the cons of the book, but I have sat thinking long enough to realize that the book has none, other than the fact that I sometimes (very, very occasionally) dozed off, but that can be blamed on my attention which is equivalent to a small stone, and not the book. This is no doubt the most interested I have been when reading a book in 2 years.To Kill a Mockingbird is an excellent classic tale of humor, evil, innocence, discrimination, and more. Harper Lee's setting, story, and characters all extremely real feeling and fascinating. I highly recommend this book.-James"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Searching and ordering this book was made very easily, I had a wide variety to choose from.

What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life.To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)Harper Lee (Up Close)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Product was in the condition stated and I received it before the delivery time stated.

I couldn't put it down for 3 days. I missed it somehow through my high school and college ed. It just might not have been on my reading list for my classes, but I would say it's better than just seeing the movie.The writing is amazing. The characterization and descriptions put you into the world of growing up in Depression Era South. But more important, it shows how we absorb the world growing up, the good, the bad, and the ugly. And sometimes, we can see changes in our lifetime that seem small at first, but can grow into something bigger. The point of view from a child growing up is the special human interest that I think has made it so interesting over the years.No wonder it was given the Pulitzer. If you have to catch up on classics, this is a good one to start with."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Just revisited this gem of a coming-of-age novel after about 20 years, and it's still every bit as striking as it was back then. Scout Finch will always stay as one of my favourite characters of all time as she witnesses the goings-on of Maycomb county where she is growing up in post-Depression America way in the Deep South where prejudice against the blacks was still rampant.Written almost 40 years ago, the issues of what makes a person human, what courage means, how bigotry and ignorance begets prejudice and becomes a threat to the individual, the family and society, are all still valid issues we're grappling with today.Narrated through the innocent perspective of a child, the novel is so much more poignant for the unadulterated logic a child possesses and becomes a foil for the folly and terror of man's ways.Saying any more than this about this timeless classic would only take time away from actually reading the novel. Please read it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Writing a review of this classic book and trying to find something to say about it that hasn't already been said many times before might not be the easiest of tasks. However, I felt that I needed to mention one thing about this highly-acclaimed and truly wonderful writing that may not have yet been addressed. Reading this book now, as an adult, it hit me almost immediately that its narration, done by Scout (Jean Louise), one of the main characters, who at the time of the story is seven-years old and by the story's conclusion, she is 10, yet she speaks within this book as though she's an adult. The story's intent was to be told through the eyes of a child - and with just a few exceptions, like when Scout finds herself in court when her father, Atticus, partakes in the trial of a young black man accused of raping a white girl, or addresses that she doesn't really understand what 'rape' is ... she is narrating through the entire book in terminology like that of an adult, and a very intelligent and thought-out conversational one at that. I found that to be hard to believe.Don't get me wrong - the story is amazing, written in such a way that one feels what they feel and sees what they see, experiences what they experience - very realistically written as well as emotionally and psychologically understanding. However, such a little girl as Scout is, it is highly unlikely that a child that young would really be able to explain law and life in such an adult manner as this little girl's narration presents. Otherwise, the book is magnificent and I highly recommend anyone who hasn't read it, to read it.As a writer, I've always been taught that if one is writing narration by supposedly a child, or an old person, one of a different ethnicity, or whichever way the story is to flow, then one must write the character's narrative in such a way that befits that kind of person so the story is realistic. I realize that this book is an \\"adult story\\" seen through the eyes of a child - therefore, much of her narration language/interaction thoughts, etc. with the other characters of the book should also be in a more child-like way. The story would be expressed that way, too. Perhaps more of the intenser explaining would have to be done in the dialogue of the adult characters, but a child is a child - they speak and think in their own way, also presenting a story through their own unique way.I have not seen the movie, but the book is a very powerful story of life in a quiet southern town that identify with the unfairness of those times, accusation of a crime judged wrongfully and how so many people's lives are affected and misdirected as a result. I do encourage both young and old to read it if you haven't already."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I love this book and I'm staying up late to finish it.

The first time I tried to read it I had to put it down because I got really confused at the beginning. However, I tried it again later on and I realized what a good book I had put down. For me it was still a little confusing at the beginning because the setting and characters were being introduced. It was also kind of boring, and that's another reason I didn't continue it the first time. You have to keep reading though because it gets much better. The story is about a brother and sister, Jem and Scout (Jean Louise Finch), growing up in a small town with their dad, Atticus. Throughout the book, they experience a number of exciting adventures. At the beginning, the story focuses on a neighbor down the street who appears to be very strange and never comes out of his house. In other words, he's a recluse. Jem and Scout, along with another friend Dill, are very curious as to why this is. They do some exploring and investigating that might just have you biting your nails. As the book moves on, it only makes you want to read more. Atticus is a lawyer and is involved with a very important case that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's really interesting and gives you a chance to make predictions to yourself on who should win the case. In a way, it gets you into the book and creates suspense that makes it exciting. Towards the end, there is an unusual twist that involves a Halloween party, a ham costume, and a walk through a very dark field at night. This book is extremely well written and shows the innocence of childhood. I recommend it to anyone who likes classics and is in the mood for a very good read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is a book which should change your life. Of course it is an outstanding American story; more, it is a study of American character--exceptional and inhuman. You will, if you read carefully, be forced to reckon you are more like a Finch or more like a Ewell. And, after that reckoning, you will different forever.I'm sorry I read this so late in my life. (I would have accomplished more by following the example of Atticus.) But for the remainder of my days, I pledge allegiance to Atticus Finch. His example is that important, that just, that right.Require yourself to read it; require those you can influence to read it. About the time this book was published, an important black man said: If you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem. I don't believe this is overstatement in these troubled times in America. If you don't read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" you are part of the problem.

The cruelty and complexity of of the world breaks into the second half as the children witness the consequences of their father defending a black man accused of raping a white woman.The freedom of a child's mind to observe what IS without judgment or malice gives this story it's power. In many ways each character is archetypal, representing that particular set of characteristics that we see in people but often prefer to ignore when they make us uncomfortable. The blind bigotry exhibited by many of the characters is still with us and speaks volumes about those of strong religious belief yet absence of true humanity and conscience.A beautifully written yet powerful book I would recommend that everybody read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Just to let you know- I usually read fantasy and sci-fi books and this is nothing of the sort.I was assigned to read this for school and I must say, I found it very interesting because I learned a lot about racism and life in the US during the great deppression.

After so many years (a lot of water under the bridge) Nelle Harper Lee's words have lost none of their shine. Her style instantly transports you to childhood with all it's innocent abandon, conflict, tears, fears and hope. It is a story everyone can relate to in some way: If you can't relate to Scout then you darn well wish you did. If you didn't have a brother like Jem or a father like Atticus, well . . ..

Atticus Finch, a local lawyer, is not like other people in the town and is determined to stand up for what he belives is right. Even if this means putting his family, career, and even his life in danger. This book will also take you back to your childhood and the way that most children look at the world.

The themes that this one single book varies from how you should not judge to how cruel racisim can be. The story is told from the view of an eight year old girl, who in her own way learns that human nature has two sides. When a story is told by a child, the innocense simply captives any reader. Jen-Lousie Finch is nothing short of this. Along with her brother Jem and her close friend Dill, they all three conceive numerous plots to bring the town's maniac in to broad daylight.On a more serious note, this story is about a black man who is accused agianst raping a white woman. One of the moral compasses of the story is Atticus Finch. He was appointed to defend Tom Robinson in court. The result of this trail will amaze and shock you. You will meet a wide range of characters. Starting from a morphine addict to a man who is shunned from soceity.On a personal note, I didn't read this story out of choice. It was assigned to our sixth grade class as an extra credit project and to this day I have respected my teacher for having such good taste.

The book narrates the story of a young girl named Jean Louise Finch, also called &iexcl;Scout&iexcl;. Lee presented this book through the eyes of Jean Louise.The story takes place in Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1930&iexcl;s or so. The plot is about Scout&iexcl;s father, Atticus Finch (a lawyer), trying to defend Black suspect Tom Robinson for accused of raping a White girl in the Maycomb County of Alabama. The plot incorporates several issues that people were struggling during the time of the story, including racism, injustice, and prejudice. The entire novel circulates around Scout and her family. Many situational conflicts arise, from trying to make Boo Radley come out of seclusion to dealing with family and community difficulties.Lee did a miraculous job of telling the story through the view of Scout. The characters were depicted hardly by their appearances, but by their personality traits, which showed advanced style in writing. The setting and the time periods had a great impact on the story, as people those days lived quite close to each other and knew their neighbors well. I was amazed how natural and realistic the characters were made. Scout and her older brother, Jeremy (also called Jem), reacted to situations exactly as many of the children now days would act. Almost every character in the story had a crucial role at some point of the story. The character development was beyond imagination. From Dill (Jem and Scout&iexcl;s best friend) coming to visit the Finch family in the summer, to Jem trying to make it past the Radley&iexcl;s gate, to Calpurnia (the house cook) scolding the children for not coming home, this piece of literature truly elaborated on pivotal character details. After reading this book, one would think he knows the characters quite well.Overall, this was a fantastic novel to read and I was truly impressed with the quality of writing and development presented in this story by Harper Lee. To Kill a Mockingbird will truly be an American Literature classic for as long as it will be remembered."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Absolutely fantastic. If you liked A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, you'll love this."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The story \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\" is basically a story about the way of life in a time of suspicion, hatred, poverty, and ignorance. It's about the effect of racism has on a small town from a child's point of view. The town is called Maycomb with \\"grass that grows as tall as a person, roads of dirt, and children with none, sometimes or disgusting eating habits.\\" The main characters are Atticus, Boo Radly, Scout, Jim and Dill. I liked Boo Radly. He stayed hidden for many years. I don't know if he really did, what the town said he did; that he stabbed his father in the leg with scissors and then pulled it out. Boo placed wax dolls and food in the hollow tree and in exchange received candy from Scout, Jem, and Dill. Atticus the father of the children heads into a major problem as a lawyer defending Tom Robinson who is accused of assault and rape on a town woman. The children had many difficulties dealing with Ms. Doubtly's craziness from drug use. Seeing their dad being ridiculed by the town as he was trying to achieve justice for Tom Robinson also made their lives more complex.The characters I could relate to were Atticus, Scout, Boo Radly, and Dill. Boo Radly reminded me of events in my life when I was not wanted in places like school and church, Where Boo was stuck in a hole, I felt I was stuck somewhere as well. Just as Atticus stands up for human rights and believes in himself, I stand up for my rights as well as the rights of my friends. Dill is a character that has a wild imagination just like I find myself having a wide variety of ideas.My favorite part of the book is when Boo Radly saved Scout and Jem from Bob Edwell. As well, I thoroughly enjoyed the part where Bob Edwell is twisted crimes were exposed and he was killed accidentally.For the educational and symbolic idealism the book deserves a medal. The book exposes and illustrates hard reality in a time when people were racist. My least favorite part of the book was when Tom Robinson was killed because he was killed by hate. It was as if he was going to die anyway whether a public execution or not. From a student's point of view, I would change the use of the n word so readers don't have to see it.I would recommend this book to as an insight and perspective on history. The type of person who would like this book would be a person who enjoys reading history, a suspenseful novel, or a person who likes to read about problems in the past."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a MockingbirdThe book To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961.

But as a controversial court case arises, they have to deal with derogatory terms and the fact that the case is doomed. Atticus, Jem and Scout's dad, has to defend a black man who is accused of raping a woman. It will take a miracle to show the town the innocence of this man.Lee is a great author and it shows in her work. The language Lee uses is appropriate for a southern town of the 1930s.

This book is good for readers who like suspense and good morals.By Kevin"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Oh, this is literary perfection. There is no more beautifully simplistic portrayal of childhood and its inherent responsibility to understand the complicated adult world that surrounds it. In my estimation, we will never surpass the moral tale in this treasure. It makes me want to be Atticus, Jem, Scout...even Tom, because of the self command that he portrays, or Boo, because of his ultimate normality and heroism...each charactar is rich and worthy of our attention, love, admiration. This is my all time favorite American classic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I recommend To Kill a Mockingbird on the basis that when searching for a good fictional piece to read, I think its necessary to find a complex story combined with articulate writing for it to remain engrossing. Lee achieves this by offering a narrative filled with multiple story lines as well as frequently dealing with adult concepts depicted through the mind of a eight year old.To Kill a Mockingbird offers some consideration to the notion that the nature of one's choices does not necessarily encompass one's true worth. To draw such a conclusion from the unbiased naivet&eacute; of a child is a mere example of the eloquent and perceptive nature of this book.I would recommend reading this book to anyone with an open mind and a sincere interest in human reflection."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"My daughters are reading this book for a school assignment and they are finding it as relevant to them today as I found it when I read it at their age.

I recommend whoever is considering reading this doesn't try to figure everything they can about the book before they do so. It's better to into on a clean slate. Some references and lifestyles may be shocking but one must remember where, and when it takes place. Reading novels from today's biggest names in literature, its clear many are influenced by Harper Lee. Lacking clear violence, true love, and other huge themes seen in books and movie now a days, some may say its boring but reading thoroughly, one can see the painful conflict and romance in its pages.

Harper Lee's candid statement that, i quote, said\\" i intended this to be a simple love story\\" amuses me . it is so much more, exemplifying racial inequities, preconcieved notions and their detrimental effects on society, A keen love with the disabled, and so much more. This novel is what stimulated me to read every possible erudite literary work in existence. lee's cadence resonates throughout every page of the book. a must read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book came out at a time when \\"civil rights\\" was first beginning to seep into mainstream American conversations. It was an uncomfortable subject, and had to be addressed with tact and diplomacy.I feel that due to the publication of this book, and its rapid transformation into a feature film, the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964.To Kill A Mockingbird was a striking statement made by Nelle Harper Lee, an Alabama native whose father was for most of his life a typical Southerner with typical Southern attitudes towards African Americans, According to Lee, this novel, her only one, is to remain a snapshot of the South, as it was during her youth, on the verge of it's first reluctant steps away from the shadows of its past.Part One of the book is purely expository. All of the characters and the tenor of Maycomb, Alabama are thoroughly established. Part Two deals with a trial that laid out the basic injustice being practiced on a daily basis by the townspeople, and the epiphanies experienced thereafter by the narrator and her young brother.In the end, this book is about compassion. The acquisition of compassion, in my opinion, is the litmus test every young adult must pass in order to reach a productive and happy adulthood. This book, taken with the right context, is a wonderful stepping stone for anyone needing an introductory course in compassion.After reading this book, everyone would gladly have Scout as a friend, and Atticus as a father. The author outdid herself with this contribution, and that fact, sadly, made To Kill a Mockingbird, her only contribution to the Great Conversation."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee only wrote one book, To Kill a Mockingbird, but it was truthfully above anything I've read before.This story begins in the un-eventful county of Maycomb. In a life drained of interest, Jem and Scout are raised, they will never know what is to come. One summer, a boy named Dill becomes their friend and takes an interest to the house nextdoor. Arthur (Boo) Radley is a concealed man who they've never seen in their lives, but they think the know the story. Is he really a man that only comes out at night to kill flowers and eat cats?Along the way, behind the scenes a trial goes on. A black man is accused of raping a white girl. In a world so racist, things change, people die, and eventually no matter how many paper cuts you get, you can't put that book down.I've never read anything like it in my life and I don't think I'll find something that meaningful in a long time. It opened my eyes to the world and anybody who loves a thrilling tale with jumps along the way to get you attached, should read this book. I vow never to get on another plane without it tucked inside my bag."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Ever since Harper Lee published her only novel, she has remained as reclusive as J.D. Salinger. Sadly, she has accomplished the almost impossible by writing the great American novel of all times. The characters become multi-dimensional and alive at times. Set in the deep South, the story is told from Scout's point of view. Scout has been named on countless girls ever since the publication of the book. Atticus Finch is an unforgettable character immortalized by Gregory Peck in the movie version. One of the main reasons that I read this book is to see where Mrs. Dubose played by actress Ruth White's character in the film was about. At first, I thought it was a small part but boy was I wrong. Mrs. Dubose becomes an important figure in the lives of Jeremy \\"Jem\\" and Scout Finch as well as the other Finches. The story of a rape and trial is sadly but in the end of America, Scout is like Anne Frank who provides hope in times of hopelessness and revives the hope for a better world in the Deep South where prejudice and racism runs deep alongside lynchings and cruel treatment of African Americans after slavery was abolished in 1865. Since she won the Congressional Medal of Freedom for her services to literature, Harper Lee has still maintained her reclusive nature."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The youngest of four children, Harper Lee was born in 1926 in Alabama. She won the Pulitzer Prize with \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" - her only novel - which was first published in 1960.The story is set in 1930s Maycomb, Alabama, and is told by Scout Finch. In it, she looks back to her childhood, between the ages of six and nine years. A lively, intelligent and fiercely loyal child, she has one older brother called Jem, whose main interest is football. Despite an age difference of nearly four years, the siblings are clearly very close. Their mother died when Scout was two and they have been brought up by their father, Atticus - who proves to be a man you can't help admiring. Calpurnia, their housekeeper, seems to have been a great help to Atticus in raising the children. At times, Scout seems to have seen her as something of an adversary, though they become much closer as time goes on. Among their neighbours are the mysterious Radleys - Mr. Arthur, better known as Boo Radley, hasn't been seen outside for many years. He has become something of a legend that inspires a certain amount of fear among the children. Another neighbour, Miss Maudie, is an entirely different proposition - a very likeable character, she proves to be a very good friend to the children and one of Maycomb's more admirable residents.Another of the children's friends in Chet Baker Harris, a boy from Mississippi who is better known as Dill. He spends his summer with his Aunt Rachel, another of Scout's neighbours. Dill is the driving force behind one of the book's major themes : the quest to make Boo Radley come outside. The other theme, however, is a lot more serious - it deals with a court case where a black man has been charged with raping a white woman, on very flimsy evidence. The attitude of many of the townsfolk to the man in question, and to the black community in general, confuse the children greatly. The consequences of these attitudes have a direct impact on the Finch family, given that Atticus has been appointed the defence attorney.I tend to be very suspicious of a book if it's referred to as a 'classic' - too many of those I've read (or been forced to read) have been far too tedious. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", however, is what a classic should be - superbly written, with an excellent story and featuring characters you genuinely care about. Its screen adaptation is also widely regarded as a classic, leading to an Oscar for Gregory Peck, who played Atticus. Neither the book, nor the film, should be missed."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"As it had been about 27 years since I had read this classic, I had forgotten much of the detail of the book. I loved every single page of it this time around and I am sure that I understood it a great deal more than when I was a teenager. This is a remarkably well-written book with humour, pathos and charm, besides its more obvious look at various types of prejudice. The fact that the story is told through the eyes of a young girl gives it a wonderfully innocent appeal but constantly challenges the reader to look at its larger social issues. Despite the fact that it is set in the 1930s, this classic has not aged at all. If you have not read this book at all, get to it; if it has been many years since you have read it, have another look at it - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;&quot; is obviously one of the best American novels of the 20th Century. It is the story of a young girl, Scout Finch, growing up in Alabama during the 1930s-40s. She lives with her brother and father, the often referenced Atticus Finch. Her father has been appointed to represent a black man being tried for allegedly raping a white woman. The novel deals with the Finch family's persecution for Atticus's role in doing what he knows to be right, and specifically, how these events affect Scout's view of the world as she grows up.The picture Harper Lee paints in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is of an honest, noble man and his struggle to raise his children as a single parent in the impoverished Deep South of the early 20th century. They live in a neighborhood of several eclectic personalities, from the brooding, misunderstood Mrs. Dubose, to the mysterious Radley family. The Alabama Ms. Lee portrays is a beautiful rural arrangement of small towns and counties, with many wonderful, honest citizens, who are unfortunately overshadowed by the hateful actions of others.&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is one of the most beautiful stories I've ever read, and it left me occasionally saddened, but ultimately proud of my homeland, the American South."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I first read this book when I was twelve yrs. old. I found myself enthralled with this accounting of small-town southern living and because the story was told thru the mind of a child I was intrigued with the lovely vocabulary and the startling clarity of a child's insight. Down thru the years I would return over and over again charting my growth thru my uncoverings of the truths written here. As a 14 yr. old I was enlightened to what rascism was, as a 17 yr old cynic I was justified in my world weariness,at 25 I was renewed and endowed with optimism for the basic goodness of mankind, and now.... I am back to open this world to my children, hoping they'll discover the warmth and beauty and create yet another link between my heart and theirs."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a great book that ties in childhood curiousity with harsh reality. For the first half of the book the narrarator Scout and her older brother Jem surround their lives with the mysterious Boo Radley. Boo is commonly known by the people of the community as an antisocial untouchable. The kids of maycomb have never seen Boo, so they make it their duty to seek him and introduce him to their world. However, the trial of a crippled black man shifts the excitement from the hibernating Boo, to the most controversial trial Maycomb has ever witnessed. Tom Robinson a poor black man was accused of raping Mayella Ewell who carries the poor reputation of her family. Tom becomes a victim of the unbalanced justice scale of early twentieth century Alabama. The trial glorifies the word of a crooked white person over the honesty of Tom Robinson. Atticus, Jem and Scout's father, who is constantly trying to set a good example for his children, is infuriated with the decision. This trial deeply effects the kids' lives by introducing the horror of an unequal society at a young age. As the book comes to a close an awkward situation ties both parts of the story together. This book is a classic for its insight on children and its social commentary."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life.To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)Harper Lee (Up Close)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is my favorite book. My uncle bought it for me when I was twelve, and at the time I thought, okay, I'll read it . . . one day. A couple months later I finally picked it up, and couldn't put it down.To Kill a Mockingbird is a profound novel because it deals with a topic no one can understand (racism) but tells it in a language everybody can understand (the narrator is a little girl named Scout). Scout's view of the world at the beginning of the novel is like that of any other child: innocent. You know, the lies we all used to believe, that everybody on earth is nice and kind and that we all love each other, etc., etc. But then Scout, her brother Jem, and her friend Dill (who is based on Harper Lee's childhood friend, Truman Capote) are compelled to face reality all of a sudden when their father defends a black man on trial for rape. The children learn the hard truths of life, that this world isn't always a pleasant place after all.But what is so extraordinary about Scout is that she never speaks with hate. She speaks with a child's innocence, and describes complex things in a child's way, which makes it easier to understand. I don't think this book would have been the same if Atticus had told the story, or if this had been told in third-person point of view. Then it would have lacked its young narrator's frankness.There aren't enough words to describe To Kill a Mockingbird. This is by far the best book I have ever read, and perhaps the greatest contribution an American writer has made to the literary world. To put it simply, this book should be read by everyone. If we all looked at this world as Scout does in this book, maybe this world would be a better place."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee spent years crafting this classic novel of life in small town Alabama in the mid 1930s. Ms Lee wrote a first draft which her editors felt read more like a series of interconnected short stories rather than as a cohesive novel so, she went back to the drawing board and ultimately produced this popignant tale of life as seen through the eyes of an adult narrator remembering her childhood.I read this book for a reason. My son, a high school student read this as an assignment for his honors English class. As an attorney, his teacher asked me to talk about life as a lawyer before the class. She mentioned this book in particular so I read it to compare my experiences with those of the novel's main character, Atticus Finch. I'm glad that I read it. I have seen the movie a couple of times but, the book offers great character analyses which cannot be duplicate on the screen (although the movie does a reasonable amount of justice to the book).The book was written in the late 1950s and completed in 1960, as the evils of the Jim Crow era were coming to a head. Ms Lee could have painted portraits of good guys and bad guys, however, she looks affectionately upon most of the characters, seeing them as complex individuals. Therefore, she confronts their prejudices with understanding rather than in anger or self righteousness. Also, she does not paint the deep South of that time as monolithically rascist. There are those, in the book, who rise above narrow prejudice. Again, I read the book to be able to comment on the legal system portrayed therein. However, I got much more out of this book; a beautiful and compassionate character study."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is set in a small town in Alabama during the early 1930s. The main plot centers around the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of the rape of a white girl. It is within this context that Atticus, the town's gentleman and defense attorney, teaches his children humanity and truth. The story is narrated by an adult Jean Louise (Scout), recalling the events of her childhood leading up to and after the trial. Tom is convicted and sentenced to death - not surprising given the era, any other outcome of the trial would have rendered this novel trite and significantly diminished its value. The trial is without a doubt among the most well written scenes I've ever experienced in American fiction. Tom's accuser represents the complete antithesis of honor, respect, and decency. I applaud Lee for delivering biblical comeuppance to the accuser in a swiftly paced yet suspenseful narrative that made me anxious to get to the next sentence.Lee introduces the right characters in the right setting with exacting language to support the theme of the novel. This is perhaps the nations' most well written lesson on the personal depravation caused by racial hatred and the spiritual enlightenment encountered when one stands defiant in the face of it. And what better way to demonstrate this moral message than through the eyes of children who know nothing but truth, until told otherwise. Lee would be hard pressed to top this novel, perhaps that's why she hasn't tried. This is a novel that children should grow up with, its bound to produce better adults. Most certainly worthy of the Pulitzer and deserving of it's place in the history of American fiction."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is an excellent novel about prejudice in the southern Alabama town of Maycomb in the 1930s. Harper Lee shows prejudice with the trial of a black man in which a white lawyer, Atticus Finch (the father of young Scout, from whom which the story is told), is appointed to defend him. Tom Robinson, the black man being falsely accused of rape, and the Finches' neighbor, Boo Radley (an outcast of the community and very taciturn in nature) are the symbols in this novel. In the beginning/middle of the novel Atticus tells Scout and Jem (his children) never to shoot a mockingbird. Jem questions why not and Atticus replies not to because mockingbirds never harm any one or thing, they just sing beautiful music. When Tom Robinson is convicted, it is symbolic of killing a mockingbird. Later in the novel, Boo Radley must kill Bob Ewell because he tried to kill Scout and Jem, however, the sheriff (Heck Tate) makes up a story that Bob fell on his knife, because if he told the community that Boo had killed him, it would have thrown Boo into the limelight and would have also been like killing a mockingbird. I strongly suggest to read this book, it is a wonderful novel."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It hardly seems like 50 years since I picked up this book late one rainy night when it was first published, after my mom had been raving about the book for weeks, trying to get me to read it. Well, what the heck, the late movie was boring that evening and there was nothing else on the TV... next thing I knew, it was two o'clock in the morning and I had just turned the final page on what was the most magical reading experience of my entire life.From the opening line, \\"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow...\\" Lee hooks the reader with a deceptively simple story of a Southern family and a Southern town caught up in a cataclysmic moral crisis, and keeps us enthralled till the very last word. Lee's writing style is that of the storyteller who mesmerizes her audience telling a tale so simple, yet so compelling, that you never want it to end. Her narrator is Scout Finch, a delightfully devilish little tomboy who sees her world through the all-observant eyes of childhood. Scout is one of the most enchanting characters in modern American fiction. She's bright, funny, totally real; there's nothing contrived about her. She's someone we all knew in first or second grade, or wished we'd known. Scout lives with her brother Jem, four years her senior, her lawyer father Atticus, and their housekeeper Calpurnia, in a sleepy Alabama town where everybody knows or is related to everybody else. Lee spends the first half of the book drawing us into the life of the town and the Finch family, Scout's hilarious and problematic adjustment to first grade, and brings us into the mystery surrounding the notorious-yet-never-seen Boo Radley. The second half of the book is about the moral crisis that tears the town apart.Lee has a way of saying a lot by saying very little, and her laconic statement that the people of Maycomb had recently been told they had nothing to fear but fear itself sets the time squarely in 1933, the depths of the Great Depression. Times were bad for most people in small Southern towns; they were especially bad for poor whites and all blacks. In 1933 the South was rigidly segregated down every possible line, and a white woman's false accusation of rape was enough to get a black man hanged. When Mayella Ewell accuses Tom Robinson of rape, in the eyes of most of the white populace, Tom has been tried, convicted and is awaiting execution. Judge Taylor disagrees, and asks Atticus to take Tom's case.In Atticus Finch, Lee created what would eventually grow to be the best-loved character in all American fiction. Atticus is a loving but not a doting father, an able lawyer, and an individual of towering integrity. He takes Tom's case because he knows Mayella's accusation is full of holes, and he believes Tom is as deserving of good legal representation as anyone else. Atticus knows better than anyone else how his decision to take the case will affect his children, but as he explains to Scout, who wonders how Atticus can be right if everybody else thinks he's wrong, if he didn't take the case, he could never hold his head up in front of his children again.Atticus knows he's fighting a losing battle, but deep inside himself he believes he may lose a battle but win a bigger war. The chapters describing Tom Robinson's trial and Atticus's defense are some of the most powerful in American fiction. On of the most moving passages in the book is at the end of the trial when the town's black minister tells Scout to \\"Stand up. Your father's passin'.\\"Along with Scout and Atticus Finch, Lee created a host of other memorable characters. Jem is the perfect big brother for Scout, sometimes protective, sometimes antagonistic, always encouraging. Lee only needs to pen a few details about Calpurnia to bring her vividly to life: \\"She was all angles and bones; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard.\\" Calpurnia isn't the stereotypical Mammy of Tara; she's a no-nonsense maid and housekeeper who dishes out ample amounts of love and old-fashioned discipline in equal doses. And Miss Maudie Atkinson is a delightful creation; funny, ditzy, and wise all at once. Anyone would want her for their next-door neighbor.The two major villains, Bob Ewell and his daughter Mayella, are compelling characters in their own right. Bob Ewell is quintessential white trash, spending the family's relief money on moonshine while his children go hungry. But poor Mayella is as much victim as villain; we can't help but feel for her, ostracized and isolated, knowing only her father's physical violence and sexual abuse; her attempted seduction of Tom Robinson is a desperate cry for love and affection. But, as Lee reminds us, it's all for naught. Tom Robinson was dead the minute Mayella, caught in the act of attempted seduction by her father, opened her mouth and screamed.After the highlight of the trial, the book might have slid into anticlimax, but it's Lee's genius that she keeps the tension heightened after the trial and its denouement, through Ewell's drunken, insane attack on Atticus through his children, and their rescue by Boo Radley. And after everything she, her family, and the town have been through, what has Scout learned from all this? Pretty much what Atticus set out to teach her all along: that you can't get to know a person until you put on his shoes and walk around in them.I turned the final page of \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", unbelieving that it had come to an end. I opened the front cover and immediately started reading it over again from page one. At two o'clock in the morning. The book had that much of an effect on me. One doesn't just read this book; one experiences it. At best, one lives it. I did.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Oddly, I'd never read To Kill a Mockingbird as a high school student. Nor had I ever seen the famous film with Gregory Peck. Fortunately, I also avoided learning the entire plot through cultural osmosis. Sure, I knew who Boo Radley was-- didn't I? Atticus Finch... yeah, I know who that is... right?Boy, was I wrong. Last week I finally decided it'd been long enough, and I sank into Harper Lee's only novel with high expectations. And I was certainly not disappointed. With its slow, warm and evocative opening chapters, Mockingbird starts off like a sulty summer day in the South. Lee depicts a South of \\"whistling bob white,\\" biscuits and warm milk, and ladies who on the hottest days bathe twice by noon and then douse themselves in lavender-smelling powder.Jean-Louise Finch, better known as Scout, narrates the story with the keen eye of an adult looking back on a childhood rich with incidents that shaped who she has become. Scout reminded me of some of Carson McCullers's heroines (Member of the Wedding, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter), but without the morbid loneliness and heartbreak. Scout might be described as a tomboy, but that would be doing her a disservice. Her adventures with her older brother Jem, and their dimunitive friend Dill (real name: Charles Baker Harris. \\"Your name's longer'n you are,\\" Jem points out) evoke the timeless place of childhood.As for Atticus Finch, what can one say about a father who seems to embody the greatest of virtues? He is tolerant, patient, kind, and understanding. He does not meddle with his children's affairs, he speaks to them as fellow adults (he allows them to call him \\"Atticus\\"), and his skill as a lawyer is legendary. Lee presents Atticus in a tough and sensitive manner, so that his believability is paramount.The other characters in the book are also depicted with great skill: Aunt Alexandra, bane of Scout's existence; Miss Maudie, who gives as good as she gets when harassed by intolerant neighbors; Calpurnia, the ever-present black maid who has as much a hand in Jem and Scout's well-being as Atticus; and of course the Ewells, whose poverty and ignorance help set the plot in motion.Harper Lee has written a wonderful book that pulses with life, with compassion, and easy good humor. Watching Atticus face down an angry mob set on lynching a black man, or racing with Jem as he escapes gunshots from the Radley house, or sitting with Scout as she forced to join her aunt's church lady reception, or taking that long midnight walk with Jem and Scout, is pure joy; these are scenes that reverberate in the reader's mind and surely in the minds of several generations of readers. I'm glad I can now say I'm one of them."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I just finished this book a few moments ago, and I am completely awed by this story. Harper Lee has done an excellent job bringing this 1930s Alabama childhood to life. I can see why To Kill a Mockingbird has won the Pulitzer Prize, garnered an Academy Award for the movie version, and ultimately become a timely classic enjoyed by many generations.To Kill a Mockingbird tells the story of two children, sister Scout and brother Jem, and their childhood during three years in the midst of the Great Depression. Scout and Jem spend most of their summers with their summer-neighbor, Dill, making up plays and spying on the town recluse, Boo Radley. During the school year (minus Dill, who goes back home to Mississippi), Scout finds herself in trouble one too many times and struggles with the concept of being a lady, especially when all she wants to do is wear overalls and beat up her classmates.Then everything changes one fall.... Scout and Jem's father, Atticus Finch, a lawyer in their town of Maycomb, Alabama, is appointed to the defense of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman (although not of the highest caliber), Mayella Ewell. The fact of this case rocks the town of Maycomb, and with Scout and Jem feeling the brunt of their classmates ridicule when they realize Atticus is on Tom's side.I was simply floored while reading this novel. I wasn't expecting a &quot;classic&quot; to be so readable. Now I know what I've been missing! To Kill a Mockingbird is a piece of our American history that depicts racism and prejudice, childhood innocence, and the perseverence of a man who risked it all to stand up for what he believed in. Wonderful portrayal and one I will read again."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Somehow my education did not impose on me a reading of Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" although I saw the excellent movie based on it several times. What a pleasure to discover, when finally picking up the book in my middle age, that the people who inhabit this book spring fully grown directly from the mind of Harper Lee herself, rather than just the actors in the film.Harper Lee has written not a single one-dimensional character, and has created a few of the best realized and strongest characters ever put into print: not just Atticus, Jem, and Scout Finch, but also the dignified Calpurnia, the eager Dill, the peaceful but ghostly Boo Radley, even the degraded and predatory Ewell family. These characters jump off the page like in no other novel I can recall. There is no doubt in my mind that these folks are as real as any of the people I see walking down the street, and I feel for Atticus in particular a similar sort of astonished respect as I do for my own father.If somehow the book itself has passed you by, or if (sadly) it was imposed on you for a class assignment when you were young, revisit it. It's one of the best ever written."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"There used to be a time that the word \\"classic\\" meant something. Nowadays, it seems to only mean \\"more than ten years old\\"; quality doesn't come into the equation at all. Take, for example, the cable channel American Movie Classics, which typically features movies that are forgettable regardless of age. I prefer the classic definition of \\"classic\\", one that means something that is not only really good but withstands the test of time.Put another way, look at the Da Vinci Code. A decent book and a phenomenal best-seller, but will people still be reading it decades from now? Only time will tell. Time, however, has already told on Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, and it is clearly, by any use of the word, a classic. Although forty-seven years old, it is still as good as ever.Set in the town of Maycomb, Alabama during the Depression, To Kill a Mockingbird tells the tale of the Finch family: widower father Atticus, young son Jem and younger daughter (and narrator) Scout. Atticus, an attorney, has been appointed to represent Tom Robinson, accused of raping a 19-year-old girl named Mayall Ewell. Since Tom is black and Mayall is white, guilt is assumed by most of the town and the trial a mere formality. The truth plays little part.Maycomb is a stratified society. There are the \\"respectable\\" people, who - with or without money - are considered the aristocrats of the community. The Finches fit into this category. There are the poorer white people, from the poor-yet-proud Cunninghams to the \\"trashy\\" Ewells. At the bottom are the blacks. Though Atticus refuses to participate in this classism (and tries to lead his children to do the same), he is pragmatic enough to acknowledge its existence.This novel may have the trial of Tom Robinson as its centerpiece, but there is plenty more going on as we take a tour of an impoverished town in the Deep South. With this book, Lee has written one of the Great American Novels. And while some great authors are not easily readable (for example, Faulkner), Harper Lee holds the reader from the beginning to end.Has there been any author who has written something so great in his or her only effort? Yes, there are authors like Margaret Mitchell who wrote Gone With the Wind (which has a far more romantic version of the Old South), but her career was cut short by an early death; Lee is still around and still has no other books published. The one book she wrote, however, is considered one of the greatest novels ever written. It is a true classic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"what a great drama!

Many true bibliophiles I know still talk about this book and the way it changed them forever.It deserves better than to be assigned reading to captive 6th and 10th graders. They read it then because they have to, not because some kind librarian or insightful teacher, or intuitive parent, sends it their way, like a lucky charm.I am not a Southerner and unless you can call a Western New York born mother and an Owensboro, Kentucky bred father any sort of meaningful Southern influence in my life, I do not know why this story fits my life so well. It filled a need I never even knew was there until I closed its covers on first reading it.I am a fan of both the writing and its message, its dual edged sword of hope and sorrow, the tragicomic aspect of its mood and setting.I wanted to be Scout as a tomboy girl and when grown, to be Atticus; my cats have borne those monikers well.I only wish my husband had not told me I could not name my own son after my hero.A rare case where the movie and its inspiration are as beloved as its author, To Kill a Mockingbird, N words and all, needs to be read more---and not just as some lame excuse for a paper writing exercise. Scout, Jem and Dill come alive in these pages. They have meaning in their world and in this one.The dialogue, minus a few colloquiallisms, is readable and real. You will laugh out loud at times when Scout makes her mind known to you.You'll wish Atticus was a real man. Maybe you'll even feel a little guilty about wanting him to replace your father in real life.And Tom Robinson? He'll break your heart. He should.I was once told my Coleman family had some relation to Harper Lee's father's family and, if that bit of fiction has even the remotest grain of truth to it, I am even happier now than I was just having imagined it.PLEASE READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This classic should be made required reading for every person in every culture and in every country. If only everyone would read it, and truly understand, identify with and 'learn' from the story and the message found within its pages, I believe the world would be a happier and peaceful place to live in for all.&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a 'rich' and compelling story set in 1930s Alabama. It's a story about the purity and innocence of children, about justice (or the lack of it), racism, hypocrisy, human compassion, trust and love (all issues we can relate to) told from the experiences and perspectives of a small child (Scout).The writing is wonderfully beautiful and charming. You'll fall in love with the depth of inner beauty and innocence found in the 2 children (Jem, and especially his sister, Scout/Jean Louis). You'll find yourself rooting passionately for their father (Atticus Finch) to win his case when he chooses to defend a black man on trial for life, despite much social pressure on Finch to give up the case and veiled threats against him and his family. Watch for the part where Finch cross-examines the &quot;victim&quot; (a white girl who accuses the black man of rape) and during his closing speech. Both are excellent courtroom drama (the best I've come across) and they also reveal a lot of the (ugly) truth behind the case.Atticus Finch's sense of justice, perseverence and fighting spirit (the way he stood his ground) are most inspiring and touching. Based on what he believes in, he knows he must &quot;do the right thing&quot;, all the more since he has 2 young children who look up to him for guidance on the difference between right and wrong.I also loved reading the precious scenes involving Atticus and his children - Atticus is really a &quot;beautiful&quot; person and a perfect role-model of a dad - at once loving and understanding and patience and fair.And what about the mysterious recluse, Arthur &quot;Boo&quot; Radley who hasn't left his house in years and has become some sort of a terrifying yet intriguing &quot;legend&quot; among the neighbourhood children? Is he really the madman or evil spirit that the children believe him to be?This book (and another winner, &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; by Frank McCourt) should rank highly in everyone's list of must-reads. What a true gem! Read it and be charmed."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Some books so fluidly transcend the stories they contain that the characters and setting almost become incidental to the universal themes they express without contrivance. Such a book exists in Harper Lee's masterful 1960 novel, one of the most revered pieces of fiction this country has ever produced. Set in rural, Depression-era Alabama, it is a classic coming-of-age story about a precocious nine-year old tomboy named Scout. What she experiences is palpable in the virulent racism surrounding the persecution of Tom Robinson, a black man unjustly accused of raping Mayella, the abused white daughter of an unrepentant bigot, Bob Ewell. Representing Tom in court is Atticus Finch, Scout's father and the moral compass of the story.The plot moves toward a deepening exploration of the intractable conflict between tolerance and ignorance and how the pre-existing environment of hatred and mistrust makes innocent people guilty by pure circumstance. Scout embodies these themes within her own journey toward womanhood and her questions of what society expects of her. Through the travails of Tom and the town's outcast, Boo Radley, and primarily through her father's example, Scout recognizes how innate goodness can exist even in the direst circumstances. Likely because the story is semi-autobiographical, Lee is able to vividly capture the rural south and the pervasive mindset during the Depression with spellbinding accuracy. Yet for all that, the book's lasting legacy has more to do with Lee's particular lierary gift in bringing a genuine universality to her themes.Other characters weave in and out of the story - including Dill, Scout's wannabe boyfriend and the Truman Capote doppelganger - and each plays a key role in shaping the novel's core conflicts. I have to say that the author's particular literary strengths come to the fore in her empathetic depictions of the evolving relationships between these characters, for example, Scout and her father Atticus, Scout and her brother Jem, the children and Boo. Nothing seems extraneous in the story Lee tells, no small feat for a 336-page novel. She brings intense emotion to her prose, especially in describing the uncontrollable fury created by racial hatred and false accusations, for instance, in the lynch mob scene before the trial and in the vengeful attack on the children. The timing of the book's original 1960 publication turned out to be prescient, as the Civil Rights movement was just becoming national in scope thanks to the efforts of Martin Luther King and his brethren. Even if you have seen the masterful1962 film, you owe it to yourself to read Lee's literary masterwork and sadly the only novel she ever wrote."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is absolutely brilliant. I've read the book three times in my life, at ages 13, 18, and 22. With each reading I gain a better appreciation for the storyline, the author, and the moral beliefs that are challenged within these pages. There are few books that increase in complexity the more they are read, and this happens to be one of them. Harper Lee seems to speak to readers of all ages, and no matter how many times this novel is read, the reader will never cease to feel compelled by the message that it delivers.The story is narrated by Scout, the daughter of Atticus Finch, a criminal defense attorney in the Deep South who is assigned to defend a black man in his trial for raping a white girl. The novel tells the story of how Scout and her family endure the threatening ridicule from their community for Atticus' loyalty to this man. While Harper Lee delivers the message that black people were discriminated against in the Deep South, the more notable message was the struggle that whites endured when they chose to side with the blacks. There are some extremely comical moments in this book involving Scout and her brother. Therre are also several other interesting sub-plots that help describe the morals, beliefs, and problems in the Deep South during that period of time. Though, my favorite part was Atticus Finch's closing argument during the trial. His monologue constitutes some of the best pages of literature I've ever read.This was the only novel that Harper Lee ever wrote. Maybe it is best that she never published again. There's no way that she could have ever topped this novel. Not many authors can. This novel will always remain a permanent member of my book collection, and I'm sure I'll be reading it a few more times in my life and gaining something new ever time. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mocking Bird represents a handful of books and authors that are able to transport the reader directly into it's pages. One may find that they can relate with one or more of the characters in the book, and sometimes with more than one at a time.This book is about many things, and although it is very complex it is easy to follow due the similarities to life itself. Like life, there are many characters. Some that are easy to hate, easy to love, and those that are plainly repulsive because of their disrespect for their fellow man.This story is indeed about prejudice. It paints a despicable ( but reasonably accurate) picture of the hate that permeated the daily lives of those in rural Alabama. It also portrays the prejudice that is applied to those that are different for reasons other than skin color. This book is also about the preservation of childhood innocence.Scout and Jem enjoy a pleasure that many of us only wish we could have experienced. That pleasure was the love and care of a father that stood for what was right to the point of his own harm. Many of us have never known that type of uncompromising love that Atticus Finch so readily exudes. He is a man, as Miss Maudie says, \\"was born to do our unpleasant jobs for us\\". The character of Atticus Finch still stands as a man among men. We could use a few like him today.Jean and Jeremy find themselves subject to the harsh realities of poverty and prejudice, but they are always able to take refuge in the affection of their father. Atticus makes many efforts to protect his children. His primary tool is truth. He speaks openly and honestly with his children. Again we would do well to take a few notes from Atticus.The true value of this book is it's exposure of hate and bigotry, but it is valuable in so many ways. It has more to offer than could be considered in any review. Were it's many complex details of relationship to be reviewed and catalogued by the greatest minds in psychology and human sciences it would require multiple volumes.Although I highly recommend this book, I would offer a word of caution to the reader. The book uses the \\"n\\" word repeatedly, and I suppose that within it's historical context may be accurate, nonetheless I found it quite unsettling. There are a number of other explicative statements, but I would suggest that they are also supplied to offer a contextual reality that would otherwise be lost without them.This is a timeless and enjoyable story. The entire human drama is put on display in a small rural Alabama town."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I think that this was an interersting novel.

This was the book that we DIDN'T read in high school, but instead we bought the cliffs notes and watched Gregory Peck. Too bad we were so ignorant in high school. This book has been the favorite for most of us. It is wonderful. It is an easy read and so engaging. I couldn't put it down and was a little sad when I finished it.I think that our English programs in high school do a huge disservice to teenagers when they assign this book. Teachers tell their students that the book is about racial tension and bigotry. What student WANTS to read about that? Instead, students should be told that it is a great book about 2 siblings growing up in the south, who play during the summer and try to peek in on their reclusive neighbor (Boo). Then, when they read it, students would just naturally pick up on the racial themes throughout the book.We all thanked the person who picked out this book for us; it was a real treat to read it as an adult."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

Atticus, who is the father of Jem and Scout, must defend Tom Robinson, a hard-working young Negro man, for a crime he is accused of during a difficult time of racial prejudice.

When I first read it (at age fourteen) I found it to be a difficult read, and not particularly enjoyable. Rereading it some thirty years later I now see what all the fuss is about.Firstly, this book is about the thoughts and activities of a young girl growing up in 1930s rural Alabama. There is very much the innocence (and, ultimately, lost innocence) and wonder of youth in the Harper Lee's prose ... kind of a Dixie version of 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'. Harper Lee's observations of the rascism and hypocritical society of the times are keenly judged. My only complaint, albeit minor, is that her prose is too rich - it seems out of place (ie, too adult) for a story about adolescent girl. This makes 'To Kill a Mockingbird' a deceptively inappropriate book for anyone under, say, seventeen years of age.Bottom line: all the heartbreak of youth during turbulent times exquisitely told. Worth rereading (time and time again)."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Like most teenagers, I read this novel in Grade 10 as part of an English class. I noted then it wasn't a bad book for a 'classic'. I have since read this book twice more, most recently in June 2005. Each time I read this book, I learn more from it and pick up things I missed previous times or perhaps I didn't miss them I'm just older and have learned to understand so many more things.This novel is narrated by Scout and takes place over three summers in Maycomb county. Scout, her older brother Jem and their summer time friend Dill have typical summer vacation for children of the south during the Depression. They make up plays, they have a treehouse, there is a scarey neighbourhood house. Scout starts the first line of the novel saying she remembers the summer that her brother Jem broke his arm. From that line forward we learn about the events that lead to this and most importantly the summer that their father, Atticus represented a black man, Tom Robinson against the state and a white but trashy family, the Ewells.If you have't picked up this book since highschool - I recommend you give it an adult read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I know that some people here think this is a forum to discuss their political views and whatnot instead of a BOOK REVIEW. Let me set the record straight: It is not. Go find the appropriate place and do so there. (For those who don't know what I am talking about or who are feigning ignorance and/or innocence, please read the comments posted below mine.)As for the book itself, I loved it! I read it in 10th grade as part of an assigned reading in class. A few years later, I read it again, just for the sheer enjoyment of it. I have not, since then, been lucky enough to get my hands on a copy, but I will one day. I will say this, though, without giving away the plot (for those who haven't read it yet), I am a person who is hardly EVER moved to tears, yet this is the first book I've read that has made me cry!!! There are only one or two other books that have made me do that, but that is another story for another time.

The children get into all sorts of mischief around the town and their neighborhood. During their first summer together, the children are very intrigued by the Radley house and Boo Radley. The history of the Radleys is shady and different, all the more reason the children want to investigate. The second part of the book, the children have matured and are starting to see things in different ways. During this section, Atticus, their father, has a bery big case to defend. This case could result in the imprisonment of an innocent man, or going against the system that has been followed for so long, to keep an innocent man free.

Jean Louise Finch (Scout), her brother Jem, and their friend Dill experience many tough situations to learn from that they don't understand as kids, but as they get a little older their dad explains it and it makes sense to them. The kids, along with many others are faced with racism throughout the book and it has a major impact on their lives.I enjoyed the way Harper Lee wrote most of the book. She used outstanding details and imagery to describe the characters and scenes. I found the way she wrote the courtroom scene very detailed. I could feel the intense emotions flying back and forth between Atticus and Mr. Gilmer as they argued the facts of Tom Robinson's case. Mrs. Lee showed both, Atticus' and Mr. Gilmer's personalities with that one scene alone by how she described their facial expressions and emotions. It showed how calm Atticus is, opposed to how angry, and determined to defeat Atticus Mr. Gilmer is. Most of the novel was very strong.The book started off a little slow and gradually got more exciting. The author took a while to introduce the characters and their personalities. It took me some time to get in to the book before it pulled me in. The author spent a lot of time on the introduction to make sure she thoroughly described the setting and characters to make it clear to the reader what was going on.

As a lawyer, Atticus is called to defend a black man who has been accused by a trashy white man of raping his daughter.

Boy, was I wrong! I had to force myself NOT to read ahead, it was so interesting! It wasn't entirely about Tom Robinson's trial; there were some side plots, such as the stories of Boo Radley, Mrs. Dubose, and the tree filled with gifts. None of them were pointless, though. They all tied in to the central theme of the story.When I first started reading, I could not understand what the heck \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" meant. Even when I cam across that quote halfway through the book, I didn't get it. When I was done, however, I could understand the symbol perfectly. I also enjoyed how the very first sentence in the book, about Jem's elbow, is explained almost at the very end.I want to mention that I have a friend who never reads anything, ever. She hates books and reading with a passion. She had to read TKAM for the same reason as me, for English class. Her class read it before mine, and when she was done, she told me she loved it. I think that just proves how excellent the book is: if SHE loves it, it's got to be good!My one complaint is that we had to do so much work on it. We had to write Jane Shaffers, we had to complete reading guides, we had to do quickwrites, we had to take excessive notes. All that, in my opinion, just killed the joy of reading such a wonderful book. I fully intend to go back and re-read it when the school year is over so I can appreciate it even more for what it is.To Kill a Mockingbird has replaced Beastly (Alex Flinn) as my favorite book of all time.

The book details Scout's period of self discovery & her exploration of ethics in a time of racial conflict in America's South. Scout, the narrator of the novel, is six at the beginning, but as she grows, so too does the novel's vocabulary. Words like \\"stricture\\" and \\"slop\\" turn into \\"ex cathedro\\" and \\"morphodite\\". The diction evolves in accordance with the development of the character changing to reflect shifting views & perspectives.Although a great piece of literature, the novel does not contain similes or metaphors. This lack, however, does not detract from the literary experience, but rather adds to the book a refreshing element of honesty & innocence. A relatively new literary work, To Kill A Mockingbird is a masterpiece that will be enjoyed by adults, children and families for years to come.Reviewed by: K. Klavon, P. Friedman, J. Quinlan, L.K., Mike Dalbello,Max Holmes"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The great American classic, Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, is a heart-warming and insightful re-telling of one spunky, curious girl growing up in the racially-divided and old-fashioned South. The main character, Scout, was constantly reprimanded by her relatives, for being too \\"unladylike.\\" She breaks through these gender stereotypes by refusing to adhere to this expected persona of a Southern Belle. Ever her brother and friend engage in sexist jokes and banter, and exclude her from certain activities because of her gender. Despite her dealing with the constant insults to her person, Scout blossoms into an upstanding and determined woman, partially because of her father Atticus's moral teachings throughout her development.This book is considered a classic for a reason. Not only does it contain beautiful writing and meaningful morals, but it also has an entertaining plot. The book appeals to twelve-year olds and forty year olds alike, with a sweet and humorous story. All different kinds of people, from the more \\"involved\\" Stephanie Crawford's to the sassy and opinionated Calpurnias, can enjoy this wonderful tale of growing up, learning new things, and breaking boundaries that has entertained a nation for over forty years.by ava, jenny w, lizzy, and rosalie."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's literary masterpiece To Kill A Mockingbird portrays poverty during the Depression in an accurate yet somewhat negative light. The novel chronicles the childhood of Jem and Scout Finch, with their father Atticus, in the economically disadvantaged town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1930s. The decade brought increased financial hardships to much of America's muddle-class as racial tensions escalated in a nation struggling to achieve equality.Although the majorirty of Maycomb residents faced a certain degree of poverty, Lee highlights extremely impoverished families such as the Ewells and Cunninghams. In a truthful rendition of the sacrifices many had to endure, Lee describes Walter Cunningham's lack of food. \\"He had no [lunch] today no would he have any tomorrow oe rhe next day,\\" Lee writes and, \\"He had probably never seen the quarters together...\\"Mockingbird also displays the respect and generosity with which most tried to lead their lives, despire the poverty all around the,. When Scout invites young Walter over for lunch, Calpurnia, the Finches' housekeeper, reprimands Scout, admonishing, \\"Yo' folks might be better than the Cunninghams, but it don't count for mothin' the way you're disgracin' 'em...\\"Lee's depiction of the dirt-poor Ewells, whose alcoholic father uses his meager income to fuel his addiction , allows the audience to glimpse the bottom crust of Southern society. Of Burris Ewell, a permanent first-grader, Lee writes, \\"His neck was dark gray, the back of his hands were rusty, and his fingernails were balck deep into the quick.\\" The poverty-stricken South is accurately exemplified in Harper Lee's classic tale To Kill A Mockingibrd."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee is a call to 1960s American society to take action in the Civil Rights Movement. This is the story of a young, white girl in a small 1930s Southern town. She grows up learning from her father, the town lawyer, appointed to defend an innocent black man accused of the rape of a white girl. The author depicts the reality of injustice and prejudice in everyday life at the time. This timeless classic portrays racism, segregation, and the need for the Civil Rights Movement in a deeply moving novel, which is a must-read for all.Lee takes a stand for Civil Rights in To Kill A Mockingbird, portraying the hate and injustice of segregation. She tells how an innocent man is absurdely accused of rape, solely because he is black. Atticus Finch, the accused's lawyer, clearly proves that his client is innocent, but the all white jury still rules Tom Robinson (the accused) guilty as charged. This page-turning novel calls attention to the need for acceptance, tolerance, and desegregation.Atticus Finch was looked down upon for defending an African American, but he taught his children, as Lee teaches her readers, to stand up for what is right. Harper When asked why he was defending Tom Robinson, Finch replied, \\"if I didn't I couldn't hold up my head\\". Written in the 1960s, this book is a call to conscience as powerful as the marchers in the street, the sitters in the restaurants, the pioneers in the courtrooms, and the oppressed all over the country.by: Cierra Campbell, Zoe Kurtz, Leah Ragen, Lila Weintraub, Selena Wyborski"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"A friend in New York called to say, \\"I just listened to To Kill A Mockingbird on tape. There's a lot of funny stuff about education and John Dewey. I wouldn't have understood it if I hadn't read all those articles on your site.\\"Now I had to order this book. I had avoided it all these decades because it was such a Teacher's Pet; kids are made to read this novel because it says all the right things about racial injustice. Well, I read it, and enjoyed it thoroughly. It's good history (Alabama, 1935); good sociology; and good story-telling, lightning in a bottle, actually. But you probably know that. So let me mention a funny irony. Public schools make kids read TKAM, but TKAM is a tough critic of those schools.My friend exaggerated; the bits about education hardly add up to three pages. But they are delicious! The set-up is that the narrator, Scout Finch, age six, is off to her first day of school on page 15, with this thought: \\"I had never looked forward more to anything in my life.\\"But there's a problem: she can already read, at a high level. The teacher, discovering this fact, looked at Scout \\"with more than faint distaste. Miss Caroline told me to tell my father not to teach me any more, it would interfere with my reading...'It's best to begin reading with a fresh mind. You tell him I'll take over from here and try to undo the damage...Your father does not know how to teach.'\\"That's so pretty, you might want to cry. An entire cosmos of educational stupidity is right there. Scout goes on: \\"I mumbled that I was sorry and retired meditating upon my crime. I never deliberately learned to read, but somehow I had been wallowing illicitly in the daily papers.\\"At lunch Scout tells her brother she wants to quit school. He reassures her, \\"Don't worry...Our teacher says Miss Caroline's introducing a new way of teaching. She learned about it in college...It's the Dewey Decimal System.\\" According to Scout, this consisted \\"of Miss Caroline waving cards at us on which were printed \`the,' \`cat,' \`rat,' \`man,' and \`you.'\\" That, of course, is Whole Word; and we are still fighting this crabgrass 70 years later.Scout is bored so she writes a letter to a friend. Miss Caroline catches her and says: \\"We don't write in first grade. We print. You won't learn to write until you're in the third grade.\\"You can see what a deft touch Harper Lee has. It's sweet, and sly, and scathing. Melvil Dewey, by the way, created the Dewey Decimal System. That little inside joke is one example of what I mean by \\"sly.\\"As for Professor John Dewey, he has caused a lot of trouble. I like to think that Harper Lee and I are in total accord about this guy. Discussing Miss Caroline's origins, Scout notes that the teacher was from a part of Alabama that was full of \\"Liquor Interests, Big Mules, steel companies, Republicans, professors, and other persons of no background.\\""},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"There is a reason that this book is extremely popular, and now that I've finally had a chance to read it, I know why: I consider it to be one of the most well-written books I ever stumbled upon.Lee's writing is so precise and sharp that it makes me wonder exactly how long it took her to come up with the first idea of the story, and then finally to have turned in the final draft for publishing. A story with characters like this could take years to write.For those who have never had the privilege of reading this masterpiece, do not overestimate this book by its mass popularity; unlike the countless books out there that are popular, no matter how bad they really are, Lee's book continues to thrive in both classrooms and bookstores alike because of the universal lessons it has to teach.It can be enjoyed by both the young and the old, but I suggest that you wait till you're older to read it, as the mind may not be able to fully appreciate it until it is well seasoned."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"If you're looking for a fast plot, kick a$$ characters who overcome insurmountable odds, then you should look elsewhere.If you're looking for the gritting truth, set at a Southern pace (i.e. slow), where things are never quite what they seem on the surface (i.e. small towns), and good does not always prevail (i.e. what ever happened to Dill and why did it have to happen to Tom), then I recommend this American classic.I've read a few of the reviews and was actually surprised that some didn't like it. While I understand that nothing appeals to all audiences, it was still a shock to me. And the reason for that is that when you love something, it's hard to see why other's don't.A small percentage of reviewers said that nothing happened and the characters are one-dimensional. While this feedback is obviously valid for those who made it, I have to disagree. The women in the town (esp the Auntie and Miss Maudie) were perfect examples of complex characters living through a very changing (and challenging) time. If you read a bit below the surface, I believe the average reader should be able to pick that up.Jem was another example of a complex character. We watched him cross that threshold from a little boy to a young man. To me this was proven by his periods of quietness and his behaviors.Because the story was written to reflect, as closely as possible, true life during a particularly period in American culture, it may seem a bit slow to those accustomed to and prefer contemporary/speculative fiction.I was born in the South and therefore found the dialogue to be quite accurate of how we spoke during my childhood. This helped me to relate to it and build more of a bond to the characters.Every now and again, I find (as I get older -- not sure how relevant that is for the younger audiences) you want to read a book that stays with you. You're not in the mood for a Stephen King (tho he is a master story teller). Instead you want something slower, something with a little more meaning to it so that you when you put it down, you have to sit in silence and reflect on what you've read and why you liked it so much.This is not a book that I would've read in high school (cliff notes was my preferred method). Unfortunately I did not have the patience nor the maturity (that adjective is reflective of me only) to understand how good people can make bad decisions and still not be bad people. One of the toughest things to do is to stand up in front of an angry mob and tell them that you don't agree with. This, I think, is one of the crucibles of the novel.For me, this is one of the best books I've read and completely understand why it has won a Pulitzer. She deserves it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book by Harper Lee shows how race is an issue that needed to be solved.It's an realistic fictional book that has to deal with a black man's word against a white trash man's word.Scout and Jem are just normal kids who have a lawyer father who takes on the trial of a life time; that will change their lives for ever.This book is an exciting but interesting and has lots of drama.

The story is told through a 9 year old girl, Scout, growing up with people who hate blacks. Her father doesn't want her to grow up a racist, and he does everything he can to teach her right.

The trials of a family in the 1930's Deep South were touching and effective. Scout Finch is a little girl growing up in a town with a disease called racism. The events that surrounded one summer of her life have more meaning than many other books at that level. Harper Lee has become a celebrated author since it's release in 1960, even though she has never written another book. It's impossible not to become completely attached to the characters in the heartfelt story. It handled issues of discrimination, rape, and murder in ways that could only come from an author who had lived it. Her childhood in Alabama gives us the idea that Harper Lee's book might be closer to realistic fiction than anything else. Still this book was inspiring and complex. It was in no way anti-climactic, and though it was written forty years ago, the issues it explores are still prevalent in today's society. I highky recommend this book to you, no matter what lifestyle you thrive in. It's not often that a book can be considered revolutionary almost fifty years after it's written, but that's exactly what To Kill A Mockingbird does."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"In the beginning the children had a big curiosity in the man who lived across the street.

In the end an astonishing verdict was made."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"What can possibly be left to say about Nelle Harper Lee's classic tale of tolerance and pain, of justice denied and served, of childhood innocence lost to adolescent understanding? Surely it has all been said before in analyzing Ms. Lee's sole published novel, a surprisingly autobiographical recounting of small town Southern justice at the dawn of the pre-civil rights era - the strong sense of tradition and place, the parallelism between Tom Robinson and Boo Radley, the alternating flashes of humor and tragedy, the implicit pleas for social justice.A work that stands as revelatory for high school freshmen necessarily loses some of that power on later rereading. However, the directness and simplicity of Harper Lee's writing, her ear for the Southern voice and eye for the telling detail, and her remarkable ability to realize memorable characters continue to impress even the mature reader. Atticus Finch stands as an archetype of the righteous but humble man seeking to serve justice and the common good, whatever the cost. Scout is the eternal tomboy, the adventurous young soul grappling with the implications of racial prejudice and injustice while experiencing and conquering her own version in Arthur (Boo) Radley. Boo himself stands as the \\"unknown other,\\" the feared immigrant or differently colored whom, as Atticus says, we can never know until we put ourselves in their skin. Then there's Dill, the summer neighbor so clearly modeled on the author's own childhood neighbor and lifelong friend, Truman Capote. These are joined by an entire townfull of supporting characters, each memorable and each an archetype in his or her own right.Lee's master stroke as a writer was to view the events surrounding Mayella Ewell's alleged rape and Tom Robinson's trial through the eyes of a child just emerging into adolescence. Scout struggles to interpret the lives, actions, and attitudes of those around her through the lens of nave childhood, yet her budding adolescence places her on a cusp. One day she is beating up boys and catching frogs, the next day she's being groomed for Southern womanhood. Nevertheless, Scout forces us through her questions and reactions to confront the inherent irrationality in racial and class prejudices. If it's a sin to kill a mockingbird, as the story's underlying proverb asserts, then who is Harper Lee's mockingbird? At one level, the answer is obviously Tom Robinson, seconded by Boo Radley. Yet perhaps the true mockingbird, sinfully slaughtered, is indeed that very childhood innocence, forever destined to suffer that tragic fate at the hands of incipient adulthood.To a far greater extent than one might imagine, Harper Lee drew much of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD's material from her own life. The lawyerly and reserved father, the small town life (hers was Monroeville, AL), the deceased mother (hers was emotionally distant and psychologically troubled), the scarily unseen neighbor's grown son, the cranky, busybody neighbor, the oddly effete childhood friend - these and numerous other story elements came from Ms. Lee's direct family and childhood experiences. Ms. Lee even borrowed the theme for Jem and Scout's climactic school pageant, \\"Ad Astra Per Aspera,\\" from Kansas's state motto, a little fact she picked up there while assisting Truman Capote with his research for IN COLD BLOOD. I highly recommend as a companion piece to this novel Charles Shields's MOCKINGBIRD: A PORTRAIT OF HARPER LEE."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Like the prose and symphonies of centuries past that yet today evoke memory and emotion, To Kill A Mockingbird epitomizes the definition of \\"classic\\".It is a story of the most important time in people's lives; when morals are made, when lessons are learned, when lasting friendships are born and time takes forever and then is forever gone--childhood.This thoroughly heartwarming tale chronicles the struggles, strengths and weaknesses of Atticus Finch, small town Alabama lawyer and widowed father of two in the 1930's. It delves into the spiritual and moral dilemmas aroused by fear and prejudice. As he defends a young black man accused of a crime against a white woman, it becomes as much a trial of fatherhood as a test of justice.The story is seen through the eyes of a 9 year old girl, Scout. She and her older brother, Jem, have critical issues of their own to deal with. Scout wants to get out of having to go to school, so she takes up cussing, hoping her father will assume she's learned these new words at school and immediately withdraw her. Another time, Scout and Jem build a snowman that looks exactly like their next door neighbor. When the offended neighbor complains, Atticus tells them that a snowman is not supposed to be a caricature of a real person. Jem replies, \\"It's not a caricature. It looks exactly like him\\".Scout, Jem, and Atticus develop strong bonds they must cling to as they juggle a tedious balance between the ideologies of chidhood, fatherhood and the temperamental mores of a tumultuous place and time."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book in school not that long ago. That was the THIRD time reading that book. I can't get enough of it. It is an amazing story taking place in 1930's Alabama. The story is seen through the eyes of a 5 year old girl who's father, Atticus Finch (one of the most well known characters in literature), is defending a black man. This book is all about the way humans react to one another and how cruel people once were, but there were the seldom few like Atticus Finch that did care and tried to make a point to those who did not. There's so much to say about this magnificent book that can't be put in one review.

Everybody should read this novel because it is so interesting and it really is important. And a bonus- IT'S NOT BORING! Which is good because usually it seems books that are required reading are kind of boring. But not To Kill a Mockingbird.The novel takes place in a small fictional southern town called Maycomb, Alabama set during the depression. A family lives there that consists of a widowed father, Atticus Finch, an older brother, Jem Finch, and a younger girl named Scout Finch. The father is a lawyer and he takes on a case about an African American man who has supposedly raped a white girl. Not to give away the ending I have to stop my summary there. But the book goes on about a detailed trial of the man. Another subject the story talks about is the Finch's neighbor- Boo Radley. He is a mysterious man who never comes out of his house and has terrible rumors going around about him. Scout and Jem and a friend they make named Dill make it their mission to see Boo.The only downer to the novel is that the beginning doesn't make much sense.

It also shows how she wrote Truman Capote as a child into her book. You'll want to read both books."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I believe the greatest elements in this book are its good, decent, praiseworthy characters. Harper Lee creates a time and place where each character is flawed and fallible, yet her work lifts the reader to a more noble and lovely view of our world. Atticus Finch is a believably moral man with lofty principles, yet we see his hesitations and stumblings as a father and public defender. Scout, Atticus' daughter, and Jem, his son, act out in youthful fits of rage and misunderstanding, yet the deep love and unbounded admiration they feel for their father is heartwarming.The fact that Lee weaves threads of race and human rights and class distinction so skillfully into this tale is partly why I believe this book is such a beloved classic. Atticus is a single white father raising his two children with the help of a black housekeeper in Alabama during the 1930s. As Lee unfolds the family's story, we as readers are allowed to step back in time and possibly begin to understand what life may have been like from the perspective of young and old, black and white, and the poor and privileged. In the latter half of the book, Atticus is called upon to legally defend a black man for allegedly raping a white woman, and the trials he and his family suffer as a result make this book sing with conflict and weighty moral decisions.Furthermore, I very much liked Lee's folksy and funny and frequently beautiful language and her skill in penning creative and insightful sentences of high literary value.Recently I read or heard somewhere that Atticus Finch was determined from the results of a vast survey to be one of the most revered fictional characters in literature. In my opinion, Lee's Atticus deserves that distinction. I give this book my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I have read this book at least 10 times (and I don't even like to read), and I absolutely love it!!!

As with many, it was required reading. The night before it was due, I decided I would attempt to muster through it. I kept reassuring myself that if I could manage to hit the halfway mark, I'd be okay...boy, was I in for a surprise! When I got half of the book finished, I realized something strange: for the first time in my life, I did not want to stop reading, even if it was to get a drink or eat. Harper Lee had spun a tale that I could relate to, growing up in Geneva, Alabama. I was Scout. Lee had taken this mixed-up world that we lived in and turned it on its ear by showing it to us through the eyes of someone we once knew--ourselves. So much of this novel reminded me of how I was as a child--wide-eyed and innocent, before the world and all of its troubles set in. I have read many of the reviews here and while most are for the novel, the ones against and the reasoning behind them bother me. Many of the allegations are that this book is prejudice. This book is no more prejudice than any other great work of fiction. It is just portraying life as it was back then. If the truth is always right, then why isn't this book? I'm not agreeing with the views, but am also adult enough to know that they did exist and to acknowledge their presence. The other allegation, that children could not feel the emotion Lee writes about is ludicrous. How can one person know what another feels? Children do experience a whole scale of human emotion, just are unable to give it a name. Any emotion can be felt at any age. To make a long story short, BUY THIS BOOK! You will not be sorry.

Being Southern, it's hard for me to find many accurate novels about the South, but as old as this book is, I have never read one closer to the real thing.

It starts out with two kids in the summer and there early days. Just playing games and being innocent. It is about there lifes in a little town. After summer ends it is time to start school for the first time. This is a big chapter in life were the world starts to expand. This book was well written. It is Narrated by the girl in the story. The name of the girl in the story is Scout. This book reminds me of the book of Mice and Men. IT is just little everyday things in life and then somthing big and a big let down. That is what life is is a series of let downs you work hard play hard and may win but more often it is a let down. This book will keep your attention and then it will get serious and then it is a ferious ending. This book is real. I mean we all can remeber those times were we tried as hard as we could to get somthing be within inches thought you had it then bam it is gone. That is real and this book is exactly it.

It is a well rounded book and will keep you interested."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird was about a very deep and sad topic-African Americans vs. Whites. After I had read the book, it took me a minute to get beack into the 1990's. It was one of the very few books that drew my a purfect picture of what it would have been like to live then. The author, Harper Lee, had a way of telling you exactly what was going on through an eight year old girl. The emotions of the girl, Scout, were perfectly seen and there was never any confusion about any thing at all. On the whole, this book was VERY good, but it reached right into your soul. I'd say: GO READ IT!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is truly magnificant. No words can describe. Like many other people, the only reason why I started to read it was for an English assignment. At first I thought it was going to be really boring, but I was soon proven wrong. Even the first chapter was interesting. Harper Lee is truly a talented person. This book it totally original and creative. If you haven't read it yet, then I strongly advise you to read it. Once you start, you won't be able to put it down. The only regret I have was that I didn't read it earlier. So READ IT, HECK, BUY IT!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"When I read this book for the first time as a young girl, I didn't understand most of the symbols the author used and I didn't think the book was well written. When I went back and read it in high school, I could not help but feel that I was in Maycomb, Jem was my brother, Atticus, my father. This book places you not in a time, but in a common sense of emotion shared by all human beings. To Kill A Mockingbird is a timeless classic that should be shared by all."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This classic is one of those &quot;required&quot; novels that young people will be surprised to find they actually enjoy. This is mainly because the narrator, Scout, is such a likable tempestuous girl whose unflinchingly honest opinions are often as amusing as they are truthful. As the novel begins, Scout is a 6-year-old attending school for the first time. Her teacher is a newcomer to Maycomb, and although her methods of teaching frustrate Scout, her father Atticus explains that one never really knows a person until he walks around in that person's skin.This theme of &quot;putting oneself in another's place&quot; echoes throughout the novel, as Scout clumsily continues to ridicule or fear people who are different than she. One of these people is a mysterious neighborhood recluse named Boo Radley. Scout, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill naively turn the situation into a game in which they try to get Boo to come out of his house. In the meantime, they create their own idea of what Boo must look like, and the composite they come up with is a seven-foot ogre who eats raw animals. The kids are unaware of their cruelty in &quot;reenacting&quot; Boo's life, and their insensitivity is a metaphor for prejudice, which stems from people's ignorance, and which is also in abundance among the conservative Southern white folks in Maycomb.The standout character is Atticus, who is a lawyer. His motive is clearly not money, since they live in one of the poorest areas in the country; he is an idealist. Soon he will fight an uphill battle involving a young black man named Tom Robinson, a church-going family man who has nevertheless been accused of raping a 19-year-old white girl. Most of the townspeople are scandalized and pronounce him guilty on the spot, even when it becomes apparent during the trial that the &quot;evidence&quot; doesn't fit the accusation. Tom is almost too saintly as a character, but then, he is more of a symbol than a person--the mockingbird of the title. His reluctance to utter the &quot;unfit&quot; language that the girl's father, Bob Ewell, so readily uses, shows his gentle good breeding. Atticus has repeatedly told Scout that killing a mockingbird is a sin, because they do no harm to anyone. Scout sees how Tom Robinson, Boo Radley, and even Atticus at times, fit into the &quot;mockingbird&quot; theme, and that is the first glimmer of maturity and understanding experienced by her.The book is unique because it encompasses so many emotions: humor, misery, tragedy, indifference to others' suffering, loneliness, nobility, understanding, bravery, and acceptance. Scout herself is as feisty a heroine as any recent tomboys; she refuses to repress herself, even when she is told to be &quot;a lady&quot;. Atticus is almost god-like in his idealism; he is clearly a metaphor for Jesus in his lack of materialism and determination to seek justice at all costs. Jem, Scout's older brother, is so naive in his idealism that he, too, is wounded like the &quot;mockingbird&quot;; he did not realize that prejudice is so deep that no amount of logic can instantly dispose of it. Dill is the classic &quot;child orphan&quot; who is also wounded in his own way--emotionally. Mayella Ewing, Tom's accuser, is also a mockingbird in a sense--she was so mistreated, abused, and lonely, without any friends or confidantes, that she inspired the pity of a black man--an unforgivable sin on Tom's part, as far as the majority of Maycomb was concerned. There are so many noble and spiteful characters that the reader will not be bored; this book is truly an inspiration for all."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee. This classic book is about a little Southern girl Scout and her experiences growing up in the 1930's. It begins with a set up of things to come,such as Scout's experiences and the people she observes. Her guardians, her quiet, lovable lawyer father Atticus, and her Negro cook Cal help Scout and her tough,yet caring brother Jem through these experiences in Maycomb County, Alabama. Scout, Jem and their curious friend Dill make up plays about their reclusive and mysterious next door neighbor Arthur &quot;Boo&quot; Radley. He is the cause of scare and mystery and their lives. This sets up the ending, as does the racism of the town, shown by the neighborhood gossip, the piggish lazy Mr. Ewell, Scout's strict Aunt and the tyrant down the street Old Mrs. Dubose. The children learn many things about the town in which they live from their neighbor, sweet, tough Miss Maudie. One thing they learn is that they should never kill a mockingbird because those birds are just there to make people happy and they never do anything wrong at all. In the second half the children learn more about their father's trial defending a Negro being tried for rape. This man Tom Robinson is going against the lowlife Mr. Ewell who says Tom raped his daughter. The citizens are against Tom for the most part except for a handful. In the courtroom Atticus makes his case so strong that Scout, Jem, and Dill(who are watching)think that he cannot lose. However it is a white man's word against a black man's... The rest you have to read for yourself because from the trial it grows into such an exciting climax, and ends so meaningfully, pretaining to why you should never kill a mockingbird. Definitely think about this quote reading the book, it helps your understanding a lot. I found I couldn't put it down. The beginning goes slow but it forshadows things to come. You think how unfair and unpleasant life can be sometimes and these children learn this at a very young age. It made me want to change thingsso it couldn't happen anymore, and it made me very angry at such unfairness, such as in the lives of African-Americans, like the innocent Tom Robinson. The ending was so perfectly lead to and meaningful that I had to go back and read it again(and again)! I recommend the book for people 14 and up because I feel you should be old and smart enough to grasp the conflicts and the complex plot. However this book is timeless and everyone above 14 should read it at least once in a lifetime. This can teach you about life and growing up better than anything you will ever read so pick it up...soon."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mocking Bird This unforgettable classic by Harper Lee features a little girl around nine whom throughout this book matures and develops in significant ways. She learns all about prejudiced people through the town's folk when a young black man is accused of raping a young white woman. No matter how innocent the boy who is accused of rape is, the people of the town are so prejudiced that they will not listen. They believe that just because this young man is black, he is guilty beyond a doubt. The reader will also cross some details such as a better understanding of life in general. Scout learns not only by her teacher, or father, but by her brother, town's people, and especially Boo Radley that one must understand something to criticize it. Scout Finch is put into a position of major responsibility in these depressed times in southern Alabama. This book traces her ongoing development in what really is an incredible charge.When Scout Finch first hears about Tom Robinson and the crime he committed, she believes he should be prosecuted for his actions. What she later found out was that her father was defending the man she had so wrongly judged. Predigest was a word that Scout Finch had not ever heard, nor had she felt guilt's for feeling what she did not know was wrong. She was, weather she consciously know it or not, guilty of being prejudiced against black people. When kids at her school called her the daughter of a &quot;Niger Protector&quot; she went home and questioned her father on the matter. Her father being so unprejudiced said&quot; don't use that word, its not right&quot; and that &quot;all people are equal and should not be judged by the color of their skin.&quot; He was very serious on the matter and made it very clear that he hoped Scout would be to. &quot;No matter what anybody says to you, don't let them get your goat.&quot; From this aspect of the book, The author shows how Scout Finch was just starting to understand the use of race, and prejudiced amount people.When Scout Finch and her brother had to go to a black church due to absence of her father, she is greeted with a surprising welcome. &quot;What you doing bringing white chillin into a Niger church?&quot; One person, Lula, found it very distasteful to bring white children, into a black church. Now most of these people where not insulted to see that Calpurnia had done this, one man even stood up to welcome them. These people, who have been mistreated, insulted, wrongly judged, and over all disliked just because they are black, welcome the children in with no hatred in there mind. The reverend of this church was very friendly to the Finch children and treated them as if they were regular common black children. This is just one incident of how these so wrongly treated people could be so warm to the wrong doers."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mocking bird is one of the most interesting novel I ever read.

Written by Harper Lee, who attended Huntington College, University of Alabama, and also spent a year as an exchange student at Oxford University in England, this is her only published novel. This book was published by J.B. Lippincott in 1960 and consists of 323 pages. \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and made into a major motion picture.The setting takes place in a ficticious town named Maycomb, Alabama from 1933 to 1935. The main character and also the narrorator of the story is a young girl named Jean Louise Finch, but everyone calls her Scout. She is telling the story as an adult, but about her childhood. Another main character in the story is Scout's older brother, Jeremy Finch, Jem for short. Atticus is the father of Scout and Jem, an attorney, and Maycomb's state legislative representative. Then there is Dill, a boy who comes to stay with his aunt, the Finch's neighbor Miss Rachel, every summer.The plot of the story is that Atticus agrees to defend a black man named Tom Robinson, accused of raping nineteen year old Mayella Ewell, which causes Scout and Jem to be tormented at school because people think their father is disgracing the town. Another part to the plot is that Jem, Dill, and Scout are constantly trying to get Arthur (Boo) Radley to come out of his house. The story was that Boo got into alot of trouble when he was a teenager, and he hadn't come outside since because his father kept him locked up.The climax is when Bob Ewell, Mayella Ewell's father, tries to hurt Jem and Scout in the field behind their school Halloween night, but Boo Radley comes out and saves them, killing Bob in the process. Later, the town sherriff, Mr.Tate, states that while attacking the children, Bob Ewell stumbled into his own knife, accidently stabbing himself in the soft spot between his ribs. Mr. Tate does this to protect Arthur Radley. The theme of \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is social class. I believe this is the theme because in the story it talks about how the people of Maycomb County despise the Ewells and the way they lived, and the Ewells despised colored people. But yet in court, a colored man had never been found not guilty against a white man, and that wasn't about to change.This book is an amazing book because it shows very strong opinions and veiws on racism. It is a book with very strong vocabulary, which makes it a great book for any high school or college student."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"12/19/06To Kill a Mockingbird Book ReviewIntro: I believe this book gives you a direct feeling of what the segregation andthe society was in Alabama in the 1930's. I author gives you the story through theperspective of a young girl.Setting: The book takes place in southern Alabama in Maycomb County whereeverybody knows everybody. The people of the town are all white and the blackslive outside the town. The town is very small with not a lot of wealthy people.Theme: The theme To Kill a Mockingbird, is represented in the Character TomRobinson because Mockingbirds are innocent like Tom Robinson. In the townof all whites in the 1930's being black was almost a crime itself.Characters: Tom Robinson, Mr. Ewell, Dill, Scout, Jem, Atticus, Calpurnia,Nathan Radley and Boo Radley, and Miss. Maudie and the Main Characters of thestory. Tom Robinson was a black man accused of rape by Mayella Ewell sentto jail then got murdered in jail for a crime he didn't commit in the first place.Plot: Character Mayella Ewell was a very young girl that didn't get muchattention from the people of the town except from Tom Robinson, whohelped her with things around the house. The two kept on seeing eachother until one day she came onto Tom Robinson, but Tom was a marriedman so he wouldn't dare cheat on his wife. However, when he resist shescreamed and accused Tom of rape and sent him through a ridiculous trialwhich sent him to jail where his was later murdered.Conclusion/ Recommendation: After the trail people went back to their oldways Atticus was the State Legislature, Mr. Ewell still was harassingblack people, and Boo Radley still kept to himself. I recommend this book foranybody all ages."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is the best book I ever read and why I said this is because the author, Harper Lee, simply describe every scene with descriptive languages. Harper Lee described the environment of those people inside the story during the Great Depression. Harper Lee simply used her ideas and descriptive languages to show us how does those children at that time having fun by themselves and finding out who is Boo Radely.The story begins with one of the main character, Scout which is also the narrator, showing a flashback of what happened before her brother Jem's arm was broken. Scout, Jem, and their friend Dill met many funny and nervous events and also telling us about their adventure of finding out who is Boo Radely. That also witnesses about the court scene where Atticus, which is Scout and Jem's father, helping Tom Robinson who is being accused from raping a girl.This book is really interesting because it describe about how the kids during that time think and do and their attitude facing everything. While your reading the story you will feel like your also one of the character which is really fun. So I strongly recommended this book to everyone since it is interesting and the events happening inside is nervous and exciting."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is one of the great contemporary books. It is one of the very few books that can be read at any age or stage of life. Many relationships, stereotypes, attitudes, personalities are presented in a simple straightforward manner. This book makes you think."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Books I consider exemplary have a few qualities: straightforward but engaging narration, likable characters, and a plot which examines &quot;issues&quot; without becoming strained in doing so. To Kill a Mockingbird possesses each of these qualities. What makes it especially outstanding is the point of view and what is left unsaid. One main driver of the plot is an incident which we never witness and only learn of through some testimony. One of the main characters in relation to the plot we spend a scant few pages with--we never really know him in order to sympathize with him as a character. And another main character, Atticus, though extraordinarily quiet, maintains a powerful presence reminiscent of Howard Roark in Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead.The simplicity and one-sided nature of the trial can be considered a shortcoming, but they actually make the novel's point that much more powerful. It's believable that the jury would find Tom guilty despite his obvious innocence, and this emphasizes how much man can be cruelly unfair to his neighbor. The ending does seem a bit strained as Atticus somehow is unable to see who killed whom when his children were attacked, but this is a very minor flaw.Overall To Kill a Mockingbird tells a powerful, emotional tale with the easy childhood innocence of its narrator. It makes the reader feel tremendously guilty, seeing what we as a society could be vs. what we unfortunately are. If we interpret this not as an accusation by Lee but rather as an inspiration then maybe we can improve things a bit."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is about the lives and youth of Atticus Finch's two children, Scout and Jem. In a small southern town built on typical social classes and seperated by race, Atticus, a lawyer, is able to step over the line and defend a negro. It raises many questions and shows the ignorance of the people that are racist, and shows that they don't even realize there is anything wrong with their racism. Although it has been a while since I read the book, many parts of the book still stick out in my mind. In particular, where the south is described as &quot;still fighting the Civil War.&quot; Those are words that are true still today, with the recent controversy of the confederate flag. Another is the criticism of Hitler and his views of anti-semitism by a school teacher. However, the school teacher is prejudiced towards blacks. Although the book has many good points, I dislike many of the sub-plots and the stories that happen in the lives of Scout and Jem, as the story is narrated by Scout and often shows her childlike ways. I also feel the book isn't as critical of racisim as it should be, preferring more to take things as they are and blame it for being in the south and because that is how many people are raised."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is Harper Lee's only novel. Since she was at one time friends with Truman Capote, many have thought that he had a hand in the authoring of this great book, but that's not so. Although Harper Lee has written other short stories, this prize winner came from her heart. A semi-autobiographical story set in the South and modeled after her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama. The movie was also wonderful, but this book will be one you'll never forget."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"You should read this book, I am not a reader at all and I loved this book. It is really good and is worth the small amount of time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, is a wonderful book that centers on a stage in a young girl's life, while, and at the same time analyzing the extent of racial bias in a small town. I think one of the rights of passage in life should be reading To Kill a Mockingbird. The themes, characters, and situations remain an indentation in my life, and they are respectively profound, believable, likeable, noble, enigmatic, detestable (in this last case, the Ewell family, of course) and, unfortunately, current. This novel is one of those unique readings that appeals to both young and old alike. That is simply because it defies the decomposing to which many contemporary writings give way and I think that is why I enjoyed it. After having read this classic at least Three times, I find something new each time. Some interesting plot device, characterization technique, theme, motive or symbol - that I had overlooked before. This, surely, is one of the signs of not merely a good novel, but great literature. I suppose this is one of those books that will endure for many years to come. It truly is a great part of American literature and will be a not only timeless but an ever-enduring classic. This is one of those books that you fall into \\"the trap\\" of thinking just because it is popular it is good. This book is a good book and its good to fall into the trap. Something about the story: This timeless classic is about Scout Finch and what she sees through her eyes during the story. Her brother Jem, her father Atticus, and she live together in Maycomb, a small county in Alabama out in the country. Their mother had died when Scout was only two years old. Across the street, Miss Atkinson lived who cared deeply about her flowers that she grew. Mrs. Dubhouse, an old lady who picked on everyone that passed her house, lived down the road. Two houses down from the Finches, the Radleys lived. Their house was old and their door was always closed to the world. Mr.Radley lived with his mysterious son. Mr. Radley would be seen now and then walking down the road to the town. He didn't speak much. His son, Arthur was rarely seen unless during the night. Rumor had it that 0h! he would watch people through their windows while they slept, and scratch on their screen doors. The children of Maycomb called him Boo. Dill, the nephew of Miss Atkinson came to Maycomb every summer to see his aunt. Dill became good friends with Scout and Jem. When Dill learned about Boo Radley he came up with the idea of making him come out. Together, Dill, Scout, and Jem have a lot of adventures trying to contact Boo. During the same time when they were having their exciting times together, Atticus was defending a black in court. At the time, Blacks were free, but they weren't considered equal to whites. Not everyone in Maycomb believed that Atticus should be doing this, but he held his head high and tried his best in the trial. With the feelings from the people that didn't think what Atticus was doing was right, and the longing for contact with Boo from the kids, it turns into a near death experience for Jem and Scout."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was assigned to read To Kill a Mockingbird in 8th grade.

At that time , there were a few aspects (about rape and racial prejudice) which I didn't really understand, having being brought up in a sheltered world in India.

As I grew up , I re-read the book several times and have never failed to be moved by it. I feel that it is a story which transcends barriers of language and society, like all great literature does. The recreation of the childhood world is wonderful-living in a different country and society, Scout and Jem's fantasies could still have been my own. Each time I read the book I'm impresssed by the accuracy with which the author has recreated the world of childhood- it is a world which all of us have inhabited at some time, but which tends to get buried ubder the moss of years until a book like this comes along. The racial prejudice and the irrationality exhibited by apparently &quot;solid citizens&quot; is something which keeps cropping up again and again in different forms in every society -another reason why I feel the book is so universal. But ultimately, what has made this book one of my all time favourites is that it re-affirms one's faith in humanity -the unswerving courage shown by Atticus (and perhaps Boo Radley too though in a different context), the simple goodness of ordinary folk like the Judge, Sheriff, and Cal, and the spirited idealism of the children, all remind one that there is light amidst the wilderness.All in all a funny, moving, poignant,sensitive,wonderful book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was permitted to read this book at the age of 13. I have continued to reread it about every three years. I am now 47. This is a wonderful journey into childhood and a way of life that is all but gone. It is also a tale about injustice, ignorance, and prejudice and the courage of one man attempting to overcome them. I believe it is a must read for high school students and or college students. I cannot recommend this book too highly. The movie is also a must see, one of few that sticks very close to to the book. Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus is perfect as well of those of Jem, Scout and Dill. And Robert Duvall as Boo Radley is memorable. To Kill A Mocking Bird is one of the finest works I have ever read. Read it with a book discussion group at your local library. It is a true classic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I am so glad my English teacher made us read this novel! So far, it is my all time favorite. It really makes you think about judging people from their outward appearance. An excellent novel!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Regardless of how American race relations fluctuate, this book still carries a fresh and sobering message about the price of bigotry. Lee's view of the world through the eyes of children is especially effective in making the point, and her classic should be read and discussed in schools throughout the United States.John Frye"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"An English teacher of mine once said: &quot;I've never read To Kill a Mockingbird. I've only heard it. I open the book, and Scout speaks to me.&quot; That pretty much sums it up. It's an accurate portrayel of that time, that place, from the lack of snow to the nutty happiness-hating Christians, and yes, to the racism exhibited by many townsfolk. I don't understand the people who are offended by this - not only is it appropriate for those people, but the negative portrayel of southern whites as racist baboons and idiots (case in point: the Ewells) is far more &quot;degrading&quot; than a few uses of the n-word by characters for whom it's appropriate."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Recommendations and praises about this book from other people were what made me pick up 'To Kill A Mockingbird' and start reading it. Although it was quite difficult to get into the story on the first chapter the rest of the plot proceeded smoothly enough. The characters were likeable, and the storyline plausible. Harper Lee had put much care in the narrative to make it sound as if an actual child was speaking from her own thoughts and experience, adopting the simple, honest style of writing throughout the novel. All in all, this book is definitely not bad. However, beware if you're seeking something more than a 'nice' piece of writing silently - and 'nicely' - reprimanding us about racial indiscrimination. This novel might be welcomed by those who come from the southern states and badly want a quiet, pleasant walk down the Memory Lane seeking their childhood again. But it is not, mind you, for others who expect it to be something more thrilling or 'unputdownable' li! ke I did. The book simply lacks a deep emotional or intellectual impact upon the mind. It is what it is - a nice, tastefully bland novel."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is quite possibly the best book I have ever read. The story follows the coming-of-age of Scout and Jim, a sister and brother who are raised by their father in the south. Their father, a lawyer, is given the task of defending a black man accused of raping a white girl. Through this trial and their own adventures, the children learn about prejudice and misunderstanding.Because the story is told from Scout's point-of-view, the reader can see the prejudice from a child's perspective. This very effective tactic makes the prejudices seem more apparent and less logical. Furthermore, Lee makes her point without being preachy. The numerous lessons in this book should make it required reading for everyone."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was first assigned this book in high school and I really enjoyed it. I recently read it again, and listened to the unabridged book on tape. I laughed, cried, and thouroughly enjoyed every minute of this book. The way Ms. Lee tells the story, from Scout's point of view is amazing. Even though the story is told in retrospect Ms. Lee maintains Scout's innocence in the way she looks at things and understands them. This book should be required reading for every student, and you should read it at least twice to really gain a full appreciation of all it contains. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"ANYTHING BUT!!!! When my English teacher assigned this book, I thought, &quot;My gosh, could anyone pick a dumber-sounding book?&quot;. I was wrong. Dead wrong. The depth that Harper Lee gave her characters was unfathomable. They seemed so real. As if you could go down south, and visit everyone in Maycomb County. I enjoyed the book so much, that I bought my own copy, and read it twice over. The only people that were in my class that didn't like it were the shallow ones, who didn't take the time to realize that there was more to life than the next fad TV show. There were 20 people in that class. All skeptical. 18 loved it. The other two...... All the characters are forever etched in my mind, from cantankerous old Mrs. Dubose, to shy and reserved Boo Radely. Anyone with an appreciation for literature will surely adore this book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is one thing. A Masterpiece. You can give it all the wonderful names but those names add up to one thing. A Masterpiece. Many people ask me why I think it is such a Masterpiece. They laugh at the books title. my response to them is always don't judge a book by it's cover, (or in this case it's title). This is a powerful book that uses such subjects that make our hearts stop beating. In this book, I feel like I'm part of the story. How many books can you say this about? All together, It is truly one of the most prized pieces of literture in American history!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mocking Bird This unforgettable classic by Harper Lee features a little girl around nine whom throughout this book matures and develops in significant ways. She learns all about prejudiced people through the town's folk when a young black man is accused of raping a young white woman. No matter how innocent the boy who is accused of rape is, the people of the town are so prejudiced that they will not listen. They believe that just because this young man is black, he is guilty beyond a doubt. The reader will also cross some details such as a better understanding of life in general. Scout learns not only by her teacher, or father, but by her brother, town's people, and especially Boo Radley that one must understand something to criticize it. Scout Finch is put into a position of major responsibility in these depressed times in southern Alabama. This book traces her ongoing development in what really is an incredible charge.When Scout Finch first hears about Tom Robinson and the crime he committed, she believes he should be prosecuted for his actions. What she later found out was that her father was defending the man she had so wrongly judged. Predigest was a word that Scout Finch had not ever heard, nor had she felt guilt's for feeling what she did not know was wrong. She was, weather she consciously know it or not, guilty of being prejudiced against black people. When kids at her school called her the daughter of a &quot;Nigger Protector&quot; she went home and questioned her father on the matter. Her father being so unprejudiced said&quot; don't use that word, its not right&quot; and that &quot;all people are equal and should not be judged by the color of their skin.&quot; He was very serious on the matter and made it very clear that he hoped Scout would be to. &quot;No matter what anybody says to you, don't let them get your goat.&quot; From this aspect of the book, The author shows how Scout Finch was just starting to understand the use of race, and prejudiced amount people.When Scout Finch and her brother had to go to a black church due to absence of her father, she is greeted with a surprising welcome. &quot;What you doing bringin white chillin into a Nigger church?&quot; One person, Lula, found it very distasteful to bring white children, into a black church. Now most of these people where not insulted to see that Calpurnia had done this, one man even stood up to welcome them. These people, who have been mistreated, insulted, wrongly judged, and over all disliked just because they are black, welcome the children in with no hatred in there mind. The reverend of this church was very friendly to the Finch children and treated them as if they were regular common black children. This is just one incident of how these so wrongly treated people could be so warm to the wrong doers."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"*I loved Harper Lee's &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird.&quot; It starts as a flashback, as told through the eyes a sweet girl nicknamed &quot;Scout.&quot; *Through most of the story, it seems like the book is going to be based on the life of the creepy neighbor that Scout, her brother Jem, and their friend Dill try to get out of seclusion. The mysterious Arthur &quot;Boo&quot; Radley, seems to be the focus of the story early on, but later, a new topic shows the point. *The ideal father, Atticus, seems to be the only man in Maycomb County willing to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman. This is very important because the story takes place in the deep South during the Depression. The trial helps the kids (especially Jem) realize that even the town they've lived in all their life, is not as it seems. *My favorite quotes come from Sheriff Heck Tate and Scout, the two quotes are unrelated, and won't make sense until the whole story has been read. Tate says, &quot;...there's just some kind of men you have to shoot before you can say hidy to 'em. Even then they ain't worth the bullet it takes to shoot 'em.&quot; Scout says, &quot;Mr. Tate was right...it'd be sort of like shootin' a mockingbird, wouldn't it?&quot; The quotes alone are enough to read the book, and I know that once you start reading it, you won't be able to put it down; I know I couldn't."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I would not be engaging in hyperbole when I say that To Kill A Mockingbird was the single most important book I've read in my life. I am 35 now, and I read the book at 13 years of age. Although a voracious reader long before 13, this book was the first piece of true Literature which I had the pleasure of devouring. It showed me how great literature, great *art*, could transcend the mundane and resonate in the soul ages after reading its final words. With this book my love of literature kicked into hyperdrive, and I'd have to say that if not for To Kill A Mockingbird I would not have gone on to major in Literature in college. It still remains a favorite that I re-read every few years. As an aside, I might add that the movie version was one of the most thoughtful, true-to-the-spirit-of-the-original-work adaptations that I have ever seen on the big screen (or the small screen, for that matter). I can only hope that this book will continue to be taught in our schools for generations to come."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"No question why this book is a classic. It is amazing and should be read by every American. This is particularly important for southerners."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book for my English class and looking at the cover I thought it might be a pretty okay story but I was definitely wrong! From the very first chapter I was captured by Lee's captivating and mysterious characters. Boo Radley, the classic camp-fire story character, reminded me of the stories I used to hear about monsters in the woods that were located near my house from the way he was portrayed as this secluded person with a strange and twisted history. The end of the story was far from what I expected because of all the plot twists. Scout, the little tomboy narrator of the story, provided the intriguing perspective of a 6-year old girl instead of the usual teen or adult point of view like in other novels. Looking through her eyes at the trial between Tom Robinson and Bob Ewell, I believe, may have let some parents who have read the story know that kids may be kids but they can still see and understand that something bad is going on. Overall I think that this is an outstanding book that everyone should read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Sissy Spacek does a masterful job of reading this American literature classic. Harper Lee's novel is clearly one of the best of the 20th century and Sissy Spacek's audio performance is worthy of such a classic. An absolute delight."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Some books so fluidly transcend the stories they contain that the characters and setting almost become incidental to the universal themes they express without contrivance. Such a book exists in Harper Lee's masterful 1960 novel, one of the most revered pieces of fiction this country has ever produced. Set in rural, Depression-era Alabama, it is a classic coming-of-age story about a precocious nine-year old tomboy named Scout. What she experiences is palpable in the virulent racism surrounding the persecution of Tom Robinson, a black man unjustly accused of raping Mayella, the abused white daughter of an unrepentant bigot, Bob Ewell. Representing Tom in court is Atticus Finch, Scout's father and the moral compass of the story.The plot moves toward a deepening exploration of the intractable conflict between tolerance and ignorance and how the pre-existing environment of hatred and mistrust makes innocent people guilty by pure circumstance. Scout embodies these themes within her own journey toward womanhood and her questions of what society expects of her. Through the travails of Tom and the town's outcast, Boo Radley, and primarily through her father's example, Scout recognizes how innate goodness can exist even in the direst circumstances. Likely because the story is semi-autobiographical, Lee is able to vividly capture the rural south and the pervasive mindset during the Depression with spellbinding accuracy. Yet for all that, the book's lasting legacy has more to do with Lee's particular lierary gift in bringing a genuine universality to her themes.Other characters weave in and out of the story - including Dill, Scout's wannabe boyfriend and the Truman Capote doppelganger - and each plays a key role in shaping the novel's core conflicts. I have to say that the author's particular literary strengths come to the fore in her empathetic depictions of the evolving relationships between these characters, for example, Scout and her father Atticus, Scout and her brother Jem, the children and Boo. Nothing seems extraneous in the story Lee tells, no small feat for a 336-page novel. She brings intense emotion to her prose, especially in describing the uncontrollable fury created by racial hatred and false accusations, for instance, in the lynch mob scene before the trial and in the vengeful attack on the children. The timing of the book's original 1960 publication turned out to be prescient, as the Civil Rights movement was just becoming national in scope thanks to the efforts of Martin Luther King and his brethren. Even if you have seen the masterful 1962 film, you owe it to yourself to read Lee's literary masterwork and sadly the only novel she ever wrote."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Even though written in the 1960s, this book is timeless.

It is an act of quiet desperation in the face of overwhelming injustice, prejudice, racism and bigotry. It is all they can give to him but it speaks volumes. I share the novel each year with my 10th grade students and each year, they say, \\"I love this book\\". I am honored to be in the presence of students who perhaps for the first time in their lives \\"feel\\" the injustice and prejudice that far too many prople have been subjected to for numerous reasons. I also love the evolving maturity and love in the unusual Finch family. I see the family representing many feel ings that are unspoken in my students' eyes.

It's one of those books that when you start reading it, you don't want to stop until you finish.This book takes place in Maycomb, Alabama in 1932 during the depression. It's about a girl named Scout and her brother Jem. They live with their dad Atticus. Atticus is a lawyer who is raising his two kids because he's wife passed away when scout was two. Atticus is a lawyer for a black innocent men being accused of a crime they did't commit. Tom Robinson is one of the main characters in this book, he's being accused of raping a young women, but really her dad was the one who beat her because he say her with Tom Robinson trying to kiss him. Even though there was strong evidence that proved he didn't do it, there was no chance for him because it was an all white jury. In the end the jury convicted Tom Robinson and senteced him to life. When it was time to put him away he dcided to run for it. As he was running to get away a police officer shot him in the bak and killed him. Atticus never won a case and they were all innocent, but he was the only one who could keep a jury in the deliberation room for that long, which was a tiny step closer to endind racism in the court when it came to innocent people.

I just started analyzing this book with my high school english class about a month ago. we havent even finished going over the whole thing yet. But, I have never had one thing teach me so much about being a good person. This story, about two small children Jem Finch and Scout Finch living in the judgemental town of Maycomb in Alabama shows us how dangerous a thing racism is, how judging a person by someone elses opinion can turn an innocent man into a recluse and what it means to be a good christian and parent. These people of Maycomb County called themselves Christian when they were living a lie to god, other people and themselves. The setting takes place during the great depression when people had no jobs but to gossip about other people. An example of this is the neighborhood recluse Boo Radley. Many people started saying bad things about him and his past that most of the town was believing a lie, that he was a criminal. Because of this, Boo decides to stay away from people. Harper Lee decides to show the reader how bad people and lies are, and she refers to Boo as a mockingbird, which is an animal that does not bother anyone and is reclusive. The people go on asking themselves why Boo is reclusive when they are the reasons. Another example of people living a lie is the law case of a black man Tom Robinson. He is wrongly accused of raping a girl.The whole town knows who the real raper is , but they continue to lie to themselves that the black man is the wrong-doer.In the middle of this is Atticus Finch, the father of Jem and Scout. He is the only one who brings up his children the right way, which is how he lives his life. Just think for yourself. Maycomb County believes in the lie of racism and that it is the right thing to believe in only because that is how they were taught. But, Atticus is different. He is introspective like his children and his children like ! him. His parents and probably told him that he should judge a person on the color of their skin, but he thought it out realized that racism is the sin. People may not have agreed with him and some of these people tried to kill him for his beliefs. But, Atticus had what not many people had and what his children picked up from him, this was courage. He decided to stick up for what he believed in. Atticus is the ideal Man-of-god, the ideal parent and the ideal person. Harper Lee probably used his character in this book, hoping to teach her readers how to be an Atticus Finch, Jem Finch, or a Scout. The moral of this book is to think about what you are taught and think for yourself and stick up for what you think is right. Infact, you dont have to read this masterpiece because I gave you reasons to, but because it is your duty to. After all, what do I know, I am just fifteen and this is maybe my favorite book yet and there are probably many more greater books than this one. What I do know is that this book made me like to read and To Kill A Mockingird makes me want to be a better person and keep on searching for those greater books."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I believe that To Kill A Mockingbird is the single most important novel a person can read in their life.

The story has two different plots. The first story is about Jem and Scout growing up in the 1930's. The story is being told by Scout, whose real name is Jean Louis Finch. Scout is a tomboy but very well educated. Scout lives with her brother, father, and black cook whose name is Calpurnia.The second plot is about Scout's father who is a lawyer in Macomb, Alabama and is from a well-respected local family. He had to raise his children alone and has taught them a strong sense of morality and fair play. During the 1930's there were great problems between the races, and he was one of the few commited to getting equality for both blacks and whites. He agrees to defend a black man charged with rape, exposing himself and his family to anger from the white community. A big part of the story focuses on the prejudices between African -Americans and the Whites in the southern states of the U.S.A.Scout remembers this summer in 1930 and tells it to us in the eyes of a child. She not only talks about the views of the white community, but also talks about the black community and gives important details of thier lives.This is a great book for all ages."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird makes it&#65533;s mark mostly through illustrating small southern life in Alabama and exposing the reader to the prejudices that pervade not only the 1930s but the times we live in. The story is told through the eyes of Jean Louise Finch (also known as &#65533;Scout&#65533;), and, as a child of only eight, she shares (in looking back) her ideas of family life and the rich history of Maycomb.Harper Lee&#65533;s depiction of 1930s South racial prejudice is a powerful one. Atticus Finch is clearly the hero of the novel, defending a black man on trial for raping a white woman. A widowed father, he teaches Jem (his son) and Scout lessons in life, one of the most paramount being to &#65533;walk in another&#65533;s shoes&#65533; to understand life from their viewpoint. Jem and Scout take many of these lessons in stride and try to impress upon themselves being civilized and respectful all of society.Another aspect of the novel is the mystery surrounding Boo Radley and his spooky house. Boo Radley represents all the bad rumors of the Maycomb community, and yet, most of these are unjustifiable. Scout, Jem and their friend Dill are obsessed with discovering exactly who Boo is.Although the novel is primarily small town in nature, the themes encompass everything we deal with today as a society, namely discrimination and prejudice. Through the trial of Tom Robinson, we see Atticus worthy of great respect for standing up to the ideas of a narrowed-minded community. The Finch family also must deal with the man whose daughter is the alleged victim in the case, Bob Ewell. (Bob Ewell represents the ignorance of a small town).Perhaps what makes the book timeless is not only its theme in the general sense, but the final speech by Atticus during the closing arguments. This oration is built up over a long trial, and it is worthy of the time it takes to get there. (Although, I think Gregory Peck made this scene come to life more in the movie).A reader may frown at the many tidbits of detail given to establishing the Southern way of life, especially in the initial chapters, but the book progresses to a point where the reader wants to know the fate of Tom Robinson, Atticus and the rest of the Finches. This book is a classic because it delves into modern topics, a central issues that certainly we all must come to terms with: discrimination and lack of equality."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I can't believe that I never read this in high school. Then again, I don't think that the people in my Alabama hometown have changed their mind much about black people since the 1930s when this book was set. The parents of my classmates would have wanted to censor this book for its cuss words and references to sex. Small town Alabama has changed a lot since this book was written in many ways but not at all in others. To quote from the book: \\"You're not gonna change any of them by talkin' right, they've got to want to learn themselves, and when they don't want to learn there's nothing you can do but keep your mouth shut or talk their language.\\" My personal choice was to keep my mouth shut and to get out of there!Harper Lee paints a portrait of small town Alabama with its varying social classes. Below even the class that lives on the outskirts of the city dump is the class of the black people in the town. To Kill A Mockingbird is a story told from the viewpoint of children who had not been tainted with this social phobia and who had learned from their father, Aticus, to view each of these groups equally. Still, their curiosity about these different groups lead them beyond their own imaginations into the real world as they encounter people from each of these social classes. They invite a boy home for lunch who has no lunch of his own, they visit a black church with their housekeeper when their father is away on business, and they try to make contact with the next door neighbor who hasn't been seen for 20 years.Then the children are unexpectedly plunged into world of intolerance where the town's adults live when a black man is accused of a crime he didn't commit. Their father is appointed as the black man's lawyer and the children hide in the balcony to witness the trial first-hand. They are shocked and dismayed by the townspeople's inability to see past the man's skin color to aquit him for his alleged crime. In response to the children's reaction, their black housekeeper says, \\"They've done it before and they'll do it again and when they do it -- seems that only the children weep.\\" How amazingly profound!What a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee was intriguing to my soul. I have never felt such great leaps of passion towards a book. In this Novel I found myself almost crying, surprised, laughing and in complete awe at the end. At first, I picked this book thinking it was just another boring English novel, I was mistaken. Harper Lee has proven to America and the world that great litature exists. It taught me many lessons about life such as the horrors of discrimination and standing up for what's right. Harper Lee writes through a 6-year-old girl and in first person. The action behind scout's tale is her father's determination as a lawyer and a liberal to defend a black man accused of raping a white girl, although he did not do it. The books' setting is in a realistic racist and segregated town in Alabama in the 1930's. The author does a wonderful job making each character distinct and different. This book brings to surface the idea of how unfair and cruel society can be and how racism can affect so many lives, in ways we cannot imagine. The reader gets to see how the family grows both together and apart and also how it copes with its day-to-day lives. The Novel deals with such issues as racism, neighborhood togetherness and the bonds that either grow or are lost between parents and children. I am proud to say that this is my favorite book. This novel is a must for all growing children."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee was intriguing to my soul.

While this too could have been done in a way that makes the reader go through a turmoil of emotions so strong that getting through the book is difficult, Harper Lee softens it without taking away any of the facts.The book tells of the world through a child unaffected by adult prejudices yet having to face them, and of a man, her father, who dares to live the way he believes is right: to be the same on the street as he would be in his own house. With nothing to hide, always straight, always true.The book makes you think, and learn and realise--like a book ought to do."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel that was written in 1960 by Harper Lee about Jem and Scout Finch growing up in Maycomb County, Alabama. Their father, Atticus, is a well-respected lawyer who is assigned to the case of Tom Robinson. Tom Robinson is an African-American man who is unjustly charged with committing a crime against Mayella Ewell, a white woman. Although Tom Robinson's case is predictably lost because of the racial and prejudicial beliefs that existed at the time, Atticus feels obligated to accept Tom Robinson's case. Atticus Finch is a strong person who is well ahead of the times, who believes in Tom and who wishes to help him as much as possible. He also wants to set an example to his children against the prejudicial beliefs that they are growing up around. Besides Atticus, Jem and Scout, there are many other important characters in the book, especially as it progresses.As the book advances, the characters change. They evolve, become more or less important, and fall in and out of the story. For example, in the first part of the book, Miss Caroline is one of the main characters. She is Scout's first grade teacher, and it is in her classroom that Scout faces the first injustice done to her. Dill, who spends summers with his aunt, Rachel Haverford, in Maycomb, is also an important character in the first part of the book. He plays an important role in being a friend to Jem and Scout and brings out more information about Boo Radley. On the other hand, Boo Radley does not play an important role consistently throughout the book. In the beginning, he leaves gifts for the Finch children. After he can no longer do that, he is not heard from until the resolution of the novel, when he saves their life. Miss Maudie, the Finch's neighbor, is important through out the book. She is always around the help the children and shares her wisdom. Calpurnia, the black woman who works at the Finch's household, is also important throughout the book. She serves as a good example of the African-American community to the children. Another member of the household is Aunt Alexandra, Atticus Finch's sister. In the midst of the main conflict, she moves to Maycomb to live with her brother's family. At first there are many conflicts, but soon Aunt Alexandra is loved as part of the family in her own way. She is supportive of her brother, Atticus, even when she disagrees with him about the Robinson case. Atticus's client, Tom Robinson, is very important to the plot of the story, although he is not the main character. When the conflict is examined, he is the main protagonist. The Ewell family is in the story more than Tom, although they are featured as the antagonists. Other characters are Judge Taylor, who presides over Tom Robinson's case, Heck Tate, the county sheriff, Mr. Underwood, owner of The Maycomb Tribune, and Mrs. Dubose, an elderly neighbor.Although this book was published in 1960, it is set in the 1930s in Maycomb County, Alabama. It is a town that is full of southern pride, where everyone knows everyone else, where rarely does someone leave, and where judgments are formed about people from their last name. Because each family has a position in the county, and each person in that family just follows in the way their ancestors lived and behaved. Each class just keeps to themselves. It would seem like the town was divided into the townspeople, the Negroes, the country folk, and the people who live in trash despite their skin color. This story could happen anywhere, but the setting definitely accelerated the pace and depth of the plot.The author's purpose was to write a novel that explored the issue of prejudice in a way that everyone can feel and relate to. By writing through the eyes of a young girl from ages six to eight, it allows readers to look at complex, controversial issues in a simple, innocent way. Scout asks simple questions such as \\"Why? Why does this happen? Why is this going on?\\" Harper Lee makes the reader feel angry at the twisted prejudice that existed for so long. I think that the author accomplished her purpose the instant her successful book was published and later won the Pulitzer Prize.I can understand why this book has become a classic piece of American literature. The book conveys many emotions and completely shows the injustice and desperate feelings of humanity. The first half of the book focuses on building the atmosphere of the town and of the Finches and other residents. You learn of the school, the neighbors, the opinions of the town, and become familiar with the important character's lives. Then, you are thrown into the midst of Tom Robinson's trial. The whole community must face their personal prejudices and angry feelings of injustice and helplessness. You can see how the behavior of others affects the feelings and opinions of a person. I think that this is an important book that still holds a lot of meaning."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"As long as prejudice and injustice exist, the commentary in \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" will remain relevant and a tool by which we might be able to mend. Author Harper Lee, who earned a richly deserved Pulitzer Prize for literature, once said she never thought of her novel as nothing more than a love story of a widowed father for his two children. The novel is so much more. Intentionally or not, it is a searing indictment of the individual and institutional racism as seen through the eyes of southern lawyer Atticus Finch's daughter, Scout. Written in the innocent words of a child, we see unfolding a white woman's fabricated cry of rape against a black man and the cursory trial trial in which, considering it's the South and a black man is on trial for a crmie against a white victim, the proceedings are little less than perfunctory. As defense counsel, Scout's father endures the disdain of the white community in his lazy southern town. The fate of the defendant, predictable in the then-racist South, is no less heartbreaking and, at the same time, outrageous. Along with racism, the novel touches on people not fully understood, and the character of Boo Radley serves the point masterfully. An American classic in every sense of the word, \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is a moving experience that, if we read closely enough, compels us to look beyond the prejudices and discrimination in our own hearts. It is a stunning masterpiece, and anyone who's felt a pang of discrimination ought to be required to read this one."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is told through the eyes of an 8 year-old Southern girl from Maycomb, Alabama; Scout Finch. The story begins one summer in the 1930s with Scout and her brother, Jem, leading a normal childhood full of play, mischief and wonderment over their mysterious and scary next door neighbor Boo Radley. The children have never seen Boo Radley but have heard stories and rumors of his life of solitude locked up in his large, dark and scary house on the corner. This is also the summer that Dill comes into the children's lives. To amuse themselves, Scout, Jem and Dill put on plays to mimic what they think Boo's life is like and try to entice Boo to come outside so they can see him. These chapters are full of child's play, innocence and fun.Meanwhile, during the children's innocent play, the racism and violence in this small southern town is brewing because a black man, Tom Robinson, has been accused of raping a white woman. This tragedy seeps into the chilren's innocence when thier father, Atticus, is appointed to represent Tom Robinson.Harper Lee's description of the Tom Robison's trial are riveting, nail-biting and very exciting.There are many sub-plots along the way and the author does a wonderful job of tying them to all together for the novel's rising climax and ending.To Kill a Mockingbird is an excellent look into the racial injustice that played a major part in America's history.

The book was fiction even though it probably happened in real life. I think the theme is courage because Atticus really showed it when he defended Tom Robinsin.

I disagree with discrimination. I think it it cruel to to that to people. I think the book suggests to know people before you judge them. I learned so mant things from this book.

There are some funny moments and some very sad moments. Harper Lee writes the characters so well, it's like you know them. In every neighborhood, you have the mean old lady whose house you hate to walk by (Mrs. Dubose) and the character no-one really knows, they never leave their home and speculation arises as to their activities (Boo Radley). I'd have to say my favorite character is Atticus. He does his best raising his two children after his wife dies at a young age. He tells his kids the truth and doesn't sugar coat things for them. He talked to them like they were his equal, not below him as many parents do. He teaches his children that just because every one else says or does something that doesn't mean that it is ok. The best part is his closing argument at Tom Robinson's trial. Atticus was a kind and patient man.

If given the chance, I will probably read it again. :)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Every so often there comes the writer whose story telling is so vivid that it forms an indelible impression on the readers' mind. Harper Lee is just that kind of writer. I read this book many times and it gets better with each reading. IMHO, the real beauty of this book is that the author was able to talk about prejudice on two fronts- irrational fear towards Boo Radley from a child's point of view and that of the criminal trial. In both the cases, the real victims are the &quot;accused&quot; themselves. If you haven't read this book till now, please do take a few days to read it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is undoubtadly the best book of all time. I have read it several times. Though many people tend to think it doesn't mean any more than the actual words written on the pages, it does. Symbolism is key in this book, and people should really take the time to sit down and read it. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The first time I read this book was in 7th grade and I loved it. Now, a first year college student, I am reading it again. The story is so real, involving family and problems within. It talks about relationships between siblings and friends. But most of all, it talks about stuff that has happend in history. The way that blacks were treated and how their words didn't matter in a court room. Not only was the book excellent but the movie was great. With the movie you can see and feel the emotions that the characters where going through. I recomend that everyone should read this book at least once in their life. Also I believe that Middle and High School teachers should continue having this book as part of their studies."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The injustice in To Kill A Mockingbird is neither forgiving nor moral. Just because a person has a different skin color or look does not give anyone the right to accuse them of rape, or anything. Judge others fairly and moraly. To Kill A Mockingbird is a great book for one to read. I deeply enjoyed this book and I recommend this to mature people"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To tell everyone the truth, this book is the best book in the whole entire world. When I was told to read it in 7th grade, I looked at how big it was and I thought I was never going to be able to finish it. When I read the first page, it actually grabbed my attention. By the end of the chapter, I was so in tunned with it, that I didn't want to stop. Scout made me realize so many things in life. Actually, Scout kind of resembled me. I learned a lot about Africans and I think every english teacher should recommend this book for the students. I got a real kick out of the book. It was so hilarious, but then there were a lot of parts that actually made me want to cry, because it seemed so real. I know sometimes its hard to read a book because at first it seems so boring and too long but what i do is pretend im actually in the scene and thats how this book brought so much attention to me. I think this book is the greatest book ever written, because when i actually read it, it seemed like I was actually in it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"i first read this book in high school.

Read this book!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I first read this book during my third year of high school while still living in the Caribbean. It taught me many values which are now a part of my personality, and helps me to identify with what my people went through in the post war years.African Americans can enjoy this fine piece of literature."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I first picked up this book when I was babysiting for my neighbor. I started reading it and didn't put it down. To Kill A Mockingbird is easily a classic, portraying southern society in the '30's and the injustice that was often thrust upon blacks. The story is told through the eyes of a child, Scout. To Kill A Mockingbird tells the story of a horrendous crime (the supposed rape of a girl by a black man)and how it shocked a quiet southern town (Maycomb)."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I recently finished Harper Lee's remarkable novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, and I fell completely in love with it. This wonderful book really takes you deep into the truth of our human identity. It shows love, hatred, cruelty, and kindness all through the eyes of a child leaving you with many emotions and thoughts. Harper Lee's way of writing really attracted me. One thing I liked was that you are demanded to use your imagination. Not everything is written right out for you. You really have to think about what the character's appearance is, dream about what will happen next, etc. The ending is an example of this. It is not complete. It leaves you with many questions running through your head that only you can answer. I also enjoyed the way Harper Lee broke the book into two totally different ideas, with the same significance, and brought them into one at the end. I learned and understood many new aspects of life by reading this book. Harper Lee has a point to make and she does it very well. I would recommend it to anyone who is ready to sit down and really read a great book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"When I sat down to read &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; I thought I was in for another long, boring, reading assignment. On the contrary, I found myself so impressed by the novel I was soon reading it in my spare time. The childhood tale of 'how Jem broke his arm' intrigued me to the very end. My interest in the eerie neighbor, Boo Radly, soon gave way to the shocking Ewell trials. At the end, each detail came together in a clever ending. Strategic foreshadowing and vivid description, although not overdone, contributed to the novel's appeal."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is a candid testament of the trials and tribulations of growing up. I can honestly say that book has had a permanent effect on me, one I cannot forget. I feel the strongest aspect of this novel is it's realistic characters and detailed adventures. Atticus is a character that has such depth and sincerity it's amazing. Atticus is an excellent example of someone who is ahead of their time, he has an unbelievably large amount of love in his heart, and his children really are his life. He is very up front and honest with Jem and Scout, always treating them as equals. Atticus has no problem with defending a black man, something the town looks down on him for. Jem is a great example of a boy going through the average adolescent pains. And Scout, the stereotypical tomboy, is along for the ride. Scout however, is changing just as much, and has a lot of growth ahead of her. From the beginning of the book, I was drawn to the mystery and uncertainty of Boo Radely. The stories about him, became more and more interesting and forced me to consider who and what he was. As I reached deeper into the book, I found more and more to relate to. I know I am reading a good book, when as I am reading it I can see a movie in my head. It's an extraordinary feeling to see a book acting itself out. To Kill A Mockingbird has every element needed to make it a classic, but I recommend children of all ages to read it because of how unique it is. I have read other coming of age novels, and none compare to this literary masterpiece. It provides facts about the past and insight to the future. It's a book that anyone can relate to. I found myself witting down quotes from the book, because some of the things in it left me speechless. I found that so many things in this book remind me of my childhood. It lets you see the world from the objective of a child, something many people forget. With an emotional end, and a wonderful flowing of incidents, To Kill A Mockingbird gives everything anyone would need to know about Maccob County ,and the word itself. Possibly the greatest work I have ever laid eyes upon, I recommend this book for anyone, who has the patience for something different."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"You know what, I was about to put that book down and stop reading it. I heard so many people telling what a good book/movie it was so I was curious to find out why.The first half of the book was really dragging and sometimes seemed irrelevant and boring, but it totally turned around starting at chapter 17 (I know, a loooong way to go, but don't give up). I was amazed at how well it ended, though.I only give it 3 stars because of the slow-moving development of the plot. However, I still think it's worth reading."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mocking Bird by Harper Lee is not a bad book. I enjoyed the situations that took place and the events that happend in the book. I disagree though with the character choice, not necessarily the choices but who the narrator should have been. I dont believe that Scout would be able to remeber things like the problems that took place let alone being able to basically turn away a mob? At her age things like that are hard to beleive espceially her and jem and Dill sneaking around at night? Its hard to beleive children not even ten years of age could accomplish sneaking out like that and not getting caught is very hard to beleive im 16 and cant even sneak out like those characters. I'd like to see this book from an older adults view like Atticus or a black persons view like Calpurnia. Overall the book is quite enjoyable and I do recommend it to other peolpe my age and older, this is one book i may read more then once"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book was written by Truman Capote.

Like most people that hate it, I too was forced to read it for English class. I want to start by saying they shouldn't make us read books like this anyway. People can get the wrong idea about racism.

Ezekiel."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"But I think someone needs to hear both opinions. I read this book because I heard it was so good, a classic, etc. In fact, I was less than impressed. It was slow, and at certain parts I found myself wanting to skip ahead or even stop reading it. If you have any idea that this book is about racism and the unfairness of our courts, you will be dissapointed when you wait through half the book just to get to the five or six chapters dealing with the actual case. Most of this book is the story or Scout and her family, and doesn't make for what I call a gripping novel."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I bought the audible.com 50th anniversary edition, believing it was the actual book - it is actually interviews of praise for the book. I should have read more closely, but I feel like I was mislead."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is one of the quintessential \\"high school classics.\\" It appears classic and deep only to those who lack the art and intellect to grasp the shallowness of it. It seems like there is a lot there up until the point where you begin to understand it. Apparently, the vast majority of people never do. It is a shame really, but I suppose that is the way it is. So much time and energy poured into books which are simply bad.Sorry to ramble like this, but it verges on heart-breaking to see so many good reviews for a book that barely approaches passable. Its imagery is poor, its premise is shallow, and the attempt to \\"enlighten the human condition\\" is a flimsy pretense to draw out the phony intellectuals who cannot see 10 inches past their own lies long to see that agreeing with the crowd doesn't make you an intellectual. The problem lies in the fact that the book is a triumph of vagueness. It has a certain undefinable characteristic that many mistake for art, but which is, in fact, a simple lack of talent. The reason it is vague is not because there is a truth behind the words, but rather that there is a *story* behind the words that the author lacks the talent to draw out. A bad story, by the way. A rambling, pointlessly morose, insipid story lacking any value either in entertainment or art. Let us not even approach any further the lack of intellectual content, or otherwise I fear I may vomit.This book is, however, a certain kind of triumph. It is a triumph of marketing. It is a triumph in the manipulation of plebian minds yearning to appear, or perhaps be, more than they are.I beg of you, do not deride your own intelligences by attempting to force them to heights they are not capable of. If you cannot go beyond a certain point, do not do so. If books like this continue to sell in such immense quantities, I fear for the fate of all art."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I ordered this, thinking that a signed copy of the book was a true find.

I liked some of the characters, but not enough interesting things occured to keep my attention. I had to read many of the descriptive passages several times to gather their meaning, and the author lets the reader make many assumptions, which are not always correct. I've read a number of excellent classics, but I'm stumped how this could be considered one of them. I realize this is an unpopular opinion, but aside from a few isolated passages, I really didn't find this book to be very enjoyable."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I started reading this book because I heard so much about it. It sounded interesting - the south, racism, a murder trial. It seemed to have potential. The beginning was o.k... After 50 pages I started wondering where was the ground breaking story? why should I care about any of the characters? This book is so boring! Nothing is going on. Until you get to the trial piece, you have to go through pages and pages about Atticus's childrens' lives which have no relevance to the supposedly main idea - racism in the south. All those descriptions that are supposed to be annecdotes don't support or shed any light on the main plot and are frankly boring. Even the characters that had potential like Boo Radley or Atticus were poorly written. Does anyone have any idea why this book even won a Pulitzer?!?! If you want to read a really good book about life in the south why not &quot;the color purple&quot; or even &quot;A time to kill?&quot; this is not a masterpiece. I don't know how this bad book on such an important subject ever got published in the first place."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I'll just sart off that I had to read this book for my Sophmore year, and to me, it just didn't fit. I can't say that I hated the book, for I didn't mind some equally impressive parts, such as the court scene, and bits and parts of the ending. But I'll just say overall it just bored me. People who like it don't get angry at me, just stating my opinion of the book. I'm not putting the book harshly down, nor burning it. Actually I've read a few parts over, but that doesn't mean I truely like the whole thing. But Harper Lee's pros were he excelent use of language, and discriptive words. I'll give her credibility for that, but to me, the book didn't cut my top 100 list."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I thought this book was fairly dull reading, notwithstanding its \\"classic\\" status. Certainly it enunciates every desirable goody-goody piety - both those common to all decent people, and those especially desirable among late 20th century American liberals (Low Class Whites Bad, Low Class Blacks Good, Too Much Religion Hypocritical and Bad, that sort of thing). But I didn't enjoy it that much, and think Mr. Finch's high ethics are unfortunately matched by his mediocre skills- his supposedly withering cross-examination (consisting of about ten questions fired at a silent witness) was really an argument disguised as a cross-examination, the sort of thing that a good judge would not allow."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is the first and only book by the author Harper Lee. it is a work of fiction ut seems to be very realistic. it takes place in the early 1930s when there was lots of racism in the south. it teals the story of the trial of a black man acussed of raping a white girl. personnally i HATED this book! other people have regarded this book as a masterpeice of american literature but i find it horribly overrated and dumb. i dont really see why everyong loves it so much. it just tells a story of 3 dumb kids trying to get a freaky little guy named boo radley to leave his house for once. i donnt find it that great. if you like readig overated books, go for it. sorry but noo thanks. to kill a mockingbird is a book i can do without."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I have to read this book for school, which we just finished it like last week. I think this book overall is pretty good, but I can't really state my opinion to the book, because I was forced to do vocabularies, answer study questions, and take a test for each chapter of the book (31 Chapters). But if I have time, I might read it again without some forcing me to read something that I wasn't ready for.I recommend this book to the people who is entering high school. I have heard from sophomores, juniors, and seniors that they have to read this book when they were freshmans. So, you little people below high school should get a head start on reading high school gonna-read books. This book's vocab and stuff is not hard at all, but it is like a tradition that every single one of us has to read.This book brought us back to the time in which the Great Depression took place, but the story didn't really link that much to the Great Depression, but it is just a reference point in which we can tell what the setting is. Our young narrator, Jean Louis Finch, who is commonly known as Scout, tells us the important events that happened in her life that leads to her brother Jem's accident. Throughout the story, it shows us, the reader that our main characters is growing and intersting events happened while they grow. Scout started her story at age seven, but the narrator Scout, in my opinion, is a grown-up Scout, and this story is like a flashback, but we'll never know, because the story never told us. That's why this book is a classical tale, because it allows you to think about the what is happening, what makes it happen, and what might happen.I give it a four star because I did enjoy, but not fully, because of my English teacher forcing us to read. Keep in mind, I recommend this to all middle-schoolers!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I recently finished this book and I really enjoyed it.

Atticus was the perfect parent, and always led his children in the right direction and told them the truth without being harsh. Overall the book, was absoulutly great, but there was only one thing I didn't like. After the book was done, it leaves the reader wondering what happens to Jem, Scout, Dill and Boo.

I think younger kids shouldn't read it though but around 6th or 7th grade is ok. this book made me want to live up to the morals of the book on day-to-day basis. I bet you the world, if everyone in this world used the books morals everyday and every second of our lives the world would be a better place... So yes i'll admit it, and i should say the book started out really slow... but when Scout(narrator) finds a summer-friend the book gets really interesting, i felt like the book was a movie rather than a book... as a 7th grader i think this book should be read by everyone... its a really great book that YOU yes YOU should read!!!!!!! so go ahead, if you think its too historic for you then thats your problem... your the one whos missing out... I am so ready to read this book again(2nd time)... enjoy!!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Like others who have reviewed this book recently, I was never assigned this book to read in school. And like many readers, I usually bypassed it. The classics were most often requried reading in school, and too often were more than difficult to get through. However, I had seen the movie starring Gregory Peck and agreed with recent polls that it is one of the best ever made. Given that the books are usually better than the movies, I finally succumbed to my own curiosity and picked up a copy. My very literate friends were surprised that I'd never read it before.As is customary with books written decades ago, this one starts slowly, builds slowly, sometimes seems even plodding. But as the story unfolds, the reader learns about the characters, many of them, primary or secondary, even background. No character is less than fully developed. No incident is trivial.Placed in a small southern town, life is very nearly ideal for children growing up and going to school. But even in such a venue, evil can lurk in the shadows, as Jem, Scout, and their friend Dill discover. There are ancient mysteries, secrets, and people who aren't quite who they seem to be. Others are exactly who they seem to be, like Atticus, gentle, intelligent, sometimes feeling old, but never compromising his principles. His son, Jem, beginning to feel less like a child. Daughter Scout, not quite the lady her aunt Alexandra wants her to be. Dill, their best friend who comes every summer to stay with his aunt. Most of all, Boo Radley, the recluse, whom the children would give almost anything to see.Every word, every scene, every character makes this a most readable book. It is timeless and a joy."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a classic, and will always be. It is about a small town, losing its innocence, like a mockingbird if it is killed, thus the name. A girl named Scout and her brother Jem, embark on many adventures, the last one being the briefest but deadliest. Little by little, the children become unsheltered from the real world, seeing injustice, and seeing that \\"all men are not equal.\\"The biggest part of the book is the trial. The famous racist trial. A respectful African-American is accused of raping a low class American woman. All evidence is circumstantial. But the way the children's father, who is also the defense lawyer, tells it, it makes it sound like the woman's father raped her. However, the jury still thinks the defendant guilty, and he gets a death sentence. And that is where the mockingbird is shot dead right in the heart.Overall it is an excellent book, and everyone who has not read it, I urge them to get their hands on one soon. Enjoy!! Cheers!! :"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"For years, my friends had pestered me to read this book. Every time I would look at them and say &quot;It looks so boring, though!&quot; It wasn't until this year for a school assignment, that I read it. I could have killed myself for not reading it earlier. This book is anything but boring. It is a fantastic novel that I will read over and over. Jeremy(Jem) and Jean Louise(Scout) Finch are brother and sister and they live in the county of Maycomb in Alabama. The story takes place in the 1930s. At this time, there was a lot of discrimination towards black people. People also discriminate poor whites, to whom they reffered to as white trash. One family that was considered white trash was the Ewell family. Bob Ewell was the father of 8 children. Since thy had no mother, 19-year-old Mayella Violet Ewell, the oldest child, served as a mother. A black man named Tom Robinson, who worked in fields near the Ewell household, had to pass by the house every day. Being lonely, Mayella started making advances towards Tom. This was totally against all code. It was unimaginable for a white and black to do anything with each other. Ashamed of what she had done, Mayella went to the court and accused Tom of molesting her. Atticus Finch, the father of Jem and Scout, is the lawyer who defends Tom. Every one is against him because of this. Sure enough, Tom and Atticus lose the trial. But Bob Ewell is planning revenge on Atticus anyway, because Atticus had exposed him as a liar in the courtroom. What Bob ends up doing is extremely scary. This book touched me very much. In my opinion, i would say Atticus is my favorite character. The lessons he teaches to Scout and Jem about right and wrong, and how peaceful and kind he is to everyone is just amazing. Atticus is a great man, and I respect him very much even though he is make-believe. I have only one more thing to say. If your first opinion about this book is bad, please put it aside and read it. I will say that the beginning is boring, but look beyond it into the true meaning of this book. READ IT."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Nelle Harper Lee did a job well done when writing this book. To Kill a Mockingbird reminded me of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, describing the truths of humankind's hate and prejudice. Lee's novel was based on her own childhood past in southern Alambama in the 1930's. She put the aspects of prejudice, discrimination, stereotypes, and justice into an intelligent child's perspective. As most other child-point-of-view books, I found To Kill A Mockingbird more thought provoking than adventuresome. \\"Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit \`em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\" A mockingbird sings its' heart out to make beautiful music, and never eat up gardens or nest in corncribs. That's why it's a sin to kill them. Lee used the symbolic mockingbird to depict the innocence of a few of the characters in the book. Such as Tom Robinson, a black man who never did a thing to harm anyone else, but was accused and charged of rape to a poor white woman because of his race. This book unmasks a county's feelings of prejudice and hate. The author incorporates a man defending to save a black man's life while teaching his children the unjust ways of the world. \\"As you grow older, you'll see white men cheat black men every day of your life, but let me tell you something and don't you forget it - whenever a white man does that to a black man, no matter who he is, how rich he is, or how fine a family he comes form, that white man is trash.\\" Lee did a wonderful, unlike any other author, in making a book about the maturation of a child and the steps made into the real world."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"One of the most unforgettable stories of all time, To Kill A Mockingbird becomes a landmark novel in American literature since its publication in 1960. It is a novel of a lawyer, Atticus, in the deep south defending a black man Tom Robinson charged with the rape of a white girl. Nine-years-old Jean Louise Atticus, from whom her father always shelters and whom neighbors often deems too young to understand the racial struggle, narrates the story. She does it with a stark manner and equanimity of an adult who is savvy of the law. Her perspective is unbridled of the biased and disapproving voices of the town, of which nobody does even one thing to help Tom Robinson, let alone risking one's own life to defend a black man who in the secret courts of men's hearts have no case. That simply being a black yields a disadvantage in the jury's deliberation let alone a black man who is allegedly convicted of an act of felony against a white person. Tom Robinson is dead as the girl opens her mouth and rains charges on him.A child's narration cuts to the core of hypocrisy: some of the most religious people turn their blind eye to an innocent black man who in the absence of any corroborative evidence is indicted on a capital charge and is on the trial of his life. Jean Louise's voice of the narrative might be hesitant, dubious, and questioning, she packs the novel with intimate voice of conversation, of people living and sorting out their lives and the whole racial entangle. Atticus therefore bears a formidable task to not only defend Tom Robinson but also to rebuff, with a righteous indignation, the inveterate discrimination against the blacks. He thrives to protect the children from absorbing the human ugliness: Why can't people get along with each other? Who do people get out of their way to despise one another? What really scares me is such racial labeling still exists now but in a subtler manner that no longer makes people feel broken. In the recent Katrina news coverage, the media labeled a black woman who waded through the hip-deep water hurling supplies out of a store a looter. Racial labeling pervades people like babies born with basic instincts: it renders a stereotype that is culpable of perception that is laden with judgment.Atticus knows that Tom Robinson's case, though it is as simple as black and white that it should never have come to trial, is something that dives right into the essence of a man's conscience. Conscience is the one thing that does not abide by the majority rule. It transcends all racial difference and confronts the intimacy of one's heart. That is the reason he wishes his children to embrace some \\"ugly things\\" that are concomitant of his defending a black man - for all he does is to abide by his conscience and to come clear of it. It is never an insult to be called what somebody thinks is a bad name, especially when one is defending a good cause against mendacious testimony. It just shows how poor and piteous people are when they with maddening superiority thrive to label and call name at others.To Kill A Mockingbird vehemently condemns those who recklessly bend the law at the expense of the innocent's life for the satisfaction of one's supremacy. It also satirizes self-righteous people who rave madly when anything involving a black person occurs. Every page of the novel reminds us that the fight for equality is yet over: it radiates a wave of racial tension and menacing undertow of conflict."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Here is a perfect example of a coming-of-age tale that refuses to be either melodramatic, mushy, or even boring! A story that should be read again and again. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is the classic novel written in 1960 by Harper Lee to great critical acclaim, received the Pulitzer in 1961 and became a classic film in 1962 starring Gregory Peck as the hero Atticus Finch.We are in the life and times of 1930s Alabama, the town of Maycomb County, as seen through the eyes of a young tomboyish girl named Jean Louise Finch, or &quot;Scout&quot; as she is called by her widowed lawyer father Atticus and her older brother Jeremy &quot;Jem&quot; Finch.The span of the story takes place within three years of their lives. From their summer get-togethers with their young friend Dill from Meridian, Mississippi; to their adventures in trying to make their mysterious neighbor Arthur &quot;Boo&quot; Radley come outside; to the courtroom drama of black man Tom Robinson accused of raping a white woman by the name of Mayella Ewell.All characters are positively wonderful! There's the Finchs' black maid, Calpurnia, who acts like the children's mother and guardian; their colorful neighbors: Miss Maudie Atkinson, Miss Stephanie Crawford, and Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose; the town's sheriff Mr. Heck Tate, and the Ewells. All involved help move along the story with both poignancy and humor. The ending of the book, where Scout and Jem are saved by Boo Radley, is perhaps the sweetest moment in any book. The connection between the little girl and the mysterious man is heartbreaking!Harper Lee created a kind of hero to us in creating Atticus Finch, the strong, stalwart man who never hit his children, much less yell at them. Even when Jem and Scout would get into trouble, he would always be there with his broad shoulders and comforting arms. Gregory Peck, in the film, was the ideal choice for Atticus Finch, and won the Best Actor Oscar for it as well.My only complaint, and this is usually with all books and novels, is too much detail to the surroundings of the characters. There are moments when Miss Lee tends to fill about five pages with description of Alabama during the Great Depression. That, to me, tends to slow the story down. Even THE GODFATHER had that same problem, even though it too is a great book.All in all, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD lives up to its reputation as a very important and classic novel."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird, by Harper Lee.To Kill a mockingbird is a book that tells of two children growing up in times of racial segreation in a small southern town.

The black man is accused by a young woman who is the oldest child in a large family. Her family is the worst in town, het father is an acholic and her mother left her at a young age. The story goes on to tell about the hardships of the blacks in the small town and of their white friends. While that is the main plot of the book you are also told of the everyday lives and adventures of the two children and their best friend. The book ends in a way that makes you think &quot;no thats not right, it's not supposed to happen that way.&quot; But I will not give away the ending because that in my opinion was one of the best parts of the book. I sincerely hope that you enjoyed my review and that if you already have not read the book that you will not delay in doing so."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life.To Kill a Mockingbird (Universal Legacy Series)"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"As a lawyer and writer born before the first edition of this book was published, I'm embarrassed to say I never read To Kill a Mockingbird until the fortieth anniversary edition came out (even my fifteen-year-old had read it). But I'm glad I waited. I don't think I would have enjoyed or appreciated it nearly as much in my youth. What a treat!The book starts slowly, but draws the reader in by the end of the first chapter. Without exception, the characters are intriguing. Scout, the young girl who narrates the story, is a particularly compelling and sympathetic character. Author Harper Lee gives her a youthful perspective without patronizing.The story is enlightening and entertaining. It accomplishes these dual feats with minimal moralizing. A few passages did make me cringe, such as the \\"enlightened\\" neighbor's there-but-for-the-grace-of-God thankfulness that she wasn't born black. But I suspect those passages reflect the views of the period, and are as instructive as the story itself.No need to say the writing is masterful; the Pulitzer Prize gives away that little secret. I particularly enjoyed the scene in which Atticus Finch is called out to confront a rabid dog. It's as chilling and suspenseful as anything in today's movies -- without the gore and unnecessary violence.To Kill a Mockingbird reflects the best and worst of American sensibilities in the twentieth century. We would do well to remember its lessons in the twenty-first.Harper Lee was right in insisting against a long introduction to the fortieth anniversary edition; this American classic stands on its own."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I have heard this award bestowed upon The Great Gatsby, but for me, To Kill A Mockingbird is the great American novel. In it, we meet the best and worst America has to offer. We learn that while most Americans are good people \\"when you really see them\\", we unconsciously inflict the most damage upon those who never hurt us.The central plot in Ms. Lee's tale involves the trial of Tom Robinson, but the book is half over by the time we reach this point. Instead, Ms. Lee paints a picture of a sleepy, shabby Alabama town where locals are poor, have little to do, and spend a great deal of time worrying about the activities of their neighbors. We see the town through the eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, children of the attorney Atticus Finch. Slowly we see a world where people want to do the right thing, but lack the courage of their convictions. We see how unjustly the town's African American citizens are treated by the majority of the townfolk, by the contrastingly decent and fair treatment of these citizens by Atticus. We learn that Atticus is the man in the town who does what no one else has the heart to do--whether it is shooting a rabid dog or defending Tom Robinson in an unwinnable case. He does it all without boasting, and without the expectation of reward.I read recently that Atticus Finch had been voted the #1 hero in American cinematography by a majority of Americans voting. I work as a lawyer, and a majority of my classmates ran off to join a big firm and get as rich as possible as soon as they graduated. Yet we idealize this simple, humble man who believed in doing the right thing before making a fast buck. In this time of Enron and secret terrorism tribunals--both of which make a mockery of our legal system--it is important to remember the lessons taught by Atticus Finch: never cheat a man with less education, for anyone who does so is trash; never judge someone, for you don't know what it is like to walk in their shoes; never shoot a mockingbird, for all they ever do is make beautiful music for the rest of us."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"TKaM is a classic and it was nice to see the 50th edition in its originally-designed book jacket.

Harper Lee's story is timeless, and her message of tolerance and compassion for all is just as clear today as it was 50 years ago.The book was delivered the same day of its release."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a Pulitzer Prize-winning classic of American literature. It may well be one of the five greatest books ever published in English (my other candidates are the King James Bible, anything by Shakespeare, MOBY DICK, and HUCKLEBERRY FINN).Written in 1960, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD at first seems to be a young girl's first-person reminiscence of childhood in a sleepy Depression-era Southern town. Author Harper Lee has steadfastly denied that the book is formally autobiographical, though many autobiographic elements clearly exist (the character of Dill is the author Truman Capote in childhood, a lifelong friend of Miss Lee's).The children spend much of the first half of the book whiling away their time at imaginative games and summer daydreams. Their waking world is peopled by a curiously colorful collection of neighbors who range from the sublime (Mrs. Dubose, a cantankerous Confederate widow quietly addicted to morphine) to the ridiculous (Miss Stephanie Crawford, the town's indefatigable gossip). Their waking nightmare consists of Boo Radley, a mysterious neighbor who they have never seen. The children construct elaborate fantasies of Boo, but as they grow older their deliciously terrifying imaginings of the man within the house at the end of the block become overshadowed by more frightening realities in the outside world.The children (narrator Scout, her brother Jem, and their friend, Dill) become unjaded observers of the daily drama of ordinary human life when their father, Atticus Finch, the town attorney, is assigned to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman. The town becomes quietly inflamed as the submerged flotsam of prejudice floats to the surface of the residents' collective consciousness.Scout, Jem and Dill, along with their lifelong friends and neighbors, are forced to confront issues of justice, injustice, and their own identities, first as Southerners, second as Americans, but lastly and most importantly, as human beings who have the power to choose.Generations of young reviewers have attacked this book as \\"boring\\" and essentially incomprehensible. It is neither. However, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD has suffered the fate of being consigned to that seventh circle of hell known as \\"the assigned reading list\\" in most high schools. As a classroom project this book can be impenetrable. I recall being forced to endure TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD in my Junior year, and being unable to truly appreciate it at age 16. In part this is because it does not lend itself at all well to the usual straightforward teaching techniques of English class.The fact is that many adolescents have neither the attention span nor the life experience to grasp the subtle fineries that underlie this book. This comment is not meant to be an indictment of teenagers. Nor is it meant to be off-putting to young readers. It is merely an observation of the price one pays to reach adulthood. This is an adult's book, though each reader must discover for themselves where that line of demarcation lies within.I have always been of the opinion that literature should be enjoyed, not studied. I have returned to TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD every several years, and each time I revisit it I take away something more and deeper."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Like most young ones my age, I read and studied \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" in junior high school. But this story has stuck with me through the years, and every time I flip through it's pages, I look back on it with affection. This classic tale of courage and altruism is timeless.It is the early 1950's in the southern states. A highly respected small-town lawyer decides to take on a case defending a framed African American man, although he knows he will not win the trial. The lawyer must face the ridicule of the town's folk, and racists in his community who seek to have the framed man killed.In the meantime, the lawyer's two children (Scout and Jem) get entangled in the age-long mystery of Boo Radley, their mysterious next door neighbor who no one has seen for years...and who no one seems to understand.\\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is a touching story full of life-lessons, one of which proves that fighting a losing battle may be difficult, but \\"good\\" will ultimately triumph if you stand up for what you know to be right and true."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; was one of the best I've read.

She breathed life into the moral struggle of those torn between the traditions of their culture and the quiet voice of conscience. It isn't an easy story and there is no conventional happy ending. It is therefore true to life but it is a book that gives hope. Its characters live and breathe in all their wonderful complexity and Sissy Spacek brings them from the page to our ears in a remarkable tour de force. Her soft southern accent takes us straight to the heart of the characters and she builds the atmosphere of the time beautifully. The art of story telling is not dead as long as Ms Spacek exercises her craft. My 16 year old son and I listened to her each morning on the 30 minute school run and could not wait to hear the next segment. This is well worth purchasing."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird was first published in 1960 and it went on to win the prestigious Pulitzer Prize. Sadly Harper Lee has had no other novels published since To Kill a Mockingbird. I first read To Kill a Mockingbird at school nearly three decades ago and since that time I must have read it at least once each year. This has helped me develop a deep understanding for Harper Lee's master work. The central characters of this book are two children Scout and Jem, who live with their father Atticus, a lawyer. The story is set in a fictional town called Maycombe in the depression ravaged 1930s America, though the people of America have just been told that the only thing they have to fear is fear itself.My favourite parts of this book are the way a child is able to disperse a murder intent mob, the power of the court room scenes and the way that the children eventually see things so clearly, maybe more clearly than any adult does throughout the pages of To Kill a Mockingbird. As Scout puts it: \\"...you never really understand somebody until you step into their shoes and walk around in them.\\" If we all applied that wisdom, how much better the world would be.I personally loved the way Harper Lee describes this small town and its quaint little ways, while at the same time realising that this quaintness hides attitudes that are tainted by class distinctions and prejudice. The book goes on to relate this prejudice that comes to the surface in a dramatic fashion and forces people to look very carefully at their own attitudes, while at the same time exposing a simple truth that when people have been brought up with deep prejudices it is very difficult to shake these off. But To Kill a Mockingbird demonstrates that when prejudice is confronted in the minds of those who are prejudiced then the truth can be very different to the one previously supposed.Nobody should make the mistake of thinking that this book should only be read by those who are at school doing their exams, because to miss reading this book would be a real shame. I would recommend that everybody buy this book and read it again and again. It is not without it's flaws but if you read it with an educated mind you will benefit from it's wisdom."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird epitomizes all that is valuable to mankind. Through the simple, innocent eyes of children, we see triumph of good over evil played out in a small town. Scout's father, Atticus, told her it is a sin to kill a mockingbird, for they only make music and harm no one. Two innocents, played a role in demonstating this fact: a black man, falsely accused and a mentally ill man by the name of Boo Radley, who does an amazing thing as the subplots unfold, within the major plot. There are several humanistic morals to this story, as Atticus Finch sets an example as a good father and defender of the innocents. To Kill a Mockingbird is not only fascinating reading for all ages, but holds moral lessons that never die for humanity, for all time."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is an accurate representation of the struggle for civil rights. One character, Calpurnia, particularly caught our eye as she was a respected figure in the Finch household even though she is an African American working for the family. Despite being a valued member of the family, and a mother figure to Scout and Jem, Calpurnia is looked down on by outsiders, the reserved citizens of Maycomb; for example, even Aunt Alexandra, sister to Atticus, is concerned about Calpurnia's place in the family, convinced that the household \\"[doesn't] need her now.\\" It is evident that Calpurnia's right to be respected is disregarded by others.While most Southern whites of the 1960s were racist, Atticus Finch, a white man, agreed to legally defend an African American, Tom Robinson. By doing so, Atticus becomes an object of ridicule and prejudice. Being called derogatory names such as \\"nigger-lover\\" and \\"negro trash,\\" Atticus is threatened both verbally and physically. At one point in the novel, a mob arrives at the jail to attack him. He is saved only by his daughter, Scout, as she humanizes him. Atticus' loyalty and devotion to the civil rights cause is inspirational.The average southern white is greatly contrasted by Lee's portrayal of Mr. Dolphs Raymond. He is a white man who feels more comfortable with blacks than with whites. This is a welcome juxtaposition as it creates a contrast between the average southern citizens and himself. Dolphus' character not only supports civil rights but opens readers to the possibility of peaceful integration. This book is recommended to readers interested in the 1960s civil rights movement.Written By Nadia Kadry, Madeleine Varmer, Anna Rittman-Tune, and Caroline Kemper"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's classic novel To Kill a Mockingbird is set in a rural Southern town during the Dpression of the 1930s. The story is told from the perspective pf Scout Finch, a school-age Caucasian girl from a struggling middle class family. She has many encounters with conflicting social pressures. Many are quick to point out the civil rights aspect of the novel; however, even deeper into is, the subject of feminism is also addressed. From a feminist view, this novel excellently portrays social struggles of women during the era of the Depression.Throughout the novel Scout is faced with an interesting dilemma concerning her gender and feminism. She is continuously faced with conflicting messages coming from Jem and Dill and from the likes of Aunt Alexandra or Mrs. Dubose. Jem and Dill are constantly encouraging Scout to act less like a traditional girl, and to spend more time in overalls than in dresses; for example, Jem tells Scout, \\"I declare to the Lord you're getting' more like a girl every day\\" after Scout declines to accompany Jem and Dill to the Radley House.On the other hand Scout faces intense pressure to act like a convention girly-girl from the likes of her Aunt Alexandra and Mrs. Dubose; for example, Scout says, \\"Aunt Alexandra was fanatical on the subject of my attire. I could not possibly hope to be a lady if I wore breeches; when I said I could do nothing in a dress, she said I wasn't supposed to be doing things that required pants. Aunt Alexandra's vision of my deportment involved playing with small stoves, tea sets, and wearing the Add-A-Pearl necklace she gave me when I was born.\\"In addition, Scout feels that she is isolated from other children by Aunt Alexandra as a result of her gender. She desires to \\"graduate to the big table\\" with the others, but she is not allowed to. Scout expresses that Aunt Alexandra \\"didn't understand girls much.\\"Overall, the book fully addresses the expectations felt by both children and women and offers a powerful commentary on feminism in the depression era of the South. It explains how the feminist influences affected growing up during this time period. This formula makes for a classic novel.[...]"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird exemplifies the feminist views of its time. The book tells the story of Scout, a young girl living in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama, and her adventures with her older brother Jem and their summertime friend Dill. The trio's escapades are set against the background of a black man in their community, Tom Robinson, being tried for raping a white woman. Scout's father Atticus acts as a lawyer for the trial, bringing Scout and Jem ridicule from their peers. Throughout the novel, Lee conveys a feminist message.Scout, the protagonist, is a rambunctious, tomboy who defies the expectations of women in the 1930s Southern Alabama society; for example, on page 22, Scout beats up Walter Cunningham, which is uncharacteristic of a \\"proper\\" lady. Scout spends her days \\"usually mud-splashed or covered with sand\\" instead of drinking tea with the ladies (Lee 131). Furthermore, Scout gets a gun for Christmas, thus engaging in a normally male-dominated activity. Scout is boyish, unruly, and adventurous; yet, she is perceived positively, as a protagonist of the novel. Lee shows that women can be self-sufficient and intelligent without being \\"girly.\\"On the other hand, the characters that conform to society by adhering to standards for women are often perceived as mean or shallow; for example, Mrs. Dubose is Scout's \\"gender appropriate\\" neighbor. Mrs. Dubose criticizes Scout for wearing overalls. \\"'You should be in a dress and camisole, young lady!'\\" Mrs. Dubose yells from her porch (Lee 101). Despite being feminine, a trait favored by society, Mrs. Dubose is also mean, sharp-tongued, and selfish. Scout's Aunt Alexandra is also a feminine character who is overly critical of Scout's wanton ways. According to Aunt Alexandra, Scout should fill her time \\"playing with small stoves, tea sets, and wearing the Add-A-Pearl necklace she gave [Scout] when [she] was born\\" (Lee 81). Aunt Alexandra further tells Scout that she shouldn't \\"be doing things that require pants,\\" meaning Scout should act like a young lady, not a man (Lee 81). Aunt Alexandra's antagonistic nature shows that feminine qualities are not necessary to be moral.Lee has written a spellbinding story that tackles the feminine stereotypes of the time. It parallels the heavy issues of women's rights with the tale of a young girl coming of age."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a MockingbirdWe just finished this book and were amazed at the incredible use of diction and tone words by the author to enhance the theme.

Aside from being enormously important, it is also an excellent read. Every middle-schooler should read this book.Lee's novel takes place in small-town Alabama during the Great Depression. The narrator is Scout Fitch, the daughter of Atticus Fitch who is a local attorney. Atticus is assigned to defend a local black, Tom Robinson, man who has been charged with raping a white woman. Much of the town disagrees with Atticus' decision to defend Robinson, and vehemently taunts Scout for his father's actions. Atticus is able to prove Robinson's innocence, but Robinson is convicted of the crime anyway. Robinson is later killed while trying to escape from prison. The alleged victim's father, Bob Ewell, is humiliated by the trial and menaces Atticus' family. In the end, Ewell attacks Scout and then dies in the confusion of the attack, probably killed by Fitch's mysterious neighbor, Boo Radley, who the children in the community have been fascinated by for years.This incredible piece of literature broaches many important topics in our society: racial tensions and race relations(especially in the South), injustice in the legal system, class, sex crimes and the importance of courage and integrity. The book deals extensively with these issues, but is still very light-hearted and humorous.Above all else, To Kill A Mockingbird, is a poignant reminder to all who read it about the importance of humanity and good will towards all. The book is one of my favorites because it reminds me of what is good and just in this world, and can be, even in our darkest hours of moral ambiguity. It is a reminder that there are always people out there, in the face of impossible odds and situations, striving to do what is right and just.

The main character of the book is a five year old girl nicknamed Scout and she tells the story from her point of view. Scout and her brother Jem, live with their father, Atticus Finch, who is a prominent lawyer in town. In the summer, Scout and Jem become fascinated with a recluse neighbor, Boo Radley. Life is dramatically changed when their father, Atticus, takes on a controversial case. A white woman, Mayella Ewell, accuses an innocent black man named Tom Robinson of raping her. It is obvious that he is innocent as the trial goes on due to Atticus' questioning. Nonetheless, in a small southern town still full of prejudice, the all white jury finds Tom Robinson guilty. Due to Atticus taking on the case, his family and children are faced with many threats and scorn from the angry white people in Maycomb. Atticus stands constant in his conviction to fight racial inequality and teaches this good to Scout and Jem. Near the end Tom Robinson is shot as he attempted to escape from jail. This is a hard lesson for Scout and Jem to learn as they feel the injustice of Robinson's position. Mayella's evil father, Bob Ewell vows revenge on the Finch's since Atticus made him appear a fool during the trial. The book ends with him attacking Scout and Jem on their way home from a school play. The children are saved by their recluse neighbor, Boo Radley. Boo stabs Bob Ewell and is luckily saved from punishment by the police officer who claims that he saw Bob Ewell fall on his own knife. The Finch children, Scout and Jem grow up during the entire process of the trial. They are faced with many examples of evil and good in people and lose their innocence through the trial.Address negative aspects of the book:One of the main themes of this book is forgiveness. Atticus always forgives people for their evil traits. For example, Atticus is able to forgive people for being racist and chose to admire them instead for their positive traits, such as courage or love. While I think it is good that Atticus teaches readers forgiveness, I think that it can be frustrating. Some people and acts do not necessarily deserve forgiveness, like the character Bob Ewell. I think that it is important to make sure that the seriousness of the racism in the south during those times is not taken lightly and forgiven, but remembered for the giant mistake it was.Your appraisal of the book:I would definitely recommend reading this book. When I read this book in fourth grade, it changed my life. Being able to discuss such serious issues and get new viewpoints and a history lesson at the same time is an amazing part of this book. I think this book should be read by every student in America. We can only learn from our mistakes in history by discussing them and learning about them in literary works. This is a perfect book that can address that lesson for students today. Buy this book and read it for all of these reasons."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Title: To Kill A Mocking BirdPublisher: Warner BooksAuthor: Harper E.

Scout Finch and her brother Jem live in a small town in Alabama where they become obsessed with Boo Radley. Boo leaves present under a tree that Scout and Finch continue to visit until Boo's brother fills the hole with cement. At the same time as this story develops Attacus Finch (Scout's father) decided to defend Tom Robinson who is a black man who is accused of raping a white female.

Later in the novel Tom Robinison's accuser is embarrassed because Attacus embarrasses him in the courtroom and harasses Jem and Scout when Boo comes to their rescue.As a current teacher I firmly believe that this book should be read at the end of middle school. It is a fantastic novel that teachers young adults some very important lessons. It is a coming of age novel that provides very valuable lessons at a middle school age. The book provides characters that are very relatable and the reader develops strong feelings for the character. This is a book that should be read by people of all ages. This book is typically read by freshmen in high school, however, I strongly believe that this book can do a great amount of good if read at a middle school level. The books issues and themes are so prevalent to a middle school world. To see Jem and Scout grow up throughout the novel just as many young middle schoolers are.The only negative aspect of this book for middle schoolers is that the characters in the beginning of the novel may be hard to relate to. Scout is too young and Atticus may be too old. However, I believe that the issues that are handled in the book are issues that typical teenagers care about. I have found that issues like racism always spark debate in the middle school classroom. Another problem with this novel is that despite the 8th grade reading levels it deals with a complicated plot and takes in-depth analysis to fully understand all of its meaning which may make it hard for a middle schooler to fully comprehend."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I have read this book many times over the years since I was a child.

One could say that Maycomb was a town comprised of thickheaded individuals that were very closed minded and set in their ways. Also, in this era whites were dominant to blacks, and segregation was the law that by which all blacks had to abide.Atticus Finch was a lawyer, and also a single father of two children growing up in the town of Maycomb. His son Jeremy (Jem) and his daughter, the narrator Jean-Louis (Scout), were at the age of questioning everything, and also at the age where certain experiences would etch and mold the way both would think, feel, act, and behave in the future. Atticus being a wise, humble, caring man knew this so he did his best to not shelter but to welcome questions and concerns that each of his children may have.Scout tells her experiences with Atticus, Jem, their friend Dill, her talks with Miss Maudie, altercations with Mrs. Dubose and her Aunt Alexandra, her views on school, and her childhood obsession with Boo Radley. Everything seems to be well for the Finches, until Atticus agrees to defend a black man by the name of Tom Robinson that is accused of raping a white man's daughter. The story erupts with emotion, drama, and at this point is virtually impossible to put down.This book is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird is a unique, multi-faceted story of a small town and the people who live there during the mid \`30s. As I began reading this story, I found it hard to keep up with all the characters that played a part of it. The deeper I read however, I began to understand that the author was portraying the many facets of people who made up the town of Maycomb Alabama.The story's central focus was on two young children, Scout and Jem, of a widowed lawyer Atticus. It portrayed how life was in the small town of Maycomb through the eyes of Scout. Harper Lee does a wonderful job of weaving the meaning of the title, into the story, and its relationship to a trial of a young black man.In reading the back cover, I found that Harper Lee considered her book to be a simple love story. I believe it to be more of a story about human compassion, or the lack there of. This book is very descriptive in detail, that one could plainly visualize its characters and setting. Although I thought it started out slow, I found it hard to put down (I can't wait to see the movie!).I highly recommend this book to young and older readers!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"An interesting story of three children and their exploits in the backdrop of 1930's Alabama. It keeps you riveted though it does not have the suspense, violence and corporate mumbo-jumbo of nowadays fast novels portraying big city life. This book is very soothing read, will keep you smiling to yourself and will talk to the evergreen child in yourself, you'll be happy you read it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is a wonderful portrayal of prejudice, not only of African Americans, but of all people as well. It gives examples of prejudices against the poor and strange; the story not only focuses on the main character (Scout), but also on the important events surrounding her and gives her child's perspective of the occurances. Her views on her father (Atticus Finch) and brother (Jem) are interesting, and through her eyes we are guided through a most interesting story. Though this tale deals with a lot of serious topics, it also has a subtle and unassuming humor that personally made me laugh. It is a well-written, well-balanced book that brings real topics to light and, at other times, brings a smile to your face."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird was a hard book to keep up with.

Any number of books can be hailed as classics, but I'm talking about the books by Twain, Dickens, Verne, ect. Their are few books from the 20th century that can be called classics yet. The Grapes of Wrath, and Of Mice and Men, can claim this. The other in my opinion is this book. It is one of the greatest novels I have ever read. If you have not read this, you must read it at least once in your life. It is one of the best of the elite group of books known as \\"the classics\\"."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is a powerful and touching story. The author, Harper Lee, did a wonderful job of telling how young children evolve into young men and women. The novel tells of a small southern town and the dramatic events that change the town forever. To Kill a Mockingbird starts with Scout, a young girl telling about her and her brother Jems summer and the exciting events that occured during it. Scout and Jem were being raised by their widower father Atticus with the help of their housekeeper Clapurnia. Scout and Jem are very curious of the people and happenings in their town. Unpleasant things begin to occur in town though. Atticus, a lawyer, explains that he is defending a young black man, Tom Robinson, who is wrongfully accused of a serious crime. Since this is causing such an uproar, Scout and Jem want to know why he is doing it.The writing flowed nicely with the telling of the children's innocent fun to the heart pounding hatred of the trial. During the summer it appears that the children grow up very quickly. In many situations, the kids learn the harsh realities of life. Examples would be when the neighbors house burned down, the trial, getting attacked, and meeting a recluse neighbor for the first time. The neighbors play major parts in this novel. They influence and teach Jem and Scout many things about the way people in the town view each other. This novel really shows how child like innocence can teach adults lessons and how easily it can be lost. To Kill a Mockingbird is an unforgettable novel that is recommended."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee tackles the moral and realistic views of racism in the story of a girl and her small southern town. Set in Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1930s, the book vividly depicts the issue of race and how a young girl overcomes the boundaries of color to show her community that there is more to someone than the color of their skin. Scout, the main character, lives with her brother Jem and father, whom she calls Atticus. Atticus teaches her and Jem that race really means nothing and that every person deserves the chance to be respected and treated fairly. Atticus is completely non-violent and will not even show the children how to fire a weapon. The family's black cook Calprunia tells the children to never kill a mockingbird, because they are only here to sing.During the summer Scout and Jem befriend a boy named Dill who becomes fascinated with an almost \\"haunted\\" house owned by Boo Radley. The children begin to trespass on the mysterious property and soon find little gifts left in a knot in one of the trees. They are shot at by Boo's father and in the chaotic events Jem loses his pants. He finds them days later mended lying on the fence. The children come to believe that Boo is behind all this confusion.Meanwhile, Atticus is assigned to a case involving a black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Atticus tells his children that they might be taunted and treated unfairly because he was taking the case. The children take the criticism openly and even spend Christmas in a black community and become friends with everyone there. They attend a mass with Calprunia and become more comfortable with the open and accepting black community there. Sadly, Tom Robinson is found guilty by a racist, unfairly picked jury, even though Atticus proved that Tom did not rape the woman. While in prison an angry mob wants to kill Tom. Acting quickly and effectively Scout talks the huge crowd of adults into not killing him and letting the whole fiasco go. Imagine seeing a six year old talking a monstrous crowd out of killing an innocent man, whom she does not even, really know.The father of the \\"raped\\" girl attacks Jem and Scout, but Boo is mysteriously there to help them and ends up killing the crazed man. Scout and Jem realize that Boo, even though different from them, is a truly caring and a good person.Harper Lee relates that the Mockingbird symbolizes innocence, which includes Tom Robinson, Jem, and Boo Radley. These innocent characters have lost something or been almost destroyed by others. Needing help they unknowingly turn to Scout to recover what they have lost. Lee also reveals that race can be conquered by even a six year old girl like Scout. Scout shows the angry mob that what they are doing is wrong and is completely unnecessary, telling them they must treat everyone with respect. Lee also depicts the morals of a small southern town, by the hate and racists beliefs that fill almost everyone's minds. Through Scout, Harper Lee shows that the innocence of a child can overcome the terrible boundaries of race. Harper Lee wrote a meaningful and symbolic story revealing that race is ultimately nothing and that every human should treat all of mankind with the respect that everyone deserves. This is an outstanding novel that should be required reading for any child or adult. This novel can truly change the way you think about life and your fellow man."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The story takes place in a small southern town. Scout and her brother Jem are two young children being raised by their widower father Atticus and their housekeeper Calpurnia. Tension is started to take place in the town for whites and blacks. The black community in the town seem to like Scout's father and she doesn't understand why. Her white friends are very racist and full of hostility. Nasty things are said and heard by Scout. She asks her father why. Atticus is a lawyer, he is defending a young black man wrongfully accused of a grave crime. All of this hatered stems from this case. Atticus knows that it is the right thing to do. The summer before Scout's first grade year her and Jem find a friend named Dill Harris. He tries to get them into some trouble and they try to get the town's bogeyman, Boo Radly to come out. Trouble is started in town with the adults as well. Mayella Ewell is the daughter of a drunk and violet white farmer. Tom Robison, a black man, is accused of raping Mayella Ewell. Atticus is hired to defend him. Both of the troubled scenes account for one death and a hell of a court case. This whole time scout is trying to figure out the whole situation for herself. This is a good book and very emotional and controversial. The author Harper Lee does a terrific job making you want to read more."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's book To Kill A Mockingbird delves into a small town in the rural south and examines the role that prejudice plays amongst the inhabitants. The story as told from a young girl's point of view has light moments that are filled with the joy of playing with childhood friends and her sibling, Jem. However, as the story progresses Scout is faced with the concerns that her classmates and neighbors have over her father, the town's most prominent lawyer, representing an innocent black man in a rape case against a white woman. Racist people in their everyday lives confront Scout and her brother Jem and they must learn how to react to their hateful remarks. Scout realizes the discrimination that many black citizens face in their everyday lives for the first time. She doesn't understand the weight that her father's case has in both the families' and the town's everyday activities. Scout begins to understand her father's kind and respectful nature and begins to respect more as an upstanding and moral citizen.To Kill A Mockingbird is set during a time that most young readers' parents and grandparents reflect upon as a time with a tremendous communal bond. The wonderful sense of community takes the reader back to a time in our history where neighbors cared about each other. However, it also brought back to life the very real prejudices that many African-Americans were faced with during the era of the depression. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story and appreciated the glimpse of the not so distant past that it provided me with."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's to Kill A Mockinbird is a wonderful book. The characters are well portrayed, and the setting is described in a very intreging way. Harper Lee sets the story in a small town like the one she grew up in and this helps us relate more the characters and what is going on in the story. She also creates a significance in the story from the setting by relating it to something we have all seen or heard of. The novel has a very interesting plot that ingulps you into it the second you start reading the book. The meaning of the book is very significant in itself. Harper Lee uses a lot of metaphors in this story but one can always understand what she means by these metaphorical phrases. With this book Harper Lee has portrayed examples of our historical past. This novel is one of the best of all times and you will not just read it once but rather over and over again."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is truly a classic. It is by far, my most favorite novel. In this story, there is a lot of racism. I think this is what the main theme of the story is. There are two sides of racism. One has to do with blacks and whites, and the other has to do with the town and Boo Radley. I felt this was important because it showed that people are not only prejudice when it comes to race, but also when it comes to social class or people just being different from other people. People are afraid of things, people, and situations that are unknown to them. When they are afraid of the unknown, they strike out in very unkind ways. Sometimes they use words, and sometimes it can get very physical as when the lynch mob came to Atticus and he was unarmed.Also, another theme that really stood out was maturation. Scout and Jem grew up and matured throughout the book. I think they saw how cruel people could treat other people because of the color of their skin, or maybe just what they believed in. The situations Jem and Scout were put in made them think twice about what they believed in, which tends to make people grow up quickly. Atticus also changed throughout the story. I think that the situation Atticus was in would make anyone change because hatred and anger can make people say and do things they wouldn't normally do. I think there were times when Atticus was very quiet due to the fact that he had so many emotions inside him. I'm sure through time, he felt the animosity of the town's people. I think after awhile, that would really get to someone. I liked Atticus because he fought for what he believed in and didn't give up even though it was hard. Another character who changed in the story was Boo Radley. In the beginning, no one hears from him or even sees him. Toward the end of the story, he is seen more, and is more spoken of. I think that he was becoming less afraid of people. In the end when he saves Jem and Scout's lives, he shows great courage and I think that is very admirable."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is a great story. It invloves Atticus Finch and his two children Scout and Jem who mature through the story. The main part of the book is a trial where Atticus is defending a black man who is accused of raping a low-class white woman. The people of the town are against what Atticus is doing and through this and the rest the story, you learn about racism, predjudice, and maturatiopn. Harper Lee does a good job of describing the setting and the characters. And her style of writing involves telling the story through the children's perspective with humor, and good decriptions. Overall this a good book that involves many issues that you might face in life, and I recommend that you read this book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee has created a wonderful book containing many details. One way Lee made this book so enjoyable is the way she constructed her characters. She made me feel like I was a friend of Scout's and that I knew all of them very well. Speech played a big role in forming each character. By the way they talked, you could tell who they were around and how they were acting. When scout was around all of his friends from school he would cuss and talk mean to everyone. This showed how scout was trying to fit in and how he was acting aound all of his classmates. When Cal took the children to the black church she stopped talking in proper English like she always did at home. This showed the part of her that was her history and culture. It let the kids and the readers know that around people that she can relate to, she is more herself. People would talk about Atticus say he was a bad person for defending Tom, but then Scout would get into fights. The actions of Scout showed us how protective of her family she is. The way Atticus is being talked about lets us know how everyone sees him. The other way we get to know these characters so well is how they are described. Dill is described as a little guy. This gives us a visual picture that Dill is around the same size as scout and we can begin to see him as we read. Lee did a wonderful job and these characters were very appropriately described."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I believe that there are many reasons that Harper Lee wrote this book. In my opinion the main reason for the book is to inform people about a time period in America, which is often overlooked or not known about. Before I read this book I had never heard of the Scottsboro trial. I learned a lot about the trial and some of the things that took place. Another reason I why I think Lee wrote this book was to entertain. I found this book for the most part entertaining and enjoyable to read. I liked all of the foreshadowing, metaphors, and moral values."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I actually would have given this book more than 5 stars-its wonderfull.i have read this book again and again and have not tired of it.Atticus Finch is one of the most amazing charectors ever wriitten-yes perhaps he's too perfect but it makes me like him more.The morals in this book were subtle and its part of the reading experience to understand and embibe the morals in this book.

But I've gone back and read many of the classics and this is easily in my top 10 best books ever! Not only is the story entertaining, but the emotion and the action of the book is fantastic. You'll laugh, you'll cry... And if you are a fan of the movie (which I am...Gregory Peck at his best...) you'll really love reading the book! If the movie is one of the best movies ever made, the book exceeds it simply based on the fact that it is twice the story of the movie! The movie sticks to the story very closely, but they edit out about half of what happens in the book! The trial happens about half-way through the book, rather than toward the very end, like in the movie. And after reading the book, several scenes in the movie make much more sense!This one is definitely five-star book and I'd say it is one of the best books out ever written!

The town is rocked by a trial in court concerning a black man, and the town's most disrespected whites. Scout Finch, an eight year old girl and the narrator of the story, experiences the heat of predjudice with her brother Jem for the first time. Their father,lawyer Atticus Finch, a man wise beyond his years, boldy defends the black man, who has been wrongly accused of raping a white woman.

I have heard the plotline from my mom at least a million times but i have never had the determination and the will to read it until now. This book is every bit as well written and classic as everyone I talk to believes it to be. Its masterful use of a child's perspective on the wrongs of our world is breathtaking. Read it... I did and I'm only 16...to think people say the youth of our nation has no appreciation for great literature."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's To Kill A Mocking Bird has a timeless quality -- people of various generations and cultures have embraced it. This is -- without a doubt -- one of my all-time favorite novels. I marvel at Harper Lee's amazing language and compelling story of Atticus Finch and his two children, Scout and Jem. Atticus has decided to defend a young black man accused of raping a white woman. Set during the Depression in Alabama, defending Tom Robinson is not an easy task. The whole town is against what he's doing. Lee touches on some very sensitive subjects, like the caste system, separation based on class and racism. I love the fact that the story is told through the eyes of Scout and Jem -- the children talk with honesty, humor and innocence. Also, I am awed by Atticus's fatherly warmth and family values. With great characters and a tender story, To Kill A Mockingbird is an everlasting treasure that should be read more than once."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"\\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is more than the usually discussed issues of racial bigotry and the human condition under trial. Don't let me take away from those values at all... but Harper Lee has written a book transcending a literary social commentary. She has written a love story.A love story? huh? Who gets married? Does anyone kiss? Are there passages of deep romance? No, no, no... none of that. Try instead family love.Atticus is the kind of single dad we need to see more of in this generation. He cares for his children so much that he protects them from the fires of his grown-up life of representing an innocent man. He protects them from the full impact of his neighbor's lies. He shows them how to love them, even though he knows his neighbors hate him and the love of fellow man he represents.If all Atticus, the father, did, was love the innocent man, he would be doing a good thing, but he demonstrates love and allows dignity (when possible) for the ones persecuting the innocent. He shows he is a big man, and his children mimic this sense of understanding.Deeply rooted in the memories of his children, the story has a gentle subtext of growing up. You can almost taste the lemonade of the porch and smell the flowers in nearby gardens.Lee's power as an author here is that she does let her statements about humanity overtake the story. Rather, she lets the story tell the story, and she just writes down what happened in her imagination.Her characters are not paste-up Southern children or adults, but complex characters all of us relate to (even me up here near Chicago!). Relationships are embedded in the depth of being neighbors. This creating a milieu of angst in Atticus' children when they see the adults warring in court and out of court in matters of truth.I fully recommend this book, and think to give it the best reading possible, examine how interwoven the story is with its various cultures and characters. The power of Lee's message will be plenty clear.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.com"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book....it was cleverly written by the author...we see the prejudices and all the different types of people living in Maycomb County come alive through the narration of Scout,a girl who has not quite yet reached the age of 9.The book was written in a simple, and yet humourous way, and the message that the author was trying to get across is very clear, that we should never ever judge people until we have seen their true colours.Alas! The world is often less than perfect and sensible people such as Atticus, Scout's father, are becoming extinct. I read this book twice, and it brought me to tears each time. The simple acts of kindness shown to Scout and his older brother, Jem, by their neighbour, &quot;Boo&quot; Radley, are really touching. People like &quot;Boo&quot; , who have strange and weird habits and are not like the ordinary being, are often misunderstood and misjudged by people.However, they often have a beautiful side to them that people fail to see.After reading this book, it really made me think twice about the misconceptions that appearances give."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's novel &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; throughly deserves its huge critical acclaim. Telling many stories in its content, it deals with the growing up and learning process of Scout, (Jean Louise) a little girl who lives with her father Atticus and brother jem in the deep south of America. In between the years of five and eight, Scout comes across Dill, whose sad unloved story touches even the hardest reader, an ill-tempered, prejudiced old woman, whom Scout's father describes as &quot;the bravest woman he ever met&quot;, and most importantly, the &quot;nigger&quot; Tom, whose obvious innocence of the crime of rape is ignored, to be punished by death. These hard-hitting storylines would give the book a somber tone, but Lee cleverly moves away from this by giving the narration to a child, making the book witty, light-hearted, yet serious, dealing with issues still very much alive today."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Some of the books they make you read in high school are really boring.

The characters, the trial, but more importantly about race.I loved this book as a kid and I love it as an adult. Please, if you are assigned to read this book do so, I know the temptation for cliffnotes is there, and use them for a Separate Peace. But if you are assigned To Kill A Mockingbirg, read it.

This is a great book that at the end will make you think about life and cry. It is an emotional book in some places and fun in others. This book is about a family's life during the time when blacks were not able to do the things whites did such as go to school. It is mostly about a little girl though, and how her brother risked his life in the end for her. &quot;Scout&quot; as they called her, or her real name, Jean Louise, was a little girl at the time Acttius Finch, her father, defended Tom Robinson a black man. Mr.Finch was a lawyer and took the case. He would have had to anyway, but he wanted to. It's hard to explain all that happens, but if you read this novel, you will learn things in life that are more precious than anything else. It will teach you lessons about life and show you what is the most important things in life. It is an emotional story filled with sadness and happiness. You will share the feelings and times with Scout and her family."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"One cannot possibly read this book without thinking back to the innocence of their own childhood. Remember when people were people? And we couldn't understand why grown-ups talked about &quot;certain people&quot; ... none of it made sense. We were sure that all grown-ups were screwy. The remarkable thing about To Kill a Mockingbird is that Lee captures the moment when kids are shoved into a harsh, unforgiving environment in which they don't at first understand. With each turn of the page, the Jem and Scout sink further into the ills of society and drift farther away from the innocence they once knew.I love this part in chapter 20- Scout:I had a feeling that I shouldn't be here listening to this sinful man who had mixed children and didn't care who knew it, but he was fascinating. I had never encountered a being who deliberately perpetrated fraud against himself. But why had he entrusted us with his deepest secret? I asked him why&quot;.&quot;Because you're children and you can understand it,&quot; he said."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was forced to read To Kill a Mockingbird in 10th grade. And WOW! I loved it. My class was reading it together, but I couldn't help reading ahead a few chapters. I think its a shame that Harper Lee only wrote one book because, if she had written more, I would read the others for fun. To Kill is a coming of age novel more then anything else. But along with the two children, Jem and Scout, growing, the novel deals with heavy racial issues. And when Atticus, the children's father, takes up a case where he defends a black man accused of raping a young white girl. The racial angle of the book takes over. Harper Lee is a wonderful writer, her writing ties the book together wonderfully. This book left me with a sense of awe, making it easy to see why it has become a classic. I personally loved it.

I first read the book as a freshman in high school and fell in love with the story almost immediately. Harper Lee didn't just create a cast of unforgettable full-rounded characters, including Scout, Jem, Atticus, Dill, and Boo Bradley that have become a part of a cultural conscious, but she also wove a memorable tale that exposed the evils of racism, as well as other societal ills from child abuse to the flaws of our public education system.The story takes place during the Great Depression in Maycomb, Alabama and is told from the perspective of Jean Louis Finch, aka Scout. Scout has an older brother named Jem. Their mother is deceased and they call their father by his first name, Atticus. He is a lawyer and a respected citizen of the community. The Finch family undergoes some difficult challenges when Atticus is selected as the defense attorney for a young black man named Tom Robinson who is accused of raping a poor, white woman. The case rocks the community and becomes somewhat sensational and changes the lives of everyone involved with it.Having reread TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, I was once again touched by the beautiful simplicity of the novel. The characters are authentic and drawn from real life. The novel is set in the Depression, but the characters could have come from any small town in America. Having lived and been raised in a small town I notice many similarities between the place of my youth and the town of Maycomb, Alabama as Scout describes it. That doesn't mean that people raised in an urban setting will be unable to relate to the novel, because they can and often do. The novel has a universal message and story. That's why it's a classic and is a book that all Americans should read at least once in their lives."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is truly deserving of it's classic status.

Atticus Finch, an attorney, is a widower raising two children, Scout and Jem. The book is told from Scout's viewpoint. She is a precocious girl about 10 years old. The Finches have a full-time housekeeper, a black woman who is much like a surrogate mother to them.Maycomb, Alabama is very stratified at this time. There is the white section and the black section, the middle class white section and the poor white section. The Finches' , though struggling like everyone during the depression, are considered middle class.The story is about the trial of a black man, Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping a white woman. Atticus Finch decides to represent him and this creates all kinds of challenges for the family from the white community. The black community is very thankful towards Atticus and his family. Scout and Jem have to deal with their own struggles in school due to the stratification of the town and the many families that are angry at Atticus for taking the case.The story unfolds beautifully. There is a wonderful cast of characters living on the Finches' street that we get to meet through Scout's eyes. I think that as children, we all had those folks in our neighborhood that we liked or feared or thought were just plain mean. We meet these folks on Scout's street. We also get to view the trial through Scout's eyes.I recommend this book for everyone starting in high school. It is a book that has lasting power, that will be read for generations to come. It has universal themes of love, hate, racism, poverty, wealth, and community. Harper Lee is a great writer who has written an American classic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Each time I read this book, I find more jewels inside. Harper Lee has written a masterpiece. I'm amazed how she accurately illustrates the complexities of topics that are difficult for adults (then and now) to comprehend and articulate. The fact that she paints these pictures through the eyes of children is AMAZING. I wish she'd written more. Although when you write perfection your first time out, it must be hard to contempate topping yourself."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Part of what prompted me to buy this classic on audiobook was that Sissy Spacek was the narrator. I knew she would do it justice, as well as lend authenticity with her Southern accent. To Kill a Mockingbird is a classic that continues to endure today. The audiobook version, as narrated by Ms. Spacek, is riveting and engrossing. I looked forward to my commute because I knew there was more drama or just more of a wonderful story waiting to unfold!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"There are so many reviews and websites about Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird that it's difficult to imagine adding much to the discussion. This was not required reading for me during my middle or high school years and I recently read it because it was chosen by my book club. There are so many lessons to be gleaned from this book and I think there's something for everyone to take away.Told from the view of Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch who does not fit the stereotype of a young lady, this story highlights and challenges the assumptions that are often made about those whom we don't understand or know much about, the racial inequalities and prejudices that exist in our society, and the importance of family, integrity, and morality.The story starts out a bit slow, but stay with it and you'll be glad you did. It wasn't a page turner for me and took a bit of resolve to stick with it in the beginning, but it was well worth the time to read it to the end. It was one of those books that had me going back to reread and ponder passages throughout.Excellent read with layers of meaningful insights."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Never read this in high school, so I thought I'd read it with my daughter as she read it for her high school english class. I told my daughter that I would read it at the same pace as her class, but I found I couldn't put it down and had to speed ahead of their slow pace. What were my teachers thinking to have left this off the list? A beautiful piece of literary fiction with meaningful metaphors and lessons on tolerance that we could all still benefit from today."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I originally read this book back in junior high school and I loved it.

We are currently reading it in my 9th grade english class, and I must say, To Kill A MockingBird is the best book I ever had to read for school. Usually teachers assign stupid books that we will never pick up again, so I was really surprised that this book turned out to be so good. What's ironic is that I've had this book for quite a while now but never got around to reading it. I'm so glad I did. And somehow I can relate to Scout. I just wish I had a brother like Jem. Anyway, the first chapter of the book was boring, but the rest is wonderful. Unlike most people, who prefer action books, I like books that tell more about the characters lives and family and everything, and this is one of the few books that could provide this for me. Read it now--you won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird deals with large world issues while just talking about a little girl in Maycomb. I as a sixth grader couldn't put it down, and I entend to read it again when I'm older, because I think I will get something different out of it. This book made me cry because of our wourlds unfairness, and laugh simply because Scout and Jem were cute and lovable. I recomend this to anyone and everyone who enjoys fiction."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Just read it-you'll see"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"If trapped on a deserted island with only two books with me, this would be one of them.

The last time I read the book was 6 months ago. I think the total number of times I have read Harper Lee's classic has now reached 15! People who adore reading think I am crazy for re-reading a novel so many times. I, too, enjoy reading and when I want to revisit a classic story with classic characters I always go back to Harper Lee's novel. While writing this I am already envisioning my 16th trip through the book!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Granted, this book is required reading for many ninth grade english classes (I know it was for me), which could make kids not like it. But, even at 13, when I first read it, I fell in love with it because it made me think. As I got older, I started to realize the very deep nature of the kind of person Atticus was and the values he was teaching his children in the deep south. I can't help but admire Atticus deeply for the man he is and what he wants his children to be. The racism in this book is overwhelmingly powerful and strives to show the injustices that was and still are a large part of this nation. It doesn't promote it; it makes us aware. For all those ninth graders out there who read this book by command of a teacher, pick it up again in a couple years and then tell me if it was deep or lacking in the american classic ability. You might be surprised by what you find."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I had grave misgivings about even starting this book, what with it having a narrator who recounts her innocent childhood. What could I, a 50-year-old white male, an embittered battle-weary liberal, get out of it? Well... plenty actually. For one thing, the kid really is cute and precocious, and her lines are always remarkably apt, like Alice's. And all the other characters are similarly convincingly drawn. The seeming childishness of many of the incidents always have a deeper level of meaning. But mainly, the stunning matter-of-factness of the trial of the Negro and its foregone conclusion, and how life had no choice but to go on (to do anything else would be life-denying) reached deep into my heart and made its certain mark on my soul. Not all books have to exhibit the densities of a Saul Bellow or a John Barth tome. Some books can be quite simple and still succeed magnificently. This book is one of them. Don't avoid it just because it's read in schools. Thank God it is."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Our class had to read it as an assignment and i thought i wouldnt enjoy it cause i really dont like reading but i ended up reading it three times!!!! IT WAS THE BEST BOOK I EVER READ!!!!!!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The reason I first bought this book is because I was told that I would have to read it in the grade I am about to enter. Figuring that I would just get a head start on the rest of my class b*cuz I have nothing better to do. This book is THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ! It deserves more than 5 stars, but thats all they has to offer. I recommended this book for anyone past the age of 13 because I'm not sure if anyone youger than that would be able to understand it as well as older people. If you have the chance to read this book, then I highly recommend it. Please take my advise in consideration when you have nothing better to do on a rainy Sunday. A classic always and forever."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Every year I re-read this book. It's one of those captivating novels that you just can't put down.

The book's narrator, Jean Louise &quot;Scout&quot; Finch, is a tomboy from Maycomb, a &quot;tired old town&quot; deep in Southern tradition during the '30s. Although most of the novel depicts Scout's childhood, the last half of the novel connects with the beginning to tell a story that leaves everyone moved. Tom Robinson, a young, friendly black man, has been charged with the rape of a girl by a trashy and disrespected family, and Scout's father, Atticus, has been asked to defend Tom. The family's struggle through this trial and the life lessons learned by Scout make this book top-notch. If you haven't read it, buy it today- you can finish it in a weekend, but it will impact you for a lifetime."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"i had no choice but to read this book for english class when i was 15. i fell in love with it. even now, being 19 and reading adult books, this will always remain the most treasured book in my personal library."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; inspired me to look for the good in every man. It taught me that all men have a basic goodness about them. Even when evil men harm you, I learned not to judge quickly but to try to help them. This book was well written in several ways. The characters were well developed. I even felt as if i knew many of them by the time i finished the book. The settings of the book were described really well. I felt as if i had been to or even lived in many places in this book. The themes were popular and easy to relate to. Slavery, racism, and predjudice are still big issues today. Atticus taught his children that regardless of race, unusual manerisms, or social class, all people deserve fair treatment or the treatment they desire. To me, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a must read book for all teachers, students, and literary fans."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"When first given 'To kill a Mockingbird' to read as a school assignment, I admit, I did dismiss it as another boring school book, but when I actually came to read it I realized that it I was very wrong. 'To kill a Mockingbird' is written through the eyes of Scout, an eight year-old recounting the past two years in a childlike innocent way. However, under the surface of her young vocabulary and speech patterns, there is a very mature voice telling us all some very important lessons for life. The childrens' father, Atticus, their housekeeper, Calpurnia and even Boo Radley show us the importance of respect and tolerance of other people, especially the importance of treating other races the same as our own. Every aspect of Maycomb society, even the bad racist side shows us how and how not to behave toward other people, without at any time appearing 'holier than thou' or pious. The wisdom of Atticus in using metaphors to explain the most important lessons in life to his children is evident: 'It is a sin to kill a mockingbird because all it does is sing its heart out for us'. He says this to his son, Jem as a warning to not shoot this type of bird, but also the deeper meaning of not destroying innocence or hating a black simply for the color of his skin. I recommend that anybody who has not already read this book read it as it is a beautiful book with very positive messages. I think the best part of Atticus's wisdom is when he says 'You can never fully understand a person until you get inside his skin.' Think about it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is a charming love story that involves kids growing up and tells what they feel about the adult world's hypocrisy, discrimination, anger, and frustration. Kids' father tried very hard to accomodate them with what's going on in the world that they are not ready to accept, but the kids' purity made him feel helpless in explaining the evil of this world.U must understand the book is told by a young girl who has a incredible amount of vocabulary and remembers everything a person says (like Dr. Watson). So try to get use to it, if u are not charmed by the story which i am sure that won't happen, u will still like the surprising and abstruse ending."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This novel is one of the greatest modern American novels. It deals with one of the most pressing modern issues which is race. The story is told by an adult Jean Louise (Scout) Finch, who is looking back on the period on her childhood from age 6-9. Harper Lee first introduces us to all the eccentric souls that inhabit Maycomb County in order to give us an idea of how this town operates. At the beginning of the novel everyone seems like pretty decent people, but we see who are the truly noble people in town when Tom Robinson, a black man is accused of raping a poor white woman. Scout's father defends Tom in a trial scene that has probably inspired numerous people to become lawyers. Scout is an excellent and winning narrator as the tomboy who refuses to grow up and who is considerable smarter than her peers and clear eyed than the adults around her (with the exceptions of her father and Miss Maudie). Lee wraps you up in southern small town warmth and childhood misadventures that ring universal until dropping her bombshell of a trial. How that trial affects Scout and her older brother Jem and their perceptions of the world and of their town is a focal point of the novel. By the end of the novel, you know that regardless of their ages that their childhoods have virtually ended and they have experienced evil and have seen the evils that people can visit on one another."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Superbly written with a fine balance between the serious social issues and the light hearted view of our host. &quot;To Kill a Mocking Bird&quot; is set in Alabama in the 1930's and is told through the eyes of &quot;Scout&quot; the young daughter of Atticus the single parent town lawyer.The central tale of the book is that of Tom a negro falsely accused of raping a white girl, who despite his innocence is found guilty by his bigoted peers. The secondary stories concern the struggles of Atticus to cope as a lone parent role model, the difficulty of being a child learning about concience and empathy as they grow up and the mysterious disappearance of Boo Radley.The book builds slowly as it paints a vivid picture of the times, the characters and prevalant attitudes. Once the scene was set this book built such a head of steam I was unable to put it down. I read this book in one session, something I have never done before"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Excellent, tremendous, great, what praise can be said that haven't been said time and again.I have read about a 1,000 books and \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is the reason that I will rate many a great book will only 4 stars.I have no idea who could play the part of Atticus Finch in a remake but, Mayella Ewell could be played by Paris Hilton.Either way get a copy and read it, take if from an avid reader this is some good stuff."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To kill a mocking bird is a revealation of the injustice that is still perceived in America. It is a book that will bore you from the beginning but will push you to the edge of your seat from chapter 14 to the very end. Its a book for both the old and the young. Its a text book that reveals social injustices and the negative consequences it puts on society as a whole. I wish there was only one storyline, where Harper could have focus on Scout and Atticus relationship than the other characters. The book could have been breif and more riverting, provocative and captivating. But overall, I recommend this book!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"After seeing the video (which immortalized Gregory Peck), I really wanted to see the book.And I am really enjoying the book. I think everyone needs to have a copy at home! If you cannot, get a copy from the library. It is a jewel.

I got another version. Not a big deal as they all contain the same text just different page numbers.I had never read To Kill a Mockingbird and seeing as how everyone considered it a classic i thought i should give it a read. Having just finished it i have to say it really is a good book. I have also watched the film after reading the book and i have to say i didnt like it as much as the book. I love how the story is split into 2 distinct parts. The first part sets up and describes all the characters as well as taking us through their daily lives. Then we get to the second part which is the part that revolves around the main story of the book, the court case and its participants. Their are quite memorable characters here and each one has their own distinct personality that they live by.Basically if you havent got around to it yet, you really must read this book. It truly is a classic. I am glad i did."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This novel is one of my all time favorites!

The first-person story narration, plus Spacek's light Southern accent and marvelous acting skill, makes you feel as if a grown-up Scout is telling you her story. A wonderful listening experience -- highly recommended!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This past winter (2010), after I'd lost a job and had virtually no money, I was driven to watch my video of the film To Kill a Mockingbird over and over again. Then in April, I went to a tribute to the novel at Symphony Space in Manhattan, NY on the author's 84th birthday. The next day I took the book out of the library, and last night (5/5/10) I finished it. WOW!You know the story: in 1930s Alabama, young Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch, her older brother Jem, and visitor Dill Harris connive to make their reclusive neighbor \\"Boo\\" Radley come out of his house. Later, their principled father, lawyer Atticus Finch, defends Tom Robinson, a hard-working Black man accused of raping 19-year-old Mayella Ewell, daughter of Bob Ewell, the trashiest white man in town.If you've only seen the film, you missed some of Scout, Jem, and Dill's adventures, such as their plays based upon the Radley \\"legend\\". You've missed Uncle Jack and Finch's Landing, and Aunt Alexandra and the ladies' Missionary Circle. You've missed the secret of the old lady in the rocking chair. Scout and Jem's visit to their nursemaid Calpurnia's church. Alexandra forbidding Scout to invite Walter Cunningham Jr. to the Finch house again because he's \\"trash\\"--not because of his behavior, but because of his family's social station. You missed a quasi-romantic scene between Scout and Dill.To Kill a Mockingbird, at its heart, contrasts the all-people-are-worth-something approach that Atticus Finch tries to teach his children, and the some-people-are-worth-more-than-others code undergirding Maycomb County society. Scout's third-grade teacher may deride Hitler and glory in America's DEMOCRACY, but thinks the blacks are \\"gettin' way above themselves\\". The strict shadow caste system consists of whites of \\"background\\", money, or education (the Finches and their nearest neighbors), dirt-poor but hard-working white farmers (the Cunninghams), the dirt-poor and shiftless whites (the Ewells), and below them, the \\"coloreds\\". The laziest, dirtiest white is \\"better\\" than the most hard-working or well-mannered black. No white Maycomb citizen expects Atticus truly to defend a Negro against white accusers--and when Atticus does, someone tries to make him pay.The \\"shooting a mockingbird\\" motif symbolizes how this unjust system destroys the innocent and the harmless. This novel says much more than could be squeezed into the movie, which is a great work in its own right."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I saw the movie a long time ago and read the book very recently. I could not put the book down. There are many insights--bigotry and hatred, goodness, the angst of normal childhood, cruelty by children to others, integrity, etc. Harper Lee only wrote this novel.

They make it pretty well off due to the fact that Atticus, their widowed father is a lawyer.In the story, he is assigned to defend Tom Robinson, a Negro accused of raping Mayella Ewell.There is no evidence of this crime however and so it is a white trash family's word against a black man's.One subplot deals with Boo Radley, the subject of many rumors although he hasn't been seen in a long time.I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants a great book to read.

Their dad is a lawyer, so they get a lot of information from him. In the end, they definitely grow up. They are not afraid of anything. This book was very interesting. It's different from most books.

This book has many lessons and morals. I think the theme of the book is, don't judge people because of how they look or appear to you. The whole book focusses on racism. This book is about a mysterious man who never comes out of his house, and an ongoing trial in which there's a white man's word against a black man's. The setting takes place in the 1930s, which has a big effect on the plot of the story. It's a very interesting book, there are many inspiring quotes. the morals learned in the book can be compared and relate to today's life. I agree witgh the message that the author is trying to get across. Not only do you learn moral values from this book, but you also can learn more about how life was back in the 1930s time period.

First, Spacek is an excellent reader who has a unique way of giving every character a unique voice--both sexes, and all ages, races, and social classes. She even manages to project the feistiness and naivte of the young narrator (\\"Scout\\" Finch, who is about 7 years old through most of the novel) without being as annoying as the character most likely was to the adults she interacted with. Spacek's warmth and sensitive reading were essential in communicating that MOCKINGBIRD is a novel about how a community understands itself: the silences it keeps and the things it will and won't tolerate. Although I read the book many years ago and enjoyed it then, what struck me as especially interesting upon hearing it anew is that Harper Lee has done something very unique, she has presented us with a dual coming-of-age story. At the same time that Scout is facing some hard realities as she reaches what theologicans used to call \\"the age of reason,\\" her brother Jim is moving from childhood to adolescence (at one point he proudly displays a single chest hair), a time of troubling ambiguity. This dual perspective of reason and sexuality proves to be the perfect lens through which to observe the key events of the story, the ugliness of racism and the trumped-up charges of rape that Atticus Finch, the children's father, is called to address in his role as court-appointed lawyer for an accused black man. At times the novel veers toward preachy, and I'm sure some readers/listeners will find it heavy-handed. But somehow, perhaps because it is told to us by a child, this heavy-handedness seems easy to forgive."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I never was required to read this book in school and only picked it up 20 years later at the continued insistance of a friend.

If you've read this book more than 10 years ago, you'll be amazed at its artistry and timeliness if you read it now.I've read most every contemporary novelist who have renown for being among the best. While quite a few of them deserve such encomium, quite a few of them do not. To compare style, content, artistry, - then pure enjoyment with \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", none truly equal the work of Harper Lee.It certainly should be on the required reading list of every high school in this country."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"{Note -- I lost my book review, so here's my movie review. It should give you the impression that I absolutely love this book like you wouldn't believe. Yep. That's right.}My earlier review of the book amounted to little more than \\"rah rah rah, go read this!\\" Now let me go into some more detail. The story is excellent on many levels, and it's a bit more complex than a retelling of the plot would indicate. \\"Black man accused of raping white girl in the Depression era.\\" That's the court case that drives some of Harper Lee's novel. Gregory Peck won a well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of attorney Atticus Finch, one of literature's most memorable characters. And yet, in the novel, Atticus isn't the main character. This book is about his daughter Scout and his son Jem. Scout is our narrator, and what we see (and don't see) comes from her.So how did this translate to the big screen? Quite well. The child actors, both newcomers, were excellent in their roles. Ditto on the boy who portrayed Dill, whose part was far larger in the novel but which is good in the film as well. The book had a large number of plots and subplots, so the filmmakers had to strip some away to make it work as a movie. They chose well. The results are still as complex and multi-textured as life itself.I watched this maybe a month after reading it, so I remembered 90% of what would happen, along with much of what was deleted. I doubt the movie could have been done much better than it was, and I'll watch it again. I'm aware of all the \\"deep dark Southern secrets\\" from the novel, those that were in the film and those that weren't. I got a strong sense that the actors were equally aware, and that's cool. Nobody could fit them all into a film that lasts under 2 hours, so they only chose the most relevant. This is how it should be. I very love this film, as we say in China, and it'll probably be in my DVD collection until I die.Oh, and this is purely coincidental. Later in this newsletter you'll see \\"The One-Plot Wonder,\\" which I wrote over a year ago but chose to rerun. I made this decision long before watching TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. But this book, and this movie, are a fantastic example of what I'm talking about. It has many plots.

This book is an easy read and a great one to pick up again for summer enjoyment."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was one of the most memorable I books I read as a young pre-teen. For starters, Harper Lee wrote a wonderful account of very adult circumstances in the voice (and through the eyes) of a very astute young girl, Scout Finch. How is that a young girl who has barely lived life seen so much? Her father, Atticus Finch, is a very dedicated lawyer facing a very hard case ahead of him--a rape case that takes their town of Maycomb by storm. This book takes a keen look at racism and integrity in a small town.This book is so wonderful and I am so glad that it still lives on as a great novel, in the hearts and eyes of a whole new generation of readers."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I bought this product some time ago and got it because I felt the 'urge' to buy it. So I did and it is a really good read. I read in school years ago and it was nice to read again."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It is amazing to me how Harper Lee wrote so animated such a long time ago, reading the book felt like watching a movie before my own eyes. The book deals with a lot of different issues of the time and place of the story, but also of human behavior - in the past and some of it is still relevant today."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book was a wonderful one, once I started reading it I couldnt put it down. It really takes a deep look at racial issues in the South in the early 1900's. As Jem and Scout journey through having their father, Atticus, defend an african-american. I would recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I am a High School senior at D. Russel Lee Career Technology Center in Ohio, and I often look for books that I can find much interest in just by reading a review often located online. I feel as if I can understand and find interestand info much concerning a book if I read peer reports on it initially, and I am here to add to the numbers. I have found much interest in the timeless novel To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee. I originally chose this book due to I have heard discussion circulating all over about it, so I wanted to see what it was about.If you wish to learn and understand how the southern United States operated in the post Civil War Era you can take a look at a small Alabama town of Maycomb where life appears to be always tranquil but you could not be farther from the truth. As Harper Lee depicts it, Maycomb is a town quiet to the unseeing eye, but upon closer inspection you will see that anything from innocent child meddling to a town family with a history of misfortune and bad demeanor. As every town has its own \\"ghost story,\\" Maycomb has a story of a man by the name of Boo Radley. This name is legend to the children Jem and Scout Finch who are locals neighboring the Radley house. Throughout the story, these two, with the summerly assistance of their newly acquired friend Dill, attempt to make contact or witness Boo just to influence their curiosity and build their character. Throughout the course of the story you will hear much of the father, Atticus Finch, being a well known and repected lawyer and seat of the Maycomb County Council, is appointed and must defend a negro man, Tom Robinson, who is accused of beating and raping Ms. Mayella Ewell.So if you are interested in the post Civil-War Era involving partial racism and seeming duress, or to witness exploits of children in their seemingly innocent curiosity, or even a court case where sparks and bullets seem to constantly fly, then this is a story for you.I would like to take note for future readers that this story contains some harsh language as well as demeaning references to the negro race as well as acts not often seen in everyday life. I would recommend this excellent novel to anyone any age you begin to read, as long as you take no major offense to the story line and passages containing what I have previously listed above."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I never saw the movie with Gregory Peck and knew very little about the plot but I knew the book and movie have been regarded as classics. So I was expecting a great read and I wasn't disappointed. The old south's racial code of ethics, were written with a great deal of insight and I thought it was very interesting comparing it with our current day struggles with race relations. Needless to say we've come a long way, thanks to people's attitudes like the character Atticus portrayed in this book. A must read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I was an English major and had never read some of the classics, such as this book is. So, I read it. I hate novels but found this text to be a delightful read. It is slow to get going but once you arrive at the courtroom scenes, it is all worth it. The characters are fun to get to know and the central message of the book is great. It is an easy book to read; thus, its prominence in high schools, and its a quick read too.Sometimes you read a novel and hope that there are some undertones present from which you can make some strong conclusions about what the author is trying to say. Some books fail at this entirely; this one doesn't. It is filled with subtle meaning and revelation.

Lee really brought the theme of racism to life. She taught the real subject and reality of it all. She put her heart and soul into writing the novel.The only downside to the book is it isn't an amazing ending; it was somewhat bland.The story takes place in Maycomb, Alabama. The book had unique characters, who all had their own personality.This book is rated four stars because the plot was very strong and the characters came to life. Harper Lee created an extraordinary novel every person should read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this book 4 years ago when I was a freshmen in high school and this book still left a strong message. Harper Lees view on racism and mob brutality were dead on. This book shows how deindividualization can cause people to lose their identity and cause them to lynch and hurt other innocent people for no logical reason. The message is hammered in many ways, that racism and prejudice leads to everyone being more miserable and people lossing their sense of personality. Boo Radley is an interesting character who helps hammer the message of this book more clearly. My memory of everything that happened in this book might be a little foggy, but it is a classic and may change your views on racism and why people treated each other so cruely before the civil rights era. In the end, racism is never right, and people need to get to the roots of it before it grows out of control and infects more people."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book comes with such a reputation behind it that it seems a bit of a sin to criticise, but really folks, it lacks the tight structure needed to put it among the truly great.It's basically a series of charming sketches of small-town America before the modern world got its hold, given some sort of shape by the arrest, trial and conviction of an innocent man.Once the main plot is over and done, Harper Lee seems not to know where to go, and the book drifts rather aimlessly to its close.Wonderful, touching description of people and place, however, with Atticus Finch one of those quiet heroes who makes you feel the world is a better place just for having read about him."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Read a fantastic book Now I know why it's a classic Book came as promised"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"It seems most perspectives are learned based on personal experiences or the internalized experiences of others.The near universal narration of this book makes it accessible: a child at play, making sense of an patently imperfect and covertly hostile world.The point of view character, Scout, is a young girl, so young that behaving according to gender is something she has not yet mastered.Similarly, the concepts of poverty, racism, sexuality, and violence are unclear to her.As the story unfolds, through her eyes the reader gains (or revisits) these perspectives in a place and time that is likely at least a little different from our own - and thus the work is as insightful now as it was when it was written."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, is a story about a family that faces difficult times and stays loyal to their friends.

First of all, it's an incredibly engrossing story that sucks you right in and brings the characters and events to life. The book is deep because it digs into really intense issues like prejudice and injustice, and gets right to the heart of the matter and the fundamental flaws in people's thinking that perpetuate injustice and the irrational fear of other groups.The story centers around Scout Finch, who is the narrator. Scout and her family live in Maycomb County, Alabama in a time of tension and extreme prejudice. The story follows Scout from home to school and the courtroom where her father works. An African American man is wrongly accused of a horrific crime, and the town becomes conflicted. Tempers flare and neighbors show their true colors until, ultimately, a real change is made."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This story is a classic because it continues to resonate with its readers/watchers no matter what decade or century one lives in.I first read Harper Lee's novel in my ninth grade English class. It had a profound effect upon me. Growing up in Utah where everyone was pretty White I hadn't really thought about racism, I mean, I knew it existed, but I'd never been exposed to it either personally or in literature. So when I read this novel it allowed me to enter that world where it exists (I know it exists everywhere), but where it actually brought me into a world that dealt with it culturally as part of daily life. I remember while reading how appalled I was at the ignorance and hatefulness of these characters. I remember feeling akin to Scout and her brother and friend during their summer excursions and wondering who Boo was. I remember feeling injustice and sorrow and a desire to do my part to make the world better.So once again I feel a classic is a story that gets me thinking about the world, my own prejudices and how I am pulled out of my comfort zone. To Kill a Mockingbird is just such a story. It is beautifully told through the eyes of a small girl and allowed me to see the events in a different view.I was very surprised that this movie came out in 1962 since the Civil Rights Movement was still in its infancy. All of the actors did a superb job, especially Gregory Peck as Atticus and Robert Duvall as Boo Radley. The book is usually better, but I still felt the impact of the story in movie form. Thus, both have impacted me and continue to do so each and every time I read/watch this beautiful and poignant story."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"After purusing the many reviews, not much else can be said, except the summary would be \\"it's a classic,\\" and should be read by every youngster, especially by the age of Scout and young people gaining their independence and starting to think for themselves. The reader gains insight into the human spirit and behavior, even though you don't live in Maycomb County, Alabama. You don't have to - one size fits all. I read it originally about 1960 when it was first published and enjoyed reading it again - definitely an American classic."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Most of the time, I get really pumped about reading books. And most of the time, I get so frustrated and don't finish them. That, however, was not the case with this book!!Usually, my decription of \\"great\\" literature means a bunch of long words scrambled together into a sentence leaving the reader to meditate a REALLY long time and figure out what it means. I was SO excited to find out that this book wasn't like that!! This book was so much fun to read because I didn't have to stop and think every two seconds!The characters in the book are so...real. Atticus reminds me SO much of my Dad in the sense that he will think things out, and when threatened, he doesn't get all worked up. I actually got a kick out of the story being from Scout's point of view. The world is a completely different place in an eight-year-olds eyes, and that's what made so much of a difference in the way this book was written. So, I say, give it a read!! It's worth the time."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Whenever you think of heroes, most of the time you think of superhero tiers like Superman, Spiderman, and Batman; I think of Atticus Finch from Harper Lee's novel To Kill a Mockingbird. Although he possesses no superhuman power or abilities, he possesses characteristics few others have. Not only intelligent, respected, and calm, but he also is humble and just.Lee sets her story during the 1930s in Maycomb, Alabama from the perspective of young Scout recounting her story of growing up with her brother Jem and their father Atticus. Over the course of the novel, Scout develops from a nave innocent girl to maturity and acknowledging the evil in the world.Deeply rooted within this town is severe racial prejudice. Atticus exemplifies his justice by defending a black man, Tom Robinson, in a lopsided courtcase about raping a white woman. Subject to the town's attacks, Atticus persistently determines to defend his client, and ultimately proves Robinson innocent. Yet the biased jury thinks otherwise and still convicts him, despite the indisputable evidence.The mockingbird signifies the innocent in the story, which in the end is tarnished by humanity's evil. The two most prominent representations are Boo Radley and Tom Robinson. Boo Radley is distorted by society to nothing but a myth, but as the story progresses, the children discover more about him. Culminating down to the conclusion where Scout finally meets him in person, she realizes him to be truly good and acknowledges him as a human, quelling all theories she had of him before. Tom Robinson, on the other hand, is ruined by the white jury, despite Atticus' sufficient proof to show his innocence. Convicted and sentenced to jail, he attempts to make his escape and is shot and killed in the process, capturing the book's title.The story is not too difficult of a read, but the meaning is extremely insightful, containing profound commentary about good and evil, bravery, and innocence. In essence, I have never read a book as good as this one. It should be on everyone's top 1 list of greatest books of all time. Period. If it is not, something is seriously wrong. You better be changing it."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"I read this in school and then read it again recently (I am now in my 30's). This book made a significantly more profound impact the second time around. It is now one of my top 5 favorite books."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To think this is the only book Harper Lee has produced. But, as they say, it's greatest to go out on top. One word eloquently equals the sum of this book: earnest. The book is not politically correct (nor should any book be). Accordingly, I am sure the book outrages every type of person to whom Harper's message was written. The book tells of the injustices black people did, and have endured. The time period is late 1930's. The story line feeds the reader a view of endurance, moral right, truth, honesty, and that one must stand up for what is morally right in the face of many detractors. Verily, a book every person should read."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This book is one of my favorites and I was happy to find it in large print and share it with a friend.

The book is beautiful, THANK YOU"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"A great deal is made about the fact that Ms. Lee only wrote this one book, but when you write a classic how do you follow it? Plus it has always added to her mystique, also she saw up close and personal how In Cold Blood destroyed Truman Capote. She just went back to the small town she grew up in and has live a long and seemingly peaceful life. The word classic is thrown around alot these days, but if the case of this book it fits. Her writing style propels the book and the content resonates off the page. It's really a story of a decent man defending a decent man, and in the process teaching his children what being a role model is all about. As you read the text, you get the feeling Ms. Lee knows these people quite well, even she admits one of the characters is lose take on her childhood friend Truman. I recommend this book to anyone who loves to read, it's a must read for the centuries."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Saw movie years ago and cannot believe it is the same story I just wrapped around myself and lived with Sport!! The book is MUCH,MUCH,MUCH more real at 69 than the film at 30something!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Like many youngsters, I was assigned To Kill a Mockingbird to read as a 15 year old. Unlike most, however, the assignment was for speed reading class . . . rather than American Literature.Don't ever read this book for speed reading class.I always intended to get back to the book for a more leisurely reading that would allow me to take in the obvious brilliance of Harper Lee in more ways. I was pleased to find that my local library offered an unabridged reading by Roses Prichard (an actress with a Ph.D. in Communications from the University of Southern California) for Books on Tape.In the first 15 seconds, I knew I had made a winning choice. Roses Prichard turns Scout (Jean Louise) Finch into a girl you'll feel like you've known all your life. Take the time to find this wonderful recording: You'll discover more in this book than you've ever thought could be in a book describing the thoughts and experiences of a five- to eight-year-old narrator.Jem and Scout Finch are the only children of Atticus Finch, a highly principled lawyer in the small Southern town of Macomb, Alabama, whose wife died young of a heart attack. Unlike many novelists who cram their story into a few hours or days, Harper Lee showed the good sense to give us the family history and to let the children grow up over a few years before entering the heart of her tale. It's good story-telling and is great for character development.Jem is five years older than Scout but tolerates her company as long as she doesn't start acting like a girl. That's fine with Scout who prefers overalls to dresses any day. As Jem grows older, he finds himself taking on the role of protector as well.The children acquire a summer friend, Dill, and decide they want to meet the reclusive Arthur (Boo) Radley, a neighbor who always stays indoors. They have many adventures that will remind you of Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher in Injun Joe's cave.The book is written in pre-Civil-Rights-era Alabama when consciousness of the bad things done to African Americans wasn't very well developed among those who weren't African Americans. The only people in the story who seemed to appreciate the full horror of discrimination are those who are honestly trying to live the Christian life. But even many practicing Christians proved to be blind to their African American neighbors' needs and concerns.Harper Lee does a fine job of skewering all of those who are hypocrites on the subject of race. She even takes an appropriate shot at northerners who avoid the company of African Americans.In a way, this book was The Uncle Tom's Cabin of the Civil Rights Movement, developing the consciousness that helped to change some attitudes towards African Americans.The story also features lots of insights into Southern \\"justice\\" of the day -- inside the court, in the jury box, in jail, and in prison. To bring the evils of the attitudes to bear, Harper Lee tells us that it's wrong to kill a mockingbird . . . they only sing for us to enjoy and don't do any harm. By the end of the book, some of those in Macomb begin to feel that way about harmless human beings who do good, as well.You can learn more about Southern culture and attitudes in the early 1960s by reading this book than by studying a dozen nonfiction texts. Harper Lee got it right. One of the lightning rods for racial tension in those days was unwarranted sexual fear of African-American males. That theme is fully developed through having an African-American be accused of raping a white woman.But what I think makes this book timeless is its focus on what it means to be a good person . . . the story of Atticus Finch and his struggles with being both a good man and a good father.But years from now you won't forget Scout: She's one of the great heroines in American literature and an important prototype of what the next generation should have become in loving other people.Appreciate the untapped potential all around you!"},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Best novel of the 20th century read by a great actress with a great voice for this story. To Kill a Mockingbird is, in my opinion, the quintessential and best novel for America in the 20th century. Sissy Spacek's reading of the story is wonderful in that her voice has just enough of a Southern twang and the little hoarseness that I associate, in my mind, with the main character -- Scout Finch (even though you could tell that she had a cold or allergies or something while reading this because there are a few parts where her voice is noticeably stuffy). I've read this story over and over for the last 30 years so I know it well but listening to Spaced read it aloud was a new way to enjoy my favorite booka nd film."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"There's really not much to say.

This book really made me think about the differences, and similiarities, of our society from the period the book was set in to the present time. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to read a good book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird tells a wonderful and compelling story about the characters. Beyond the story, however, the true value of the book lies in its moral framework. Atticus Finch serves as a model for human decency and dignity in a world that far too often lacks these traits. By looking for the inherently good qualities within even the poorest or socially marginalized of his clients, Atticus Finch personifies the true goal of his profession, which is to provide each person with equal standing and dignity before a jury of his peers."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee's book is so rich in so many ways that it is truly astounding. I believe that Truman Capote -- a thinly disguised character, Dill -- played a large part in the evolution of the singular narrative voice displayed here -- Lee and Capote were childhood friends -- but never mind. With each reading this moving story sweeps you up, both in the lovely, humorous tales of youth in a simpler time, and in the rush of the rape trial, which confounds you with suspense and real grit. The characters of Atticus, Sout and Jem spring to life on the page -- these are people you wish you knew. But it is that overriding voice, spoken in soft, simple tones, that pulls you in the most. This is Southern writing at its most appealing. There is not a scene conjured up, a character created, or a feeling engendered that does not feel utterly true."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This is one of those rare books that could change the world if everyone would just read it.

The book is written in a Southern Alabama town through the eyes of an eight year old child who is unable to understand the true meaning of what is happening but gives you (the reader) the whole story. This is a book that touches your soul. I read it in one day and was at the time unable to comprehend the full meaning, but even then as I put the book down, I knew it was one of the best books I had ever read.

I am only too sorry Harper Lee has not written more novels."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"The award winning nove, To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee is a piece of literature I believe is appropriate for all people older than 13. This book is the story of a little girl named Scout growing up in a small, racial biased town called Maycomb County, Alabama in the 1930's. It includes her childhood adventure with her brother Jem and their best friend Dill. It includes the wisdom of her father, Attikus and her maid Calpernia. Even thought Attikus was quiet, mild mannered he was a very strong man. Also, the story came in contact with many peopel such as Miss Maudie, Miss Rachel Harris, , Miss Stephanie Crawford, Mrs. Dubose, Mr. Radley, Boo Radley, Reverend Stykes, and Mr. Ewell. This book illustrates racism of the deep south. Also, points out how children have to learn to deal with bigotry at a young age, and that predjudice can play more of a role than the obvious truth. Two examples of predjudice are against a misunderstood neighbor, named Arthur &quot;Boo&quot; Radleyand a black man that the falsely accused of a crime because of his race, Tom Robinson. The kids had specific experiences that taught them not to be prejudiced toward a person, despite what they may have heard about them. This book includes many charactors, but they all fit together very tightly in the end. I learned a lot from this book and found it hard to put down while reading it. To Kill a Mockingbird is an extremely well written piece of literature and I suggest everybody read this at least as once in there lifetime."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Lee, Harper. To Kill A Mockingbird. The story starts out in summer with Jem and Scout when they were playing around Boo Radley's yard. He was the neighborhood shut-in that everyone was afraid of. In one incident they were snooping around his house out of curiosity and they wanted to leave in a hurry because they got scared. Jem's overalls got ripped on the fence and he had to take them off to get away. When he went back to get them they were all sewn up. Jem and Scout learned from their father that it was a sin to kill a mockingbird. After a while, their Aunt Avery came to live with them and tried to make Scout into a lady. Atticus, their father, got assigned a case to defend Tom Robinson, a black man who supposedly raped a white girl named Mayella. The townspeople criticized Atticus and his family for supporting a black person. Atticus was able to prove that it wasn't Tom who raped the young girl because he had a crippled left arm and her bruises were on the right side of her face. But because Tom was black, the jury convicted him anyway. Tom tried to escape from jail. In the attempt, he was shot and killed by prison guards. Mayella's father, Bob Ewell, attacked Jem and Scout to get back at their father. Boo Radley rescued Scout and Jem from their attacker. During the fight, Bob fell on his knife and killed himself. Jem was badly hurt, but both children knew they owed their lives to Boo.I liked this story. It had a well thought out and intriguing plot. I really got into the trial. Atticus had an extremely convincing defense, and although the odds were against him, he proved that it wasn't possible that Tom could have committed the crime. Even if I were racist, the way Atticus composed and presented his defense, I don't think I would have been able to, in good conscience, rule the way the jury did. It made me wonder if Atticus could have reached down and said something to strike a nerve in the jury so that they would have felt morally obligated to leave racism out of their decision. The book got me convinced that they wouldn't convict Tom, and kept my interest when he was convicted and with the appeal. I think Atticus should have pushed for them to have a mixed black and white jury because of his own \\"equal court\\" justification speech. If it was going to be fair and equal, they should have had a jury with black and white people. Despite that bad part, it shows us how much Black people can be discriminated against and that we can look up to and try to be like Atticus in his courage in sticking up for what he believed was right. We have to make sure in life that we don't kill a mockingbird.I think a description of an appropriate audience would be anybody who has matured enough and lived enough to understand about the problems of racism and be able to grasp the importance of this story. Also someone who has the time to read the book in detail and get as much out of the book as they can would make for the best audience. For me, the best time to have read this book would have been eighth grade because I had matured enough by then and I would have had the time to more thoroughly go over the book. At the younger age, it would have sparked my interest in reading. I would say that as soon as a teacher feels that a class is mature enough to grasp the story, he or she should give it to them to read, preferably in junior high."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee really made the characters seem like real people. She gave each of the characters human like characteristics, which added to the feeling of the book. The fact that Atticus took up the case of a black man because he wanted to and not because he was forced to was also important. He did try to defend Jem even though the people in the town were mistreating him because of it. The book gives you a real feeling of how things happened back than. Overall it is a very good book and I would highly recommend it as a great reading book."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"One of the true classics in American litterature. A vivid slice of the harsh realities of life in the South during the 1930s. The book is filled with realisticaly interesting characters and scenarios expertly drawn by Harper Lee. A must read. The only dissapointing element is that it is the only novel I know of written by Harper Lee."},{"Title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"This epic novel is one of the best that I've read.This story has to do with the contraversial issues of racism.Taking place in the days where african-americans really didn't get respect,it is precise in every detail,and gives the reader a front row seat at the events that happen.Harper Lee is a critically acclaimed novelist,and this book gave her a place in the world of literature forever.-Great Book!
