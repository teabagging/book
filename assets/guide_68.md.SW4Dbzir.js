You can call them that. But they don't act like hate-filled zealots. The Four Just Man are civilized. They advise their targets they are guilty of crimes. They tell their targets to reform. They alert their targets to the date of their death. They even give their targets a final warning --- delivered in person. As the author notes, \\"The honesty of the Four was their most terrible characteristic.\\" Honesty --- how thrilling.Now the Four Just Men have a new target: Philip Ramon, the Foreign Secretary of Great Britain. He is a public servant of unquestioned integrity with a conscience in working order. And yet he is about to commit a crime. A legal crime. But a crime nonetheless: His proposed legislation --- The Alien Extradition Act of 1905 --- would send a great Spanish social reformer, currently directing his followers from a safe perch in England, back to Spain. Once there, the corrupt government would kill him.No reasonable Brit wants this to happen. But the Four Just Men are not like those of us who read the newspapers and bitch. Because they believe Sir Philip is a good man with a single blind spot, they have sent word to him: Drop the bill, or die. Naturally, almost every policeman in London is assigned to protect Sir Philip. The question is: Are they up to the task? Can they even identify the Four Just Men?Very quickly you will get past the moral question --- terrorists? vigilantes? heroes? --- and find yourself lost in the whodunnit. And the howtheydunnit. You may even find yourself rooting for The Four Just Men.How does it end? Glad you asked. Edgar Wallace held a contest when he published this novel, offering 500 pounds --- not a small sum in 1905 --- for the correct answers to some esoteric questions about the ending. Several readers guessed the answers. Wallace lost money. Or did he? For Wallace hyped 'The Four Just Men' as if it were a new flavor of Coca Cola. He took out full-page newspaper ads, put posters on subways and buses, even advertised in the movies. The publicity launched his career.And Wallace went on to become the most famous writer in the world.He was quick --- he could write a novel in a weekend. He was good. And he was prolific: 175 books, 24 plays and countless articles. The only title known to the contemporary reader? \\"King Kong.\\" Maybe you've heard of it.'We kill for justice,' claim the Four Just Men. On that morally uncertain but dramatically delicious boast rests the second of Edgar Wallace's titles that the world should remember --- and relish."},{"Title":"The Four Just Men","review":"If you are the Saint fans, you'll be also interested in &quot;The Four Just Men&quot;. They are also a kind of &quot;Modern Robin Hoods&quot; who fight against the injustice beyond the reach of the Law. I read some Edgar Wallace's short stories before and they were splendid. This book is enjoyable, but not so good as I expected. Unlike the Saint, the Four Just Men lack outstanding indivisualities that attract readers. Indeed they are nondescript and distinguishable only by names. When more than one heros appear, they should display different characters or abilities."},{"Title":"The Four Just Men","review":"Modern authors can learn much from this book by the late Edgar Wallace. It is an intriguing plot,captivating to the very end. The reader finds a love/hate relationship with these 'off the wall' protagonists who of high moral character themselves are also lethal in the resolving of their motives.Captivating reading for the mystery buff."},{"Title":"Postal Supervisor (USPS) (Passbooks)","review":"This is a very, very, very helpful book!!! Get this book and just study!"},{"Title":"Elizabeth I","review":"Anne Somerset's version of Elizabeth I is thoroughly researched and presented in exacting detail, but despite the minutiae, it is still an interesting read. Somerset expends some space on the details of everyday Tudor life, but this book is primarily an historical work, describing court intrigues, treasonous conspiracies and international incidents in presenting a complete overview of the most important political events of the era. Readers wanting a simple understanding of Elizabethan politics could probably find an easier volume to read, but Somerset's style is quite interesting, and serious students of history will enjoy this work immensely."},{"Title":"Elizabeth I","review":"This book is not light-weight reading. It's quite thick at 575 pages of fine text. It does, however, cover extremely well Elizabeth's reign and puts many of her decisions in their social context.The author has relied heavily on primary sources for this work and they give a &quot;flavour&quot; to the time Elizabeth lived in. You end up with a good feel for Elizabeth's mercurial personality. Her chronic indecisiveness and hatred of being forced into a decision. The mine-field of international politics, when phones and TV didn't exist. Second-guessing the opposition, or trying to prevent an opposition from forming.For an in-depth view of Elizabeth's life, reign and era this book is up there at the top of the list, if you can take the time to read it."},{"Title":"Elizabeth I","review":"I've read almost a dozen books on the Tudors and this is the best on Elizabeth I. Although I usually get my doses of the Tudors from Alison Weir and Antonia Fraser, Anne Somerset has truly written and organized a beautiful book. An impressive work -- better than any other I've read on the world's greatest monarch."},{"Title":"Elizabeth I","review":"This is an insightful and fascinating look into the age of Elizabeth I: not only does the author explore her complex private life, but her techniques of holding and exercising power and diplomacy - always mixed together - are examined with a depth that never romanticises this remarkable leader.The story begins with a frightening look into the battle for succession. Her half-sister, Bloody Mary, at the moment is attempting to re-convert the country with ruthless brutality to the Catholicism of her mother, whom Henry VIII divorced to marry Anne Boleyn, E I's mother. Thus, E I faced not only the normal suspicion of treasonous intent between bitter blood rivals with a personal twist, but also was open in her protestantism during the bloodiest epoch of the Reformation. While E I survived and was crowned as queen, the legitimacy of her claim was always under threat - her difficult though charismatic Catholic cousin, Mary Queen of Scots, served as a living reminder of how easily E I might be replaced on the throne. E I survives, of course, and more or less triumphs over all her adversaries, but she was never bloodthirsty.Behind this basic plot, Somerset masterfully dissects the machinery of government of the time. As an absolute sovereign, E I had the last word, but she relied on a series of deeply trusted advisors as well as a network of courtiers, with whom she forged extremely close (perhaps physical) relationships. They form a fascinating backdrop as the story unfolds with their attempts to manipulate while serving her. It is as complex as a Shakespearean drama and yet Somerset is wonderfully even-handed in her treatmet of them all, from Cecil and Dudley to the deranged and dangerous step son of Dudley. E I's missteps, pride, and personal need for attention and love are criticially covered in just the right level of detail: not academically over-exhaustive, but satisfyingly complete nonetheless. After reading this, I went to the National Portrait Gallery in London and immensely enjoyed looking at paintings of virtually all of the characters. Finally, the finances of the Kingdon, so interlinked with the patronage system she managed to keep her aristocrats happy, are explained in perfect detail that is never excessive. There is also a clear explanation of E I's carefully engineered religious compromise as embodied in the Anglican Church.Then there are the details of E I's diplomacy: she held out the prospect of marriage as a tool of this, ever enticing suitors, but never quite committing. It was a brilliant balancing act, in which she often felt personally vulnerable and perhaps even hopeful of finding a love match, while ever cunningly manipulative. This was perhaps the most fascinating for me, with characters surpassing her courtiers, such as the Duke d'Anjou, who preferred men and was later a transvestite before being murdered as the French King. But there were score of others, including Philip II, her great rival in Spain and former brother-in-law, whose Armada she crippled to make England a true world power with new naval techniques.Warmly recommended. THis is a masterpiece of popular scholarship, beautifully written, and elegantly subtle as well as demandingly critical. It is the perfect supplement to those who enjoyed Cate Blanchett's Elizabeth. The only thing that I would have wanted in this is a more in-depth cultural explanation of the Age she was identified with, but that would be a book in itself."},{"Title":"Elizabeth I","review":"Anne Somerset's biography on Queen Elizabeth I, was the first historical biography I had ever read. I became interested in finding out more about the famous red-haired monarch from the Hollywood version of her life, in the film &quot;Elizabeth&quot;. I knew the film version had taken some license with the historical record, but I felt that the more accurate and less glamorous story about Elizabeth, the monarch, had to be interesting as well.The story of Queen Elizabeth, both as a historical figure and a woman of 16th century England, is a interesting one and Anne Somerset makes it an easy and thoroughly enjoyable read. She goes into great detail and has many annotations to support her statments about Elizabeth, yet at the same time, the reader doesn't feel as if she is reading a scholarly work. It was such a pleasure to read and I found it difficult to put down.For those of you out there who are either intimidated by biographies and other books about historical figures, or think them dull, this is a great place to start your journey into these kinds of books."},{"Title":"Elizabeth I","review":"I thought Somerset's Elizabeth I was an excellent biography. At almost every turn you were loaded with so many little facts and intricacies that seemed to go off on another tangent but somehow ended up where it began and leaving you with an even better understanding of the topic.What I liked was how Somerset presented the information. She was not in awe, and her writing was straightforward and no-nonsense. She didn't try to make Elizabeth seem more than a person, and she included all the aspects of the woman's personality, including an outrageous vanity and an almost childlike stubborness.While, of course, a biography of Elizabeth I, it is not so much about her, but of every person that had a factor in her life, including a weak, disastrous older sister and queen, a father desperate for sons, the queen's favorite but court-despised Dudley, and her tumultous relationship with her cousin, Mary Stuart.From start to end, its only purpose is to be as informative as possible, and though it may occasionally wander, it is filled with detail and research, which is all one can truly ask of such a book."},{"Title":"Elizabeth I","review":"Who is the most important monarch in English history? The case could be made for a number of different figures, from William the Conqueror through Victoria, with a number of other significant figures, including Henry II, Edward I, Henry V and Henry VIII. To me, however, the most important monarch was Elizabeth I, last of the Tudors, who reigned in the second half of the 16th Century.Anne Somerset's even-handed biography follows Elizabeth's entire life, from her birth - a disappointment to her father Henry VIII who wanted a son - through the dangerous years under the reign of her sister Mary (whose brutality earned her the title \\"Bloody Mary), to her own lengthy term as queen.Upon assuming the throne, there was a lot of doubt that a woman could handle the position; in the half-millennium since William I, there had only been two female heads-of-state - Matilda and Mary - and neither had been very successful. Elizabeth, however, would prove quite effective; this would not exactly be a success for women's rights, but instead just placed the throne beyond sex to some extent. During her reign, the religious nature of England itself was transformed, the country became a greater European power and from a cultural standpoint - most notably through the rise of Shakespeare - her reign was a period of growth.Somerset is a good if not spectacular author, covering Elizabeth's life in great detail. Although a positive biography overall, Somerset does not shy away from the negatives. The marriage intrigues, the battles with Spain and France, the incomplete romances with Essex and others, the complicated relationship with Mary Queen of Scots...all are covered. If you want a good, detailed account of Elizabeth's life, this book will fit the bill."},{"Title":"Elizabeth I","review":"Anne Somerset's biography on Queen Elizabeth I, was the first historical biography I had ever read.

I could hardly put it down! Somerset does a superb job placing this brilliant monarch in the context of her time period. She goes into detail about court intrigues, political strife, and personal relationships. I found the book much more exciting and dramatic than the movie. after reading this book, I felt that I understood not just Elizabeth better, but the whole Elizabethan era. To top things off, Somerset's style is easy to read. The book is well researched and objective; never over romanticizing or over criticizing. Plus, it's a thick book so you get more for your money. I would have liked to hear more about the Queen's supposed virginity (Somerset goes with the Virgin Queen angle) but I'd still pick this book over Allison Weir any day."},{"Title":"Elizabeth I","review":"This is an excellent book and a lively and interesting read. Anne Somerset gives an insight into all sides of the character of Elizabeth. Her moods and feelings, (she was renowned at the time for her short temper), both as a woman and a Queen.The glamour of the Tudor court and what it was like to be in or out of favour in a clique where a careless word could in some cases cost you your life.Elizabeth did not suffer fools gladly and the book examines her religious feelings, her sexuality and the way she dealt with conflicts both at home and abroad in what was essentially a man's world. Elizabeth was nobody's fool and although she would listen to her advisers, she had a mind of her own, shrewd and extremely intelligent, and was quite capable of using her authority as monarch to make important decisions for herself.The book is a delight for anyone with the slightest interest in history."},{"Title":"Elizabeth I","review":"A very good historical novel (unknown if every circumstance is true).

The author presents a good overview of Elizabeth while sometimes going into excruciating detail. There in lies the problem. Much of what I wanted to know more about: court intrigue and the supporting characters were often given short shrift. At the sametime, the author works very hard to maintain the &quot;virgin queen&quot; myth, often off handedly dismissing evidence for Elizabeth's affairs. The book also ends abruptly, telling us little about Queen Bess' last years.On the plus side, the author does an excellent job explaining the queens religous views. Still, there are better biographies of this facinating subject to be read."},{"Title":"Elizabeth I","review":"If you want to know the reign of Elizabeth in depth and not simply as an overview, this is definitely the book to read. In 575 pages of relatively small font, Anne Somerset spells out who this remarkable woman was. Somerset never lost my attention. It definitely takes time to read this book but few monarchs deserve this kind of in-depth study as much as Elizabeth. Somerset never lets the reader get bogged down in any information that is not carefully explained. The author weaves the names, dates and events into an ongoing narrative that is easy to follow and never leaves the reader hanging. As other reviews have noted, Somerset is unbiased about the strengths and weaknesses of Elizabeth. She presents the negatives about her character, such as the Queen's indecisiveness and her attachment to a couple less than ideal males, in a way that gives insight into Elizabeth. The story never turns into a tabloid version of the Queen. And Somerset clearly points out the positives about this monarch who could dominate the men around her in an England that never before saw a woman like this one. This is a great biography, well worth the time put into reading it. Unless you are a professional historian, you will come to know Elizabeth as well as any 21st century person can. I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"Elizabeth I","review":"This is the most substantial and elegantly written of the recent biographies of Elizabeth I. Somerset is especially good on Elizabeth's character (indecisiveness was a big element in it). The book includes excellent summaries of complicated and obscure issues like the England's campaigns in the Netherlands. You get a clear sense of Elizabeth's learning and mastery of languagde, but I did wish for more quotation from Elizabeth's speeches and letters. On that front, it's helpful to read this biography together withElizabeth I: Collected Works, which includes modern-spelling versions of these (plus her poetry, etc.)."},{"Title":"Elizabeth I","review":"In my opinion this is the best of the numerous biographies I've read about this fascinating person. A balanced and fair, warts and all approach that allows the reader to form their own opinion. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Elizabeth I","review":"If all that you know of Elizabeth I is what you know from Cate Blanchett's two movies, then you know nothing. Even if you learned that Sir Francis Walsingham was her advisor and Sir Walter Raleigh was her friend. In high school I got an \\"A\\" in world history, and in college I earned a minor degree in history. So, literally, I can convey SOMETHING about the Virgin Queen. Like me, she had red hair, and Sir Francis Drake was her champion. And before reading ELIZABETH I, I could have told you that Elizabeth was human and that she was imperfect and she made many mistakes.Still I did not know HER. So, like movie watchers, I knew nothing.For me, Anne Somerset's supreme achievement was to teach me the SPECIFICS of the first Queen Elizabeth's humanness. She brought this lofty person down to earth. As I read Elizabeth's story, her image as a great person of history disintegrated and she became just a person. But she remains close to heart.Please do not misunderstand. This lengthy, though easy-to-read biography is not a psychological treatise. Actually it reads pretty much like fiction. Bloody Mary serves as a villainess. Mary Queen of Scots provides intrigue. Sir Francis Drake leads us to adventure. The Spanish Armada injects suspense. The impulsive arrogance of Lord Exeter makes us shake our heads with admonition. And Elizabeth herself emulates Shakespeare by exiting the material plane with pathos.God save the Queen!Extras: Family tree showing descendants of Henry VII (Elizabeth's grandfather), sixteen photographic plates of period drawings and portraits, hundreds of footnotes, hundreds of bibliographic entries, index with detailed subtopics.

He tells of his hope that of the many many stories he has written perhaps thirty will continue to be read. Then he goes one step further and says he would be pleased if in fifty years three of his stories survive.I was at first surprised by the imaginative and linguistic powers displayed in the stories. O'Faolain gives each of his characters a voice a dialect by which we hear them distinctively. His work is deep not simply in Irish landscape and scene , but in the foibles of Irish character. His characters it seems to me are often oddball loners with very distinct passions. In one story a man who lives for the sport of racing pigeons finds himself deeply disapointed at one pigeon, the fastest of all, who refuses upon reaching the finish line to cross it. In another a young girl finds a daring way of saving a trout that has mysteriously appeared in the family's well. In yet another an eloquent old widow tells the story of her married life to a group collecting Irish folk tales. Ireland itself is a main character, its problems its inner struggles deeply effecting the characters.These are very fine stories by a skilled master of the craft. Whether however they reach the highest level of modern storytelling that which in my judgment Chekhov, Joyce, Sherwood Anderson, Hemingway, I.B. Singer and Salinger attain, is another question."},{"Title":"My life and times","review":"for anyone who does'nt know, mr.peter cashin was the leader of the newfoundland independence party in the now famous 1948-49 confederation vote in newfoundland as to whether the island should become indepedant or join canada.as everyone knows ,mr.cashin's party lost {quite sadly i must say seeing i'm a newfoundland nationalist}to the confederation party lead by the universally known{at least in newfoundland and canada]joseph smallwood or joey smallwood as he is better known.this book is a great read as it is written by mr.cashin himself.this book gives you insight to what this man was all about and what he believed in.mr cashin is almost forgotten today in newfoundland,which is quite sad cause it's obvious he truly loved newfoundland like all of us newfoundlanders do.thank you mr.cashin for a great book and for all the years you dedicated to our people.this book is recommended to all newfoundlanders and those interested in newfoundland history."},{"Title":"Limit of Vision","review":"I've read all of Linda Nagata's previous books. As a group, all of her previous books were enjoyable and reasonably well written. The characters were well described and the plots were interesting. The only complaint that I had was that the books really weren't that accessible because of the level of technical detail. While I enjoyed her \\"hard science\\" approach in her earlier books, I think it also kept her from getting a wider audience. From that perspective, I think that _Limit of Vision_ is an excellent attempt to broaden her audience while still remaining true to her original \\"hard science\\" roots. In addition, I think that with each book, Nagata's ability to create a thought provoking and challenging story has increased._Limit of Vision_ is set in the near future. A trio of scientists has been working on a project for a corporation basically exploring the feasibility of using organisms named LOVs (since they exist at the limit of human vision) for any practical purposes. Unfortunately, the scientists are hampered because all biotechnology is strictly regulated b/c of a horrible sounding accident caused by biotech gone awry. So, their LOV experiment actually lives on a space station in orbit around Earth. Before the LOVs were taken to the space station, the scientists stole some of them and implanted them on their foreheads.This book is about the unexpected and unpredictable consequences of that action. Some of the questions that were raised in the book include: what defines consciousness? At what point does an organism stop being \\"animal\\" and start being something else? If an organism has consciousness, then do we have the right to just destroy it? And if we don't destroy it, does it pose a threat to the very things that define us as humans?It's not a perfect book. It does leave some loose ends. It might even be missing some details throughout the book. But, that said, I absolutely had a GREAT time reading this book. It read almost like a thriller rather than some dry biotech story. In my mind, it encompassed many of the things that make sci-fi fun to read - a fast moving plot, lots of technology well used, a real concern about what might happen in the future. With a little stretching, I could absolutely see the vision Nagata created in _Limit of Vision_ as being a realistic possibility of what our future might look like. I was also really impressed by the strides that Nagata has made in creating realistic characters.I also want to stress that Nagata is not some \\"new SF author\\" attempting to re-write Bear's _Blood Music_. First of all, she's been around for quite a while. She has several other books out there that are really well written, although in a much different style than _Limit of Vision_. Second, Nagata has written about nanotechnology in basically ALL of her earlier books. She's not attempting to re-write _Blood Music_, she's continuing in exploring a subject that she's been talking about for quite a while. In my opinion, even if you just look at the quality of the WRITING, _Limit of Vision_ is a far superior novel."},{"Title":"Limit of Vision","review":"I give mucho applause to Linda Nagata for her efforts in writing a book with so alien a plot. As an avid sci-fi and history reader, I'm always interested in moments of discovery and the unforeseen consequences.The author takes us on a very interesting ride through this story of computer/living matter confluence, and performs many aspects of plot-building and character creation very admirably. I have to say that I was truly intrigued with most of the book.The problem I have with this book is that it sounds like the author is trying to sound like a scientist without the benefit of being a scientist. A story this intriguing and mind-bending needed a lot of scientific extrapolation, and well-done extrapolation would have added a tremendous amount to the plot. I'm sure it sounds like I'm being picky, but this is very important for me as a reader. I don't want to have to fill in many, many details of the plot using my own belief system.Another problem was the ending. Very shaky and ill-conceived. I think Linda Nagata was trying to establish a creative and dramatic climax, for which I applaud her, but there were so many issues in the book that were left unresolved. I had no true feeling of conclusion when I finished the book. I don't think Linda Nagata did either.Great ideas, but it needed more focus, better scientific extrapolation, and more questions answered."},{"Title":"Limit of Vision","review":"____________________________________________I thought Limit of Vision was Nagata's best book yet -- she's gaining full knowledge & control of the novelist's toolkit.

In the beginning it tries to be an edgy, sci-fi thriller, but soon slows down to a crawl and attempts to be a hard SF novel. The beginning features a moderately exciting escape sequence, a satellite crash, and a tidal wave, all in about fifty pages. Then the plot abruptly stops. All characters quickly and conveniently sort out into heroes and villains. The heroes suddenly become shallow and predictable, and what they're doing isn't very exciting: they farm the surviving LOVs in fish ponds, while the outside world tries to starve them out of their little reservation.&quot;Limit of Vision&quot; treats its general subject matter - LOVs, an intelligent form of nanotechnology - in an extremely simplistic and straightforward manner, with no ambiguities. Despite having an incredible knack for mutation and problem-solving, they don't seem to pose any threat at all, and their &quot;mind-enhancing&quot; capabilities are hardly taken advantage of.The book's tone is essentially dead. The narration moves quickly, but leaves no lasting impression. Characterization is lacking and follows predictable patterns: a blossoming romance between the male and female heroes (who would've thought!?); an enemy who becomes an ally, etc.In a nutshell: lacking in both premise and execution."},{"Title":"Limit of Vision","review":"_Limit of Vision_ by Linda Nagata is an interesting relatively near future science fiction thriller, one that was a little slow going and perhaps even choppy at first, with disparate storylines and at least at first with characters fairly light on detail, but about a quarter of the way into the book became a riveting narrative with a brisk pace, great tension, and a wonderful sense of escalation. Though at least one of the main characters remained to me at least not as well formed as I would have liked and I thought the opening was a bit too open-ended, revolving some but not all (or even most) of the story's problems, it was all in all an enjoyable book.What is it about? I will try to avoid spoilers, but here goes. At first, we have two entirely unconnected storylines. The first plotline introduces the reader to two daring young researchers (so daring in fact that they are conducting experiments in violation of international law). These two men, Randall Panwar and Virgil Copeland, employees of a company called EquaSys based in Honolulu, are illegally experimenting with something called an LOV (acronym for limit of vision), a tiny symbiotic synthetic species that is basically comprised of an artificially-created neuron called an asterid housed in a transparent silicate shell (the shell not only protecting the asterid but also permitting optical communication, as the colonial asterids communicate with pulses of visible light). Originally developed to be transplanted onto humans (where they would be visible on the host's head - generally the forehead - as glowing gemlike structures, easily concealed in a person's hair) who suffered from unbalanced brain chemistries, the LOVs would help stabilize the neurochemistry and emotions of those that possess them. It was found however that the semi-sentient LOVs could mutate and produce unwanted results, including deadly ones. After a mysterious event which we never learn anything about (referred to as the \\"Van Nuys Incident\\"), the LOVs were confined to a low-earth-orbit research facility called the _Hammer_ so that they could not escape into the environment and possibly pose a threat to people or animals.Unfortunately, Panwar, Virgil, and their friend Gabrielle Villanti illegally removed some LOVs and transplanted them on to their persons. Conducting experiments in secret, they are discovered when Gabrielle dies (this happens during the first few pages of the book so I am not giving away any big secret here). Though I thought it quite remarkable that their bosses did not recognize the LOVs that they implanted on themselves (later this is explained away by the fact that Panwar, Virgil, and Gabrielle worked in a very loose administrative environment with fairly minimal supervision), the reader is not given much time to ponder this as their actions set into event a chain of events that includes the public discovery of LOVs on Earth, knowledge of a mutation of an LOV colony on the station to something approaching real sentience, and its escape from the station to avoid destruction.The second plot thread at first seemed to have nothing to do with the one involving the LOVs, Virgil, Panwar, etc. The reader meets Elsa Suvanatat, a roving freelance Thai reporter, connected to a distant agent online (Else, like nearly everyone else in the setting, uses a sunglasses-shaped and sized item of headgear called a farsight, a device that allows one to be online all the time, pull up large amounts of information, make use of a personalized nearly sentient and individually customized computer program called a ROving Silicon Agent or ROSA, and even see in the dark). Virtually broke, she comes across a strange story covering a cult-like, locally feared group of kids in Vietnam called the Roi Nuoc (a Vietnamese name that means \\"Water Puppets\\"). The Roi Nuoc are a group of orphans and street kids who are fiercely independent, leery of authority, nonviolent but not exactly working within the law, united by a ROSA that is both motherly and aggressive by the name of Mother Tiger. Elsa also meets an another important individual in the book, a Vietnamese man by the name of Ky Xuan Nguyen, a locally influential businessmen who she thinks is either the head of (or a head of) the Roi Nuoc or possibly one of their members grown into adulthood (as apparently all Roi Nuoc members are kids and teens).I don't think I am giving away too much when I say that the escaping LOV colony ends up in Vietnam and the events surrounding it entangle the Roi Nuoc, Elsa, and Ky. At this point in the book the separate plot threads unite and the story becomes fast and very interesting.All in all a pretty good book. As I mentioned, I don't think all of the story elements were resolved and while it doesn't necessarily beg for a sequel, it did have an unfinished feel to it at the end. The LOVs themselves are very interesting and it was fun to read about their evolution. I also liked the fact that the book was set in Vietnam, not exactly a common locale for science fiction stories. I also like the title, which on one level simply mentioned the subject of the book, the artificial lifeforms, but at another level addressed the main problem of the authorities and the powers that be of the book's setting; their limited vision of the potential uses and benefits of the LOVs as well asan appreciation for the LOVs for their own sake."},{"Title":"Limit of Vision","review":"I was riveted for the first 60 pages or so... the implications of the story at this point are profound, a thriller which places the contest of ethics and science on stage. Then, inexplicably, Nagata changes pace and it slows considerably.After losing the science/thriller pace, the story leaves doesn't drive to a full examination of the theme; other central characters, including the enigmatic &quot;Mother Tiger,&quot; remain forever obscured by mystery.Entertaining, but the utterly profound examination of the central question, having been abandoned, the novel languishes. After almost finishing, I left the remaining 40 pages or so many days before I summoned up the gumption to finish it."},{"Title":"Limit of Vision","review":"It seems rewriting Greg Bear's excellent \\"Blood Music\\" has become madatory for every new SF author to come along. This kind of recycling normally wouldn't bother me because it's a great plot worth revisiting from another author's perspective. What does bother me is they never get it right. An escaped biotech, nanotech, whatever-tech agent which alters people's minds and threatens a new order of human evolution should be scary. But though it's touted as hard SF \\"Limit of Vision\\" reads like a juvenile adventure novel and rarely generates anything more than mild suspense. It doesn't help that Nagata saddles her rogue whatever-tech agents with the unfortunate acronym \\"LOVs\\" --a name I can't help but associate with either Barney the Dinosaur or disposable diapers. But these LOVs are serious things which atain sentience (surprise), tear up a space station and start reproducing themselves after outgrowing their chemical-dependence safeguards (yep, JUST like in Jurassic Park).You'd think people would be a little hesitant to infect themselves with these LOVs (cute name notwithstanding), but not in this strange world where all natural human instincts are sacrificed to further the plot. Nope, in this world people can't wait to get their brains on the LOVs because LOVs \\"intensify your mood\\". Exaclty what \\"intensifying your mood\\" really gets you is never really nailed down, but it's a pale second compared to the host of freakish super powers imbued in \\"Blood Music\\" --or for that matter in any of the various Star Trek episodes of a similar plot. People may be willing to scrap The World As They Know It for an evolutionary upgrade, but it's gotta be a killer deal--imortality at the very least. I found myself rooting for the \\"bad guys\\" who spend the novel trying to stop the idiotic \\"heroes\\" from thoughtlessly passing out LOVs like M&Ms; even as they're mutating into that thing on the book cover. In the real world our response to such an outbreak could be summed up in two words: Daisy Cutter, and we'd be right. But who am I to question the author's assumption that \\"intensifying your mood\\" is worth the risk of having your world overrun by giant spiders a thousand times smarter than you who just outgrew what they used to eat."},{"Title":"Limit of Vision","review":"Nagata sets up the big questions in this book and then punts at the end. Her maturation as a writer happens right in front of our eyes but don't buy this book. The ending can only be described as 1) A cliffhanger designed to get you to buy the sequel, or 2) A failure of literary courage. In either case, this is editorial irresponsibility at its most heinous. Even the most transparent first book of a series resolves the major plot elements and answers the questions raised by the narrative. Not this time.None of this would matter if Nagata had written just another media tie-in, dumbed down and evanescent as rime. But it isn't. As Norman Spinrad noted in his review in the March 2002 Asimov's, this is a spectacularly well-written tale for literate adults, all too rare in the current market. If you must have more Nagata, enjoy the setup but don't expect a payoff. It isn't there"},{"Title":"Limit of Vision","review":"Possibly the decade's boldest voice in speculative fiction. Most writers hobble and contort their ideas to fit a preconceived plot or theme, but Nagata's mind appears to be wired exponentially.The idea of brain-enhancing implants is hardly new, but until LIMIT OF VISION, we had never seen a full-throttle treatment. Nagata carries the idea to its logical conclusion, and while the fears of the technologically timid are duly noted, they're shown little mercy by the steamroller of progress. The future is coming on fast whether we want it or not, and the author's point rings true: it's way more fun to be _on_ the steamroller than under it."},{"Title":"Limit of Vision","review":"A scientist dies during a forbidden experiment with nanotechnology, and her death and a journalist's probe lead to the release of a science which may ultimately transform mankind in this gripping story of a technological experiment gone awry. Strong characterization and gripping twists of plot keep this fast-paced and hard to put down."},{"Title":"Limit of Vision","review":"In my opinion, &quot;Limit of Vision&quot; is tied with &quot;The Bohr Maker&quot; for Nagata's best book (&quot;Bohr&quot; has some really neat ideas; &quot;Limit&quot; is more accessible). She has always concentrated on nanotechnology, but a few of her books have been difficult to follow. &quot;Limit of Vision,&quot; on the other hand, can be read by even those who aren't intimately familiar with SF.&quot;Limit&quot; is thought-provoking in that it made me wonder how I would react to this situation: protect the LOVs because they're an exciting new lifeform, and humanity could use a little competition? Or hunt down the LOVs because they may pose a serious threat to humanity since they obviously cannot be easily contained? There is also a great deal of social commentary, as in how humanity chooses to deal with displaced persons. I also enjoyed Nagata's extrapolations of how the Internet may work in the future.Nagata's writing is not your run-of-the-mill SF. She's definitely worth checking out."},{"Title":"Limit of Vision","review":"This is a fascinating take on the theme of AI and scientific experiments gone awry.The account of AI offered by Nagata is not the typical &quot;hardwired computer gains consciousness of itself&quot; theme (and its countless variations), but rather a story of the products of a microtechnology experiment run amok: small organisms that exist only at the &quot;limit of vision&quot; (hence the acronym LOV), mutate from their original design as human intelligence enhancers into increasingly sentient and dangerous clusters of life.This is the &quot;goo-iest&quot; AI story to date: and one of the best!The description of the evolution of the LOV's provided by Nagata is extremely interesting and disturbing. The plotting is excellent and the characters entirely convincing.A very enjoyable and intriguing read."},{"Title":"Limit of Vision","review":"I concur with a previous reviewer who finds Nagata's &quot;Limit of Vision&quot; to be an inferior repetition of Greg Bear's splendid &quot;Blood Music&quot;. Although Nagata does an excellent job describing LOVs and the politics of the mid 21st Century, her writing never seems as sharp or as lyrical as Bear's. Still I must commend Nagata for writing a fine debut hardcover novel. Fans of nanotechnological science fiction and hard science fiction will unable embrace Nagata's latest novel."},{"Title":"Costume Design 101","review":"I find this was a refreshing view point of a designer.He went into the nuts and bolts of the business,not just the artistic side. I enjoyed the book so much I ordered a copy for a gifted student of mine."},{"Title":"Costume Design 101","review":"A graduation requirement for my high school is a year-long senior research project on a subject we choose. This project includes a year-long research portfolio, a piece of work applying the research, as well as a 20-30 minute presentation. I decided to research costume design for films. The first book I found was this book by Richard La Motte, and it was the most helpful book out of all 27 that I read for my research project. This book not only tells of costume designing itself, it shows what goes on behind the curtain, the business of it, the organization and preparation involved in costume design, etc. This book truly is a costume designer's manual. There is so much helpful information written in a clear way, there are examples in the book that help the reader understand the information even more clearly, as well as some designs by the author himself. This book helped me ace my Senior Project, and also inspired me to study and pursue costume design for films."},{"Title":"Costume Design 101","review":"This book is probably THE most informative book I have ever read, irregardless of the subject. Everthing you need to know about costume design is here, in this book. Critical information when contemplating a career, that you cannot get in a classroom. The author has been there, worked in the &quot;trenches&quot;, for years, has had a successful career, and is now willing to share years of accumulated knowledge. I was amazed at all I gained from this book."},{"Title":"Costume Design 101","review":"An excellent &quot;how to&quot; for anyone in the costume or fashion business, or someone wanting to know more about the inside scoop of what it takes to make the costumes in a movie come together.

Even though I work in stage theater, its information is immediately applicable for all levels of productions. It has tips for organizational skills, outlines of how things work, who does what, advice on how to manage your time, working with actors, dealing with unexpected problems, etc.I've read it several times and each time I get something new out of it. Read this book, apply it, and you will be a shining star that gets hired again and again for productions."},{"Title":"Costume Design 101","review":"This book is excellent for those individuals that are breaking into the film industry in costuming.

This book is definitely for someone who is interested in Costume Design and wants to know absolutely everything about it, in detail (not for someone already in the field and familiar with how it works). It's not just a book that I'll read and then retire to my bookshelf. As I continue to aspire to be a costume disigner, this book will stay by my side for a long time.

I urdge anyone who is interested in this field to buy this book first."},{"Title":"Costume Design 101","review":"Having recently completed a costume design certificate in Los Angeles, I have found Costume Design 101 extremely informative. Coming from a fashion background, there are similarities of what to expect while on a shoot. There are quite a few differences as well. This book is very detailed in how to organize and really do the various jobs of any role in the wardrobe department for all types of situations. The author, Richard La Mott, explains his real life experiences in a fun way that advises any costumer on how a production generally works and the surprises you might encounter. This book is definitely a must for anyone aspiring a career for the love of clothes."},{"Title":"Costume Design 101","review":"I am a local community theater costumer. While searching for information on costume design, period costumes, costume construction and fitting etc., I came across this jewel of a book. Easy to read and understand, full of helpful suggestions on how to manage a costuming project even at this level. I have no formal training in this area and so am in need of direction. I have put the sections on breaking down the script to use and what a difference it has made in my organizational skills. The book is full of insightful gems, and even the areas where I will never go, like how to set up a whole department and what the responsibilities are of each member of the team from supervisor to designer to seamstress( I fill all those rolls), and managing hundreds of actors on location, were interesting and useful or just plain fun to read. Other areas like communicating with Director, Producer and Actors have relevance even at this community level... Mr. La Mott brings you into his world with important and valuable instruction as well as sharing some of his personal memories of the projects he managed. This is one of the most useful books I've ever read.

Over 150 sites were checked, of which 34 were considered Register-eligible. Some sites would, if additional investigations were made, contribute to the closing of certain information gaps in the prehistoric record of the state. At the time of survey, sites were exposed by unusually low river levels. Most sites have since been re-inundated.

I found the canoe trail information on these maps far superior to the information offered by the Fish and Wildlife &quot;free&quot; maps. The book is small enough to put in a plastic bag, and strap to your gear in the canoe so that you can know right where you are, even without a GPS.The content is certainly worth studying before selecting the kind of trip you want to make to the swamp. The information about the creatures and the plants you are likely to encounter made the entire experience more enjoyable.

I personally could do without all of the details on the various plant species but I love the in-depth descriptions on what is around virtually every turn. Traveling from Virginia, I could have also used more information on area camping and lodging. In addition, I love fishing on my trips into the Okefenokee but the book essentially ignores the topic. While the book could be improved upon, it is a fascinating and invaluable resource for anyone interested in experiencing the magic of an Okefenokee wilderness canoe trip."},{"Title":"Paddling Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge","review":"Look forward to using for a future kayak trip. The book provides thorough information, maps, and details. A good book."},{"Title":"Paddling Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer. This was the only book on the subject I could find, thankfully it is the only one you will ever need. I have done 3 day overnight trips twice in the Okefenokee Swamp. I am from Pennsylvania so I was going in blind on planning the first trip. I ordered this book from Amazon and was very happy to see so much info for planning a paddling trip to the swamp. Let me say that again, PLANNING A PADDLING TRIP IN THE SWAMP! This is not a \\"Fishing in the Okefenokee Swamp\\" book, it is not a \\"Plantlife of the Okefenokee Swamp\\" book. If the author went into great detail about fishing tips or vast detail about all the plant and animal life this book would be huge or they would have to leave out vital trail or trip planning info. This book tells you everything you will need to know to have a successful trip into the swamp. It covers every trail in very good detail as well as quick references on the difficulty of each trail. It covers every available overnight trip you can take in the swamp along with put-ins and descriptions of the camping sites. It tells you what to expect in the weather and temperature as well as what types of plant and animal life you will most likely see at any given time of the year. It tells you what to bring, both a required items list and a recommended items list. It gives you contact info for Okefenokee N.W.R. park service, the Stephen Foster S.P. service, and private outfitters outside the park that can provide you with boats and shuttles. It gives you maps. It gives you safety info. It even gives you a few nice pictures. This book cannot make arrangements for you or pack your car for the trip, but nothing is perfect. Make sure you get your permits in advance, you can't just show up. Also, make sure you don't schedule your vacation at work until after you have gotten your permits, certain times of the year are very busy and they only let 7 groups in the swamp for overnight trips at any given time so that there is no overlapping with campsites. They only take reservations 60 days in advance and this year i had to call every morning for almost 3 weeks before i hit an available day and was able to get a permit. This is one of my favorite camping destinations, the first time my brother and i did it we didn't see a single person for 3 days. See my pictures above and have a great trip.

Many of these don't really offer a process on \\"how to coach\\" or even explain what coaching is. Other books seem to be a \\"make you feel good\\" style of book, but don't offer hard skills to coach others for performance. I guess this is why the term \\"coaching\\" seems to be misused and abused which I find frustrating. This book offers tangible content and more.

I've gone back and read it again maybe two, three, or ninety times since, and it hasn't lost its vertigos of wonder. It has inspired a host of imitators (Brenda Shaughnessy, Karen Volkman, Mary Jo Bang), none of whom are as brave or wild or awe-inducing. That an author so unprolific should inspire a whole new branch of writing bespeaks the importance of this book; poets who read it often feel that they've found something that had been missing from all poetries leading up to it, and afterwards everything they read seems predictable, emotionless, and linguistically flat. The last time a book came along that was this daring and this powerful, it was posthumous: Sylvia Plath's _Ariel_, whose swoops and deft gestures of language don't actually come close to those of _The Master Letters_."},{"Title":"The Master Letters","review":"This is one of the best and most fascinating books of poems published in the last quarter of the 20th century.

And by \\"snake lovers\\" I refer to those who have genuine respect for snakes in their natural habitats -- not those who collect exotic or native snakes, like trophies, to be ill-kept as \\"pets\\" in their homes. Author Carl Kauffeld had a genuine respect & affection for snakes, and it shows in every step of his adventures, which takes him from swamps to deserts to mountains and flatlands throughout the U.S. Very well-written and fast-paced, this book is a fascinating read, made even more so by the fact that it was written by a man who understood -- a full 50 years ago -- the impact of human development on snake habitat, plus the very real and urgent need for habitat conservation to protect snake populations. Today's kids are being brought up on a diet of thrill-seeking wildlife \\"hunters\\" on television, who -- oblivious to their surroundings -- barge willy-nilly into the outdoors, seeking out those hapless creatures deemed dangerous enough to boost TV ratings. Author Kauffeld, by contrast, notices (read that: revels in) his surroundings -- the sight of a Carolina moon rising through moss-draped oaks; the fragrance of a swamp magnolia in the Jersey Barrens.... Along the way, he discovers snakes. Lots of them. His journey, richer for his unique perspective, is ours to share in this book."},{"Title":"Snakes and Snake Hunting","review":"Kauffeld is seen as a pioneer in Field Herpetology.

This would be a good book for a young (or old) fan of reptiles and field herpetology.The events in the book, mostly from pre WWII, and the period shortly after the war are well told and make you feel like you are there.Also look for Kauffeld's \\"The Keeper and the Kept.\\""},{"Title":"Snakes and Snake Hunting","review":"Both my sister and I read this book at our grandparents house in the 1950s and had the exact same reaction: we loved it!

Meet the most notable characters ever introduced in literature: Bob Cratchit, angelic Tiny Tim, and good-natured Fred. With vivid descriptions of Victorian England and enlightening dialogue, 'A Christmas Carol' will enrapture both the young and old throughout the year with a vital lesson on hope and benevolence for humanity. This, I find, is treasured most of all in this brief story marvelously crafted by the creative Charles Dickens. No matter how many adaptations of the book one has seen on television or as films, the real source is highly recommended and should not be missed. For if you do pass the book up, you are being just a Scrooge (metamorphically speaking, of course!)."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This is a great book for everyone! I just got done reading it for school! It really shows the different families in that time period of London! I dont want to give to much away! A MUST READ! Plus its a very short book! You could read it in an hour!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"One of the greatest contribution to Literature and Life. A must-read for everyone,regardless of age. Although Dicken wrote it back in December,1843,It still very much related to this very day. This book suits every era and even more now into the 21st century. It showed a great example what's is Christmas all about. Sharing,loving and giving...Charles Dicken's timeless classic about a miser,Ebenezer Scrooge whom couldn't understand the true spirit of Christmas. However with helps from 3 Spirits(ghosts) namely Ghost of Christmas Past,Ghost of Christmas Present and Ghost of Christmas Future,each showing him envisions of his past,present and what will happened if he continue being mean and a miser.He came to face up with his pasts, realised his mistakes and turned a new leaf and became grateful to life and learn to be loving and giving. He also learnt to be appreciate people around him and learnt to share his life with his nephew and helped less fortunate people like Tiny Tim. Eventually he honour Christmas in his heart.May Dicken's brilliant prose always be remembered. I quote: &quot;I have endeavoured in this Ghostly little book, to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.&quot; CD"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"ALmost everyone knows the story of the Christmas Carol, either through the muppets or Bill Murray, but few haave read the book.You should read this book, unlike many of Dickens other books it is simple and not over long. He simply tells the way it happened and no flowery writting, plus many scenes that are skipped in almost every version."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I think A Christmas Carol is the most detailed book I think I have ever read. It was filled with a lot of literary techniques. I could just picture the evnts happening in my mind. I would reccommend this book to anyone who loves the Christmas season and anyone who believes in miracles."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I was excited to read this free book until I received it.Unfortunately there is no table of contents.Some of the punctuation is different from the original. This is distracting and slows the pace of the book.Everything runs together. The entire book from the preface to the end reads like one chapter without a break."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"\\"Every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips, should be boiled with hisown pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart!\\"Next to the birth of Jesus, this has to be the most popular Christmas story. It has been adapted into so many variations (my favorite is \\"Mickey's Christmas Carol.\\"). However, the story still remains fresh and a pleasure to read.A short novel, this is still classic Dickens. His characters have depth and even insignificant characters are given a human quality. Of course, the curmudgeon Scrooge and his transformation is the focus of the novel, and Dickens delivers an enthralling, somewhat eerie story as the wraiths (spirits) of Christmas attempt to instill a human warmth in Scrooge's cold heart.There is nothing new or earth-shattering in the novel. Almost all the adaptations have more or less adapted the text of Dickens novel. There are a few extra places and people that are visited that don't appear the movie adaptations. However, overall it is the same story that you know and love, and a great way to get into the Christmas spirit."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"A Christmas Carol, written by Charles Dickens is a book of being given a second chance. Ebenezer Scrooge, the main character of the book, is a grumpy old man who feels he has no time for anyone. As an owner of a firm called Scrooge and Marley's, Scrooge runs the business while Marley has been dead. On Christmas Eve, exactly seven years from Marley's death, his ghost visits Scrooge. He tells him that soon three different ghost will visit him during the night.As promised, the ghosts of the past, present, and the future visit Scrooge. He is visited by the ghosts because of his rude attitude and his disregard for anyone's attempt to be nice, which we all find ourselves doing now and then. The past shows Scrooge how he used to be, which was somewhat pleasant but still lonely for Scrooge. The present shows Scrooge his actions in a way Scrooge has never realized, most of which are to his dislike. The future shows the time when Scrooge is dead and no one cares for him, actually they are happy that he is gone. All of these visions has Scrooge sobbing in tears and ready to make changes in his life.The book is cleverly written and fun to read. It often makes you put yourself into Scrooge's situations. My favorite part of the book is when Scrooge visited the past. I think it would be great to revisit all of the things you used to have in life. My least favorite part of the book is when Scrooge is dead in the future, instead of mourning, everyone is interested in his death will. It would be horrible to leave earth in such a way that all anyone wants is your money.As far as recommending the book for others, I believe its a great story especially for the holidays. If you are into the Christmas glee spirit then you would like the book, especially the ending. A Christmas Carol can make you angry, cry and laugh all throughout the book. Its a story of one man whos favorite words, \\"Bah Humbug\\" becomes sincere and realizes all that he can accomplish in life."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This classic by Charles Dickens is always inspiring to read.

It didn't turn out to be the case. Admittedly I am a huge fan of Charles Dickens' books and consider David Copperfield one of my favorite books, I felt A Christmas Carol a drastic departure from author's usual style. What I noticed the most in the book is the usage of the many five dollar words (This might be the reason, I realize now, that there are alternate versions of the story and especially in abridged form). Not only those words made the book difficult to read, they helped to provide detachment for me from enjoying the story and being immersed in the tale. What is worse, I simply didn't like the story all that much because I felt my motivation to be lacking when Ebenezer Scrooge was hand-picked for the journey. Thinking of the kind of a person he is, why can't a worthier person be selected? That's why I prefer the tale of It's a Wonderful Life over A Christmas Carol, and it did happen to a better person than Scrooge. One worst part about A Christmas Carol is the force to love Christmas to death. I am not too keen about this approach because it feels too religious in the wrong way. Then again, the entire book was too religious for my taste with a lot of overtones in a spiritual sense. Charles Dickens also gives poverty a role in A Christmas Carol, but I didn't like the part where a character is judged by how he views money as he sees fit. All in all, I found A Christmas Carol a disappointing read, and all of the characters were unmemorable for me."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Before reading A Christmas Carol, I automatically gave the book the highest regard probably because I was influenced by the Disney's movie version, at least that's what I thought the book will be like.

It's too bad no one notices that the curmudgeon had a point-quite a few points, in fact. There can be no arguing with Dickens's wish to show the spiritual advantages of love. But there was no need to make the object of his lesson an entrepreneur whose ideas and practices benefit his employees, society at large, and himself. Must such a man expect no fairer a fate than to die scorned and alone? Bah, I say.

Author and Publisher Gregory Augustine Pierce numbers it among his favorites. Thus, when he was visiting a bed and breakfast, he was delighted to find a beautifully rendered edition that was in the public domain. That meant he didn't need permission to reproduce the version he had discovered. He called on friends and favorite artists to work on the book design, illustrations, and cover. Theologian John Shea agreed to write the introduction. The final touch was applied by the publisher's office manager who, Pierce says, \\"found a red ribbon, put it on A Christmas Carol, and it was complete,\\" a beautiful Christmas gift.Shea suggests that those approaching the book as a \\"must-read yawn,\\" will be surprised at the connections to be drawn between Scrooge and ourselves, and the pull to consider our own past, present, and future. He characterizes the unconverted Scrooge as smoldering with anger, rationalizing against helping the needy, and choosing isolation over communion. Scrooge's conversion, Shea explains, is a result of \\"the unyielding work of grace, the theological atmosphere that envelopes the Christmas season.\\"The ghosts show Scrooge the opportunities he has missed, the isolation of his current life, and the promise of an un-mourned death. But conversion is still possible for Scrooge and for us, Shea writes, citing the end of A Christmas Carol. In the final paragraph, Dickens reveals that Scrooge had learned how to keep Christmas well and expresses the following hope: \\"May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!\\""},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I have always loved this story and enjoy the old english language which some reviewers did not like.

Dicken's has a way with words that makes it easy to the reader/listener to imagine the setting. Palmer builds on this with his rendition of the story, where you can truly experience the old fashioned dickensian christmas era. Unlike other narrators that summarize this classic, Palmer reads straight from the novel so if you have the book you can follow line by line. The story is told across two audio tapes.

I very much enjoyed the book and will make re-reading A Christmas Carol a new holiday tradition."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"A few days back, I read in an article on Leo Tolstoy's \\"What is art?\\" that he quoted, as examples of the highest works of art, Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\" along with other works such as Friedrich Schiller's \\"The Robbers\\" , Victor Hugo's \\"Les Miserables\\" and Dickens' \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\". Since I've read these three - and since all of them are my favorites, I decided to hunt out all the books recommended by Tolstoy, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" being the first of those recommended, which I hadn't read before.Believe me this short novel didn't let me down. I wouldn't call it as great as \\"Les Miserables\\" or \\"The Robbers\\", but it perfectly fits into Tolstoy's main criteria of a great work of art - that which :1.Flows from man's love for God and for man.2.Unites people in the common, universal feelings of mankind and in such a manner as to lead to the betterment of human society.Tolstoy stressed on the moral content of a work of art - and on the emotional impact it makes on the reader - on its relevance and effectiveness in leading to a better world.Considering these points, \\"A Christmas carol\\" is certainly an excellent novel.The theme of this novel, I'd put as: \\"A man's discovery of the joy in giving.\\"Dickens', it seems, meant the novel to have a \\"social conscience\\" - exhorting the rich and amply endowed to look after the poor and wretched - to fight ignorance and want.But he achieves much more than this -1. This is a novel about the regeneration and rebirth of a man's soul - a man's return to innocence.2. This novel clearly shows that man is never beyond redemption -that it is never too late to make atonements for one's past misdeeds. As long as there is a will and a future - man can always strive for the achievement of higher values.3. Above all, this is (almost)the ONLY novel which radiates a sense of joy, benevolence and goodwill towards mankind which would endear it to any reader.The way Dickens has poked fun at the wrong and the erroneous, blending this critical attitude with a cheerful, benign humor is an exceptional achievement in itself, for it avoids bitterness & unhealthy sarcasm - and, while the seriousness of the subject is maintained, makes the reader smile all the way from the begining to the end of the story.The way in which he has captured the SPIRIT of Christmas is wonderful - I never knew that Dickens could write like this. Moreover, Dickens is not concerned with religious dogma or the scriptures or Christmas day as such - but has gone straight to the essence of the Christian philosophy and has attempted to show its beneficent consequences on men's lives. He has used this day as a medium for understanding and appreciating all that it stands for ; the wider moral and social principles are his concern - as should be, for any writer of stature.I'd conclude this review by saying that it is my heartiest and most earnest wish and request to not just the readers of this review but to every person in this world - be a child, be full of benevolence, mutual respect and compassion that you may be joyful and radiate joy and laughter too, to all of you out there - make EVERY day of yours a merry Christmas - and may your life be full of the bliss and goodwill this day brings to men - as has been so beautifully brought out by this delightful novel.MERRY CHRISTMAS!!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Although I have never heard of the reader on this cd, he's great!

If not you must read this classic. Charles Dickens timeless classic, A Christmas Carol , will be read by many generations yet to come. One reason this book is read by millions, is its universal plot. The first reason that the plot is so good because of the wonderful setting. This book is in London during Christmas time during the Victorian Erie. It's about an old grumpy , cranky, great business, man named Ebenezer Scrooge; who hates all and is hated by all. When he is later visited by the ghost of his old business partner, Jacob Marley, who tells Scrooge he will be visited by three different spirits. This novel is great to read to kids and for kids to read. This book will teach good values such as the importance of being generous. This book has many good examples of kindness like when Scrooges nephew, Fred, says Christmas is a \\"' kind forgiving charitable pleasant time'\\". It will also be a very enjoyable book to read during the holiday time of year. This book has a great English setting during Christmas in the 1800's, which will really boost your holiday spirit. This book often reminds us of our often forgotten past, which shocks the reader and keeps them hooked. This book explains many aspects of the Victorian Erie . For example when the author tells the reader of the greediness of some; Like when Scrooge says,\\"' If they rather die' said Scrooge,'then they better do it and decrease the surplus population.'\\" (11) referring to the poor. You can link many aspects of the book to the time period in which Charles Dickens lived and wrote. Like in 1838 the poor tried to get the write to vote but failed because of objection by the middle class . So you can see some of Dickens inspiration for the book. A Christmas Carol is a classic that has been read and enjoyed by many, and millions yet to come. This book has a great history and plot, combined it is great for kids as well as adults. So if you have not read this classic to your family you had better check your! pulse and start reading."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"There's nothing like reading an unabridged classic.

When I received a free gift from Audible to download this latest version narrated by Tim Curry, I chose to listen to this edition instead.Ebenezer Scrooge is a miserable old skinflint who runs Scrooge & Marley, a counting-house firm in London, England. His business partner, Jacob Marley, passed away seven years before, and Scrooge runs the firm with an iron-first. His employee, Bob Cratchit, is given a hard time when he asks to have Christmas Day off to spend in celebration with his family. Cratchit maintains that it is only once a year, and Scrooge's retort is that it is \\"a poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of December!\\" Although Scrooge reluctantly agrees, he demands that Bob come in the following day extra early to make up for it!When Scrooge returns home on Christmas Eve, he is startled to see that the brass knocker on his door has turned into a likeness of Jacob Marley. Later that evening, he is visited by Marley's ghost. At first, he refused to believe that Marley was real. Marley's ghost is covered in chains attached to cash-boxes, padlocks, and ledgers. Marley warns Scrooge that he is destined to the same fate if he does not change his ways, telling him: \\"I wear the chain I forged in life...I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and my own free will I wore it.\\" Marley foretells of the three ghosts that will visit Scrooge.I read A Christmas Carol way back in high school, so this is a re-read for me. This classic still hasn't lost its charm. It is a heart-warming story of second chances and redemption, which makes it a perfect holiday read! One of my favourite parts of the story is during Stave Three, when Scrooge sees Tiny Tim's crutch and asks the Ghost of Christmas Present whether the boy will die. It is already apparent that the events of the evening have begun to thaw Scrooge's hardened heart.When I saw that Tim Curry narrated this version, I was immediately intrigued because Curry has such a big personality with a booming voice to match. He didn't let me down! Tim Curry's narration was fantastic! He does an amazing job of bringing Scrooge's personality across in his narration, and I highly recommend this rendition!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"As a kindle owner, I've learned to be a bit wary of free editions of classic works as well as various &#34;illustrated&#34; editions.

Even if you think you are familiar with the book you may find upon reading this one that you previously had read a shortened version! The completeness of this volume would be reason enough to add it to your library, but the quality of the pages, typeface, and above all the lovely illustrations scattered throughout further commend it. I have bought copies for all 3 of my grown children--because every family deserves to own a complete version of this classic story and this one is the best I have ever seen."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"A Christmas Carol Audiobookread by Jim DaleI once heard it said that to appreciate Dickens best, one should read his stories aloud. I have never had the time to try to do this, but having just listened to a new unabridged reading of A Christmas Carol from Random House, I can see the validity of the statement. Playing the CD's I felt as if the narrator was, in the words of Dickens himself, &quot;standing in the spirit at your elbow.&quot;And what a narrator! The multi-talented Jim Dale reads the story...no, that is not correct...Jim Dale PERFORMS the story. I counted 42 voices in the three-hour recording. Jim Dale is well known for his over 200 voices (and counting) bringing to life all of the characters in the Harry Potter books, which he also records for Random House's Listening Library.I first saw Jim Dale in the 1977 Disney movie Pete's Dragon where he played the bumbling villain. The next year he played three hilarious characters in another Disney film, Hot Lead and Cold Feet. I was lucky to see him in two musicals on Broadway, in Barnum, and Me and My Girl. Both very memorable performances. I plan to see him next month as he sings and dances Scrooge in Madison Square Garden's Christmas Carol - The Musical. I figure if he is great in the audiobook, he will be even better on stage. An actor has only two tools...his voice and his body. In the audiobooks, of course, only the voice can be used.And Dale's voice talents are well showcased here. I often found myself laughing out loud, thanks to the combined genius of Dickens and Dale. In a couple of cases, the genius is pure Dale. At one point he adds a bit of a dog's panting that really cracked me up.I have seen and/or heard other wonderful actors do one-man renditions of A Christmas Carol. A number of years ago a friend played a tape for me of John Gielgud doing an abridged version. I saw Patrick Stewart do his acclaimed one man show on Broadway; from the first row! And I have seen the author's great-great grandson, Gerald Dickens do his skilled and energetic version several times. They are all memorable and it would be impossible to say which was the best. But I can heartily recommend that Jim Dale's version be added to the family library. It is complete, it is accurate and it is a virtuoso performance.Although I certainly know the story well, I found by listening to the audiobook I was paying closer attention to the lesser known parts...the parts that, to be honest, I usually would skim over when rereading the book. In fact, there were several sections where I felt as if I were hearing them for the first time. Marvelous sections. I couldn't believe I had missed them in the past. Maybe Jim Dale's voice just made them more vibrant than my own inner voice.I suppose that asking me to review Jim Dale reading A Christmas Carol really isn't fair. One of my favorite performers reading my favorite story by my favorite author! But surely I am not alone. Dickens is universally known as England's greatest novelist. I wouldn't be surprised if Jim Dale was gaining a reputation as one of the world's greatest readers of audiobooks. They are both master storytellers. And to quote the Dickens himself, &quot;If that's not high praise, tell me higher, and I'll use it.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I hope all readers take time to read A CHRISTMAS CAROL in the original language Dickens used in the 1840's. Dickens' language remains humorous, descriptive and insightful and not inaccessible to most modern readers especially with the use of a good glossary. This is a great read aloud for families at Christmas time and also a great introduction to Dickens and other Victorian writers. Don't settle for an abridged version. Read this masterpiece the way it was intended"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I collect \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and this is a particularly lovely volume. The illustrations are wonderful and the overall quality, printing, binding and paper, is terrific. This is definitely in my top three favorites of all the different versions I own."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Although the artwork in this book is great, readers should be warned that the text is a heavy-handed abridgement of Charles Dickens's wonderful little novel. It omits far too much of the rich and colorful language of this stirring novelette."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I bought this book to replace my old copy that was lost during a recent move. The book is finely illustrated but the narrative is so full of gaping wounds that the entire charm of the story is lost. I should have searched a little harder for a COMPLETE version."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"As to this kindle edition: it's reasonably well-formatted on the k2, but still has a few typos; the spacing is generally clear. There wasn't a clickable table of contents -- like a lot of other free Kindle books, this is pure text only -- but since this is really more a single short story than it is a book (1065 kindle \\"locations\\"), that's not a major fault, and the price makes up for it.As to the story itself: I doubt there's an english-speaking child who doesn't have at least some familiarity with some version of it; I think every saturday morning cartoon series ever did some version, and every other sitcom. This is the original novella that inspired all those adaptations.That's the biggest hurdle when reading this: it may be hard for some readers to get past having heard some version or other of Tiny Tim shouting out \\"God Bless Us, Every One\\" in five hundred different ways every year of their lives, and some readers might find parts of the story hackneyed in the same way that other Christmas classics have become overplayed (anyone who's worked in a mall during the Christmas seasons will know what I'm talking about).Despite that, though, this is still a classic story, and readers who can get themselves past that hurdle will be richly rewarded. There's a powerfully archetypal story here, and one that still managed to tug at even my cynical heartstrings, even as overexposed as I've been to endless re-adaptations; I suspect it will do the same for most other readers as well, as long as they're willing to let it.Even if you don't feel like getting into the Christmas Spirit, though, it's a great introduction to reading Dickens -- probably his shortest major work, and illustrates several of his major themes (urban poverty, workhouses, the Poor Laws, the inadequacy of contemporary aid to the poor, and, generally speaking, man's inhumanity to man). The language is fairly accessible even to a modern reader (Dickens frequently gave public readings of it).Perhaps most interesting is how much influence this single story has had on our entire modern conception of the Christmas holiday -- it's this one tale that in many ways created, idealized, and shaped the modern notion of Christmas, almost singlehandedly transforming Christmas from the celebration of a sacred holiday to the celebration of a family feast. In the century or two prior to this, the holiday had primarily been seen as a twelve-day rural celebration by a whole village or manorial community -- a celebration that had largely fallen on hard times, due both to Cromwell's Puritan abolishment of Christmas celebrations during the 1640's and 50's and (more crushingly) the increasing urbanization and industrialization of British life, which made such celebrations impractical or impossible. This single story took what had been a dying tradition and revitalized it for the industrial era, refocusing it on the (relatively) secular themes of charity, love, friendship, and the nuclear family -- the same ideas, essentially, that are commonly held at the heart of our Christmas holidays today -- and showing urban families a way to celebrate the holiday and make it meaningful. In a very real way, this story saved Christmas.So, if you haven't already read it, do so. It's the original -- often imitated, never duplicated. It might tug your heartstrings, and there's something to learn, too, both about the history of the Christmas holiday and its modern meaning.If you decide after this that you want to read more Dickens, he wrote a number of other \\"Christmas Tales\\" -- \\"The Cricket on the Hearth\\" and a few others. For the most part they're skippable, not up to the archetypal heights Dickens struck with _Carol_. Instead, I'd recommendDavid Copperfield; it was Dickens' favorite of his own books, probably the best of his longer works, and it both compares well with \\"Carol\\" and strikes on many of the same themes (charity, social injustice, cruelty)."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I've been shopping on Amazon for years and this is the first review I've ever left for a purchase I made; that's how impressed I was with this book.

A majority of the pages have beautiful illustrations that wrap into the text or take the entire page, the binding and cover is understated yet perfect for this book. This is the unabridged version, the original text of the author.

I was thrilled to find out that Mr. Dale had recorded \\"A Christmas Carol\\" because I've listened to many many hours (and more voices than hours!) of Mr. Dale.One of the great strengths of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is that it can be presented in many different ways and appeal to a variety of people at many ages. I've seen and listened to, live or recorded, Owens, Sims, Barrymore, Stewart and even Mr. Magoo perform this story but I knew Mr. Dale could bring something new to it.I'd forgotten that Crachit had no topcoat and Scrooge's niece had kissable lips. I'd lost the memory of Scrooge trying to put out the light of the Ghost of Christmas Past and was glad to be reminded of all of the descriptions of food that Dickens layers throughout the book. I love listening to the English phrases and words that had slipped from our common usage. When I was young I thought the Ghost of Christmas Future was not much of a threat, but now, deep into middle age and a cancer survivor, I see that hooded figure quite differently.It's a wonderful story, told with a fresh view from a beloved voice. What a great Christmas present!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Some songs, customs, and stories are so beloved, so familiar that they have become an integral part of our holiday celebrations. It wouldn't be the 4th of July without a parade; it wouldn't be Valentine's Day without a heart shaped box; and it wouldn't be Christmas without hearing \\"Silent Night\\" and a reading of \\"A Christmas Carol.\\"Every once in a while another version or recording comes along that makes the familiar seem new, we hear it as though for the first time. That is certainly the case with this performance of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" by the irrepressible Jonathan Winters. He inhabits every character from Scrooge to his housekeeper to Tiny Tim, offering in his own incomparable manner the way he thinks each character would sound.Never has a Scrooge been meaner, a ghost more menacing or Tiny Tim more winning. Mr. Winters has been called \\"a one-man theatrical troupe\\" - indeed, he is as he not only presents amazingly different voices but sound effects as well.

But it is worth the effort"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I doubt if there's been a Christmas season in the last thirty years that I haven't read, watched or listened to A Christmas Carol, in some form or another. Like King Lear, every actor reaches a point in his career where he wants to stamp his mark on this classic, so you have to be really quite special to compete with the crowd. Fortunately, this reading by Tom Baker IS really quite special!I approached this with some trepidation because, much though I like Baker, for me the definitive version is Patrick Stewart's and I doubted Baker could match him. I was wrong - Baker brings drama, fear, sorrow and ultimately joy to the story just as much as Stewart does. As with all of the best of the Dickens' narrators/performers, (Callow and Margolyes, as well as Stewart, spring to mind), Baker has a huge personality and a powerful voice - necessary to fill the shoes of Dickens' larger-than-life creations. Although this is a straight reading, Baker uses his fine acting skills to give each character an individual identity. I enjoyed the occasional background music and other sound effects at the more dramatic points and felt that they added to the overall performance.I intended to listen in instalments but by the time the first disc ended, I was so hooked I ended up listening to the whole thing in one session. Not better than Stewart (not possible!) but as good, and of course this is the unabridged version. Three hours of pure listening pleasure - this set will now join my select collection of Christmas Carols, to be brought out and savoured time and again over many Christmases to come. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Though it is clearly stated in the product description, I didn't notice that the beautiful Rackham illustrations have been rendered into black and white until I got the book.

This year I thought it was time that I upgraded from the old paperbacks I had and got a really nice version of the story.

The first thing you'll notice is the size and weight of the book. This thing is heavy. Always the sign of a quality book, the pages are thick and of the highest quality and the covers are thick and sturdy. Its a rare thing in this day and age to come across such a well made book. Its the sort of book that looks great on a book shelf or coffee table but will also hold up to many years of reading.The second thing I need to mention is the illustrations. Sprinkled throughout the book are many illustrations by Robert Ingpen recreating key moments and they are, quite simply, beautiful. Robert Ingpen has captured Charles Dickens' Victorian England and the characters and mood of a Christmas Carol perfectly.I cant recommend this book highly enough (and I'm picky when it comes to these things), its the sort of book that could become a treasured family heirloom and be read for many years to come.

That's how Dickens was used to writing and publishing, so his books are almost better read serial style.I purchased this particular copy for someone who was in jail and the redemption theme of the story is perfect for this purpose, I think, without being preachy.

It is filled with the stuff that modern America needs: A decent respect for humanity, a will to help the sick, the tired, the poor, the hungry, the weak, the crippled. Scrooge changed and so can the current tendency to disrepect and discourtesy anyone and everything. The plot of the story is well known: Jacob Marley returns from the grave to warn Scrooge that the chance to help people and the chance to get great joy by helping people will vanish after death. Alas, it's too late for poor Marley who must prowl about the globe seeing terrible things that he could have helped while alive but now cannot help at all. The moral reality of the idea of the strengthless dead needs greater emphasis than it usually gets: The time to do good is now, now, now.

Almost everyone, from young children to senior citizens, has at least seen it in a screen adaptation. It has become an integral part of the Christmas season, an immortal classic, beloved by both young and old. That said, if you have never read the original text, you owe it to yourself to do so. This story, though short and simple, is a timeless classic for a reason: it is immaculately written, has a great theme, and is undeniably heartwarming. Dickens is at his brief best here, deftly and skillfully weaving this immortal story in a spellbinding manner, making great and timeless art out of what would have been an overly-sugary-sweet mess in the hands of a lesser writer. This story is good enough, and well-written enough, to melt the cold hard of any cynic. The prose style he uses in this book is just about perfect: it makes for a fast-paced read which can easily be read in one setting, while also managing to be entertaining, and even suspenseful -- with a fine moral to boot. The story is also more than it seems: in addition to the simple morality tale, Dickens manages to weave in some social criticism, while also intermixing elements of horror and not a slight bit of humor. This is one of the few books that I truly recommend to everyone. Everyone can read it, and everyone can enjoy it.

People can change, and anyone can improve, and that is the message of the season.Dickens' genius is not only his vivid description, but also his thought compression. It is only 68 pages long, so it can be read in one setting. I try to do thins, since the story has greater force if it is swallowed whole, without any commercial breaks. It is the pinnacle of Christian Fantasy."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"In his 'A Christmas Carol', Dickens seems to be sending a message of gratefulness for us having to celebrate Christmas Day once a year inspite of the bitterness, sadness and hatred we sometimes feel the whole year round. Just the thought of having Christmas itself is enough reason for us to be thankful and to forgive and forget, Dickens seems to be saying.Also in this book, Dickens seems to be telling grown-ups to take care of the children. Ebenezer Scrooge has an axe to grind with the world with all he had experienced in his childhood and early adulthood. Who would not feel the same way as Scrooge after all what his early life had offered him? As when the Ghost of Christmas Past is showing to Scrooge the school scene when all young Scrooge's classmates have left for the Holidays and Scrooge's younger sister is trying to make him come home, too, but he is not inclined to do so. Dickens was constantly haunted by his traumatic experiences as a little lonely boy working in a blacking factory in industrial-age London. Dickens knew he lost a significant part of his life -- his childhood -- that he seemed to have brezzed by it straight into adulthood. He knew how important childhood experiences were as foundation of everybody's personalities that he seemed he wouldn't want other children to experience the hardships he went through as a child. And, through his 'Carol', Dickens has forever reminded adults about this particular sentiment of his.Dickens shows us how the love of money, the root of all evil, transformed a bitter, vengeful Scrooge to an old, cold man. One very poignant, heart-breaking scene of the story is when Arabella, young man Scrooge's object of affection, explains how, because of Scrooge's yearning to become financially successful in her eyes, she feels like somebody has replaced her in Scrooge's heart.Embedded in the story is the Biblical promise of redemption and salvation once a man has been born again like a child. Indeed, Scrooge, at the end of the story, on Christmas Day, feels like he's little again when he realized that there is still a chance for him to change his ways after the visit of the last specter, the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come.If there is one book that should be read during Christmastime by both grown-ups and children, it is this book , 'A Christmas Carol'. Charles Dickens has, indeed, given us an eternal Christmas gift."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol is read annually along with any and all movie versions. The tale is so simple yet so full of detail. Scrooge is every man who lets life get him down until something changes the status quo. The use of spirits to guide a person to a better path in life is so in tune with the 1990s where everyone is searching for miracles whether they involve spirits or angels or whatever. A true classic that has withstood the test of time and will continue to delight for generations to come."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I think this book should be made compulsory reading in schools. It is defiantly one of the great classics. It is timeless, it is still as good today as the day it was first released. I have read few books that would match up to this one. This book can be read by all ages and by people in all warps off life and can be enjoyed by all. I would recommend this book to any one and hope that all have the satisfaction of reading it."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"The Christmas story is one of the most well know stories in history. It is not just a story, it shows how people should, and shouldn't act on Christmas holiday. The Christmas story is a great book, and even though it is old, it is still popular."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This is the classic tale by of Ebenezer Scrooge who receives a visit from the ghost of Marley, his late business partner, on Christmas Eve. Scrooge then travels to the past, present, and future with three ghosts. The Ghost of Christmas Future shows Schrooge what his funeral will be like and what the future holds if he doesn't mend his ways. This is a story that lifts up one's spirits, not only at Christmas time, but throughout the year. I recommend it highly to everyone. I usually reread it every Christmas. Several individuals have also pointed out that not only is this an early time-traveling story (perhaps the earliest), it is also probably the earliest story about alternative futures, later popular among science fiction writers as well as historians."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"If you have to choose the story among the Christmas stories I think you should have Ch.Dickens' &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; among your finalists and many of us might find it as the final choice. Some characters of the story even expand the spheres of Christmas; in the first place we will probably mention Ebenezer Scrooge, who has inspired e.g. Walt Disney quite a lot. It might be that his feathered equivalent, even more prosperous than the (finally) good Ebenezer,is today better known than Dickens' original. One more reason to read the book! Among the rest I'll only mention &quot;Tiny Tim&quot;, who has lent his name at least to a tasty species of minitomatoes. The author mixes cunningly facts concerning the social contrasts in 19th century England, rich owners and poor workers, with fictitious ghosts. The latter allow him to move in time, these moves are more related to personal and moral matters than to possible changes in the social frames. The social frames of the story are as well international as English, and they cover - mostly and luckily in a more lenient form - all the ages. The darkest time of the year might make it easier to believe in ghosts or at least accept easier the ones who do so? We can follow how Mr Scrooge's opinions about the members of his staff change, he realizes that he has got some duties towards the people working for him, not just rights to use their skills and time. A kind person is easy to deal with all the year around, one of the wonders of the Yule Tide is that quite a lot of the naughty ones start to behave themselves rather humanly, too. Stories like &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; might not just bring the reader the right Christmas feeling, but also make some people to change their attitudes - at best not just till Boxing Day Eve but till the next Christmas!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I ordered this thinking I could listen to the story on the Kindle iPad.

Who has not heard the words: \\"Bah! Humbug\\" or known that Scrooge was one of the most disagreeable characters in literature? This story is fairly short and only takes a few hours to read but it will leave you with the hope that if Scrooge could change there is hope for everyone. The plot is simple. Scrooge is visited by his dead friend Marley who informs him that he will be visited by three spirits. These three spirits take him on different journey's to show him memories from his past, what is happening in the present and then what will happen in the future if he continues to live his life in a selfish way. During these journey's we get some insight into why Scrooge became such a horrid man. This story is great to read at Christmas time and it has a very happy ending.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Dickens' A Christmas Carol is a treasure, worth reading and rereading. The free electronic version has formatting issues, particularly with the placement of paragraph breaks and with indentation but it is still very readable. It has no illustrations."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Peculiar as it seems there is surprising and substantial spiritual consolation to be found in finally contriving to live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. Just look at old Scrooge, he whom foul weather didn't know where to have him. Every December I dig this miraculous story afresh and every December timeless new sentences ring out. I think this time through I especially love the way Dickens resoundingly hammers home the death of Jacob Marley right from the get go:\\"There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot--say Saint Paul's Chruchyard for instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.\\"Amen to that, Charley. With knobs on."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Released on December 17, 1843, A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens was a runaway success that changed the way England viewed and celebrated Christmas. In fact, the first Christmas Card appeared in 1843, illustrating a family drinking wine together, with a depiction of a charitable scene. It was precisely the vision of Christmas as a family occasion steeped in a spirit of goodwill to all men that Dickens espoused in the novel. To be fair to Sir Henry Cole and John Callcott Horsley, the creator and designer of the cards, their idea was in the works many years before Dickens was a writer.The story is a familiar one that you may know already. There have been many adaptations of the book produced, with my favorite being the 1951 version of the movie starring Alastair Sim. The essential story has also been intertwined into many tv series, soap operas, and sit-coms. Yet there is something compelling about reading the story as Dickens first told it - not just because he's a masterful storyteller, but symbolism and subtleties can't always be translated to the silver screen.All of the Ghosts who visited Scrooge on Christmas evening have symbolic appearances. Jacob Marley is chained down in his afterlife by all the financial appurtenances of his time. The Ghost of Christmas Past reflects a changing vision, depending on how you look at it. This spirit gives Scrooge a tour through his Christmas Pasts that he never quite considered before. The Ghost of Christmas Present is probably the most remarkable image of the spirits. His bounty represents that of Scrooge, whose wealth is only matched by his penuriousness. Meanwhile, the stark and sparse image of the Ghost of Christmas Future is that of death. As we suspect, and as Scrooge discovers later on, it is the aftermath of his own death that is being portrayed.There are some references that aren't well understood 170 years later, which makes a version of \`A Christmas Carol\\" with a Dickensian Glossary, like this book, a helpful post-mortem. There's even a reference to American History - in particular, the decision of Andrew Jackson to revoke the Charter of the Second National Bank and deposit gold bullion into local state banks. He put credit into the hands of local banks, some of whom abused the privilege by issuing the practically worthless securities mentioned by the novel.The story is only 126 pages long, which you can read slowly, and easily, in a week of commuting on the subway. You don't have much to lose - and possibly the spirit of Christmas to regain - by revisiting this all-time classic close to the form that it was first presented."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol has to be one of his most loved works and also one of the most widely known Christmas stories. Published in 1843, the novella tells the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a miser who is visited one Christmas Eve by four \\"spirits\\" whose mission is to save him from himself.In Mission Audio's audiobook edition of the story, narrator Simon Vance gives a phenomenal reading of the classic tale, complete with exceptional voices. The narration grabbed my attention right off and kept it through the very end. I gained new insight into the story because of the beautiful narration and was reminded of the importance of its message.Whether you've read the story before or not, I highly recommend this audiobook.

Through the visions of his dead partner, Jacob Marley, and three Ghosts, Scrooge is sent on the learning experience of a life.There is a reason why this book is so prevalent in our (Western) culture, how everyone, even those who've never read the novella/book, know the story so well (which is why this review will not have any spoiler notices). This story is a story that hits us to the core, that forces us to look outside our selfish lives and to think of others. And while the characters aren't the most nuanced, it is the story, it is the heart of the book that is most important and most inspiring.The characters are rather one-note, if you think about it. Scrooge is the only one that undergoes any change (somewhat expected, as it is a novel about his growth), but he starts out as the hideously over-done selfish man and ends up as the happiest, most joyful man in the world. Seeing his drastic change, however, does make the story more compelling, which is probably why Scrooge was painted so over-the-top in the beginning. From his little sister to Belle to Bob Crachit and his family, the characters tend to be blindly cheerful and happy despite their conditions. About the only one I can think of off the top of my head that isn't is Mrs. Crachit, who definitely harbors some resentment to Mr. Scrooge.But the remarkable thing about \\"A Christmas Carol\\" isn't the nuanced, varied characters, but the story, the journey, Scrooge's miraculous change. Reading it for the second time (I read it once in high school on my own), I was still touched and intrigued. I discovered more of the humor (the bit about Marley being more of \\"gravy than of grave\\"), the deeper meaning of the story. A lot of times, it seems that movies take the bits about Scrooge celebrating and honoring Christmas, and while that is an important theme, I thought the more important theme was to look out for your neighbor and open your heart.Scrooge was miserly, giving his employee a crappy wage (something like 15 shillings a week!). He refused to have anything to do with his nephew, he wouldn't give to the poor, and he had no compassion for beggars. While he lived in a huge home, he only lit a single candle and lived in a single room. And as the Ghosts reveal his past, present, and future, he slowly realizes, \\"Hey, I should have been nice to that kid on the street\\", \\"Hey, I wish I had agreed to visit my nephew\\", and \\"Hey, I should do something about my employee's work conditions\\".And that is why this book is so great, in my opinion. Christmas is one day and not everyone celebrates it the same way (or at all!); but kindness and generosity can be expressed ALL YEAR LONG and EVERYONE can share it. That is how I interpret it when Scrooge says, near the end: \\"I will honor Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year\\". Christmas isn't the Christian holiday, or the commercialized version that we see all around us; Christmas is the compassion we have to those around us.Brought to you by:*C.S.

Simon Vance's narration was excellent, with an engaging dramatization.At a recent Bible study, someone brought up how A Christmas Carol was particularly a message about caring for our neighbors. While most of us have heard the story many times, hearing Dickens' original words really sent the message about the power and importance of loving our neighbor.

Side panel text gives background information about the author, pictures and story. These &quot;additions&quot; (which do not detract from, but only enhance the story) help the young reader (and the adult too!) put the story into context. It is like getting both a classic and a pictorial history book rolled into one! The text is easy to read. My daughter is now 9, and reading the books on her own.

I don't understand how they would explain that this is by far his most popular work and yet it is only 1/8 the length of his normal books. This is a masterpiece in that it shows us the harsh reality that some people are so hardened that not even Christmas moves them. I also feel Dickens displays his best skills when he shows us that Scrooge was not always this way. Also, Scrooge starts to change when he is exposed to his present. Seeing upclose what his greedieness has done to Cratchit catches his conscience. Furthermore he realizes that many people will be delighted at his eventual death if he does not change. The messages are very profound. In addition, we are presented with striking images. Also, characters such as Jacob Marley, Fanny, Fred, and Mr. Fezziwig, and the ghosts are very convincing. Again, Dickens shows us the harsh conditions of Victorian England. Also, Dickens emphasizes that even a hardened miser CAN change.

For example, when he was walking through town, people would avoid him as much as possible. Even dogs would avoid him. As Scrooge met the ghosts, one by one, he slowly saw his bad side and changed his life forever (for the good). You should read this book every Christmas to help you remember what Christmas is all about."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I like this story because its not all real. Even though its a christmas story it is neat because it is a story about ghosts and sprits , and I like stories like that. I liked the middle of the book mostly because of the sprits and the ghosts. I thought some of the words were a little hard to understand , but other than that I liked the book (story) a lot!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"my favorite part was when jacob marley showed up i liked the three spirits when they apeared i thought it could use some more pictures it also could tell what some of the words mean other than that it was pretty good"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Ordered for my kindle and it is an awesome book to have.

Anyone can understand the lesson in this book. However, A Christmas Carol is not for everyone. If your heart is easily broken when reading a book, do NOT read this book! Go find yourself some other book. By the title it does not seem that this book is a mean man, but it is. With this book, Dickens has created a classic."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Was absolutely thrilled to find this among the free offerings for Kindle! I am between apartments just now and all of my books are in storage, so I was bummed that I didn't get to do my yearly reading last month. I just bought my Kindle a couple weeks ago so I got to do it after all, I little late, but better than nothing!This is such an amazing story that is still relevant today. It never fails to warm the heart and bring about the realization of what Christmas is supposed to be."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I received my first copy of this edition of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" many, many years ago from my parents. We developed a tradition of reading it aloud each year in the days before Christmas and using Roberto Innocenti's gorgeously illustrated version of Dickens' classic tale of redemption, or rather, \\"reclamation,\\" as one Ghost puts it, made this tradition even more delightful. Dickens' wordsmithing sets a standard few authors reach and reveals a desire not only to make humanity better but make more faithful the practice of the religion (Christianity) which constantly underscores the words and actions of the characters. Innocenti's illustrations reveal many hours of research into the clothing and look of 1830s London, as well as many hours spent illustrating the author's words down to some of the briefest references. Each time one looks at an illustration one notices some new charming detail: the drops of blood from a goose's neck on the snow, the Marley-haunted tiles around Scrooge's fireplace, piles of bones in old Joe's shop. The copy I received--my second copy--was in even better condition than I anticipated; while not brand new, it obviously had never been opened. I recommend this edition of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" to everyone who loves the story. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"THis went really well.

Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas without reading this story. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This is a story everyone should read. Nothing has changed in our world since this book was written. The acting Mr. Scrooge of today are our bankers, politicians and sports stars who have care for no one but themselves."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Too many people only know these classic stories by what the film industry has provided instead of the original by the author. I was guilty of this myself and wanted to original story. I had seen some earlier versions in film, in black and white, that followed this original nearly word by word so that was refreshing to see that someone got it right. Of course, the premise of Scrooge has been done and overdone to the point of silliness these days, but now I know the version as it was orignally designed and perhaps can watch these film versions with that knowledge."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"The best Christmas short story ever written. It's so great to be able to read it anywhere in a convenient format, even in the dark which makes the story spookier."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Realizing I had never read anything by Charles Dickens, I decided to take a crack at this novella after I found it being offered for free on Amazon. If you've seen any of the dozens of adaptations of this classic, you know the story: A cruel miser is visited by ghosts of past, present and future on Christmas Eve and given a glimpse of the misery he has and will continue to cause if he doesn't change his ways.As far as the Dickensian style goes, I can see the reasons why it is both loved and hated. At times the tone is conversational, like Dickens is standing in front of you telling the story, which is something you're either going to love or hate. At times I got a little lost in the text, but I just see that as a byproduct of reading a book that was written in a very different time and place.That said, the themes are very familiar, especially in today's political climate. Scrooge's dialogue in the opening scene could easily be adapted for one of the talking heads of Fox News. I'm not trying to get political here. Scrooge is a worst case scenario cartoon rendering of a heartless rich guy, but then again, I feel like he sees the error of his ways just a little too easily.At the end of the day, what you have in A Christmas Carol is a modern fable, and unlike many cultural myths, the original text is here for your enjoyment and analysis. This book is responsible in large part for how we experience and imagine Christmas today, so the cultural themes are vital. It's also a short read, so you won't lose a lot of time seeing if you like it."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Because this is a classic, I focused on the quality of the kindle edition. It was just fine. This will always be one of my favorites."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"A classic , Dickens is so descriptive , its like he is writing a painting of bygone times, with a message that is so apt for today."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"The book was really good, I think it was better than the movie. I would recommend this book to adolescents or adults. I'm a 13 year old boy, and I saw the movie so I thought I might try the book. It really surprised me that the book was way better than the movie. I loved it and I would read it everywhere and at anytime. I read the book whither my brother and he's nine, and he loved the book. The book is hard to understand but you will figure it out as you keep reading.

I read reviews about several different versions of \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" and finally settled on this one. Great price from Amazon ($12), and a beautiful book. Most of the other versions have a similar price tag, but are not hard bound with artwork. The artwork is amazing. There are pictures on almost every other page.

As it turns out, the 1951 version with Alistair Sim is truest to the original, although some omissions were made there as well to adapt it to the screen... as you would expect with a book adaptation. Still, the original story is a joy to read and the 1840's vernacular is quite entertaining, if thought-provolking at times.

My favorite film version is the one with Alastair Simm as Scrooge and I couldn't help but match many of the actors from that film to the characters in the book as I was reading it, but that never took away from my experience and I think actually enhanced it. The book was actually quite a bit shorter than I expected, a little over a hundred pages, but it was rich and well worth the read.

The ability to rapidly look up some of the older Victorian English words and phrases with the built-in Kindle dictionary made reading it even more enjoyable. Plus, who can argue with the price (free)!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"\\"A Christmas Carol\\" represents not only Charles Dickens' most memorable work. but perhaps the most perfectly plotted story in the history of literature. What other tale has been retold so often, in movies, cartoons, etc.? The heart warming ending never loses its charm, and even for a jaded public that now largely shuns morality plays, the timeless message always finds a receptive audience.Because of the brevity of this story, which is not one of Dickens' colossal novels, the deep complexity of the characters is slightly lacking, as is the terrific humor found in his longer works. Still, the master managed to create a man that everyone can understand, and give him a believable history in comparably few pages. He also bestowed an unforgettable name upon him, that melded seamlessly with his personality.This story can still inspire, and lift the spirits of any reader. What more could we possibly ask of any writer?"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Its amazing to get many classic stories for free and getting them through amazon and reading them on your kindle is not only easy, its easy to read and the way things are going to go. The story was classic and I highly suggest downloading as many of the free classics as possible."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"First of all I have to observe that Charles Dickens was born almost two hundred years ago, minus one year. That is just amazing! The man was taken out of school before he was eleven and yet managed to begin publishing his work at twenty-one, and finally being able to turn around the course of his family's debt at the age of thirty when he published this book. There's something to be learned from his life as well as from this book.For those of you not familiar with the book, it is a story about a man named Ebenezer Scrooge, who is a miserly individual who, one Christmas-Eve Night is visited by the ghost of his long dead partner Jacob Marley. His partner is there to tell him that he will be visited by three ghosts, (the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Christmases Yet to Come) in order to show him the error of his stingy and cold ways.The images Mr. Dickens produces with his words are astounding. I could see the night sky swimming with forlorn spirits bemoaning the good they never did in life! My heart ached for the girl realizing the man she loved was no longer the man before her. I laughed at the Christmas antics of Fred's guests, and felt the pain of a parent loosing their child when the ghost showed it to Scrooge. It moved me as only a truly talented author can move a reader, despite the century and decades separating our lives. Though it is writen in the third person, the author engages the reader personally, speaking to you and giving his own personal opinion on a subject. It was the first time I've observed that kind of writing to be honest. For example when discribing Scrooge's nephew at Christmas the author writes that if you should know someone more blessed in a laugh than Fred, to introduce them and the narrator would cultivate the friendship.I have to say that all the Christmas Specials on T.V. can not compare to reading the original work. The adaptations do well, but so much has to be left out or changed!Admittedly, his way of spinning a sentence is much different from today. There are times I had to re-read a sentence or two to understand it better, not because it was written badly, but because the speech of the day has changed. I found it a pleasant challenge though, and not too daunting in the long run cause he makes his world so vivid with life and action, you can see it all and even if the words said aren't exactly clear, the overall idea of what is going on is clear.Not surprising, I would give this a five-star review! It is well written, has vivid images, believable characters, and flows well. I would highly recommend it, but maybe caution the reader to have a dictionary on hand for any words that might be unclear. Without one, I'm afraid the reader might find it more of a challenge than they thought. I look forward to reading it again when Christmas time rolls around again, and maybe even before if I have the time!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Each Christmas I enjoy seeing again the several versions of this Dickens short novel. I read the work along with all of Dickens' other fiction, in a 10 volume gift set received 40 years ago, but long since lost in house movings. When I noticed A Christmas Carol in among the Kindle free book offerings, it was time to revisit this lovely classic. God bless them, every one of the faithful who convert these works to digital format! Get it and read it in installments to your grandkids. Who knows? You may revive the art of reading aloud among friends and family!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I try to read Dickens' Christmas Carol every year during the week of Christmas. It's always worth it.I read it this year while waiting at an airport in the middle of the night during a snowstorm the day after Christmas.The story always seems fresh to me. And haunting. And inspirational.It's a cool way to end the year with reflection on how we lived up to that point and also to begin the new year as we ponder how we want to live going forward.Get this book. It's free. And it's good, moving, Christmas literature."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"For many years, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, has been considered a classic Christmas novel. In America, people are becoming increasingly busy and more concerned with themselves around Christmas time. The spirit of Christmas is making its way out of the American culture and becoming a distant memory. A central theme in \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the renewal of this spirit as depicted in the life of the main character Ebeneezer Scrooge.The setting for A Christmas Carol is in London, England during the 19th century. At the time, England was undergoing an industrial revolution. Money was to be made! I feel such is the case today as technology is revolutionizing the way business is run in today's society. The main character, Ebeneezer Scrooge, is a money dealer who, along with his business partner Jacob Marley, gave loans to various people and institutions needing financial assistance. Over the years and after the death of his business partner, the love of money hardened the heart of this once cheerful man. I was reminded, while reading, how money hardens people's heart is found in the world today. Scams are becoming an increasingly popular topic in the news. Truly, money is the root of all evil (1 Timothy 6:10). Throughout the course of this book, Scrooge experiences a change of heart while he reviews Christmas memories and once again discovers what it is like to feel and live the Christmas spirit. As I read this book, I felt that desire--the desire to rediscover what it feels like to live the Christmas spirit. While reading this book, I felt the emptiness that comes when one is focused solely inward during the Christmas season and the joy comes when the spirit of Christmas motivates one to lift and serve others.I am a lover of good literature. Recently, I have noticed myself becoming busier during the Christmas season than in past years. While reading of Scrooges' Christmas memories, I couldn't help but put myself in his shoes. By so doing, the spirit of Christmas returned to my life. What a difference that made in my enjoyment of the Christmas season! I recognized what was truly important--remembering Christ by serving others. This book is a great read for anyone; especially those who feel they have lost the Christmas spirit and have the desire to rekindle it again."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Reading Dickens was hard at first, but he is a wonderful story teller. Get over the old language and enjoy the story.I have heard and seen many tellings of A Christmas Carol but none do the justice of the original wording."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Dicken's \\"A Christmas Carol\\" should be read by everyone who loves Christmas (and everyone who doesn't) at least once a year but, each year is even better. This particular version/printing is one that should be treasured and passed down from generation to generation as the illustrations are lovely!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This is Charles Dickens' best christmas story. Only David Copperfield tops this story. Mr. Dickens teaches the reader that no matter how much money or position we have, no matter how important we feel, no matter how much cynicism we have, life will come right out in front of us with a big wham!! Tiny Tim is compassion, Mr. Cratchit is hope, Fizziwigg is happiness. And all these things are life at its best. A Christmas Carol is the true feeling and hope and love. Make this short story your hope."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"A Christmas Carol is about an old bitter man named Scrooge, who in decades has not showed any compassion to any living creature for uncountable years. Ebenezer Scrooge owns a firm called Scrooge and Marley - Jacob Marley being his business partner and sole confidant who passed away years ago. On the night of Christmas Eve, while preparing to retire from his busy workday, he hears boisterous noises and frustrated and frightened answers simply by Bah! Humbug's! Marley's ghost, tied to heavy chains, appears in front of the stupefied Scrooge and alerts him that three ghosts will be visiting him that night and he must follow and obey them in order for him not to suffer the same consequence as his partner Marly. That night all of the three visit and show him his past, present, and future. Scrooge, alarmed from his future outcome changes to become the caring, charitable, and socially conscious man he was years before. Christmas morning he shocks everyone around with his Christmas spirit. Later that morning he gives Bob Cratchit - worker of Scrooge - the honor of being his equal partner in the firm and gives Cratchit's children the best Christmas they'd ever been the witness to.I enjoyed A Christmas Carol very much, I give this piece of Charles Dickens work five stars because it is a heart warming, extremely well written novel that anyone and everyone should read in their lifetime."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"The story A Christmas Carol written by Charles Dickens was a great story to read. My favorite part was at the end when the ghost of Christmas yet to come scared Scrooge. That ghost was also my favorite character. It took place in England. In the beginning of the story, Scrooge was being mean to all the people at his job. He went home and was having a bowl of soup when he heard chains rattling. He looked at the door and it flung open and Marly's ghost came through the door. The ghost explained he was going to be visited by three spirits. In the middle of the night the first ghost came the ghost of Christmas past. He showed him all the things he did wrong to other people. All of a sudden he awoke in bed and thought it was all a dream until the second ghost came. It was the ghost of Christmas present he showed Scrooge how poor all the other families were because of him and all of a sudden he woke up in bed again. The clock struck and another ghost appeared. He was the ghost that Scrooge was scared of the most. He showed Scrooge all the horrible things that happen and he shows Scrooge's employee. He goes to Cratchit's house and has a party. To conclude the story A Christmas Carol was an exciting story to read and you should read this book."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"\\"You will be haunted by Three Spirits.&quot; So forewarns Jacob Marley's ghost to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge, a miser of stingy, unfavorable traits. And so begins the enduring Christmas classic distinguished by almost everyone. Come along on an erratic journey with the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future, all of whom attempt to point Scrooge onto a virtuous path. Meet the most notable characters ever introduced in literature: Bob Cratchit, angelic Tiny Tim, and good-natured Fred. With vivid descriptions of Victorian England and enlightening dialogue, 'A Christmas Carol' will enrapture both the young and old throughout the year with a vital lesson on hope and benevolence for humanity. This, I find, is treasured most of all in this brief story marvelously crafted by the creative Charles Dickens. No matter how many adaptations of the book one has seen on television or as films, the real source is highly recommended and should not be missed. For if you do pass the book up, you are being just a Scrooge (metamorphically speaking, of course!).--P.J. Persad"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"The Christmas Carol was a book that I throughly enjoyed. This book tells about the hardships and trials of life. This book show how your character depends alot on the way you are received. The three ghost show how Scrooges behavior is traced back to his childhood. It shows that your childhood tends to effect your adult hood."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"A Christmas Carol is wonderful book that I would want all ages to read. The book shows how a man such as Scrooge can change and so can everyone else. The story is not like the movie. Charles Dickens does a wonderful job in making the story more appealing to me. The story makes me understand how life was like back then. An example is when we had the September 11 attack. I hope people can change like Scrooge. I think Charles Dickens does a great job in using the events from different sources to show different views from the movies. People should read this book so they can maybe stop being so mean to other people and races. (...) The book gets five stars because this is hardcore lessons that we should be teaching today in the youth of America.I think the ghost of the story should come and visit some of the people here in the United States and in different countries.Maybe it is not to late to save the lives of others, if you can not save yourself. This book should be read in schools all over the world.The book has meaning and we should use this meaning to live our lives. The book shows me that everyone can change, including the most devilish person can become an Angel."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I loved the book. Charles Dickens gets a five star mark in my book. The book is nothing like the movie. The way Charles Dickens showed or wrote how the Scrooge changed almost brought me into tears. The movie showed little events than what the book showed. The said part is that many people are just like the Scrooge here today in the United States. On September 11, 2001 showed how many people are just like Scrooge. Men, that are supposed to be &quot;created equal&quot; killed over thousands of men, women, children, and animals all because the United States is more econmic to other countries. The Scrooge being the mastermind of the whole ordeal. I still believe that this book should be given and read to all ages to show how someone as mean as Scrooge can always change when ready or when needed to. To Charles Dickens you should get an award for this piece of work. I think all ages will enjoy this book and maybe someday we will all change and not be so mean to others.

I've been rereading this since I was a child, and it never grows stale. We're in the middle of a heat wave and I decided to reread it just to cool off, and was as charmed by this classic tale as ever. What I noticed more in this reading, though, was the gentle humor. In the past, I focused more on the negativity of Scrooge and his redemption. This time, I focused on the humor, from almost slapstick to sarcastic, that Dickens infused throughout. For such a short story, it's really packed, and the language is a wonderful refreshment after today's crisp writing style. I know that Dickens was paid by the word, but he didn't waste a single one. If you have a child who can read at 6th grade level, who is stuck on low-level series, try them out on this.

It is often said, \\"the book is better than the movie.\\", and likewise this is so true! This book captures the essences so much more than any version I have ever seen.

This book is one that you won't want to bury on a shelf someplace but have it close at hand so you can revisit England in the 1800s with so much detail that you are practically in the picture. I also bought a copy for my cousin and her reverence for this book almost exceeds mine! If you are in the market for a copy, this is the one to buy.

His Scrooge is mean, troubled and seemingly irredeemable but as Mr. Winters makes his way through the story he shows us a quite complex and interesting portrait of the infamous miser. Just so you know there is a female actress to do the female parts and there is music and sound effects throughout the story to make it well paced and impossible to take your ears off of it. Although I don't want to give too much away Mr. Winters gives a Ghost Of Christmas Present with a Scottish accent! This is a wonderful way to help celebrate Christmas!I never thought I'd find something to rival Patrick Stewart's one man show, but this is a thoroughly entertaining production especially considering the \\"reader\\" is American!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I think everyone has seen at least 3 versions of this in movie form (I know I have!) but how many have read the story? I hadn't so I grabbed this to read to have something with a little holiday spirit. It's interesting. I guess because I'm used to seeing the movies, which they have to flesh out a bit and use rich colors and holiday cheeriness, I wasn't expecting the story to be so... simple.The language (from the mid 1800s I believe) can be a bit challenging for those of us who need a little help here and there with anything beyond the modern English language, but it really wasn't too bad. I enjoyed it, but it was hard for me not to compare it to the movies and put faces to the various actors who have played the parts.It's still definitely worth a read.

I'm very pleased to have finally gotten the chance to read the original. Each magical little retelling has been pretty brilliant for me, and it's all because of this wonderful little book!I trust that you probably already know the story (and if not, that you can see the premise in another review), so I'll just focus on my experience on the read through. And what a delightful read it was! I laughed a lot through the opening (so clever and funny), I truly shuddered as the ghost of Jacob Marley was walking slowly up the stairs and dragging the chains behind him (really scary!), and I beamed my way through the last act-so thrilled for the outcome (that, by the way, we all already knew was coming...but the way it's written here makes it an even more joyous chapter than I expected). All in all, it's a grand Christmas book and timeless piece of literature that I would recommend to anyone.Just as a side note about the Bantam Classic edition also-this is a wonderful, small book with an enchanting cover (as you can see from the Amazon picture). The binding held up wonderfully for me through my first read (it still looks brand new). As a bonus, this version also contains a small biographical sketch on Dickens and a story about him reading this book aloud at a public reading. I haven't checked to see if the other editions also contain this material, but I definitely found it to be an asset to this one. You can't beat the price, either."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I've probably seen every movie ever made from this story, but never read the story itself. I loved it.

And most of us have been exposed to at least a few different versions of some animated or Hollywood version of the story. But anyone interested in a simple and short read at Christmas time would do well to treat themselves to the Dickens classic in its original written form. You'll likely not be disappointed as long as you're willing to understand that it's Dickens and it's written in his classic Victorian style, i.e., not a simplified Hollywood script.

If you like the story, you'll love this audio version."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I've always liked the story of \\"A Christmas Carol\\", whether it was a live action film version, the Muppet version, the Disney animated version, even one of the dozens of sitcom parodies. I finally got round to reading the original, and I quite enjoyed it. Even though I'd seen and heard so many versions of the story, reading it was still very special.It's a tale about a man called Ebenezer Scrooge, who runs a business successfully and tightly. A little too tightly, most would say. Though he has a lot of money, he has none to spare for charity. Though he has a lot of time to himself, he has none to spare for his cheerful nephew. Christmas is coming, and Scrooge wishes it was over. What reason does everyone have to be so cheery? What reason do they have to stop work and get in the way of his business? He's pretty cemented in his views, though he and his worldview begins to crack the night he is visited by four ghosts. The first is the chained ghost of his dead business partner, Jacob Marley, and the other three the Ghosts of Christmas: The Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come. He is shown the beauty in all that he has criticized, the joy in things he has forgotten, and the grief his crabby ways have caused himself and others.The book is a little different from all the interpretations I have seen, but not by too much. The Ghost of Christmas Present takes Scrooge to a lot more places, like over the sea to a Christmas party on a ship, for instance. Dickens is warm and wordy here, and captures the bustle, the sights, the sounds and the tastes of Christmas very well. This is not the tacky, forced Christmas cheer you see on some television specials. Not at all.Even though it's a lot shorter than many of his other books, Dickens still pays attention to his characters. Even the minor ones have a personality in the few words Dickens uses to describe them. Being short, it doesn't take too long to read. It's divided into five \\"Staves\\", one for each of the four ghostly encounters and the ending, which helps build the anticipation up as you read, and makes it easy to find your favorite part later. There are also a few illustrations by John Leech, which are nice.It's definitely worth reading, if you're interested.

If you've never read the original (or haven't since junior high), do yourself a favor and pick it up. You'll be amazed how relevant some of the social criticism from over 150 years ago seems, not to mention how funny Dickens' wry wit can be.There's a reason this story has stuck around for a century and a half, and it's not the admirable efforts of the like of Alistair Sim, George C. Scott, or Patrick Stewart. It's Mr. Dickens, The Imitable Boz, himself. Get to know him."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Critiquing Dickens' Christmas Carol is a misnomer. Rather, it is Dickens who critiques us with this masterwork.A Christmas Carol has burrowed into the very heart of our Western Culture to where few people would be confused if you referred to someone as a \\"Scrooge,\\" that is to say a skinflint, miser.Aside from presenting us with some of the most memorable images in literature as Scrooge is taken by the Ghosts of the Past, Present and Future to review his life and probable ending, we are brought along with his and given opportunity to review those elements in our own lives.A Christmas Carol was not just a nice story of the Christmas Season to give warmth and cheer.Far from it!Dickens had an agenda. Just as in his other famous works, like Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Dickens longed to make a social statement to draw attention to the poor in England, their plight and hardship. A Christmas Carol is about Scrooge as a person, but also as representing a class of the wealthy whose abundance is wrested from the large working poor such as Cratchett and his family. THEY are the point. THEY are the ones Dickens sought to draw to public attention.Heaven help us is we simply see this book as nostalgia and fail to see the point Dickens had to make then and which still applies today!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"The book A Chrismas Carol was great! It was very inspirational. I would recommend the book to any adult or child. The book is basically an overview of how you can ruin your life, and even create death, by being mean. A Christmas Carol was a well- written example of how your attitude in everyday life, and even the way you celebrate holidays effect you and those around you. I enjoyed reading the book, because it inspired me to enlighten those around me that are like Ebenezer Scrooge or similar to consider changing. There were many interesting parts of the story. For example, in the story, the mean grouch, Ebenezer Scrooge had three ghost to haunt him. One of his past, present, and a ghost of Christmas yet to come. When each of these ghost haunted Scrooge, his attitude to each scene changed. He loved his past, hated his present, and pleaded for a better future. My favorite part of the story was the end. I enjoyed the end of the story, because Scrooge decided to change, his life improved, and he became a better person before it was too late."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This is one of those stories that tempts a reviewer to succumb to grade inflation; it is so much better than other books that I've rated five stars, that I'm tempted to give it a higher than maximum rating.Granted, there are people out there who claim that this book is too cloyingly sweet for words; it's very stylish to be cynical. So call me a sucker for a happy ending if you must, but this is unquestionably the best thing that Dickens ever wrote; not only does it have his usual marvellous characterizations, but the plot moves better than most of those in his longer works, and, being a very short piece, it doesn't have the tendency to ramble that some of his longer works fall prey to.But beyond that, the story is an absolute classic, one that eveyone should have the pleasure of reading on a regular basis. What I find particularly pleasing about it is the frequently-overlooked fact that when Scrooge becomes pleasant and generous not only is it the right thing to do, and not only does it make the lives of those around him infinitely more pleasant, but it actually makes Scrooge himself much happier; it isn't WORK to be pleasant, it's FUN!The movie versions generally do a fairly good job of portraying the story, but nothing can compare to the original written story itself; even better, it's available from the &quot;Dover Thrift Editions&quot; for only a dollar!If you cherish your cynicism, you may want to avoid this story; but if you enjoy a good bit of delightfully playful writing that winds up with a classically upbeat ending, DO NOT miss this book."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I think it is for children and is very easy to read and very childish to me and I don't really like it"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I love to read classics and Ive seen A Christmas Carol movies so many times I felt compelled to read the book.

Scores of film adaptations have been made over the years, taking Dickens' story of one man's redemption to all the corners of the globe. The name Ebenezer Scrooge immediately brings to mind the miserly curmudgeon whose life and very nature were radically changed after the visitation of four ghosts one early Christmas morning. Jacob Marley, Scrooge's former partner, returns in spirit form to warn Scrooge of the ponderous chain he is forging in life by his penny-pinching, selfish, Christmas-hating ways. Then, of course, the ghosts of Christmas past, Christmas present, and Christmas future come to call for an increasingly troubled soul who comes to see the worthlessness of his purely materialistic life. A Christmas Carol offers a truly amazing character study. Scrooge, this seemingly incorrigible fellow, quickly becomes a sympathetic character as we view the circumstances of his life. From a lonely boy rejected by his father (who blames him for the death of his wife in childbirth), we see a sensitive soul, one quite capable of feeling and expressing both happiness and love, grow greedy and cold, shutting even the woman he loves out of his life. Completely broken down by the scenes revealed by the ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, Scrooge's transformation is remarkably real and powerful.Little need be said about this timeless classic, as it is a story virtually everyone knows in some detail. The message is clear to all of us, as well. Dickens, the social conscience of the 19th century, illustrates the humanity and worth of even the lowliest of society's members and casts the harsh light of truth on those with the means but not the desire to help their fellow man, giving new life to the clich&eacute; &quot;you can't take it with you.&quot; Dickens briefly alludes to the religious aspects of the holiday, but he vividly evokes the true and rightful spirit of Christmas in humanistic terms. This is a timeless story that will forever be a part of each Christmas season. Not only does it impart lessons of the highest order, it never fails to charm and delight you no matter how many times you have previously read the story (and watched the movie adaptations) over the years."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"The vocabulary was exelent.

Read it years ago and forgot how great especially around the holidays"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This slim volume is an example of Victorian literature at its finest. Dickens' literary voice croons with the tempo of the story, dark and foreboding as the ghosts escort Scrooge on his journey and upbeat and merry as he reforms his ways. It is a story of hope in the human spirit, urging you not to give up on people, not to count them out because they may surprise you. Although I doubt that many a moral eyesore can be transformed so easily and heartily as Scrooge, Dickens artfully exploited the marshmallowy feeling many experience during the Christmas season, which makes this a believable and much loved story.Dickens immersed Victorian themes in many ways and with great skill. The worship of children as innocent creatures was apparent in the way that Tiny Tim was glorified. His pitiful image and heart of gold appeal to our senses as well as it did to the Victorians.A thirst for the supernatural was quenched through the use of the three spirits. They are not exactly Christian in nature, yet they seek to do good. This secular flirtation could indicate that Victorians' faith was being shaken and in its place a value system based on choosing favorable Christian principles and disregarding the rest. As is human tendency, we do not usually care about anything until it is almost gone (such as endangered species), and when Christian faith was questioned, interest began to percolate in the Victorians. I believe we still like basic Christian ideals, but going to church is asking for a lot. We continue to have more of an interest in phantoms than angels.Also integrated was the belief that the middle class is more virtuous because they work for their money. Bob Cratchit did not need moral instruction; Scrooge, an old miser, did. It teaches that sacrifices made for money will be costly. Scrooge lost a woman who loved him by being greedy. She dismissed him regretfully; \\"You fear the world too much. All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond its sordid reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you\\" (Dickens 37). This theme is timeless as a recent movie, Family Man, heavily drew upon it as a successful businessman who had discarded the fancies of a wife and children, woke up one morning to having both and realized he had been in error. The Victorians and many contemporary Americans ache to believe that the pursuit of wealth is not as fulfilling as two hands with wedding bands clasped and changing dirty diapers. Whether or not this is accurate I cannot say because I have neither.Dickens was a Victorian mastermind and he knew what Christmas was all about. It is about looking for the best in people and the world. It is one time that it is okay to be cheesy, okay to be touched by stories of hope and love. So next Christmas, when the snow falls like sugar and the sentimental tears fall like rain, pick up A Christmas Carol and watch the Victorians come out of the woodwork. They look a lot like us and this is why Dickens' novel has survived."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This book was really good. Some parts were a little hard to understand but otherwise it was good. It really explains the real meaning of Christmas."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"A Christmas Carol is wonderful book that I would want all ages to read. The book shows how a man such as Scrooge can change and so can everyone else. The story is not like the movie. Charles Dickens does a wonderful job in making the story more appealing to me. The story makes me understand how life was like back then. (...) I hope people can change like Scrooge. I think Charles Dickens does a great job in using the events from different sources to show different views from the movies. People should read this book so they can maybe stop being so mean to other people and races. (...)The book gets five stars because this is hardcore lessons that we should be teaching today in the youth of America.I think the ghost of the story should come and visit some of the people here in the United States and in different countries.MAybe it is not to late to save the lives of others, if you can not save yourself.

Charles Dickens gets a five star mark in my book. The book is nothing like the movie. The way Charles Dickens showed or wrote how the Scrooge changed almost brought me into tears.

On September 11, 2001 showed how many people are just like Scrooge. Men, that are supposed to be &quot;created equal&quot; killed over thousands of men, women, children, and animals all because the United States is more econmic to other countries. The Scrooge being the mastermind of the whole ordeal. I still believe that this book should be given and read to all ages to show how someone as mean as Scrooge can always change when ready or when needed to.

Let me tell you, if anything, this is a better read if you've already seen the movie. The sense of bitter cold in London in 1840, and in Scrooge's heart, are all the more real in this slim text. Scrooge's isolation is shown to be something we have all felt at some time in our lives. His joyous redemption will evoke emotions you didn't know you had. Finally, for those of you who may have been tortured with Dicken's in highschool, this is an easy, single evening read."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"It's hard to think of a literary work that has been filmed and staged in more imaginative variations than Charles Dickens' &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;--there's the excellent George C. Scott version, the delightful Muppet version, the charming Mr. Magoo version, etc., etc. But ultimately true &quot;Carol&quot; lovers should go back to Dickens' original text, which remains a great read.&quot;Carol&quot; tells the story of cold-hearted miser Ebenezer Scrooge, who despises the Christmas holiday and scorns all who celebrate it. But a visit from a series of supernatural beings forces him to reevaluate his attitude--and his life.With this simple plot Dickens has created one of the enduring triumphs of world literature. It's a robust mix of humor, horror, and (most of all) hope, all leavened with a healthy dash of progressive social criticism. One thing I love about this book is that while it has a focus on a Christian holiday, Dickens puts forth a message that is truly universal; I can imagine this story resonating with people of any religious background, and also with more secular-oriented people.This is a tale of greed, selfishness, regret, redemption, family, and community, and is enlivened by some of the most memorable characters ever created for English literature. Even if Dickens had never written another word, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; would still have, I believe, secured his place as one of the great figures of world literature."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Dicken's A Christmas Carol is a classic that we often see retold every Christmas. Everyone loves it, but few people have actually read it for themselves. I always prefer reading then viewing the story because then I have to use my own imagination. I would recommend to anyone that at least once they should read the story. Dickens is a wonderful writer although a bit longwinded (He was paid by word when he wrote!)."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"In Charles Dickens' classic masterpiece, the miserable Scrooge is given a chance to repent of his selfish lifestyle when he is visited by four spirits -- first, his tormented former business partner, sentenced to wander the netherworld until he has atoned for his sins -- and then three \\"Spirits of Christmas,\\" who show him the past origins of his lifestyle, the present effects of his selfishness on people in his life, and the future toward which his life is tending. He wakes from the final vision a changed man, renounces his selfish ways, and lives a generous, loving life from that time forward.This hope-filled moral tale contains themes of redemption, hope, and generosity that resonate with Christianity, but it isn't really a Christian story. In fact, it is a good example of how a Christian holiday has come to be observed in a way that diffuses its religious meaning.For Christians, Christmas is a day to celebrate God's gift of his Son to humanity. The familiar phrase \\"Peace on earth, goodwill to men\\" was first spoken by angels announcing Jesus' birth (Luke 2:13-14). This peace primarily refers to the relationship between God and humanity (Romans 5:1-2). God miraculously extended Himself to us in the body of Jesus, ending the hostility that had separated us from Him since Adam's rebellion (Romans 5:15-17). As Christians rejoice in the miracle of Christ's reconciliation, God's love naturally pours out into joyful generosity toward other people.This significance of the holiday has been largely forgotten in our post-Christian society, but you can still feel the shadow of that joy in a general sentiment of humanitarian goodwill recognized as \\"Christmas spirit.\\" In Dickens' story, the Spirit of Christmas is personified in the three figures of past, present and future Christmases, and it is to Christmas Spirit, not to God, that Scrooge turns in his repentance. In his own words:\\"Spirit!\\" he cried, tight clutching at its robe. \\"Hear me! I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse..... I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach.\\"For Christians, who believe the only way to change your life is to trust in Jesus, Scrooge's repentance will be somewhat unconvincing -- but that doesn't mean thoughtful Christians can't appreciate the author's brilliant portrayal of human sin, selfishness, and suffering. This is a moral tale, excellent for demonstrating the consequences of sin and the benefits of goodness. Unlike many moral tales, this one is infused with joyful hope, executed with a literary excellence that has endeared it to readers for over 150 years.Dickensian language can be difficult for children to follow, and the content of this story may be troubling to an elementary audience, but for parents who think their kids will enjoy this story, an illustrated version can go a long way toward bridging the language gap. My favorite edition is illustrated by P.J. Lynch, whose exemplary gift for depicting human emotion makes his characters very real. They almost seem to breathe on the page, and the reader is effortlessly drawn into their thoughts and interests."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Having just read 'Great Expectations,' I am a big Dickens fan, and I found A Christmas Carol almost as good as his other. It is well-written, powerful, and as always, insightful into human nature. The story gallops along as well, wasting little time, which is rather amazing consider it is like 170 years old. So many books of that era are deadly slow, probably because they didn't have to compete with movies and TV.I loved the transformation that Scrooge made, and the framework Dickens created for fomenting that change had me convinced. Dickens really handled it beautifully.My one criticism, and to me it's a big one: Although Scrooge was clearly a Class A Jerk in the beginning of the book, I liked that at the beginning he wasn't just liberally squishy as regards \\"Surplus Population\\" (that is, overpopulation). Kudos to Dickens for even touching the subject. Granted, Scrooge was a creep to suggest that the world would be better off, and the solution most easily found, if poor kids should just die or go to the workhouse. I was disappointed when Scrooge just turned liberal and squishy at the end when he just gave money to the downtrodden. Heaven forbid Dickens give Scrooge real critical thinking along with his newfound compassion! Heaven forbid Dickens had compassion for the living, but really instead spoke out against people like his weak employee Cratchet just mindlessly having kids he couldn't support. The answer is not handouts; that doesn't solve overpopulation. People need to wake up and quit having so many kids, and whoever leads this world should put that message front and center."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"For fans of Patrick Stewart, this is an awesome rendition of an old favorite.

I first looked in the library, but their book was checked out, and anyway I was looking to start a family tradition of reading the story every year with our own copy if possible. The Candlewick Press edition with illustrations by P.J. Lynch appeared to fill the bill; I bought it; and it delivered the goods. The book is nice and readable-sized, the illustrations good, the type pleasing. Thirteen bucks. I was immensely satisfied with the purchase.As to the fate of the reading, we handled one chapter per evening, there being five chapters; each took an hour or so to read. I found Dickens to be sometimes heavy going for the younger TV and video-generation kids to get a sense of what is going on. I did not recollect Dickens to be so when I read some of his works as a younger person, but apparently it's something you have to be exposed to and get to understand. Anyway I was happy to provide my children with the chance to get started. It gave me a measure of the gap between the reading preparation of today's youth versus my pre-Cambrian elementary and middle school days. On Christmas Day I showed them the George C. Scott version of the movie, and they all liked it. But all knew the basics from the book, which was my goal, even if the mid-1800s prose obscured many of the action points to the younger ones in their Sponge Bob and Hannah Montana mindsets.So the effort was a success, and this edition of the book did what I had hoped by delivering up an excellent presentation at a very low cost.Dan of Arlington"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This e published version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is beautifully illustrated and an absolute joy to read. This is the first time I read this book. I expected a revision of Hollywood's version of this story. Obviously, no movie can do justice to any book or novel; this book is no exception. What is excellent about this version is that it gives a brief history of the historical background that Dickens' wrote his work in and the history of this timeless classic. There may be a minor ( and I mean minor issue) on two of the illustrations: Bob Cratchit carrying Tiny Tim on his shoulders and Scrooge raising his salary. The Kindle Fire version of all the illustrations are recreated perfectly. They are partially duplicated on the top third portion and look like the top third of the illustration is above the the whole of the image in the Kindle 3G Keyboard version. I think that the publisher should look into this. This is no reason to avoid purchasing this version. Again, this version is excellent!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"There is not exta narration through out which I LOVE! It gives you extras in the front of the book with a lil history, but they left the story untouched which is great.

I settled on this edition, and I couldn't be more pleased and satisfied. Quite simply, Candlewick produced a beautiful edition of this COMPLETE work. I stress complete, because as I was searching for a good edition, I discovered several others which were abridged. As best as I can tell, this edition has preserved the original work. The rest of my review will focus on the cosmetic aspects of this edition, and why it's perfect for me.The dust jacket is thick and gorgeous with detailed artwork. The title \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is raised and glossed (tho the rest of the cover is matte). Under the dust jacket I was surprised to see that the publisher made the hardcover appear like scrooges door with the marley knocker. The back cover is also made to look like the back of a door. You cannot turn a page of text in this book without seeing color artwork, of which the vast majority are highly detailed. There are also several pages dedicated only to artwork which is fun to admire.The page stock is very thick, and the typography fits very well by giving you an old world feel. The size of the words and spacing is typical of what you'd see in a young adult or early teen book. That's not to say there aren't plenty of reasons for an adult to love this edition. I have no regrets in regards to my purchase of this edition, and I trust that you will cherish it too."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"A few years ago, I was in a production of A CHRISTMAS CAROL at my community's playhouse. One Sunday evening after the matinee and before the evening performance, I stopped in a Barnes&Noble; and decided to pick this book up. It looked like a beautiful adaptation of a classic holiday story that had made my Christmases special for years.I was not disappointed.Just take a second now to look at the cover of this book. Whether you have it in your hand, or you look at it on Amazon, just glance at it for a few seconds. Do you see the intricate detail artist Dean Morrissey puts in his illustration? The bricks on the wall, and shadow on Scrooge's face. The snow on the pavement on the ground. This intricate attention to detail is present throughout all of the illustrations. They are gorgeous, and they bring vibrant life to Dickens' classic.Now, for the treatment of Dickens' writing. This book is abridged, but is marvelously done. Many of the lines are Dickens' own, and all of the cuts come from lengthy descriptions that aren't essential to the story. Dickens' overall tone and beautiful use of language are present in this book, and they make the tale of Scrooge and his redemption as inspiring as it's ever been.This is a nice introduction if you've never read the Dickens original (though I can't imagine anyone hasn't). However, if you have read it, this is a must-own if you value Scrooge and his ghosts as an essential part of the holiday season, as I do."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Just as Clement Moore gave us the definitive Santa Claus in &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot;), Charles Dickens gave us the definitive Christmas spirit in his simple but charming novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. First published in 1843, this supernatural story of an elderly man's redemption from his mean-spirited, miserly ways takes place in Victorian London, but its universal theme of charity towards our fellow man has endeared this classic to many a generation around the globe. In addition to its priceless role as a morality tale, the book colorfully describes the Yuletide customs practiced in England during the early nineteenth century. This Washington Square Press edition of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; is unabridged, yet you can understand why so short a book is yet published in abridged versions, especially for schoolchildren. Not infrequently, Dickens veers from the main story line and goes into tangents of a philosophical or descriptive nature, much like the converser who abruptly changes the subject only to return to it with the familiar &quot;Anyway, ... &quot;. I assume children (and some adults) may find these tangents cumbersome and distracting, but they are still useful in that they reflect Dickens' thoughts while writing the book. It may still be difficult for some of us to think that cold-hearted Christmas-bashers like Ebenezer Scrooge exist, but look at human nature around you, and it will be difficult no more. At a time when &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; is being supplanted by a more vague &quot;Happy Holidays&quot;, and the season gives way to coarse behavior and unchecked materialism, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; is the perfect guidebook to put things into perspective."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Has any story been copied more times than A Christmas Carol? It seems almost every year there is a new movie version. And how many sitcom characters have been visited by the ghosts of Christmas?

No matter how many clumsy knockoffs try to capitalize on the idea and no matter how many dance numbers it inspires, the integrity of this classic will endure.

Crafted with all the brilliant wit and imagery of which Dickens was capable, it chronicles the redemption of an aging skinflint, rendered bitter and cruel by his passion for money, to whom life has become a trudge towards the grave.Joy and love Ebenezer Scrooge has barred from his life, and for this, as his dead partner's ghost warns him, he is doomed to wander the Earth after death, chained by his hoarded loot. Yet he is to be rescued by the spirit - spirits actually: three of them - that burn hot and bright with forgiveness and hope amid the snow and of this darkest, final month.Dickens wrote this tale as a protest in 1843, against the even then growing obsession with material wealth, and neglect of life's freely given riches. Tnd today its message is as strong and apt as ever. To me, Christmas has not arrived until I've seen it told yet again in one of its many film adaptations, be it the black & white 1951 version starring Alastair Sim, or one of the later versions in which George C. Scott, Albert Finney, Patrick Stewart and many others have portrayed the old miser. This rich and unashamed snatch at our heartstrings never fails to pluck mine."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I am not going to review the Charles Dickens novel 'A Christmas Carol' in this review. I did that already (see my other reviews to read that), and, of course, I gave it 5 stars.What I'd like to comment on is the extra's this version brings. For instance, the original art work from the first edition by artist John Leech are here, placed where they were originally. There are also the actual 1843 and 1844 critics reviews in this book so one can see what was originally thought about this classic at the time of its release.Author Richard Kelly gives his perspective on the reasoning behind Dickens writing this ghostly Christmas story - the why's and wherefore's of the characters and scenes, which, for me, gave a little more of an understanding of what may have been going through Mr. Dickens mind at the time.Mr. Kelly also writes a bit on child labor, education, and the workhouse, which, again, opens the mind a bit more in reading this story.There is also a chapter that has many writings by Dickens contemporaries, such as Washington Irving, and their own descriptions of Christmas in their time.Believe it or not, there is quite a bit more in this book than what I've told you, including, of course, &quot;Carol&quot; itself. It makes a very interesting read and can help one to understand the purpose behind Dickens original classic, as well as of the times in which he wrote.A lot to read at a very good price.

Dickens' wonderful story about the meaning of the Christmas Spirit is a story that we all know, but if you haven't enjoyed the original version (or haven't for a long time) I strongly recommend you do so, and soon. While the cartoons and children's books get the general gist of the story across, they lack the subtle qualities that make it so beautiful and compelling in its original form. Heart-wrenchingly emotional scenes of Family and chuckle-inducing moments of humor propel you through this story that provides a powerful lesson for us all.Also, this short book provides an excellent example of the writing style of Dickens without getting into an 800+ page monstrosity that most of his other works are. You'll almost certainly find you love his subtle wit and dry sense of humor while reading this one, and I then encourage you to seek out those other monstrous and magnificent novels.Whether you buy it in this version, or another, get your hands on Dickens' original tale.

Mesmerized by the three ghosts, the stinginess of Ebenezer Scrooge, and the frailty of Tiny Tim, I kept the book beside my bed, tucked under the lamp on the night stand close at hand in the family home in Iowa. When the situation seemed unbearable within the walls where the family quarreled daily, I would read it, and imagine myself freed from the hatred around me.When I began teaching at a small rural Iowa college. I risked everything to introduce A Christmas Carol to my students as representative of 19th century England: the work houses, the potato famine and hunger, the miserliness of those with financial means to stay aloof from the ever-increasing poor. Reading Dickens' Christmas Carol enabled many to discover that life had not changed that much. At night, when I would return to my small apartment on the second floor of an old wooden house, buffeted by harsh winds and empty space, prepared a cup of potato soup or wheat gruel for supper, I began to feel myself to be an ever increasing part of Dickens' tale.Later when I taught at major universities in the USA and abroad, the Dickens classic was my constant companion. When I taught English history or English literature it was required reading. Discussions turned to interpretation and the book's relationship to the present clime and time: we went through the counting houses of banks, the dark alleys where the gin-soaked poor brought stolen goods to those who would resell, and the holes where prostitutes earned a scant living, much as occurs today. Of course I encouraged my students to also read Hard Times, Oliver Twist and other Dickens classics to discover the misery of the Industrial Age and the scorn the rich had for the poor, outsourcing jobs, lending money at usurious rates, and the calloused treatment of employees. Things had not changed much, and personal choice was only for the wealthy who counted for about 1% of the people.At sixty I moved to one of the poorest, most heavily impoverished nations where crime is a daily routine, education at best a joke, and plagiarism expected and condoned by teachers at all levels. In 2007, after Antonio Chang enforced the law to test all teachers in Peru, when I learned that only 151 out of more than 185,000 teachers who were tested for basic compentency had passed, I offered to teach the teachers. My first book of choice was A Christmas Carol as it covers every art and literary aspect of dialogue and education. I am still teaching the teachers--the few who allow me the honor, while most prefer to stay at home or travel to a second and/or third school to teach for additional income. I am still using Charles Dickens' stellar work. I pull out my weathered copy of A Christmas Carol and read it to my students and collegues, and then show the George C. Scott rendition of the classic that is now on DVD and fortunately is available at Amazon.com. Several students swiftly see the similarity between 19th century London and contemporary Peru where survival remains the primary goal and the only source of hope was within the walls of churches. Unfortunately the 1% of Peru who own the means of production and wealth have not yet met the Ghost of Christmas Past and the clergy they sit in front of like marble statues are more like Dostoyovsky's Grand Inquistor in his classic The Brothers Karamazov than the pastor in Dickens' Christmas Carol.A Christmas Carol is mandatory reading in my English classes. Passing any course I teach requires a demonstrative ability to show the relevance of the Dickens' classic about Ebeneezer Scrooge to the twenty-first century elites who still rule over lives and destinies.Today the students at my university in the north of Peru, are working to help the very poor nestled on a small hill in front of the great gates to this privately-owned center of learning to plan for running water and a sewer, to go to school, to look for better jobs, and improve their lot in life. The wasteland that many have moved to in order to escape the depression in the mountains is but a mirror of the rampant poverty of the shanties surrounding Lima, but in each case A Christmas Carol's presentation of the poor districtions of London are easily understood by the poor of Peru, and Ebeneezer's epiphany is readily known and hoped for as a better future for all. Peru has a long way to go before it will climb out of the abyss it is in because of a too-long history of rule by dictators and teachers who occupied classrooms for the limited money but without any skills to impart knowledge, A Christmas Carol gives hope to those who seek a better life, and the Ghost of Christmas past still has its finger pointing at marked graves at those who have no charity, no compassion,no sense of feeling. Dickens' tale will help change that and I will teach it as long as there is breath in this old body."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"One of the classics, a must read.It's a nice warming Christmas story about old uncle Scrooge.

The Eyewitness Classics edition (ISBN 0789420708) of this popular Christmas story by Dickens has been \\"translated\\" for a younger audience, offering much historical background and outstanding illustrations while sticking closely to the original dialogue and format. With modern illustrations by Andrew Wheatcroft, this edition also features some of the engravings from the period in explanatory sections which are interleaved with the Dickens story.As the chapters of Dickens's classic unfold, the child reader also learns about Dickens's London, with paragraphs about the city and its smells and the emphasis on work for all, including children. Subsequent sections contrast the working poor with the rich, delving into the subjects of workhouses and prisons, the 7-day workweek for servants, and the lives of businessmen. When Marley's ghost appears, the reader learns about the recording of deaths in a registry--along with the meaning of \\"grindstone,\\" the importance of Christmas charity, and the custom of servants taking the master's clothes, with the remainder going to \\"rag and bone shops.\\"As the three spirits appear, additional information is provided about clothing, dances and games, foods (roast goose, Christmas pudding, and chestnuts), Christmas gifts and trees, and even about the \\"crutches and frames\\" used by Tiny Tim. Dickens's biography is mentioned briefly, with a stress on his childhood and work history, along with notes about various film versions of this and other Dickens stories, including photos of some of the stars who have played Scrooge.Graphically, this edition is a winner, with beautifully reproduced illustrations, a newspaper-style paste-up (with boxes, sidebars, and text and pictures set at angles to attract attention), and excellent clarity and color. Parents, grandparents, and friends looking for an edition which will prepare children to love a stage or film version of this classic will be richly rewarded by this edition. And I can attest that one active, nine-year-old boy named Bailey sat spellbound (and silent) for a recent stage production which lasted over two hours because he read this first and knew what the action meant. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"my class had to read this book for lit. class this year. although many thought this book boring and stupid, i loved it. i loved all the characters like fezziwig and scrooge. it amazed me when out teacher told us dickens never went to school. i think everyone should read this classic, because it changed my way of thinking and helped open many ideas to me. read this! itz not only a christmas story, but a story of repentance that should be enjoyed all year round."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Master storyteller and social critic, Charles Dickens, turns this social treatise on shortcomings of Victorian society into an entertaining and heartwarming Christmas ghost story which has charmed generations and become an icon of Christmas traditions. Who, in the Western world has not heard, &quot;Bah, Humbug!&quot; And who can forget the now almost hackneyed line of Tiny Tim, &quot;God bless us, every one!&quot; or his cheerfully poignant observation, that he did not mind the stares of strangers in church, for he might thus serve as a reminder of He who made the lame, walk and the blind, see. Several movie versions: musical, animated, updated, or standard; as well as stage productions (I recall the Cleveland Playhouse and McCarter Theatre\`s with fondess.) have brought the wonderful characterizations to the screen, as well as to life. This story of the redemption of the bitter and spiritually poor miser, and the book itself; however, is a timeless treasure whose richness, like Mrs Cratchit\`s Christmas pudding, is one that no production can hope to fully capture."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Charles Dicken's A Christmas Carol is by far one of the greatest holiday novels ever. It was first printed in the winter of 1843 and it is still in printing to this day. This classic story of Christmas joy and Christmas hate has been one of my favorite books of all time. The interaction between Ebenezer Scrooge and the supernatural is humorous and touching. When Scrooge sees the troubles the Crachits are having with money, tiny tim, etc., it is moving to see Scrooge change his way of treating bob and a number of other people. I hope that this novel will hold its ground as one of the greatest holiday novels man has known."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This is a story everyone knows, but it's far more detailed in the book, I enjoyed it very much and highly reccomened it"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Love Robert Ingpen's illustrations - they work so well for this story in particular.

DIckens literally rose Christmas from the grave to show his fellow Londoners the importance of the holiday and it wasn't silly that we all put on our red and white hats for one day a year to share in yultide glee.

Charles Dickens shows an interesting perspective in this book and makes readers take a step back to look at themselves. Readers will compare themselves to Scrooge and try to change their ways, just as he does. It is an interesting perspective and a great way to spread the word about holiday spirit.After all, who doesn't have at least one Scrooge in the family?Anyone looking for an inspiring Christmas read; this book is for you. The writing may be old, but the spirit is still new and fresh!As an enjoyable little read, I don't see why anyone wouldn't want to take a chance with it. Let yourself be drawn into Scrooge's tale, and live what he lives. Only then will you find the true meaning of Christmas spirit."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"A Christmas Carol remains a Christmas classic for good reason. As it asks us all to live with the spirit of Christmas everyday, it shows Scrooge learning how to be kind and generous and enjoy his family and the people around him. More than a Christmas story, it offers a moral vision of a kinder, more generous world.Charles Dickens' writing style remains accessible and often humerus. The spirit visitors are drawn so vividly, they are quite enjoyable to read about as well. It is worth reading the original, even though there are movie and abridged versions everywhere.While to its benefit, the Kindle edition is unabridged and free, it lacks illustrations. Most printed editions include enjoyable illustrations. This is probably its only defect.Enjoy!

And like a scourge, it can leave one broken and bloody, stripped of all his or her defenses. No one knows this better than Mr. Scrooge, but I won't insult my readers by offering a summary of this well-known Christmas story (though I will chime in with my opinion that the old Disney version with Mickey Mouse and Scrooge McDuck is the best!).I know of no one who dislikes this story. That being said, the book is waaay better; by leaps and bounds! All of the movies tell the core of the story, but they leave out all of the nuance--if a picture is worth a thousand words and they have an hour and a half to tell this story (which was only 124 pages of somewhat large text), they should be adding nuance, not removing it!The only problem with it is that it's a book meant to appeal to everyone, including children. Therein lies the difficulty: it's somewhat like asking Beethoven to compose a jingle for an advertisement; sure, he could do it, and it would be good, but he could do so much better! And I know this is true, both because there are monstrous hints within the story (primarily when the narrator speaks), and because I've read some of his other works. But even if this is the worst that Dickens has to offer, then I would still rather read it than almost any other book written in the past 100 years.Memorable Quote:What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips, to have questioned her, that she might have opened them, to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush, to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price; in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest license of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.For more reviews like this, visit my profile."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I first read Charles Dickens' version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" in my 7th grade English class. The story remains as lyrical now as I first discovered then. I cannot imagine Christmas or literature without it.

Dickens makes it easy to hate Scrooge while invoking some compassion on this horrible soul. The mixture of both hatred and pity shows the genius of the author. With the visit of the long deceased partner of Scrooge, Scrooge sees the tormented ghost and faces what he may become if he does not change his ways. With the horror of the moment, Scrooge is informed of three ghosts who will visit Scrooge, in order that Scrooge may not suffer the same fait of his former business partner. The three ghosts visit showing Scrooge the joy of Christmas had been, the happiness and good some enjoy in the current Christmas despite their humble and afflicted estate and the terror of his future. Each ghost offers their own terror but all the while offering hope that a changed Scrooge could change an even scarier future. The story will grip you if you can overlook some of the tangents by Dickens and some of the old customs included in the book. If you have a tendency towards emotional reactions to a good book, you may want to prepare yourself before reading this book. Every reader should read this book at least once and then you will understand what is meant by a Dickens Christmas."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"\\"A Christmas Carol\\" is not just A Christmas story, but one of THE Christmas stories -- not only is it instantly recognizable by pretty much everybody, but it's relentlessly copied and spoofed in countless Christmas specials. But taken just by itself, Charles Dickens' yuletide novella is a pretty bleak and bittersweet affair, with brilliant imagery and lots of ghostly weirdness.Scrooge is... well, a scrooge -- a professional miser who hates Christmas, goodwill, charity, puppies, kittens, his relatives, his employees, and virtually everything else except money.And on Christmas Eve, his dead partner Jacob Marley comes back, wrapped with supernatural chains, and claims that Scrooge is doomed to the same fate. But he has a chance at redemption: three ghosts representing will visit him that night, taking him on a guided tour of Christmases past, present and yet to come.So Scrooge is transported on a trio of hourlong trips through time. The childlike Ghost of Christmas Past takes him to his bleak childhood, when he was less jaded and hard. The jolly Ghost of Christmas Present takes him to people's homes on the very next morning, specifically of of his nephew and the poor miner Bob Cratchit. And finally a Ringwraith-like spirit gives him a glimpse of Christmas years in the future... a bleak and terrible future, unless he changes his ways.You can read plenty of symbolism into a story like \\"A Christmas Carol\\"; I've heard speculation about Dickens' father, the Industrial Revolution, spiritualism, and all sorts of other stuff. But at its heart, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the most powerful when appreciated for its story alone -- a story about a greedy, miserable man who redeems himself by learning to love all humanity.Dickens' writing is utterly brilliant here. Most of the book is bleak, grimy and painted in shadows, with Dickens only rarely holding back from showing the dark situation of England's poor. A great example is the symbolic children Want and Ignorance (\\"a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds\\"). As for the Grim-Reaperlike third ghost, it's the stuff of nightmares.But all isn't dark here. Occasionally Dickens splashes it with moments of crystalline brilliance (\\"It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and... its dress trimmed with summer flowers\\"). And as dark as the book is, Dickens offers hope for the future.He also does a brilliant job with Scrooge, \\" a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire.\\" Having worked hard to make us hate Scrooge, Dickens then deftly displays his skill at slowly revealing how Scrooge became who and what he is, and slowly redeeming him.This particular edition is graced with Robert Innocenti's artwork, and it is gorgeous: detailed, atmospheric pictures that are alternately full of bright shining colors and dark dreary black-and-white images (such as the third spirit wafting Scrooge over a bleak, lifeless church and graveyard). Really wonderful accompaniment to the text.Charles Dickens created one of the greatest Christmas stories with \\"A Christmas Carol\\" -- bah humbugs, merry Christmases and all. God bless us, every one!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"SPOILERS FOLLOWCharles Dickens' 1843 classic \\"A Christmas Carol\\" tells quite possibly the most oft-told holiday story in the English-speaking world. Though there have been many movies made, plays performed, and even other books written about this little gem, the best way to experience \\"A Christmas Carol\\" remains reading Dickens' original text.Many people know it as the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a hardened, greedy man who undergoes a great emotional change one Christmas Eve through the assistance(and occasional hard prodding)of three ghosts. Each ghost represents some form of loss. For instance, the Ghost of Christmas Past represents the lost innocence and kindness Scrooge endures in a difficult childhood and young manhood. The Ghost of Christmas Present represents the love and fellowship Scrooge is losing in his current life, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come represents the finality of death and the lasting sting of a hateful life. Ironically, though the book is very powerfully about Ebenezer Scrooge, Dickens chooses to begin it with a discussion of his deceased business partner Jacob Marley.Ironic contrasts power the narrative, as the exceedingly wealthy Scrooge is miserable, while his poor employee Bob Cratchit is a contented man with a virtuous disposition and family. In a pared-down novel, by Dickens' amazing standards of length, Ebenezer Scrooge and Bob Cratchit are two of the richest character contrasts in world literature.\\"A Christmas Carol\\" is a richly satisfying read.

May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.\\"~Charles Dickens, 1843.And so A CHRISTMAS CAROL has since its publication; it has never been out of print or truly out of fashion. It is the quintessential Christmas story and the easiest of Dickens books to read. The narrator introduces us to Mr. Scrooge, a man whose heart has turned to stone from ambition, care, avarice, and greed. We see him at his desk in Scrooge and Marley Money House dark and chilled since he is too tight fisted to permit decent coal fires and candles. He scorns everyone that visits his office Christmas Eve, especially his nephew, Fred. But when he finally gets home, the massive door knocker transforms into Marley's face and strangely lights the foggy dark night.But Marley specter follows Scrooge to his bed chamber with chains, locks, and money boxes wrapped about his transparent body. He means to save his friend the fate that he has endured since he died seven years ago on this very night. Three Ghosts will haunt Scrooge: The Ghost of Christmas Past, The Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come - whom looks much like Death. Through the lessons these specters will reveal, Scrooge has a chance to become a different man and employer and lead a different life.Scrooge's transformation is genuine as it is remarkable. Through Dickens's simple narration, we not only witness Scrooge change but we also feel his emotions. We cry at the possible demise of Tiny Tim and the true affection Fred has for his uncle. Scrooge on Christmas morning has rediscovered faith, hope, and charity and his heart is full of love for the season as well as his neighbors. This novella is one I read every Christmas and I love it more each year."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"The book A Christmas Carol is a very good book.I think that Scoorge is a very gready man.There is three different spirits in this story:the ghost of christmas past,future,and yet to come.In this book Scrooge learns a valuable lesson in life."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"My review is about a selfish, grumpy, old man who has no Christmas spirit what so ever.

Over the years there have been so many film adaptations of this story and it was nice to see it in its original form."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"165 years ago this week, Charles Dickens published what would become one of his most noteworthy and best-loved gifts to the world, \\"A Christmas Carol\\".The illustrations Arthur Rackham made for this classic in 1915, with mostly lithe figures and spare coloring do great justice to the tale of an elderly miser, who, on the anniversary of his business partner's death on Christmas Eve, is forced to review his life, and is offered a final chance for redemption.The tale of Ebenezer Scrooge could be viewed as an early novel of spiritual psychoanalysis.After readers learn of Scrooge's character flaws--his stinginess, his cold-hearted attitude towards people, including a nephew and his wife, who are his only family--he is confronted by the ghost of his business partner, Jacob Marley, who, despite Scrooge's reluctance, shows him his long chain, explains its significance, and warns him to amend his ways.Scrooge is visited by three spirits--the first being the child-like, white-haired Ghost of Christmas Past, who makes Scrooge retrace his steps in life, causing him to review a harsh and lonely childhood, which is tempered by consolation from his loving but ill-fated sister, Fan, his happier years as an apprentice to a man named Fezziwig, and finally, he recognizes how his singular pursuit of wealth at all costs resulted in the loss of his fiancee, Belle.The Ghost of Christmas Present is the most joyous and festive of the apparitions.Sitting in a well-lit room at a table with a glorious bounty when he first encounters Scrooge, he escorts his elderly charge through London, where he sees the spirit of the season among the people, and visits the houses of his employee, Bob Cratchit, and that of his nephew, Fred. He learns of the plight of Cratchit's son, Tiny Tim, discovers how he is viewed in both households, is shown the impact of poverty among those whom he has the potential to help, and lastly warned about the consequences of Want and Ignorance.The third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come, is the darkest, most foreboding of the phantoms. It is hooded, faceless, and silent as it shows the old man the possible future, pointing to significant details with a clammy hand as Scrooge realizes that he has reaped what he has sown.Back in his bed at the end of a chilling night's journey, Scrooge sees the potential to be a better man than before. He has come to terms with his past, learns to rejoice in the present, and to create a better future for those around him.Ebenezer...In Hebrew, the name means \\"Stone of Help\\", which may well be why Dickens chose it for one of his most famous characters.In the end, a formerly miserly old man does a fine job of becoming just that!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Jim Dale is a very fine oral interpreter, it is a skill to read some of the most beloved books and make people love them more and discover something new.This is a 3 disc set of A Christmas Carol, audio version and Jim Dale gives each character its own unique voice and he is pleasant to listen to and he adds charm, warmth and humor to this very well known story.Treat your self, treat your family.

But taken just by itself, Charles Dickens' yuletide novella is a pretty bleak and bittersweet affair, with brilliant imagery and lots of ghostly weirdness.Scrooge is... well, a scrooge -- a professional miser who hates Christmas, goodwill, charity, puppies, kittens, his relatives, his employees, and virtually everything else except money.And on Christmas Eve, his dead partner Jacob Marley comes back, wrapped with supernatural chains, and claims that Scrooge is doomed to the same fate. But he has a chance at redemption: three ghosts representing will visit him that night, taking him on a guided tour of Christmases past, present and yet to come.So Scrooge is transported on a trio of hourlong trips through time. The childlike Ghost of Christmas Past takes him to his bleak childhood, when he was less jaded and hard. The jolly Ghost of Christmas Present takes him to people's homes on the very next morning, specifically of of his nephew and the poor miner Bob Cratchit. And finally a Ringwraith-like spirit gives him a glimpse of Christmas years in the future... a bleak and terrible future, unless he changes his ways.You can read plenty of symbolism into a story like \\"A Christmas Carol\\"; I've heard speculation about Dickens' father, the Industrial Revolution, spiritualism, and all sorts of other stuff. But at its heart, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the most powerful when appreciated for its story alone -- a story about a greedy, miserable man who redeems himself by learning to love all humanity.Dickens' writing is utterly brilliant here. Most of the book is bleak, grimy and painted in shadows, with Dickens only rarely holding back from showing the dark situation of England's poor. A great example is the symbolic children Want and Ignorance (\\"a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds\\"). As for the Grim-Reaperlike third ghost, it's the stuff of nightmares.But all isn't dark here. Occasionally Dickens splashes it with moments of crystalline brilliance (\\"It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and... its dress trimmed with summer flowers\\"). And as dark as the book is, Dickens offers hope for the future.He also does a brilliant job with Scrooge, \\" a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire.\\" Having worked hard to make us hate Scrooge, Dickens then deftly displays his skill at slowly revealing how Scrooge became who and what he is, and slowly redeeming him.Charles Dickens created one of the greatest Christmas stories with \\"A Christmas Carol\\" -- bah humbugs, merry Christmases and all.

That the author can generate such imagery and fully-realized characters in such a short story, is a testament to his staying power.

Each drawing is beautifully done and follows along with the story. This is the unabrdged edition which I personally prefer; however, be aware that there will be an occassional paragraph with old English words and references that will be difficult to understanad unless you are an English scholar. These are infrequent and do not detract from the story - in fact, it adds charm and authenticity. Better than having some editor arbitrarily determining what you should read and what should be cut out. I believe the Amazon price for this book was $12.00 - an amazing bargain.

I got a few hits, but nothing that really struck me as the \\"definite\\" copy I was looking for.If you are looking for an heirloom quality copy, this might not be it......at least not for a couple more decades......as I believe this book will wear nicely and be a great piece once the pages start to yellow.

I haven't played it yet, but I have had some of them before, and to be honest, I don't think I would have bothered within this edition of A Christmas Carol if I'd known, as the quality of recording and reading of these leave a lot to be desired.Having said that, if your not bothered about the audiobook, don't forget the illustrations as they ARE included and have been taken from the original book, which I think was published in 1843, but whether this particular book and it's illustrations are from that edition, I cannot tell.

If you haven't read it, do so, whether it is this version or not.As for this particular version, the index is not active, but there are only 5 chapters, or 'Staves', and the book is really very short, usually only around 100 pages in a traditional book. There are a few formatting issues throughout the story, but nothing, in my opinion, that takes away from the enjoyment of reading this heartwarming classic. I have read this book many times, and have found errors in paper versions as well. So take it for what it is; a free, slightly flawed, version of a wonderful story that has become a part of our collective consciousness.I should point out that my rating of three stars is for this version, due to some minor formatting issues. The book itself deserves five stars."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I just finished flipping through this in the bookshop, and it is absolutely gorgeous.

These are the letters, words, sentences, paragraphs that made Christmas the celebration that it is today - the family parties, the feasts, the excitement, giving to the poor. Virtually every way we celebrate this magnificent Holiday (except the mall part!) comes from this book written by Charles Dickens.First off, this is the unabridged version. Nothing added - nothing taken away. That's as it should be. (Unfortunately, as great as they may be, the movie versions truly do not do the book justice - although I must say the George C. Scott and Alistair Sim versions do come fairly close).One thing that surprises me about this book is how few people I know that have have actually read it, but they've seen one version or another of the movie countless times! They don't seem to realize that when books are put to film, so much is taken out for length or for other reasons. A Christmas Carol is no different. In fact, if you watch all of the different movie versions available, you STILL would not get the complete book, even though each movie adds one thing or another from the original story that the others may not.There are countless copies of this story available in various book form, but this particular version is probably one of the best that I have seen. The illustrations attempt in some part to keep in the same spirit as in Dickens' original. But the best, most interesting part of this version (besides the story itself) is all of the little facts, explanations, and trivia put into the margins throughout this book. They give the modern 21st century reader more of an understanding of what 19th century English life was like. A couple of examples: when Dickens writes of the Cratchit family taking their goose to the bakers to be cooked, I wondered why would any one take their food OUT to be cooked and then picked up later. This book explains that few poor people in this time period had ovens large enough to roast a good family sized bird. They were big enough to cook a small bit of meat and that was about it. In order to have one of those rare Holiday meals, they had to take it to the large baker's oven at an appointed time for cooking.Another fact I did not know was that in the story, Scrooge's sister, Fan, was based on Dickens' actual sister in law, Mary Hogarth.There are also a multitude of paintings, drawings, and sketches from Dickens' time showing his time. Now you can see, as accurately as one can considering there were no cameras, life of the rich, middle class, and poor as it actually was. There's a picture of Queen Victoria and her family celebrating Christmas. There is also a beautiful painting of a poor labourer's family Christmas celebration. There are sketches from the first edition of 'A Christmas Carol.'If you plan on owning a copy of this most wonderful of all Christmas novels, this is the version to get."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I'll not insult you all by describing the action of this classic novella, nor belabor the lesson taught. I'm sure even Mowgli the Jungle Boy must have heard this story once a year growing up in the jungle. But with all the TV and movie and cartoon and Muppet iterations (the best of which remains the 1951 Alastair Sim movie version), when's the last time you went back and actually read the original book?Dickens is, of course, a wonderful author and earlier generations read everything that he wrote. Today, however, you read an obligatory novel or two in High School, breath a sigh of relief that's over and then blithely ignore him along with the rest of the ancients. But, as a reacquaintance with A Christmas Carol will remind you, he remains pretty accessible and his novels are often quite fun. What's more, there's even a Reading Version (available online) of the story that Dickens condensed himself for his numerous public readings of the tale. It's perfect for reading aloud to the family.Here's just a sample of the prose to entice you:On Scrooge before: Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge. a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.and Scrooge after: Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him.He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!We, all of us, have a tendency to let the classics become so encrusted that we take them for granted and forget how good they really are; if this has happened for you with A Christmas Carol, do yourself a favor and dig out a copy and reread it this Holiday Season. I bet it becomes an annual tradition.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Mr. Dale provides his usual vocal magic to bring Dickens' immortal holiday classic to life. Excellent narration, sprightly character voices and the reader's sense of good fun make this recording my personal favorite of 'A Christmas Carol'.If you enjoy this then pick up more of Mr. Dale's audiobook recordings. I highly recommend all 6 of the Harry Potter audiobooks *on CD of course as you will wear your tapes out & replace them constantly* and 'Peter & the Starcatchers'."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I read this every Christmas.Great classic novel.

I really hope the boy I bought it for is enjoying it because I hated to give it away!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"One of the stories I really wanted to share with my children this season was A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens. The children I particularly wanted to read this with were my 7-year-old daughter, and 8 and 11-year-old sons. While I wanted them to know the story of Ebeneezer Scrooge and his change of heart, I knew that the unabridged original version would probably be a bit much for my daughter to take in, and require a lot of explanations regarding the archaic language for my sons. So for us, The Great Illustration version of A Christmas Carol was perfect.This version has illustrations on just about every page, which was particularly important for my very visual younger children. This version stayed true to the original as I remembered it and kept the personality of Scrooge, from bitter old man to renewed and invigorated redeemed soul intact!I also felt that the use of modern English was not a disservice to the original. While reading about the death of Tiny Tim, I felt the same amount of emotion and pain as reading the original. In fact as my voice cracked and the tears started to well my little son, who is just beginning to truly appreciate the subtle nuances that make for a good reading said, \\"Great expression, mom!\\"I have read some of the reviews of other books in this series as being too watered down, and that may be. But for this particular age group, I think this book in particular fills a special need. I think reading it as a family this season will leave a special impression on their young minds and hearts and make them want to pick this story up again when they are a bit older and able to handle more of a reading challenge."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This story is about an old man who passed for a sadness experience in his life wich turned his heart dark without feelings, he didn't want to have contact with any human been and only has interest in money, but one day three ghost make him look three events in his life, past, present and future and after that, he could understand the importance of sharing with everyone, his time, money (contributing with poor people), giving love and smile, helping people, all this things could fill your heart with happiness and the feelings that you are doing the best of you to make happy other people who need it.

The characters have so much depth. The made for t.v. or movie screen renditions do not truly depict what Ebenezer Scrooge witnesses with the three spirits that causes such a change in his outlook on life. Such as Scrooge's emotions being quickened by the past heartache in his childhood; seeing how his bad choices caused the hardening of his heart and how deeply it cost him in the end; seeing what could have been his to enjoy and then thinking it could still be his with the Spirit of Christmas Present only to find out the future does not hold any love or joy for him by the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come and instead his actions leave him robbed at death and no one left to grieve for him. Read the book to hear how this story was really written.

As Christmas nears, Scrooge is visited by spectors of Christmas past, present, and future, to show him the error of his ways, and teach him that Christmas spirit must be held in one's heart all the days of one's life. Will Scrooge learn this lesson in time to save himself?This is a story with which most of us are familiar. There are countless adaptations in the form of children's books, movies, and abridged texts, so I am quite familiar with the story. However, I have never actually read the complete original text. Imagine my surprise when I found such elegance and beauty in Dickens' original words. This coming from me, someone who does not always have the greatest appreciation of Dickens.I have always loved this story, and found the message so deeply touching. I have so much empathy for Scrooge as a character, have suffered a lonely childhood and gone without real happiness his whole adult life. It is nice to see the theme of redemption so clearly illustrated in this tale. This is probably the classic Christmas story, and I imagine it will be, in some form, a permanent part of my holiday traditions."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Absolutely, hands down the best reading of Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\".

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Scrooge starts by hating Christmas and then ends up loving the loving it thanks to the three ghosts: Past, Present, and the Future ghost. I fell that A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens is a very good book, by the way that he foreshadows the chapters in the story and to give you and image of what's to come. I like the story because, Charles Dickens, makes images at the beginning of the story and he describes the ghost to be a very creative way within the story; and he knows how to make things very interesting. Charles Dickens made his characters very creative and neat looking with in your brain. I also think that Scrooges attitude in the beginning of the story is very negative, and I feel that he will never change or do anything for anybody. Scrooge, towards the end is really nice and he is giving to people who don't have anything for the most part. But towards the end Scrooge comes back to life and is nice once again. I also saw Scrooge change through out the book when the present ghost came and he sees the way that he acts toward to the people and he sees that Tiny Tim will die but he does not really care. The future ghost comes and shows him self dead, and he realized that he died greedy .Past ghost comes and changes him for good, because he saw himself sitting alone and he had no one to talk to or anything. I feel that when Scrooge came out of his greedy stage and bought a huge turkey for the Crattich family and he acted like anther father to Tiny Tim and how Tiny Tim did not die and I thought that was very sweet for what he did for them and he garishly gave everybody in the family money. I though that a Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens was a very good book and everybody should read it."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This is Dickens at his best.

I, like most people I know, grew up with Scrooge (although the form has changed). From Donald Duck to Jim Carrey, I've listened to the story of the grumpy, old, miserly man and his miraculous change of heart on one fateful Christmas Eve.My aunt actually ordered A Christmas Carol for her kindle and I saw the email and thought - oh, that would make a great read-along book for December. Perfect season, I've never read it.. but oh.. it's DICKENS. I don't know about you, but just the name Dickens is enough to strike fear deep into my heart. I struggled so much with A Tale of Two Cities and David Copperfield back in the day that, although interested to see how the book was, I approached this story with not a little bit of trepidation.It also helped to know it was short. I'll admit it.For those of you who haven't read the book, let me just say - put aside everything you know about Dickens from his other works and give this one a shot. It's remarkably easy to understand and, although he can go on, due to the shortness of the book as a whole, the descriptions don't get too much out of hand.There were quite a few things in the book that surprised me - details that really rounded out the story much more than the movies ever have. I regret that I've let all these years go by without establishing the reading of this story as atradition for myself, but it is something I intend to change in the upcoming years."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"A Great Christmas novel about a man that was stingy and grumpy.

Set in a time much like today: where poverty is widespread, being of the middle class is popular and a small population holds a large potion of the wealth. Social class dictates life, most lifetimes are spent in a single class and there is seldom movement within the classes. The characters of Dickens novel live, and for the most part, thrive in this environment. They trust in the Lord and their fellowman; during this Christmas season they are charitable and kind, with the exception of Ebenezer Scrooge. He is a cold, heartless man with no compassion or sentiment. He hates Christmas and refuses to give any portion of his wealth to the needy and less fortunate. Scrooge is a cheap man, who doesn&#65533;t trust banks, so he heats both his home and office with one small fire, keeps his money in a safe and counts it regularly. It is the only pleasure he allows himself. He is also a lonely man; his business partner, the closest thing he had to a friend, died seven years ago and he has disowned his one remaining relative.The life of his office clerk, Bob Cratchit, is entirely different. Bob works from dawn until dusk for a poor fifteen shillings a week, and is only begrudgingly given Christmas Day off. Despite this, Bob is a happy man. He has a loving wife, six beautiful children and a warm, cozy home. The Cratchits where not happy with their situation, &#65533;but they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another and contented with the time.&#65533;The lives of Scrooge and the Cratchits are permanently interlocked after the three ghosts pay Scrooge a visit. His journeys with them and the realizations he comes to, leave him a redeemed man. He changes his behavior, vows to amend the wrongs he has done, but he is not a totally new man. Although Scrooge donates his money to the less fortunate and spends his time with the Cratchits, his actions are purely to appease his conscience. His motivation is to make himself to feel better and to prove that he has not lost all the decent qualities he has when he was younger.Charles Dickens wrote this novel, his shortest, for the sole purpose of making money to support his family. He had several wives and many children; he spent most of his life living like Bob Cratchit, barley making bills and struggling to get his work noticed. A Christmas Carol was Dickens best selling novel, his intention was for his story to be popular, which it was, but he also added elements that would dig at the emotions of his peers. His depiction of a poor family at Christmas has become a tradition for years, and every Christmas someone reads his story and gives something of themselves to help make Christmas a better holiday for others."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I love this book and all its movie versions.

He was very selfish and very unliked. His needed to learn to share and love. During the story three ghosts come to show him his past, present, and his future.

When Scrooge is revisited by a ghost friend he is warned about the three ghosts that will come. The ghosts come and take him many places and show him all the wrong he has done to others.

It's light, fun, sad, and presents an important message about Christmas. During this time of rampant commercialism and long lists to Santa, it's easy to forget that the greatest joys of Christmas come from the giving. This book illustrates the euphoria that Scrooge feels when he finally is able to give gifts, either of time, money, food, or whatever, to other people. Christmas is not about what you can get...it's about what you can give. If you want a story that will remind you of the real meaning of Christmas, this is it! In terms of story-telling, this book has classic Dickensian characters and ample humor and drama, making it a classic in its own right. If I had any criticism, it would be that the story seems to wander a bit and move even a little too fast. But it really doesn't take too much away from the experience."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for myself so that I could enjoy this timeless Christmas tale over the holidays.

I finally sat down and read the novel and am glad I did. The novel by the prolific and popular Dickens is well-written with great characters. That the author can generate such imagery and fully-realized characters in such a short story, is a testament to his staying power. This book packs an emotional punch, and is a great tale for the holidays, or any time you need to remind yourself to be thankful for what you have and those around you. A classic story and a must read. 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Every Christmas I say I will reread A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens, and this past Christmas I actually did it.Nobody needs reminding of the story of A Christmas Carol. We all know the tale of Scrooge and his visits by the Ghost of Christmas Present, the Ghost of Christmas Past and the Ghost of Christmas Future. Even for those who have never read the book, the story has been retold in many different forms and at least three versions make their appearance on our television screens each Christmas.So why has this little tale proved to be so popular? I think it's because Scrooge is such a memorable character and we all know someone we like to think of as a Scrooge. And, let's be honest, we would like them to change. A Christmas Carol touches the desires of all of us to show people what they are really like and have them change for the better. And Scrooge is also one of those characters that seem to be likeable even when they're easy to dislike.I think this book is still worth reading, even though we know the story. It is a very small book. I read it in its entirety on Christmas Eve. It is also very easy to read. Some classics, I feel, are difficult for the modern reader because our tastes and expectations are different from those of the past. But because A Christmas Carol was written quickly by Dickens, and kept short, it will pose no problems to readers of today.Besides being a great tale, A Christmas Carol also gives us an insight into the way Christmas was celebrated in Victorian society.

In my opinion it is bested only by the real story itself found within the Gospels. Dickens wasn't the greatest novelist of his time, perhaps not even the greatest of his friends and acquaintances. However, his characters will live with us forever for no one can introduce us to better ones. Old Ebenezer Scrooge is perhaps one of his best known and has become a symbol of anti-holiday merriment. Added to this is the plight of the poor which Dickens describes in painful detail drawn from his keen eye and actual experience.

Some chilling and heartfelt moments about friends and family"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"First, the tale: Dickens' story hasn't aged at all. On the first page, there's this wry joke about how Marley was \\"dead as a door-nail,\\" then goes on to speculate about why door-nails are more dead than, say, coffin-nails. This sets the tone for a powerful tale of redemption and change laced with both humor and a bit of fear (all these ghosts!). At the end of it all, Dickens inspires us to be better with this old story; he really captures a \\"spirit of Christmas\\" (and I listened to the story in March).Second, the reader: Jim Dale is simply one of the best in the business. He lends similar creative, dramatic interpretation to his characters here as in his masterful readings of the Harry Potter books. We plan to initiate a family Christmas tradition of listening to this audiobook every December, letting it both entertain and inspire us."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Mr. Dale provides his usual vocal magic to bring Dickens' immortal holiday classic to life.

In no way either slick or modern, when one is handed the book, it seems as you are holding an artifact from another time; a time of coal fires, slate roofs, horses in the streets, a time that predates the sad state of comercialism that permeates contemporary Christmas season. In its simplicity of story and its fine nostalgic illustrations it becomes a treasure to be handed down through one generation to the next.Hope dwells here."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This review is of the free version of the story.Overall, a very disappointing read. The story is superb, probably the best Christmas story other than the story of Christmas itself, but the formatting is outright horrible. No effort was put into proper conversion from print to ebook. It was literally scanned with text recognition and exported to HTML. There are characters that display incorrectly because they are just 'typed' and are not the correct code. The page numbers from the print version are randomly scattered through the text, making it very hard to read. There are no page breaks, no table of contents, and absolutely no formatting whatsoever. Some text is in caps, other text in bold, you know where I'm going. Download it and see for yourself.You are better off spending $.99 on a decently formatted version of this story. I have tried a sample of several versions and this one has left me fairly happyA Christmas Carol, as it looks to be very professionally done(Embedded cover, active table of contents, page-breaks, appropriate 'stave' headings, etc. I imagine it will be the same way throughout the book).

(enriched edition)You know the story..... Ebenzer Scrooge is a bitter old man who \\"Will keep Christmas in my own way\\", which is not at all. People cringe when they see him coming. Dogs cower. But that is all about to change. He is visited by the ghost of his deceased partner, Jacob Marley, dragging the chains he has forged for himself in life, and learns that it is not too late for him. He can redeem himself!Scrooge is visited by three more spirits that Christmas eve. His past, his present and his future. Each take him on a fantastic journey,through time and space, showing him how his ways are wrong, and what will happen if he doesn't change.Scrooge goes through subtle changes at first, is humbled by the spirits, and then he is transformed from a bitter man to a caring human being. His new found appreciation of mankind is contagious. In the end we know that he changes not just so he can have a better after life, but because he really cares about life and humanity.This Enriched Edition includes explanatory notes and overviews of themes.it's also a really good buy and would make a treasured gift.Also available on CD with a marvelous reading by Geoffrey Palmer -A Christmas Carol- listen while trimming the tree or wrapping presents.Happy Holidays to allLaurie"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I've been a huge fan of Jonathan Winters all of my life. What is surprising in this CD is that Winters remains faithful to Dicken's text.

He doesn't.So, for those looking for a wild and crazy version of A Christmas Carol you COULD be disapointed.

Dickens Christmas Carol is the type of read that must be completed via a REAL book, preferably an old leather bound edition with decorative end papers and such. The tactile creases in the paper, the creak of the bindings, light dust thumbed away on the top ream, the smell of old musks radiating from text, natural oils reflecting off the leather binding...The Kindle serves a purpose but nothing beats an old book."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I ordered the audio book A CHRISTMAS CAROL to use with my class.

The holiday season would not be complete without reading some version of this story and that is why I believe this classic will be popular with many generations to come.- Ethan Butler"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Critiquing Dickens' Christmas Carol is a misnomer. Rather, it is Dickens who critiques us with this masterwork.A Christmas Carol has burrowed into the very heart of our Western Culture to where few people would be confused if you referred to someone as a \\"Scrooge,\\" that is to say a skinflint, miser.Aside from presenting us with some of the most memorable images in literature as Scrooge is taken by the Ghosts of the Past, Present and Future to review his life and probable ending, we are brought along with his and given opportunity to review those elements in our own lives.A Christmas Carol was not just a nice story of the Christmas Season to give warmth and cheer.Far from it!Dickens had an agenda. Just as in his other famous works, like Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Dickens longed to make a social statement to draw attention to the poor in England, their plight and hardship. A Christmas Carol is about Scrooge as a person, but also as representing a class of the wealthy whose abundance is wrested from the large working poor such as Cratchett and his family. THEY are the point. THEY are the ones Dickens sought to draw to public attention.Heaven help us is we simply see this book as nostalgia and fail to see the point Dickens had to make then and which still applies today!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This was a wonderful surprise for me after having to put hard times down through boredom. It's about a hundred and thirty pages long with large gaps in between the lines so it took me about three or four hours to read it. Of course I've seen countless actors play Scrooge (George C. Scott my favourite)but really, because there's been so many, none of them dominated my mind while reading. The plot moves along very quickly and little is in the book plotwise which is not in the films. In fact I'm now aware of how much the films 'fleshed out' some of it.Also in the movies you can't get a lot of the Dickens humour which is sprinkled through the prose so it was a great choice for me and will be for you."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This is the perfect book for Christmas reading. It is a short story that most of us are familiar with but may have not taken the time to actually read. I have seen versions of it on TV, movies, and this year even seen a good performance of it done in a play. This year I decided to pick up the book and devote a little bit of time to reading the story. It of course is a classic written by one of the greatest writers ever, Charles Dickens. The story has a lot of meaning and reminds us that we should be aware of how we treat others not only at Christmas time but in all we do. Ebenezer Scrooge may be in us all at one time or another but like him there is time for redemption if we allow ourselves to reflect and appreciate what we have and are willing to be giving of ourselves to others."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"The quality of the color printing of the illustrations is poor.

Though he could meet the expense of the most expensive clothes available, he chose to dress in the fashion of a lower-class civilian. He worked in a counting house with only his clerk Bob Cratchit for business. Scrooge was a grumpy old man whom believed that Christmas is for rich people. He also thinks that Christmas is also just a reason to miss work and get gifts to one another and also to exchange the gifts. Every time the Christmas holiday would come Scrooge would get the same feelings as the years before which are not very Christmas spirity. Most people respected his dislike for Christmas holidays, and continued to dislike him, despise him, even hate him. He doesn't believe in all of the good cheer, happiness and charity that the season promotes, and he makes sure everyone knows how he feels about the Christmas spirit. His money was what he lived by. One night Scrooge was visited by his friend, which was Marley, who was also grumpy and cold as Scrooge was. When Marley visited Scrooge, Marley told Scrooge that if he continues to be stingy and so selfishly he would continue with greed as his assemble. He also tells Scrooge that three spirits will haunt him. On Christmas Eve, Scrooge received three visits from three specific ghosts. The ghost names where the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. Those ghost showed him the true meaning of Christmas and the true meaning of his life. They showed him his error in valuing money over people. Scrooge saw his long forgotten past, realizing all the good quality he had deserted, and all he had done to guide him where he was now. He saw his childhood, his grief and pleasure. He saw his relatives and acquaintances. He also saw himself turn from all these through his greed as his age progressed."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I choose this rating because it was a pretty boring book but it was finda interesting itself.

Reading the book allowed to take things in at my own pace: if I wanted to pause and think about a particular wording, or if I wanted to back up and re-read something, I did, and it took the experience to a whole new level.

And my book club selection was A Christmas Story: The Book That Inspired the Hilarious Classic Film by Jean Shepard. The first created our modern Christmas. The second, well, the second was the basis for a gag-filled, funny movie. Both are touchstones of modern, American ChristmasesI'm not a Dickens fan but in reading these two short works almost simultaneously, I was surprised by one thing: even though I'm separated from Dickens by the Atlantic and one-hundred and seventy years and unfamiliarity with the Victorian world and a familiarity with the the settings -- if not the times --- of Shepherd's stories, I so much more preferred Dickens to Shepherd.I've given some thought to this. It's not like I'm was surprised by the narrative. They're pretty much what I've seen on the TV for decades. It's not that I knew that after Jean Shepherd divorced his second wife, he completely ignored his under seven son and daughter he'd had with her for the rest of his life. Dickens' wasn't a great husband or father either. (Then again, he at least didn't publicly deny their existence and did support his children.)I finally realized why I liked Scrooge's story over Ralphie's. It's that Dickens is Charles freakin' Dickens and Shepherd is, well, Jean Shepherd.Dickens can be \\"a vein of saccharine sentimentalism\\", true. But it is called A Christmas Carol. People are wanting saccharine sentimentalism. Ayway, it is leavened with rather dark passages that offer great balance. In fact, there's one scene that Dicken's writes that I've never seen touched on the the many films. It's part of the tour that the Second Ghost gives Scrooge.\\"Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remember those he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him.\\"I found that wonderful and joyous. It's Christmas.Compare that to the moment after the Bumpesses hounds ruined the Christmas turkey. In the short story, it's actually an Easter ham.\\"Finally, he [the old man] spoke, in a low, rasping voice: \\"All right! OK! Get your coats. We're going to the Chinese joint. We're going to have chop suey.\\"Ordinarily, this would have been a gala of the highest order, going to the chop-suey joint. Today, it had all the gaiety of a funeral procession. The meal was eaten completely in silence.\\"Not quite a chorus of Chinese Fa-La-La-La-La's of the film, is it? Not very....Christmas-y, really?In other not-so-obvious ways, you can feel the sharp edge of post-modernism -- or is it nihilism? Well, whatever -ism it is that tells you not to have joy in this world -- creeping it's way into stories.The final thing that turned me off a bit to Shepherd was, again, the Bumpuses. The family -- not just the dogs -- is detailed in the story. I found it offensive. While Dickens almost beatifies the poor. Shepherd depiction is so full of cultural smears and stereotypes that would be considered very bad taste if applied to another group of people. And Shepherd just keeps going on and on with pilling cliche after cliche on them including a mention of father-daughter incest. It just got tiring.With A Christmas Story, stick to the movie. With A Christmas Carol, read the book...and watch the 113 movies made of it."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I would have given this book a good rating before I even bought it, having read the story and had it read to me decades ago and a re-reading simply confirmed it - five stars.

One can really feel Dickens' love of humanity and joie de vivre throughout. At the end, Scrooge overcomes his addiction to money, misanthropy and greed to partake of the joys of participating in mankind.It is revolutionary because it is the transition of a miserly man to one, who at the conclusion, shares what he has with his fellow beings. In a sense, it is an apt theme for the \\"Occupy Movement\\" with its focus on the 1% who control most of the wealth of the world.There are an astounding number of moral lessons to be taken from this simple, but animated tale, by one of the world's greatest story-tellers.Favourite quotes: from Marley's ghost playing on the word \\"business\\" - \\"Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance and benevolence, were all, my business\\"From the second ghost: \\"There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humour\\"."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I have listened to this tape every Christmas since I was little and it's absolutely amazing.

Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law.9. The commandments, \\"Do not commit adultery,\\" \\"Do not murder,\\" \\"Do not steal,\\" \\"Do not covet,\\" and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this one rule: \\"Love your neighbor as yourself.\\"10. Love does no harm to its neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.11. And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.12. The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.Scrooge envisions his past, his present, and his future, and is given the choice between damnation and salvation. He reveals his choice by saying,\\"I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone ... Scrooge was better than his word.

Charles Dickens just blesses my heart. When I read a Christmas Carol, I was truly touched; anyone reading this story should grasp the concept that we all need to love one another: That includes sharing, helping, and just being kind. The best way of getting it over to the reader that as a person one should live so that a happy afterlife is ensured is the ghost voice of Marley, Scrooge's partner. Marley had lived as a tight grasping old man, just like Scrooge. He died, and Scrooge is the heir. Scrooge takes over, but he is NO BETTER than Marley. He is such a greedy, stingy person that even the dogs hate him! He has not friends--PERIOD. And then...one day...On Christmas Eve, Scrooge's nephew drops in to invite him over for a Christmas dinner. In his usual manner, Scrooge dismisses the young man with his usual 'humbug' word.That night, he is visited by Marley's ghost. Scrooge is not a scary man. He talks to Marley as if it is nothing, but inwardly he is a bit shaken. What really scares him is when he is told by Marley that he will be visited by the ghosts.Marley is right.First, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past. Then the Ghost of Christmast Present. And last...and scariest...of all, is the Ghost of Christmas Future. In a short while, he shows Scrooge what will happen to him if he does not change his way. And he shows Scrooge his own grave! Imagine being shown your own grave! In the end, Scrooge has a complete transformation. He is no longer stingy or greedy. I like to think that he devoted the rest of his life to helping others. Now, I don't believe in ghosts, but I sure do think that this little ghost-like story is one of the best!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"An all-time classic, Charles Dickens's A Christmas carol was a total star to me. it's not Christmas without watching the Muppet version, why not read it for a change?

In any case, one of Dickens' classics, and deservedly so."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"(In my blog review of this (visible at basicallyamazingashley.com) I have some really awesome pictures from a stage performance.)We all know that there are myriads of great (and not so great) books that have been turned into movies, plays, animated cartoons, TV shows and etc. etc. etc. I always roll my eyes at people who respond to the question- How did you like that book? With some variation of, \\"Oh ya, I loved it! The movie was so great!\\" Gag. Really?! You just said that?! You just smeared the name of literature by telling me a book was great because you liked the movie?! (Ahem...) Well, the other day I shamefacedly realized that I was guilty of this myself. (Insert horrified gasp here) One of my fondest memories of Christmas, most beloved childhood memories and in my top 3 favorite Christmas stories was missing something...A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens is one of the most recognized, well known, and cherished Christmas stories in existence. There are numerous versions and adaptations for both children and adults, in animation, live action or produced live on stage. You can find it serious or slightly comical or even as a musical. Some follow the original script closely while others use only a loose interpretation of the story. Whatever versions you've seen, most people are very familiar with the plight of the Cratchit family and Tiny Tim, the cold, miserly heart of Ebenezer Scrooge, and the eerie spirits who visit him during the night of Christmas Eve.However familiar we are with the story, how many of us have actually read the book? I imagine not very many. It's included on BBC's The Big Read and I wonder how many people include it because of the story rather than the book itself. So, to avoid this horrible reader faux pas, I decided to pick up this favored story and read it for myself. It's a short book, more of a novella than a novel, and I already knew that I loved the story.I did really enjoy reading this book and I'm glad I can now say that I've actually read it. However, I must admit that I am a tiny bit more in love with the idea of this book than its reality. It's a wonderful story, with a wonderful message and wonderful characters, but I didn't have the same emotional connection to the written story that I do to the various productions I've seen. I know that this is more due to past experiences and the relationship it has to my childhood than anything negative about the book. I loved the book and will definitely reread it in the future, but it's just not the same as watching Scrooge, the Musical or The Muppets.The book places more emphasis on the characters and the realizations they make than just the story of Scrooge. Most movie or live productions emphasize Scrooge's discovery of the Christmas Spirit, and becoming a more generous person. I love that, and it is a very important part of the story. However, I love that reading the book offers more insight into why Scrooge became the way he did and the relationships he had with those around him.It is a great story to invite the Christmas spirit and remember the true meaning of Christmas, but it is also a cautionary tale. Be careful the emphasis you place on money and things. It is usually more important to focus on the people in your lives than the things in your life and this story, no matter how you experience it is a great reminder of that."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"An apt reminder of what makes a timeless classic!

It was magical.The narrator impressed me with all of the voices that he did. In scenes when multiple characters were conversing, it was easy to follow along due to the unique voices that he gave each character. His British accent made me feel as though Dickens himself could be narrating the story.Listening to this book together would be a wonderful family tradition! Both young and old will love this story!

I thought I knew the story pretty well. I mean, I knew that the ghost of Christmas present struggled pronouncing pistachio, I knew that there was a funny rat. I had no doubt that I knew all that there was to know about the Christmas Carol, but I decided to read it anyway.Boy was I in for a surprise (insert sarcasm here). I'm not gonna lie, this was a hard read. It wasn't because of the content or writing ability of Dickens, but it was the language barrier. Sometimes I swear it was like I was reading a different language. It took a while for me to read some parts and I had to use the wonderful dictionary feature of the Kindle many, many times.I did enjoy the story and it is incredible how Dickens can describe even the most mundane details and make them interesting. I could see the ghost of Christmas past's flame, I could hear Marley's chains and see the shock on Scrooge's face when he sees his own grave. Dickens is incredible at painting pictures with words.After reading this book I saw the newer animated Christmas Carol with Jim Carrey as Scrooge and I was very impressed at how well they brought the actual story to life. There were some differences, but overall they did a magnificent job.Definitely a good read during the Christmas season or any time really, whenever you need to remember that we should value other people and treat them as we want to be treated.If you like my review and want to read more of them I have a blog chronicaling my first year with my Kindle.

Rather, it is Dickens who critiques us with this masterwork.A Christmas Carol has burrowed into the very heart of our Western Culture to where few people would be confused if you referred to someone as a \\"Scrooge,\\" that is to say a skinflint, miser.Aside from presenting us with some of the most memorable images in literature as Scrooge is taken by the Ghosts of the Past, Present and Future to review his life and probable ending, we are brought along with his and given opportunity to review those elements in our own lives.A Christmas Carol was not just a nice story of the Christmas Season to give warmth and cheer.Far from it!Dickens had an agenda. Just as in his other famous works, like Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Dickens longed to make a social statement to draw attention to the poor in England, their plight and hardship. A Christmas Carol is about Scrooge as a person, but also as representing a class of the wealthy whose abundance is wrested from the large working poor such as Cratchett and his family. THEY are the point. THEY are the ones Dickens sought to draw to public attention.Heaven help us is we simply see this book as nostalgia and fail to see the point Dickens had to make then and which still applies today!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I really enjoyed reading A Christmas Carol.

This is an advanced book. Although it is family friendly, it's not something I would suggest reading to a child because I don't think they would be able to keep up for the most part. You would constantly have to explain the meaning of many words. A good book for high school age and up.Although the words portrayed in A Christmas Carol give you a sense of cheer and you can easily see the grump that Scrooge is, there is a 'hidden' message that you will find in the second half of this book. Christmas is not just about good cheer or being neighborly. It's about overcoming your personal 'demons' and being stronger than your issues. Choosing to be joyful as opposed to being sorry for yourself.I'm rambling. Excellent literature and I recommend it if you have not read it!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Like most people, I've seen version after version of Dickens' A CHRISTMAS CAROL.

Unfortunately, I did not read it until I was well into my adulthood. My review will focus on aspects of the story from that angle.The initial part of the story provides the reader with a portrait of Ebenezeer Scrooge that is a little overdone and a bit comical. I can only say that it came across as being a bit 'corny.'The best part of the story lies in its middle chapters, where Mr. Scrooge receives upon himself several visitors during the night. As a reader you feel drawn into the lives of the families that are visited and you find yourself caring for them rather quickly.The payoff ends up being somewhat weak. It seems rushed and concluded rather a little too hastily. A slightly lengthier expansion of the final pages would have increased enjoyment of the story immensely.Still, even with such criticisms, I realize that the story will appeal to people of all ages, and have given the book a 5 star rating. I encourage parents to let their children enjoy this classic as soon as they think it is age appropriate and not view the book with a little bit of a cynical eye, as I myself might have had."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I will admit that, until now, I have never read \\"A Christmas Carol\\", but instead - like most Americans - have watched countless film and cartoon versions, from the wonderfully classic 1951 film version with Alstaire Sim and the Mister Magoo cartoon version to the most recent film incarnation starring Jim Carrey. Having just purchased a Kindle, I decided to take advantage of the free copy offered in the classics section of the Kindle site so I could finally read the actual Dickens tale. I was certainly not disappointed.I won't bother with a rehash of the story - who doesn't know this tale? - but will only say that I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I recommend to everyone that they put it on their \\"to read\\" list (it's a rather short story, I was surprised to discover). As an actor and filmmaker, I was particularly interested in comparing the story to the many film and cartoon versions I referenced above, and this has given me a new appreciation for those versions that were truer to the original, capturing the \\"right mood\\" and maintaining a sense of anticipation, fear, wonder, melancholy, and - ultimately - pure joy.You don't have to relegate your reading of this tale to Christmas time, so I encourage anyone who hasn't read it to do so. For those who have read it, it's worth a return visit."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I read Dickens' A Christmas Carol over the holiday. It was free to download on Kindle. Sadly, I don't believe I've ever read it before. I remember Great Expectations from high school (also free on Kindle), but honestly don't ever remember reading A Christmas Carol. It's another one of those classics I blame my teachers for cheating me on back when I should have been reading it, but a small town high school curriculum spent too much time on Shakespeare instead.All of us know the story. It's Christmas tradition, right? If you tried, you could probably tell a decent version of it out loud to the children at your Christmas party and do a pretty good job at it. First published in 1843, it's been a part of our American lives for a long time. Like I said before, it's tradition. Most of us know it from the big screen. If not the 1951 black and white version (also available colorized), you definitely saw the 1984 version with George C. Scott. The Muppets did it. Even Bill Murray spoofed it in 1988, a good spoof which is a classic in itself from the 80s.Community theatre groups have also embraced it and made it tradition on the stage. I was almost in a musical version myself back in high school, but it got canceled for some reason. I was cast in dual roles, one that I don't remember, but I was also going to be the Ghost of Christmas Future and I remember the director obsessing over how I should point. When I lived in Memphis, I went to see the annual production of it at Theatre Memphis. My point is, and I do have one, is how many of us can honestly say we first learned the timeless tale from the book itself. I know I didn't.It's like a really good memory that we embellish year after year for whatever reason, until sooner or later we forget how it actually happened. We're so numb to it. We've received more pleasure telling it our way, so why rediscover how it actually began, how it actually went, or what the truth is.That's exactly why I wanted to read it. It's there. Scrooge. Marley. Tiny Tim. The ghosts. All there. As I read, my brain played it out just like seeing it on the big screen, even some of the dialogue (including \\"God bless us, everyone!\\") was right there on the page. So, what does this tell us? Throughout history, we haven't changed it much. We've at least stayed true to it, not counting the Bill Murray version of course. I tried - very hard - not to picture versions of the characters I knew from the movies.Honestly, it's not very good writing in most places. Dickens loves to list things in order to describe them, like opening the thesaurus searching for a better word and deciding to just use them all. Case in point, when the Ghost of Christmas Present arrives he is sitting on a throne made from food. Dickens names almost every food there is. I'm paraphrasing here but it was a throne of ham, sausage, turkey, chicken, grapes, apples, bananas, oranges, pies, custards, puddings, bread, muffins, cakes, Reeses Peanut Butter Cups, M&Ms;, Yoplait Yogurt, Froot Loops, Candy Bars.... and this isn't the only place he does it. The children were happy, glad, gleeful, joyful, cheerful... bleggh! Some of the lists take up half a page or more!It was kind of like reading Shakespeare for the first time, be it Romeo and Juliet or Hamlet or whatever you read in high school, and your getting it. You are comprehending it okay, enough to know what it's about. But your really having to dig through the muck to find the parts that make sense. But overall, in the end, it does make sense. You found yourself scheming through it or focusing your attention elsewhere during parts, at least until you got to something you could understand. I didn't scheme through any of Christmas Carol - I read every damn word of it - but believe me, there were parts where I found myself slowly drifting off and thinking about something else.In the end, I felt no different than when I did before I read it. A sense of accomplishment? Perhaps. Now I can at least say I've read it. I know the truth, although everything I knew before wasn't much different. I want to question what makes this a classic, but I already know the answer.Time.So...I don't have much more to say about it. God bless us everyone!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This is a fantastic edition of Charles Dickens' classic holiday story of Ebenezer Scrooge's transition from Miser to Man of the People. It is unabridged (original text that includes wonderful lines such as \\"solitary as an oyster\\") and bound well for a smaller paperback. An excellent edition for an unbeatable price! For a gift idea, tie these books with ribbon and gave them as gifts to coworkers, neighbors, and even as stocking stuffers; I did, and they were a terrific hit."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Yes, modern - and not so modern - media have bombarded us with version after version of this classic tale. Some have been good, some have been ridiculously horrible (e.g. Kelsey Grammer in a \\"musical version\\"....aaarrrrgghhh!!!). However, none of these forms have ever accurately conveyed the imagery so wonderfully as the original written text by Dickens. Though written some 150 years ago the mastery of the English language portrayed in the book can never be duplicated by video. Take for example Dicken's description of Scrooge as a \\"squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\\" Tremendous ! Or Scrooge's nephew Fred's description of the season as \\"a good time: a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time: the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely\\" The literary version also contains numerous snippets of marvelous text such as Dickens desciption of Scrooge waiting for the first spirit when he notes that Scrooge could \\" no more go to sleep than go to Heaven \\". Or when waiting for the second spirit that he was: \\"ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much\\". I know of no media version other than the written text which delivers these literary gems.In the book, Dickens notes that he is \\"standing in the spirit at your elbow\\". Do yourself a favor. Read the book ! Give Dickens a chance to spend some time in the spirit at your elbow and you thoroughly enjoy what he notes in the preface is a \\"Ghostly little book, to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.

I have lost count of how many times I've read it. And each time I read it, I fall in love with it all over again. I am not that familiar with Charles Dickens (something I need to work on!), but his prose is simply captivating. Each detail is described with simple clarity, from the horror of Marley returning from the grave to the humor of Scrooge's encounter with Bob Cratchit at the end of the story. Further, Dickens makes the characters as real people, and as the reader you can't help but get swept up in their lives and learn to love them, beginning with Scrooge's loving nephew Fred, and the innocent Tiny Tim, to the original \\"Grinch\\" himself, Mr. Scrooge. Emotions range from joy to fear to sadness and back again, and it all concludes with that heart-warming and unforgettable quote, \\"God bless us, everyone!\\""},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This is a very high quality kindle edition of a classic story.

I already loved his work, but even if you're not familiar with him, his reading of this classic is wonderful.I admit I had a hard time for a few moments, not picturing him in a French maid's costume, or a concierge uniform, but that's my problem, not yours.This is a fantastic reading; Curry inflects every character perfectly. Thoroughly enjoyed this, and plan to listen to it every Christmas. Love it!"},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"To borrow from Dickens and A Christmas Carol: \\"An intelligent book...a remarkable book...What a delightful book!\\"I got this book at the \\"Dickens on the Strand\\" festival in Galveston, TX, in December 2012. The book is all the more special because it was signed by Dickens' g-g-granddaughter and g-g-g-grandaughter, who were special guests that weekend.The illustrations are excellent and really bring the story - and, especially, the characters - to life.And the story! Oh, what a story! I think my favorite aspect is the descriptions of the characters and settings. As a morality tale, it is so interesting that there is very little sermonizing. The three ghosts do not jibber jabber...they let Scrooge come to his own realization by placing him in situations where he can see and contemplate his own actions. The most biting part is when his own cruel words are turned on him. But other characters, too, act without charity, and if we don;t see ourselves in Scrooge and his outlandish meanness, perhaps we can see ourselves in the minor characters and their snide remarks, and improve ourselves on that account. While Tiny Tim seems to be the iconic character of The book, I actually like several others more, including the nephew, Fred; Fezziwig and his family; and the folks who stole the very curtains and clothes from Scrooge on his deathbed - their behavior was atrocious but their characterization was superb!This book capped off a year when I read two other Dickens works - Bleak House and Great Expectations for the first time.

Millions around the globe have read this touching book, about brotherly love and charity, since it was first published. Countless people have seen Ebenezer Scrooge, the selfish and unkind man, transform in to a kind and generous person by the visits of four mysterious ghosts.The story begins in the afternoon of a frigid Christmas Eve, as a mean-spirited man named Ebenezer Scrooge sits in his office. Scrooge is a cold-hearted and selfish miser, who isn't in the spirit of Christmas. Every so often, he shouts, \\"Bah!\\" or \\"Humbug!\\" He doesn't even buy coal for the fireplace, so he and his clerk freeze away. No one likes him, and no one stands up to him. Dickens describes him thus: \\"No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge.\\" However, this is exactly what Scrooge wants - to be in his own world.Dickens starts out the story by stating that Scrooge's former partner, Jacob Marley, is dead. Then, he reverts back to what Scrooge is up to. As it is Christmas Eve, Scrooge isn't happy. He scares all the carolers away, and refuses to donate money to the poor. When the day is finally over, he goes back to his house, and tries to go to sleep. As he locks the door, he sees an apparition. There is Jacob Marley's ghost - looking right at him! Scrooge is shocked at first, and still is shocked when Marley's phantom tells him some surprising news. The ghost explains that there will be three other ghosts yet to come: the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Future. Then, he leaves.As promised, the ghosts of the past, present, and the future visit Scrooge. The ghost of the past shows Scrooge how he used to be. Scrooge discovers that his life was somewhat pleasant, but still lonely. The ghost of the present reveals to Scrooge his more recent attitude toward Christmas. It shows Scrooge the consequences of his actions, most of which are to Scrooge's dislike. The ghost also informs Scrooge how other people are celebrating. Dancing, playing blind man's buff, and caroling aren't part of Scrooge's world for certain. The ghost of the future shows the time when Scrooge is dead and no one cares for him; actually everyone is happy that he is gone. Meanwhile, all of these visions have Scrooge sobbing in tears and he is finally ready to make changes in his life. After the final ghost leaves, Scrooge runs about his little town donating money, greeting people, and visiting his nephew and clerk's family. It turns out to be a very happy Christmas after all.I liked A Christmas Carol very much. Charles Dickens's style is very descriptive. I especially liked the vivid verbs and adjectives Dickens used when he described Scrooge as a \\"squeezing, wrenching, gasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner!\\" As for Scrooge, I liked him a lot. The book was funny when he said something completely nonsensical like \\"Bah!\\" or \\"Humbug!\\" On a scale of one through ten, I would give A Christmas Carol a ten. It was enjoyable and interesting to read, especially over winter break, as it heartens the spirit of Christmas itself."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This is the book to read if you ever need to get in the Christmas spirit. Everybody goes through the holidays and becomes a &quot;scrooge&quot; at least once during the season. Though we aren't as bad as Ebenezer, we still need the realization of the Christmas spirit to set us right again. Reading the classic story of Ebenezer's adventures with the three Christmas spirits will bring warmth and happiness back into our hearts. It will be easier to give and be gracious, we will be grateful for everything we have, and we will remember what Christmas is all about. Thanks to Dickens for writing a masterpiece especially for this time of year."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This is a truly remarkable story.

Dickens addresses the reader directly, and there is more humor than most adaptations show.This edition has an interesting account of the first time Dickens read the story to a general audience - the beginning of Dickens' career in performing his work which proved almost as lucrative as the mere writing of it."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I was impressed with the quality of the book for the money.

To write a compelling story in 300 pages is difficult, but certainly possible; to weave a complex tale in under 100 requires much greater skill. Dickens does just that, drawing you in with a sparseness of prose that is wonderful. Over-explanation has been excised, and we the reader benefit.Having seen at least five variations on this story, I was surprised at just how simple the source material was. Clean, clear, subtle, and leaving far more to imagination than description, this was a wonderful Christmas read. What else is there to say? It's Dickens in under 100 pages; this is not to be missed."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"This story has become an icon for Christmas. The story is well known, but I realized sitting in the new movie with Jim Carrie, I had never read the story itself. How could I judge a movie or play without knowing the written original? There is no way a true critique of a movie or play could be done without having a passing knowledge of the original, especially, since the orginal was presented as a written story.The new movie does follow the written word closely. The plays do not, but they try and do a good job of getting the jist of the story.As for the story, I find it a bit to goody, goody. Scrooge would not turn his life around so thoroughly from such a night of dreams. He is who he is and has been for a very long time. 'Old habits die hard' is not just an old saying. Scrooge has been thinking his frugal thoughts for most of his life and I just do not think he would be able to change so radically so fast. Another problem is Tiny Tim. He may be lovable, but what would move Scrooge to feel so sorry for him? He sees him for only a moment, would it be enough in reality?These questions are irrelevant, but I had them, so I thought I would voice them."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"A Christmas Carol, in my opinion, is one of the most perfect stories of all time.

It provides an excellent refresher on the life and times of Charles Dickens, without hitting the reader over the head with an outrageous data-dump of factoids that contribute nothing to your enjoyment of the author and his story.This book would be a well-appreciated gift for any fan of Dickens. Even if you own another version of A Christmas Carol, this affordable and portable history belongs in your collection."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I listen to this rendition of A Christmas Carol faithfully every year while I'm wrapping gifts, baking, or decorating.

At that point, I know I never really appreciated the beauty of his work and words. I recently listened to christianaudio's version of A Christmas Carol, which is one of their best audiobooks yet. Simon Vance's narration was excellent, with an engaging dramatization.At a recent Bible study, someone brought up how A Christmas Carol was particularly a message about caring for our neighbors. While most of us have heard the story many times, hearing Dickens' original words really sent the message about the power and importance of loving our neighbor. While God was never explicitly mentioned, the Gospel is written all over this classic.While it is a short book that can be easily found for free, christian audio is also offering it for free for this month!Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher.

I've seen multiple movie versions, but I haven't actually read the book until this year. Reading it opened my eyes to a few things that I haven't noticed before and/or don't remember from the movies.While I don't think any spirits will come and visit me in the middle of the night, Dickens' spirits spoke to me in a sense in that it made me stop and think about my attitude this time of year, and what I'm doing to help others. I knew what to expect as the story unfolded, but it was still a joy to follow Scrooge on his familiar path and to see his literal overnight change!Merry Christmas, and as Tiny Tim would say, \\"God bless us, every one!\\""},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"Although it may be cliche to say, the book is so much better than the movie. And the edition of the book that I borrowed from Austin Public Library was terrific. It's called The Whole Story edition and gives illustrations from the original volume with an annotated history of London at the time that Dickens was writing the story. This hardcover also explains the settings and characters that were similar to Dickens' own life.I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It's refreshing in this day and age to see a moralistic tale written without reference to religious symbolism. To me, the message under the story is so much more universally delivered this way because people with all different belief systems still get the transformation that Scrooge undergoes.I also love the concept embedded in the story about how rapidly a person can change. Unlike in Dickens' time, today we have the science to prove that if you want to change your life, all you have to do is change your mind. That's what Scrooge did and he underwent an instant and dramatic transition to a happier and more fulfilling life.If you're feeling humbug about the holidays, I suggest you read \\"A Christmas Carol\\"."},{"Title":"A Christmas carol: In prose","review":"I absolutely loved this audiobook. Charles Dickens was such a brilliant writer and this is surely one of his most loved stories. Considering its an old story that has been told many times before, it still comes across as very relevant in today's economic situation.Simon Vance's narration is perfect and adds so much to the story. I particularly liked the way he interprets Scrooge all the way through his transformation, from the grumpy old miser to a jolly old man at the end. He did very well with the different characters voices and he held my attention throughout. I definitely was transported back to Victorian London whilst listening.I would recommend this audio to everyone, but especially to those who feel jaded by the commercialisation of Christmas.

Everyone knows this Christmas story; Dickens' narrative never grows old and his writing is beautiful by itself.

When Christmas time comes, which is Scrooge does not like at all, he gets visited by ghosts. These ghosts are special ghosts who come to him at night and try to change his ways. These ghosts are the ghosts of Christmas past, preasant, and future. When Mr. Scrooge sees what he lived, lives, and is about to live, he realizes something about himself and his life that he doesn't like. He realizes that even he doesn't really like himself.

Wells. He will entice you with stories that pique the imagination, that range from the ancient past into the far future.Over sixty short stories adorn this classic work, including:The Empire of the Ants - killer ants from South America?The Land Ironclad - land ships with guns can change trench warfare? (written in December 1903)The Door In The Wall - a man recounts his boyhood memories of a door leading to a magical garden...The Tempatation of Harringay - an artist is tempted by the devil himselfThe Country of the Blind - is the one eyed man King in the land of the blind?The Flowering of a Strange Orchid - Vampire flowers?The New Accelerator - a man creates a mixture that allows him to move at ten times normal speed (concept adapted for a &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; episode)Get the book, you won't be sorry.(review based on hardback edition)"},{"Title":"The Complete Short Stories of H.G. Wells","review":"First off, this collection does not contain The Time Machine, I'm not sure what collection the other reviewer was referring to. However, this collection does contain some of the best stories you will ever read.I discovered H.G. Wells relatively late in life (within this past year, at the age of 33) when I stumbled on a discount copy of \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau.\\" Like most people, I'd read \\"War of the Worlds\\" in high school and thought it pretty good. However, I believe to truly appreciate Wells one must be older. Old enough to have experienced some sort of life and to appreciate fine, clean writing.After reading \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" I was surprised at how current the story felt and how horrific some of the details were (it definitely didn't read or feel like a book written over 100 years ago). As a result, each time I stopped at a used book store I'd peruse the shelves looking for anything Wells. I stumbled on a collection of five of his short stories called \\"The Empire of the Ants.\\" What? Wells wrote short stories? No way! I bought the book and read it over my vacation. I was amazed. Wells is known for writing in detail, but I'd say his writing is even more detailed in his short stories (possibly because in a short story you don't have to worry about bogging the reader down in too much detail- causing them to lose the thread of the story).What Wells does, and what he's famous for, is writing in such detail that a scenario becomes supremely believable, then, he adds a touch of the fantastic to really knock the reader's socks off. Since he's already created this ultra-realistic world, the fantastic becomes believable and the reader is left thinking, \\"that could really happen, couldn't it?\\"After reading that collection of shorts, I looked for something more comprehensive and found \\"The Complete Short Stories of H.G. Wells\\" edited by John Hammond. I was amazed again! The breadth and scope of Wells' stories is amazing: from a rogue plant with a taste for human blood, to a voodoo shaman out for revenge, to an upstart student with a conscious, Wells' imagination knows no bounds.I'm about half way through the book and my favorite stories thus far are \\"The Flowering of the Strange Orchid,\\" \\"Pollock and the Porroh Man\\" and \\"In the Modern Vein: An Unsympathetic Love Story\\" (the stories I decribed above) also \\"The Lord of the Dynamos,\\" \\"The Sea Raiders\\" and \\"A Story of the Stone Age.\\" I must also add that I read \\"The Country of the Blind\\" as part of the previous book containing Wells' stories and it too is amazing. Also, I admit that sometimes Wells delves into too much detail, which can frustrate the reader and slow the story down. However, of the 30-40 stories I've read thus far, it has only happened a handful of times.I only wish that this collection contained a short critique before each story. Mr. Hammond is a renowned Wells scholar and has even written a book analyzing Wells' short stories (a book I can't locate, by the way), that book I believe is essential to really understanding these stories (namely due to Wells' tendency to critique society in his writing). Unfortunately, no real analysis is available in this compilation, thus, the reader is left to his own interpretation. For the most part, the stories are pretty self-explanatory, but it would be nice to understand some of the other meanings.In conclusion, I give this collection 5 stars and I highly recommend it for anyone with a taste for great storytelling. Wells' writing is fantastic, touching, humorous, detailed and very sensitive- I think you'll be surprised at how he'll win you over. H.G. Wells is a master writer, and he's gained me as a fan for life! :)"},{"Title":"The Complete Short Stories of H.G. Wells","review":"The St. Martin's press 22nd edition wasn't returned by Amazon, so I had to review this one. But this is more comprehensive than the collection I've read if my recognition of it is on target, so you'll get more for your buck in this one. In relating my experience in reading these stories, let me say right off that I read straight through the book, and this in my view enhanced my enjoyment because it eliminated the hassle of guessing at what I would enjoy. I'm a science fiction and fantasy reader primarily, and so I was pleased to see that over 85 percent of the stories present in the St. Martin's edition had some tie to these genres. But I was also pleased to discover that all of the tales I read, whether science fiction, fantasy, religious allegory, suspense, social stories such as slice of life or love stories, was a great read. Tales like A Catastrophe and The Jilting of Jane possessed aspects of irony and humor that made them fun as social tales, while I especially enjoyed The Plattner Story, In the Abyss, The Country of the Blind and The Empire of the Ants as science fiction tales. Some of the better adventure tales for me were My First Aeroplane and Little Mother Up the Morderberg, although the latter added a healthy dose of humor. And there is one story (can't think of the name-- sorry) that is an early take on the REAR WINDOW plot idea made famous by Hitchcock on film. That one was a suspense tale-- you'll recognize it when you see the guy laid up with broken legs who watches the river out the window. I hope you enjoy these fun and erudite stories.

Because of her training in the East and her own powers, she is all that stands in the way of their evil plans. With the help of astandard issue dashing viral hero, the state department, and a female friend from her temple days they face danger and she falls in love with the hero.Chambers before 1900 was a force to be reckened with in weird literature. By the time of this book his sugery romance style had corroded his formibable dark prose but there is still power here. This is his standard romance with all kinds of weird things thrown in. Every time you turn around some Mongol is stealing the bedsheets for his death shroud and going off to die.This is not The King in Yellow but it is still a fun book and well worth the time if for no other reason then Robert W. Chambers wrote it. H. P. Lovecraft loved this book, maybe because he saw Chambers returning to his roots. Great ideas, good prose, written too fast most likely for a magazine sale. Could have used with a re-write.Larry Locfor more information on Robert W. Chambers see www.ioc.net/~larryloc/yking001.html"},{"Title":"The Slayer of Souls","review":"Robert Chambers' second book, The King in Yellow (1895) is one of the greatest pieces of weird and horror fiction ever printed. His other books - over sixty of them - are now largely condemned as rubbish.A best-selling author at the time, Chambers churned out historical romances (also occult romances, occasionally spy romances and occasionally colonial romances) to an eager audience. As a result, Chambers has largely been consigned to the derision of history - damned by his peers as an author that could have done better (as evidenced - once), but simply chose not to.The Slayer of Souls (1920) only adds to the disappointment that Chambers has fostered in his critics. One of his 'romances', except with an occult twist, The Slayer of Souls has all the right pieces to make things interesting - an escaped temple priestess, a complicated esoteric mythos that harkens back to evil, extra-terrestrial elder gods and a sinister, world-spanning psychic cospiracy.Alas, evil, extra-terrestrial elder gods do not a proper Lovecraftian short story make. (Please take note of that, all contributors to Chaosium-published short story collections). The Slayer of Souls is simply wacky hijinks, with fluttering lashes, manly 'secret agents' and conniving non-Aryan villains with ludicrous accents. Chambers does manage to fulfill one of Lovecraft's literary fantasies, in that he blatantly ties in capital-E-evil with all of the racist, anti-liberal issues of the day.Fortunately, the last line of defense is a group of volunteer 'Secret Servicemen' and a single woman, Tressa Norne, escaped sorceress from the Yezidee temple. The Secret Service are a willing - and surprisingly inept - lot of gentlemen scholars. Largely their contribution to the battle against Evil is to serve as social chaperones to Ms. Norne, who single-handedly takes out the greater part of the Yezidee brotherhood. Tressa's powers consist of astral projection, snake-summoning and an uncanny ability to make romantic matches between her temple sisterhood and the brawny young men of the Secret Service. By the end of the book, the Yezidee threat seems little more than a Fraternity theme party - an excuse for the Secret Service to be introduced to lithe young temple priestesses.Chambers made his literary mark with The King in Yellow. Any commercial success he gained afterwards (with, say, every other book he wrote) was undoubtedly well-deserved, and it is hard to begrudge him any success. That said, The Slayer of Souls is pure, ludicrous drivel. Come for the Cthulhu, stay for the anti-Communist rants."},{"Title":"The Slayer of Souls","review":"Twenty five years separates this tale from Chamber's classic The King in Yellow. Unfortunately the Slayer of Souls supports the position that it was all downhill for Chambers, and I agree with the other reviewer that this was possibly rushed out for publication in a magazine and never intended as a novel.Written nearly a hundred years ago, Slayer of Souls would be unreadable to many as it creaks along like the worst pulp romance of the period. It's marred by sexism and racism plus a copious amount of Chambers personal politics with the yellow menace and Bolsheviks lurking under every bed. The pseudo-foreign rituals and exotic names that seemed so masterful in King in Yellow fall flat, and the saccharine relationship between Secret Service agent Cleves and helpless Tressa is equally unsatisfying.My recommendation - go back and read the King in Yellow again, and consign the Slayer of Souls to the dustbin of history. Even the most resolute fan of Chambers and early American gothic horror will find this novel hard to enjoy."},{"Title":"Lessons in Taxidermy : A Compendium of Safety and Danger (Punk Planet Books)","review":"I am stunned by this book and I suggest that everyone should read it. It's a tough and frightening book, but somehow quite uplifting. I feel disoriented and almost drunk after reading it. I somehow feel more vunurable to the possibilities that bad things like this could happen to me too, but also calm. She goes very low and deep into hell, but as the book goes along, she then seems to transcend it all and enjoy her strange life. At the end of the book I almost wanted to be her, and to have her perspective on life. This is a somewhat strange outcome of the book when you consider all the savage events that happen it it. I couldn't put it down. I read it in one long sitting while all of the things I was supposed to do yesterday went undone.On the back of the book it says that it's \\"apocryphal, troubling, cathartic, and important\\". I agree with this 100%"},{"Title":"Lessons in Taxidermy : A Compendium of Safety and Danger (Punk Planet Books)","review":"While some of the great work in Bee's life, such as her work as an activist & mentor, is not given the credit or attention it perhaps ought to, what the reader receives is the sense of soul about the author, the woman.In a world of biographies which read like resumes or entries in a name-dropping contest, Bee's book has substance.Best of all, this is not some cheesy Little Engine That Could story; Her life hasn't been simple, and neither is her writing.The book is charming in an uncanny way, with lush words for empty moments, providing real depth for pits of despair. There are eccentric elements which endear... then again, that only makes the echos of the pits stronger...There are moments so bereft of detail as to leave you as lingering as she... Other moments are so full of details as to be sharp & pointy things.Certainly the freakish haunts. But her writing draws readers close, with taunt yet tender moments so intimate, it dares you to recoil at the horrific events.Her words, as well as her life, enchant.(Condensed Review)"},{"Title":"Lessons in Taxidermy : A Compendium of Safety and Danger (Punk Planet Books)","review":"I had been wanting to read this book for a while, and when I finally received it, I read it in 2 days. Bee has had a lifelime of numerous debilitating illnesses and her story of one's strength and courage through it all moved me to tears. On so many occasions, Bee was ready to just lie down and let the diseases consume her but through some hidden strength, she has been able to survive. Several times I had to put the book down to wipe my eyes. The story is told in a frank and honest manner, a story that her mother encouraged her to write to tell a story of survival.As if Bee's illnesses weren't enough of a cross to bear, she and several of her friends are involved in a horrific car accident that when told, left me sobbing.What I appreciated the most about Bee's story is that she never seemed to be looking for sympathy or pity. She told it like it happened and the story is all the more powerful because of her candor,I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lessons in Taxidermy : A Compendium of Safety and Danger (Punk Planet Books)","review":"Will make you sad and hate yourself for making light the small things, good ending.A wicked read, also check out the other Punk Planet books...

The ailments come early (rotted teeth from a misguided diet of apple juice in lieu of mother's milk) and often (degenerative cysts growing in her jaw at nine-years-old; cancer by 12). These are only highlights of a terrible litany.I was used to being alone within illness. The world recedes and other people are just phantoms, whether they are in the room or halfway across the world.Deserving more than anyone of having herself a never-ending pity party, Lavender doesn't. Her matter-of-fact prose is as detached and spare as the persona her years of illness have sculpted, which makes the book, at times, seemingly lacking in emotional depth. However, this mirrors the tunnel vision that allowed her to cope. Amazingly, nowhere does Lavender speak - at any length at least - about becoming depressed. At an age when most kids were hanging upside down on monkey bars, her life was hanging by a thread, reduced to the simple antipodes of survival, life or death.Through it all, Lavender manages to finish college, have a kid, get a job and a steady male companion (marriage must not be her bag). And, refreshingly, she doesn't treat these accomplishments as any huge, big deal. Her nonchalance resides in her longtime wish to just \`be a normal girl, with regular skin and ordinary clothes, commonplace hobbies and predictable friends.' Even if she isn't.My primary identity is found in my body, in the scars, in the injuries and injustice and disease and decay. My genetic code conveys the simple truth that I'm a freak: no other information about me is relevant....The fact that I am alive is a daily revelation, but it is necessary to do more than just survive.Despite the physical Grand Guignol that life has lavished upon her, Bee Lavender's story is a testament to guts, endurance and an indomitable will to not succumb to the maladies that are laying siege to her body. You think nobody knows the trouble you've seen? Read this, and stop whining."},{"Title":"Lessons in Taxidermy : A Compendium of Safety and Danger (Punk Planet Books)","review":"Indelible: if I could choose one word to describe Bee Lavender's autobiography of a life lived within a treacherous body, it would be that. Yes, this intense narrative is deftly paced with almost just barely enough time for a reader to catch her breath before the next corporal one-two punch knocks the remaining wind right out of her, but that's not what makes reading this book an experience I am sure I will never forget. Rather it is the sensibility of its author; she neither judges nor instructs, seeks neither pity nor admiration. To have a body is to be betrayed by it; this is true for all of us, always. For Bee Lavender, alas, more so. That is why her forthright reportage from the island of infirmity is a gift to readers."},{"Title":"Lessons in Taxidermy : A Compendium of Safety and Danger (Punk Planet Books)","review":"The story is engrossing. But something doesn't feel quite authentic. If the author is writing in this detached style because she's endured so much (certainly a possibility), I apologize. But characters other than Lavender don't come alive, and their motivations and personalities are muted and obscured. All Lavender's teachers accuse her of malingering. (Really? All?) Medical staff are uniformly insensitive and incompetent. (Not even one or two exceptions?) The descriptions of some of the medical procedures Lavender is forced to endure are truly horrific, and her ability to prevail is impressive. But I wish I had a better sense of the other players in this drama."},{"Title":"Lessons in Taxidermy : A Compendium of Safety and Danger (Punk Planet Books)","review":"A rollicking romp through the sidesplitting shenanigans of this goofy gal with a quenchless thirst for thrills!

I'm not entirely sure if this is a true story or not, but the overly-dramatic writing made me feel like it was an attempt to minimize the struggle of those who truly have cancer. The events didn't seem to tie into the emotions in the story, unless of course the events, or the emotions, were over-exaggerated in a way that reminded me of an old college roommate I suffered through that had been diagnosed with histrionic disorder (where there drama surrounded even the smallest of things).As far as a book to help those struggling through cancer, I would recommend highly No Place Like Home by Girard, which is very beautifully written and will give the reader more of a feeling of relating to the author."},{"Title":"Delaney's Crossing","review":"I really enjoyed reading Delaney's Crossing.

Only steps away from realizing his dream of buying back his families land in California, this has really put a kink in his plans. Waking up in the Merchants Hotel with the mother of all hangovers, he has no recollection of the night before in the saloon and worst of all he's missing his money belt. Cooper knows that one of those 22 women has his gold but he can't prove it so for now he's stuck signing Aggie's contract as their guide.Prim and proper spinster Agatha Pennington had little choice in her methods of securing an experienced pilot out of Independence Missouri. Their previous chaperon Hiram had gotten them this far before succumbing to some sort of 1841 ailment, even managing to teach them how to use a gun and handle their wagons and mules. Aggie knows the trail is going to be harsh, hostile and unforgiving but she's also unwavering in her determination. She will get her rag tag assembly of women into Oregon territory where they have secured a plot of land and promise of a better life.This was a pretty good historical romance once I replaced the mulleted dude from the cover with the guy from Hell On Wheels as my hero. Anyways, it kept me entertained with the trials and tribulations of life as a settler on the passage west. All the expected elements are here: a plucky virgin heroine, a hero with a dark tortured past, distrust and animosity then lust and love makin while they battle the weather, raging rivers, Indians, snowstorms, getting stuck in a mineshaft and a bad guy named Duke who without any true motivation shows up randomly and plots how to stop the wagon train while ordering his brother around and brandishing a big knife.I enjoyed several of the secondary characters, in particular the double crossing Magpie and Callie an orphaned tomboy who cuts off her hair, dons boys clothing and follows Cooper around like a lost puppy. The ending went on way to long however, morphing into another story altogether before abruptly finishing with several loose ends still to tie up. All in all this was exactly what I was expecting from a 1997 second-hand bookstore find.

This update only gives a rough idea of Murray's intent, and often changes the meaning to a Gnostic drive for power. To hear what Murray really intended, by all means find an old used copy.

A breathtaking volume that's sure to become a collector's item in its own right."},{"Title":"Sailors' Valentines","review":"John Fondas is the undisputed world's expert on Sailor's Valentines. As a collector for many years, his collection is acknolwleged as the best of its kind. What is more, his passion for shells and island living has taken John to the highest level as a designer and maker of shell jewellery and objects. Anyone who has not visited John in his shop in Bay Street (Nassau Bahamas), suitabley named GOLD, will have missed the essence of Island Living and the opportunity to meet a rare and cultured gentleman. It just doesn't get any better! This is a fabulous book which rightly takes its place on the shelf as a beautiful gift, a resource book and finally, a trubute to its author and the beauty of the natural world it so elegantly describes. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sailors' Valentines","review":"John Fondas seduces the reader with brilliant photographs of a long forgotten Victorian art form know today as Sailors' Valentines. A brief history of America's whaling heritage takes us back in time and rightfully credits Barbadians with designing these titillating mementos. With prices for antique sailors' valentines soaring, this may be the closest you'll ever get to owing the real thing. This octagonal book clearly shows us why a picture is worth at least 1,000 words and after poring over 95 pages, I clearly wanted more."},{"Title":"Sailors' Valentines","review":"This is SUCH a cool book and one that it about a very rare and beautiful subject...sailors' valentines. Sailors' Valentines are a rare and unique artform from the mid-1800s. Perhaps made by sailors as tokens of love for wives, mothers and girlfriends and with ample evidence to support this theory, the valentines also appear to have been made for sale in Barbados, a port of call for both American and English ships. They are between 8 and 15 inches across. They are octagonal shaped wooden boxes usually made of Spanish cedar, but sometimes of mahogany. They are hinged at the side to open as a book would open. Inside, protected by glass, are incredibly detailed and colorful mosaics made of sea-shells, sometimes with sentiments spelled out, the names of the sailor artists, even in one case an erotic photograph framed by an elaborate mosaic of shells. They are, of course, highly collectable and have fetched prices as high as $35,000 a piece. Antique experts know about them but most of the rest of us have never heard of them and that is a pity.This incredible book is such a marvel in itself, well crafted, detailed, scholarly and very beautiful. It comes in its own case which is a deep blue fabric covered octagon-shaped hinged box. The book inside is also octagon-shaped and contains the history of these remarkable treasures as well as dozens of actual size photographs in full color of the valentines themselves. There is a chart that identifies the various types of sea-shells that were used to create the valentines. The valentines are displayed on facing pages so it is as though you have actually opened one of the hinged boxes and are looking at an actual valentine as it would appear were you holding it in your own hands. I think this book will be treasured by art lovers, crafty people, romantic people, as well as by antique collectors and enthusiasts. It would make a really stunning Valentine's Day gift. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Sailors' Valentines","review":"Wash and dry your hands thoroughly before opening John Fondas'spresentation book entitled &quot;Sailors' Valentines&quot;.

The arguments are not finely made, as they are in, say, *Taking Rights Seriously*, or in *Life's Dominion*. Many of the illustrative parables he uses, he's used before. That being said, *Freedom's Law* is a good collection highlighting the contours of Dworkin's fundamental objections to legal positivism. I think it is possible to follow Dworkin's non-interpretivist method without arriving at the same(moral)conclusions. But if you aren't already familiar with Dworkin's intellectual base of operations, a better place to start would be *Taking Rights Seriously* (easy to find) or, even better, his early and very important essay, &quot;Is Law a System of Rules?&quot; reprinted in *The Philosophy of Law* ed. by Dworkin (harder to find). To his credit, in this latter collection, he gives ample space to views contrary to his own, such as Hart's positivism, and Finnis' moral arguments against abortion."},{"Title":"Freedom's Law: The Moral Reading of the American Constitution","review":"One of the country's leading legal philosophers collects a series of essays (most originally appearing in the New York Review of Books) which examine the ... basis for the United States Constitution, and attack the \\"original intent\\" interpretation, most famously spouted by Bork.The book's strength is Dworkin's accessible writing style (which may stem from the popular press origins of most of these essays) and his tight analysis of several cutting edge issues--abortion, affirmative action, free speech, as well as some historically important battles--the Bork and Thomas nominations.His bottom line is (although he does not say this explicitly) that the recent Supreme Court, abbeted by a series of Republican presidents, has begun a revolution in legal thinking which rejects the 200 year old liberal tradition of judicial interpretation, and in the process has substituted results based, conservative politics for any semblance of judicial reasoning.The weakness of the book is that many examples and arguments are repeated between essays, covering the same ground in virtually the same words from different times.A much easier read than \\"Taking Rights Seriously\\", although the latter clearly is a more complete exposition of Dworkin's philosophy.For a counter argument, see any of Judge Posner's recent work, which explicitly takes on Dworkin's philosophy."},{"Title":"Freedom's Law: The Moral Reading of the American Constitution","review":"Ronald Dworkin is perhaps today's Bentham.

This book unfolds the story of Saddam in a simple, frank way, without endless pages of commentary. It tells about Jewish Israel and their reign of terror on the native Palestinians, their plans to expand until they seize all lands in the middle-east, building their empire on the blood of the Islamic Arabic peoples.The author presents the facts which themselves disprove the many manufactured atrocity stories being circulated about President Hussein. The author reveals the many constructive and positive programs he employed to build Iraq into a prosperous industrialized nation. His emancipation of women, public works and internal improvements as part of his populist politics are discussed in a brief way that gets right to the point.Throughout the book, the author gets to the point without wasting the reader's time on long-winded boring commentary. The author reveals clearly that Saddam intended to withdraw from Kuwait after the regime change, rendering completely unnecessary Bush's Gulf War against Iraq. The author further reveals that after Saddam ordered a withdrawal, the U.S. pursued slaughtering unarmed retreating Iraqi troops. The author reveals how the British and the U.S. violated their agreements and promises with the Arabic nations for decades, actions which largely amounted to deliberate provocation.If you want a balanced view of Saddam, this books offers such a balance by refuting the lies and propaganda which typify dozens of other books written about Saddam Hussein."},{"Title":"Saddam Hussein (Chelsea House Library of Biography)","review":"The title of this review says it all.

When I first picked up this book from one of the economics professors at my school, I was curious to read it because Gregory Mankiw was the Chief of the Council of Economic Adivsors. So I naturally thought, well this must be a brilliant man to have achieved a position so high. Well, now for the book. While the book is laid out in a fairly simple way and it is really easy to understand, sometimes too easy for an intermediate text, I began to notice Mankiw's economic philosophy slipping into the text. If anyone doesn't know, Mankiw is a New Keynesian. Well I thought that Keynesian economics was dead after the Reagan/Bush administrations failed with certain aspects of the economy. Please note, I said certain, such as the supposed tax cuts in the 80's that were offset by Social Security Tax hikes, and the out of control budget deficits. But I digress. Now, back to Mankiw. His text is filled with the ideas that he advised 43 on, and in fact 43 carried out.But I don't want to hate on Mankiw. I think that the book could have been more properly balanced with other ideas. Mankiw could have really out done himself if he would have supplied a book that had his approach, somewhat governmental, and another approach that lets market forces take over the economy and promotes less government intervention. But that is just wishful thinking. All in all, the book does have its highlites, such as: easy to read, easy to understand, well laid out, and the fact that hopefully Mankiw will be busy and come out with a second edition to make this one really cheap. So therefore, despite its inherent downfall due to Mankiw's economic philosophy, I give four stars, and would recommend it to anyone who might be interested in macroeconomics or wants to expand their library."},{"Title":"Macroeconomics","review":"i am a second year economics student from New Zealand.

However, cover looks new. Cannot remember promptness of delivery."},{"Title":"Macroeconomics","review":"This is a clearly written and nicely organized upper-division macroeconomics textbook. Mankiw uses plain English and simple math to model the macroeconomy in the short-run (the IS/LM model), the long-run (the AS/AD model), and the very long run (the Solow growth model). He also devotes a lot of space to the Mundell-Fleming model of international trade and finance. One of the best features is the frequent use of short case studies that apply economic theory to \\"real world\\" problems such as the Great Depression or the Japanese slump of the 1990s. Mankiw's views are mainstream -- he doesn't even hint at the existence of alternatives such as Austrian economics or neo-Marxism -- but he is non-dogmatic about policy and quite candid about the limits of what economists really know about the economy. His book is a small masterpiece of clear economic writing for undergraduates.So why did I give it only four stars? I was disappointed by the relative neglect -- in spite of the many \\"case studies\\" -- of the micro-economic, historical, and institutional realities that underlay the graphs and algebra of conventional macroeconomic analysis. Let me give two examples of what I mean:-- According to Ben Bernanke, Asian countries responded to the financial turbulence of the 1990s by amassing huge foreign exchange reserves to defend their currencies against future attacks. These savings have for the most part been invested in the U.S., where they have financed trade deficits and fueled asset bubbles in the equities and housing markets. In other words, capital has flowed from relatively capital-poor countries to a capital-rich country, where it has paid for consumption binges.-- According to Robert Pollin, two decades of union-bashing, downsizing and free trade have led to widespread job insecurity in the U.S. With workers too intimidated and too worried about jobs to press for wage increases, the economy was able to grow in the 1990s without triggering a round of inflation, and the benefits of this growth were skewed towards upper-income groups. In other words, extra-market power relationships in the workplace directly affected macroeconomic performance and income distribution.I don't doubt that these developments can be captured and analyzed in the IS/LM or AS/AD framework. I'm not so sure, however, that many people steeped in this mode of analysis would have expected these developments ex ante. That would have required a knowledge of history, policy responses, and specific markets that is difficult to capture in abstract models. For my taste, any approach to economics that focuses on algebraic relationships between economic aggregates to the semi-exclusion of history and institutions is just too \\"otherworldly\\" to be satisfying. But maybe that's a problem with the way my mind works, not with macroeconomics. It certainly doesn't mean that Mankiw's book is anything less than excellent. Any student interested in learning basic macroeconomic analysis should read it."},{"Title":"Macroeconomics","review":"A clear and altogether pleasant presentation; excellent layout and typography. A quick check indicated it was perhaps a bit less thorough than Olivier Blanchard (Mankiw doesn't mention the problems with non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system; Blanchard does), but one has to draw the line somewhere, and there is something to be said for allowing the instructor a bit more flexibility to introduce examples. Quite interesting--I hesitate to label a textbook exciting, but it would be an undersatement to say that Mankiw's text is neither soporific nor unduly convoluted; it inspires further inquiry. If you are required to use another text in a course, so be it; if reading for your own education, Mankiw is excellent. One might be sorely tempted to purchase it as a supplement to other less clear texts."},{"Title":"Macroeconomics","review":"Well-written book: tries hard to restate conclusions and show how changes in policies and variables affect aggregate functions, etc. Sometimes confusing: doesn't always state whether a trend holds in the short run or long run.Since I'm more used to micro, I found the vagueness of all the curves a bit maddening, as well as the lack of definitions and real-world indications of variable values. More importantly, there is basically no math here: I don't see how this book could possibly suffice for a grad student in econ (which I am not).Interesting book on tough subject."},{"Title":"Macroeconomics","review":"This book is very well written. I like the clear dichotomy between those topics which are classical and those which Keynesian. Yes, it is true that there is not alot of math in this text, but that is fine for the following reason. In grad school, what is initially more important is a clear understanding of all that you should have learned as an undergrad. You will learn the math you need as well as how to apply it. Secondly, this book, if you pay attention, will really help you master the simple models and learn how to manipulate them in order to suit your purpose. In one section, Mankiw will define is endo and exo variable because of a question he wants to answer, but switch those same variables around in order to answer a very different set of questions. I really liked that approach because alot of published work is derivative in nature: take an existing model and modify it in a new way, after which show the contribution.In summary, the value of this book is that you will be able to get a clear idea about all of the major topics in contempory maco. Having an easy reference once you get to grad school is nice."},{"Title":"Macroeconomics","review":"This book is very well written in terms of clarity, succintness, content, and readability. The various examples and real-world cases offer great (and immediate) opportunities to apply the theoretical material of pages past. The book utilizes proper notation and vocabulary while maintaining a readable text devoid of verbose or academically pretentious wording. In terms of shortfalls, the technical readers will be driven nuts by the lack of certain important events, concepts, and the feel of a specialized-for-economists book."},{"Title":"Macroeconomics","review":"Mankiw's intermediate text is less rigorous than his introductory text.

Having worked in Russia and other former Soviet Republics, I was walking back in time as I read the book. Brzezinki's accurate portrayal of the life an expat (from the initial shock upon arrival, to the slow immersion to local custom, all the way to going native) and the business customs and irregularities (finding business partners, traveling on local transport, needless and antiquated bureaucracy, the mafia and all of the ironies in between). I laughed at loud at times and other times was reminded how scary a place to live it was. I think the comparisons to Liar's Poker are apt. The story is griping, funny, and for many people I know, all too close to reality. Billions of dollars at play in an unregulated wild west arena. He has the oil fields, oil men, bankers, Chechens, Tartars, Radisson, Nightflight, dinner parties, expat haunts, trips to the provinces,....all of it down pat and eerily reminiscent of what I know to be true. Casino Moscow culminates with an interesting and credible (hailing from the WSJ) perspective on the final spurts of Russian economic &quot;growth.&quot;"},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"I read this book cover-to-cover this past weekend and found that it captures the spirit and feelings I experienced while working and living in Russia myself in 1994-1996 as a highly paid and pampered business consultant. To this day, I still cannot accurately explain the living and working conditions as an expat in Russia/East Europe during those crazy years. I generally resort to pulling out the more than 300 hours of videotape and some 4000 pictures I took while there in order to remind myself what I went through. I do recall both cursing and thanking my circumstances on a daily basis -- cursing the long winter days, the inability to accomplish simple business tasks; thanking the opportunity I had to help transform the former &quot;Evil Empire&quot; into a potential commercial, financial, military and social ally of the West (Needless to say, those expats on the ground during those years had some lofty aspirations.)I have been back to Moscow (as recently as this recent August) many times since my long-term stay and continually ask myself how the changes put into play in the early/mid-1990s resulted in the current state of the country and people.For all of those who want to know what it was like during those wild and insane mid-1990s as an expat in Russia, this book is for you. There is no need for endless hours of videotape and pictures to see -- this book captures a big chunk of history in a neat and concise bundle."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"This book is an entertaining and valuable read for anyone interested in the countries and people emerging from the collapse of the Soviet empire. The book covers far more than just Moscow but ranges into the Ukraine, Belarus, Siberia and Poland. The author has a good eye for physical and personal detail and sets scenes well. He is also able to draw the reader into an understanding of the larger implications of the events he witnessed. Brzezinski also has the advantage of growing up in French Canada as the son of Polish immigrant parents. The resulting linguistic and ethnic understanding has given him a feeling of closeness to the Slavic people of whom he writes. He is able to write in a fluid style for an American audience but at the same time he reveals a sense of irony toward the wonders of the capitalistic system that many Americans, no matter how well traveled, lack."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"At first I was captivated by the story and the author's flamboyant sense of humor. However, further reading revealed that the author is very biased in his views, I could sense contempt and disgust mixed with jealosy to New Russians. Everything is painted black or gray at best. Russians are either mafia goons or dirt poor. Women are either prostitutes or ugly babushkas. Looks like the author was only exposed to the dark side of the moon without even looking at the other side. The author seems to be morbidly attracted to filthy clubs, mafia gatherings, and etc. THe analysis of the economy and politics in Russia leaves much to be desired. Very shallow. There are many inconsistencies and mistakes in the story that make me believe that the autors has never actually visited places he described in his book.For example, I personally come from Vladivostok, which is 7 time zones from Moscow, not 5 as the author put it. The author said they had driven for three hours to a submarine plant on Amur river, which is over 1100 kilometers to the north. It takes at least 20 hours to get there by Russian roads. The name of the hotel he stayed in is incorrect. His description of the casino and club he went to doesn't ring a bell - I've been to every single club in Vladivostok. The description of bouncers wielding K47 guns is just ridiculous - an absolute lie. There are many other details that make me believe that the author just recorded somebody else's stories and made up the rest without ever visiting places.Bottom line: one-sided and shallow. Will give you a very biased idea of what Russia really is."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"The book is entertaining, though glib and superficial. I've lived in Moscow for three years and Brzezinski's book sounds like so much standard ex-pat piffle: constant moaning about how it's not like back home, coupled with high-sounding moralizing, topped off by a mercenary drive to grab as much as possible from the place before bailing out. I have some doubts about the quality of Brzezinski's reportage, since he seems not to put himself out on much in-depth research. I thought it was particularly odd that he got most if not all of his information about Umar Djabrailov by reading Umar's own collection of press clippings while waiting for an interview. Actually, I'm dismayed to learn that the Wall Street Journal would appoint him one of its Moscow correspondents when his main financial training was watching &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; and reading &quot;Liar's Poker&quot;. It casts doubt on the quality of the WSJ's reportage in general.And I have to wonder about the quality of his analysis; how could anyone spend as much time in Russia as he did and not understand that Zhirinovsky is but a political clown propped up and used by the Kremlin to advance its own agenda? How can he summarily dismiss the U.S. policy towards Russia (too much support of Yeltsin) without discussing some of the alternatives? And how, oh how, could he not have known that Night Flight was a bordello before going in? Almost every visiting foreign businessman figures this out within 24 hours of arrival.The book seems content with tossing out the types of cliched characters that will play well with the folks back at the Home Office but it doesn't break out of its limitations with any fresh insights. It's as though the book is setting the standard for a new, post-Cold War rhetoric (&quot;those awful, thick-necked, thieving Russkies!&quot;), but then maybe it's an inevitable tradition in his family (picking up where his uncle Zbigniew left off). Make no mistake, there are a lot of baddies in the upper reaches of power in Moscow, but the situation's a bit more complicated than as presented in this book. By not having distracted himself from his high-priced dinners and social circle of Bright Young Things, Brzezinski hasn't sweated enough to try to get below the surface of the current situation in Russia."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"If you read the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times, many of the stories in this book will seem familiar to you. They should. Matthew Brzezinski was a reporter for both publications in the 1990s. In this witty revealing book, he shares with you not only the stories he covered but the experiences he had in covering them and living in Kiev and Moscow. The stories are connected by his descriptions of what happened to him, his fiancee, their friends, and the people he wrote about. The book begins with being mugged in his own apartment by a confidence team in Kiev and ends with leaving the country to avoid confiscatory taxation. Unfortunately, he ends up having a regret. A year later, one of his Journal colleagues wins a Pulitzer for her reporting of the aftermath of the Russian debt crisis.Crony Capitalism is the name that has been applied to the Russian tendency for government officials to share the benefits of special favors with their buddies, and probably get a rake-off in the process. In substance, it is little different than the corruption in many third-world countries. The key difference is that Russia as an advanced industrial country with lots of natural resources had a lot of booty to share. As a result, people arise out of nowhere to command enterprises worth billions. And disappear just as quickly when their sponsors in the government are ousted.Although these scenes occur in the 1990s, they will remind you of stories about Prohibition in the United States. For example, night spots are publicly rated for the likelihood that criminals will start shooting at each other in them as well as the likelihood of being able to arrange for sexual favors. Business people operate with teams of former commandos as body guards.The disregard for society's needs is pretty strong. In a section called \\"The Zone\\" you will read about visiting the radioactive sites in and around Chernobyl. While the visitors are wearing protective gear and leaving quickly when the radiation count gets too high, people have been bribed with good jobs to come work and live in these dangerous areas without any protection. Stories about six-fingered children and other indications of genetic damage abound.But the most chilling story for me was about a training session in capitalism run for some youths in a Young Pioneers camp. Set up to mimic a free market, the youngsters were soon counterfeiting money, intimidating each other, cornering scarce supplies, and generally running the show corruptly to favor themselves. It seemed like a perfect analogy for what was occuring in the whole country. With such an ingrained, warped reaction to wide-open capitalism, can Russian have much hope for improvement? I certainly hope so. But, if that is to occur, the prescription will not be found in these pages that outline the abuses.The stories of daily living are also compelling. If you drive a car in the capital, you will get at least one traffic ticket a day. That's the way that the local Moscow police earn a living wage. On some days, you might get two. For an airplane trip, no one is sure if the planes will take off or land. Great risks are run in the process. Businesses don't pay their taxes, workers, or bills. The new rich seem to be living at the ultimate, while most are desperately poor. Naturally, a lot of this goes up in smoke when the currency crashes in the debt crisis. Savings are destroyed, and foreigners leave behind the billions that they thought they had scored big with.Clearly, much of the money earned through Crony Capitalism was simply looted and sent to foreign bank accounts. The result was probably to impoverish the country more than it was to begin with.After you finish this fascinating book, think about where else unrestrained greed has negative consequences. How can the benefits of individual iniative be gained in the context of lawlessness . . . except by joining a criminal gang? That seems like the lesson of this book. Where's Wyatt Earp?Appreciate your responsibilities to others as a way to ensure the benefits of being supported by their efforts as well as your own."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"As someone who has been involved in Russian legal matters for the past ten years, I found this book quite interesting, if not always accurate. It is not so much that it is inaccurate with respect to what it reports, it is that it so much sensationalizes Russian business that it ignores the great multitudes of Russian businesses that are out there slogging it out just like most businesses in the West. So while I greatly enjoyed the book from a mostly prurient perspective, I did not find it terribly helpful in improving my knowledge of Russian business."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"Matthew Brzezinski, former reporter in the Moscow bureau of The Wall Street Journal (and nephew of Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's anti-Soviet National Security Advisor) writes about his time in Moscow after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when a gambling mentality took over from the collapsed aspirations of Russia's 70 year experiment with Communism.His book captures something of the atmosphere of Moscow and the former Soviet Union of the 1990s when anything seemed possible in the world of finance, set in a time and place in which Berezovsky, Gusinsky, and Potanin were discussed with the same awe (and envy) as Bezos, Case and (Martha) Stewart were in the United States.One tale of a board meeting in the mid-1990s in the chapter \\"Potemkin Inc.\\" (after the phrase \\"Potemkin village\\", a sham devised by 18th century bureaucrats to impress their sovereign) is particularly telling, not only about how far corporate governance has to go to attract foreign investors but also how the 'Soviet' mentality continues:\\"One by one, the nine board members followed, one elderly official pausing by the microphone. 'Foreigners need to think about the future of the plant and about the welfare of its employees, not just about pumping profits,' he spat, white with anger. 'This meeting is over,' he added, storming off the stage.\\"Such comments have a familiar tone to consumers of Soviet propaganda. For 70 years the Soviet Union spoke of the horrors of Western imperialism, while at the same time running the most far-reaching totalitarian empire the world has ever seen.At times Casino Moscow veers too much between being a personal memoir of his time in Moscow along with his growing relationship with Roberta and the larger story of the first few years of freedom in Russia. Snippets of the life of an expat in Moscow-the problems with personal staff, fears about safety, frustration with the petty bureaucracy-leave the reader wanting to learn more about what it is like to be in a country that has collapsed and is trying to find its place in the world community. Although I can sympathize with the desire for maintaining discretion regarding his wife's career, it was somewhat teasing that Brzezinski doesn't name her shadowy (although well known in Russian finance circles) and immensely profitable employer; he writes, \\"...I have taken the liberty of changing [her firm's name] to VSO, for Very Secretive Organization.\\" Such subterfuge does little to dispel the notion of a cabal of financiers plotting the future of the world behind the scenes (which does not make Western capital look too attractive to its recipients).Casino Moscow is an enjoyable book to read for anyone wondering about the beginnings of Russia's post-Soviet history."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"I would probably rate this 3.5 stars, but erred on the high side since I did not have that option. I enjoyed this book, just as I enjoyed Godfather of the Kremlin by Paul Klebnikov. However, Casino should not be purchased as an in-depth study of the rise and fall of the free-market system in Moscow during the 1990's. I expected a former financial writer for the Wall Street Journal to have included a little more background and detail as to what events led to the rise of the free market system and its fall. Throughout the book, Brzezinski refers to the looting of Russia's assets by the oligarchs, the corruption of government officials and business leaders, the moving in of organized crime, etc., but there is not even the most basic explanation of these happenings to give the reader the context of the events discussed in the book. This could have been done without turning it into an economic treatise. In contrast, even considering its flaws (as discussed in its reviews), Godfather of the Kremlin did try to give the reader more detailed and in-depth information concerning the government and business actions that got Moscow and Russia in that situation. Having said that, I enjoyed the book for what it was - sort of a &quot;year in the life&quot; of the author's time in Moscow with anecdotes and a few flashbacks to his family in Poland and other events in his life. As someone who has experienced the coldness of previously closed Russian cities (with defense factories), train rides across the country and being frisked before going into mob-controlled Moscow restaurants, I enjoy these stories. I am, however, still looking for a book with the perfect balance between entertaining and educational, although given the constant changes over the past couple of years it may be difficult. Next up, the book by the Miller Beer salesman in Moscow, whose name I cannot remember."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"This is a book that deserves its five stars. Excellently written and covers a fascinating subject -- the development of capitalism in Russia. The author who is Canadian with Polish heritage ventures to the east to become a journalist for the Wall Street Journal and to see first hand the continents progress from communism to market economy. Much to his surprise it is not exactly a sight for sore eyes but a wild-west robber baron type mentality where the ones with the money and the guns to back it up rules. The amount of money, power, and blood that is at stake are staggering and the quest for control has always its ties to Kremlin and organized crime. The book offers great insight in the complexity of both the workings of Russia and its surrounding countries (i.e former Soviet Union states) and the eagerness of international finance to earn a quick buck along the way, which might not be the best way to find stable growth and development that is so much needed."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"Ever desired to hear an unrepentant rapist recount his crime? Here's the book for you! Gloat over the victim's unwillingness to give in, mock the victim's pretense to dignity as she's destroyed, and have a good chuckle in the meantime. Brzezinski takes his hedonistic nihilism for a luxury tour paid for by the Wall Street Journal to explain how American spoiled brat IFC punks driving Land Rovers raid Russia with phrases like &quot;No one said life was fair&quot; and &quot;The average expat had trouble surviving on less than $100,000 a year in Moscow.&quot; The Prologue's description of the author's savage beating -- put foremost as if to claim both that this pampered candyass earned his stripes and that an economically depressed country is deserving of whatever it gets -- is unfortunate only in that the Ukrainian thug didnt finish the job and spare us Brzezinki's ignorant, shameless prose. Read any Russian of any background the sentence ending &quot;...Anatoly Chubais, the man who created Russian capitalism and was charged with saving it&quot; and enjoy the genuine, honest howl of laughter you'll hear in response. Or, if you prefer the craven smugness of the privileged sons of diplomats and have no interest in learning about Russia, buy this book!"},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"I think Mr. Zbignev Brzezinski - a former US National Security adviser under President Carter - would enjoy the book. This is because \`Casino Moscow' was written by his young nephew - Matthew Brzezinski. Plus it portraits Russians in the most unpleasant light - some people like that! Certainly, to his credit, Mr. Matthew Brzezinski has reached new heights in his creative Russia - bashing. The author has actually moved a full circle from his uncle's traditional Truman-like anti-communism to the age-old loathing of everything Russian by the Polish ultra-nationalist aristocracy from Marshal Pilsudski camp.I am not sure if this loathing is unjustified, but the question I am asking is simple: is Mr. Matthew Brzezinski really the right person to represent US business community in Russia (as a WSJ correspondent), or may be he is a little biased to bridge Russian and American points of view? No wonder US investments in Russia are less than in Costa Rica."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"I'm thinking of the final scene of the book.......Brezinski describes the flood of expats crowding the airport, jumping on the first plane out, like it was the last plane out of Saigan, and I bet his housekeeper was laughing her head off as she flipped through the channels on the TV he donated out of guilt or because it was too heavy to take with him, or as she snuggled into the fur coat Brezinski's wife probably left behind in a fit of political correctness.I was in Kiev in '94 and '97....and a great deal of what he's written about Moscow was evident in Kiev, on a smaller scale. I believe Brezinski has done an admirable job of presenting the wild west style of business that was fostered by investment bankers looking for a superlative return on their investment and the Russians who saw a good thing and knew how to play it. However, what probably sickens some readers is the arrogance of the American &quot;let us show you how it's done&quot; attitude that pervades the book.While Brezinski is describing the high life he lived with his friends......I wonder if he ever had a moment where he wondered about the lesser life lived by his housekeeper....about the costs of the oligarch's theft of companies. And the part played by investment banks who were willing to look the other way when dealing with the oligarch's as long as their return on investment was high enough.Sure, I enjoyed the voyeristic pleasure of watching the expats live it up.....as much as Brezinski. But I wish he'd balanced his work with a view of the social costs of the &quot;experiment&quot;.At the end of his book, as he recounts the mass exodus of expats, it would have done him well to look over his shoulder at the Russians who were laughing........"},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"Man, had I not been to Russia as many times already that I have...and I was getting read to leave and had read this book, I would be too scared to go!!!

Until this one.A reporter for a widely respected newspaper, dropped into '90s Moscow's whirling clash of cultures, should be able to come away with quite a collection of stories. And, to be fair, Brzezinski has some humorous stuff, and some interesting tales, but they're buried among too much personal detritus. There is far too much about the author, his family ties (enough already about \\"Uncle Zbig!\\") and his resentment of all things Russian. I've never read a book with such a smug (yet whiny) protagonist.He didn't much like Russians (and had a big chip on his shoulder throughout the book), and he had little use for the expat community. With all his complaining, I wondered throughout this book why Brzezinski agreed to go to Russia, then why he stayed there, then why he bothered to write about it.There's a good book somewhere in the Russia of the 1990s. This isn't it."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"Despicable RussiansI think Mr. Zbignev Brzezinski - a former US National Security adviser under President Jimmy Carter - would certainly enjoy the book.

No wonder US investments in Russia are less than in Costa Rica."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"This book read easily, despite it containing a great deal of factual information about the Russian economy. I have previously worked as an expatriate in a third world country, and am no stranger to the workings of corruption, but Russia's systemic corruption described by the author was to such an extreme level that this book almost seemed as if it should have been fiction. I enjoyed the book, but was genuinely horrified by certain scenes, such as the trip to the infamous reactor at Chernobyl years after the accident.My disgust peaked when reading about how after begging for a multi billion dollar bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and finally receiving the funds, the Russian government exchanged these dollars with private banker cronies at favorable exchange rates, just before devaluing the ruble- thereby deflating the live savings of citizens and letting foreign fund managers take a beating. George Soros called investing in Russia the biggest mistake of his investing career, according to the author. It is interesting to note that the Russian stock market index is up by nearly 100% in the past 12 months! Short memories, or is Russia at long last on a true path to reform?My only criticism of the book was that the author sometimes shifted abruptly into flashbacks, making it difficult to determine the point in time of the book."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"I really liked Brzezinski's book, and I think you will too as long as you don't go into it expecting something along the lines of Chrystia Freeland's &quot;Sale of the Century.&quot; Freeland is an incredible reporter and had gained amazing access to the machinations in the Kremlin. Brzezinski even pays tribute to Freeland's talents in his book.Granted, there is a hard-earned interview with the 'wily' Anatoly Chubais, but short of brief episodes like that, this is really the story of Brzezinski himself and his fiancee (now wife) Roberta as they navigate along the shoals of the East's first brush with capitalism. So it's not really &quot;WSJ reporter Brzezinski demonstrates his knowledge of Russian bond yield curves...&quot; but rather &quot;Hey, here's what was going on in my personal life while I was writing those stories.&quot;And for me, that's a fresh take, and here's where his editors and marketers have sold him short: only about 25% of the book takes place in Moscow. The author also takes you to Vladivostok, Sakhalin, St. Petersburg, Chernobyl, Minsk, Crimea, and Poland - and that's not a complete list. In fact, I thought the writings from Vladivostok were the book's finest passages, closely followed by Chernobyl.I think readers will be pleasantly surprised by the accessibility of this book. It is worth noting that Brzezinski's work is available in paperback, while Freeland's effort - despite being the definitive account of the period - is now out of print (hardback only) despite its contemporaneous publication date."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"Brzezinski displays the acumen of a tourist. The abundance of factual mistakes in Casino Moscow damage the author's credibility when he makes a rare reference to Russian businesses, which were the supposed topic of the book. As a collection of anecdotal stories, this book was more entertaining than what you'd hear from an average guy in a bar. But as a source of information about Russia in the 1990's, it is not WSJ quality."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"I found this rather disappointing, in that it was full of anecdotal evidence, lacked serious analysis, and was as much about the author's adventures in Eastern Europe as it was about Moscow or Russia. Mr. Brezinski has some interesting insights, a good understanding of Eastern europe, and his pedigree undoubtedly opened some doors in terms of interviews. Nevertheless, I frankly expected more. His lack of business or economic background was not nearly as disappointing as his failure to stick to the subject at hand. Perhaps in the future he will revisit the topic and approach it from a more detached perspective."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"Thought this was even better than his other work on Russia, \\"Red Moon Rising\\". And \\"Red Moon Rising\\" was pretty great.Brzezinski is witty, humerous, and completely honest about his years in Russia--detailing the good, the bad, and the ugly as the country transitioned from a Communist system where everyone stole everything to a Capitalist system where everyone stole everything.He also paints a pretty accurate picture of being a foreigner visiting Russia. As an American who has been to both Moscow and Siberia, I can vouch for the voraciously unscrupulous taxi drivers hawking 200$ rides from one airport to another, and other things Brzezinski so accurately depicts. However, his experience was much more interesting and treacherous than mine, him visiting Anatoly Chubais, meeting with many of the richest oligarchs, and seeing the remains of Chernobyl.This is a great book to start with learning about post-Communist Russia."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"great synopsis of what happened when Moscow went into a free-market economy.

Very good!"},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"So what's good old Mother Russia like post Communism? How's capitalism's so-called moral superiority faring behind the shredded Iron Curtain? According to Brzezinski's revealing, brisk, and often very funny account of Russia's roaring 90s, things are a little nuts. In fact, it's an all-out free-for-all, with every body trying to make as much money as possible in any way possible as quickly as possible -- before the window of opportunity closes. Contemporary Russia is capitalism without rules. The few who are rich and powerful -- which include a good number of very shrewd and opportunistic Americans and foreigners -- are super rich and super powerful; the poor include the remainder of the population, and, to put it bluntly, they're dirt poor. The middle class has yet to arrive. Filled with lurid, disturbing, scary set pieces that show what can happen to nation yet to get a handle on capitalism's finer points, for a book labeled as financial journalism, Casino Moscow is impossibly and thoroughly entertaining."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"A excellent first hand account of the life of a priviledged &quot;westener&quot; in modern day Russia. I also spent some time in Moscow and St Pete and everything he talks about rings true. At times the author walks a fine line....he can not seem to decide whether he has contempt or jeaulously for Russia's new mafia kings. He rides on their private lear jets, attends their feasts, but then derides them. His side stories about Poland, Belarus and Urkaine are as good as his Moscow stories. I give him credit for getting out of Moscow and writing on the &quot;real Russia&quot;. He final chapter is dead on...Russia is not America's fault or the IMF's fault...Russia is Russia's fault."},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"This is just a phenominal book about the fleecing of Russia and all the crazy things going on in the late 90's. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this book. Matthew Brzezinski is clearly a great writer who has just not been discovered"},{"Title":"Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier","review":"&quot;Matthew's Misadventures in the New Eastern Europe&quot; is a more fitting title for this book. It is a rambling tale of a young reporter's experiences in Poland, Ukraine, Russia and Belorussia. It is by no means a comprehensive account of the region's transition from communism to--for the most part--crony capitalism and anarchy.Casino Moscow does have some interesting anecdotes and men's locker room stories from this enthralling period of unprecedented change and transfer of wealth. However, the author often starts to ramble and goes off on tangents, thus the time period discussed is not always obvious. Another serious critique is that the book is quite superficial. Mr. Brzezinski does not delve too deeply into any topic and often fails to state his own conclusions as a good investigative reporter should. In addition he is not more perceptive than an average cognizant tourist. After living in Moscow for some time, he walked into nightspot, which, to his surprise, turned out to be a brothel. Mr. Brzezinski is a typical expatriate who fails to truly understand the local culture and people. He is constantly complaining either about the lack of western luxuries or the exuberant displays of wealth in the new Russia. At times I even sensed a tinge of resentment at missing out on this unprecedented &quot;gold rush&quot; where vast fortunes were made and lost overnight.While trying to mix in morsels of humor, the author threw serious doubts on the credibility of the Wall Street Journal. Mr. Brzezinski, who was sent to Kiev to serve as the Journal's financial reporter, wrote that he tried to learn about financial markets from watching the movie, Wall Street, and reading Liar's Poker. The Wall Street Journal is a highly reliable and reputable source and this raises the question of whether Mr. Brzezinski was hired as a result of his descent in lieu of financial acumen.The bottom line is: if you know next to nothing about Eastern Europe, and believe that wild bears roam the snow-laden streets of Moscow, then you will find this book very informative and entertaining. If not, I'd recommend other books on the subject such as Chrystia Freeland's Sale of the Century."},{"Title":"More Dumb, Dumber, Dumbest","review":"This has to be one of the best, and most interesting books that i have read in a while.

I really love the diverse characters that appeared in this story!"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"First, you could just say that Brad Meltzer is a darn fine writer. And you wouldn't be wrong. Meltzer writes well almost every time out, and he seems never short of new ideas. You could also say that we've seen the end of the mystery in Identity Crisis now, we know what happens, and the same scenario has now been played out on soap operas, movies, television serials, etc. And you wouldn't be wrong there, either. (Shakespeare's tricks and Dickens's plots have all been borrowed a lot, too.) So why do we go back? Why read Identity Crisis now when we already know the story, already have seen its coolest and creepiest moments reviewed, regaled, and revived on geek internet sites galore? The answer: Because Identity Crisis is truly one of those moments of very good if not great (and I argue that it's great) literature where the smallest parts are all fascinating and the entire piece of art, taken as a whole, resonates even now as it did then. WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS HEREAFTER. Most people are going to remember this as the DC story where the mystery is solved by seeing Jean Palmer's footprints in Sue Dibny's brain; yes, her footprints' marks meshed into Sue's brain tissue, literally into her grey matter, or, at the least, the pinky-colored stuff. And, yes, touches like that make us look up and say, \\"Wow, Meltzer! How'd you think up that one?\\" Or, maybe even better yet, they remember this as the comic in which Rags Morales drew Elongated Man's face literally sagging beyond any conscious mental or involuntary bodily control, in fact, that he drew it in such a way that we all felt sorrow for a man who, because of that unbelievably believable expression of heartfelt anguish, we came to call by his real name: Ralph Dibny. Morales made him forever memorable. But if that's all we had, we wouldn't go back and reread this year after year. Meltzer's master plan was to take a whole chorus of characters, major and minor (Batman, Superman, Hawkman, Wonder Woman, Green Arrow, Flash, Robin, Atom, Zatanna, Black Canary, Dr. Mid-Nite, Dr. Light, Merlyn, Deathstroke, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, Monocle, et. al.), and compose them into a scenario where an act of such disturbing consequences is, indeed, more disturbing than the very murder that drives the entire book. This act, furthermore, compromises everything we think of nearly all the characters in the DC Universe, because the ramifications of one choice (voted on in a makeshift democratic moment in time) thread the entire DC Universe both together and apart. They are all tied into this choice or get their bit parts according to how close or how far they were to the moment of the choice, and yet that choice could very well shatter the whole concept of a Justice Leauge (parodied by a character's comment that, in retrospect, \\"schmuck called the Injustice Gang . . . with a name like that, they deserved to be beaten.\\" Meltzer suggests, perhaps, that a group with the brazenly, possibly holier-than-thou name like \\"The Justice League\\" would shatter and crumble under its own weight were it ever to commit an act of injustice. This is the grand scope of Meltzer's masterpiece. Even if you don't take this work as seriously as I do, there is a lot to like here for any comic fan. There is a b***s-out fight between Deathstroke and members of the League in which he nearly takes them all out for the full count; you get to see intrigue between the members of the League themselves like you've never seen before; there is a huge moment where you wonder if Batman is, indeed, the smartest of all and, perhaps, knowingly makes the biggest sacrifice of all the members of the League, hiding his own knowing involvement in a terrible act; you get scenes of touching moments where characters are just as innocent and empathetic as they are glorious and powerful. And Rag Morales art is simply out of this world. By now, if you've kept reading, obviously, I am extremely highly recommending this book to anyone for any reason. It's, hands-down, a must buy. Emphatically so!"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Overall very good, I just expected a more intriguing end. But drawn great and well written.

If DC and Meltzer had chosen to create new characters, outside of continuity, this line of discussion might not have arisen. However for the story to achieve its full potential it needs invested characters.Having characters we know well causes us to be devastated by their unethical and misguided actions. Their revelation comes as body blow from which it takes some time for us to get our breath back. Only a storyteller of Meltzer's caliber, and speciality in conspiracy stories, could make such a tale exciting and plausible.Is this type of story, with its ends-justifying-the-means issues, good for comics? For over two decades writers have been portraying their characters as vigilantes who are motivated as much by their psyche as out of justice. If these characters existed in the real world, they would be met with derision from Main Street America. Although Identity Crisis gives us more cause for judgement than other stories, there is definite precedent.The appeal of Identity Crisis does not rest on being an innovation in super-heroes.

The surface story was pretty simple -- a whodunit, in which the super heroes resemble less \\"The Superfriends\\" and more \\"NYPD Blue\\". They band together to find -- oh hell, the Amazon blurb already spoiled it -- the killer of Sue Dibny, wife of Ralph Dibny. A killer who, somehow, overcame a plethora of security devices protecting the home of the secret identity-less Dibny aka the Elongated Man.But the subplot creeps up on you -- its about what it means to be a \\"caped crusader\\", someone who wears a mask and combats evil. It means your ability to do what you do is protected only by a thin sliver of cloth around your face. (Yes, the glasses of Clark Kent, and the masks of Green Arrow, Robin, Green Lantern and many others would, in the real world, do absolutely nothing to hide their identities, but that's part of the fantasy you have to buy into in the comics world.)You and your loved ones are constantly at risk -- and paradoxically -- as the revelation at the end of the book reveals -- your loved ones can actually BECOME the danger.Heroes are people too they have fathers, mothers, children, brothers, sisters and friends and any of them can, in one way or another fall victim to your \\"profession.\\"Meltzer made a good decision having Green Arrow aka Oliver Queennarrate the story. He's not mechanical, detached perfectionist that Batman is. He's not Superman the demigod. Wonder Woman is the legend -- the princess; Flash and Green Lantern are the kids and Hawkman is the gruff, no-nonsense warrior.Oliver is the everyman of the DCU. He's an idealist yes, but more than that, he's a realist. He knows how things could be, his own visions of a perfect world, but at the same time he knows how things ARE. Is it at peace with what he and others did to Dr Light and Batman? No. But he has rationalized it and understands that hard choices will always have to be made and that often in this life, \\"there are no winners.\\"Meltzer has enraged lots of people sure, many of whom have posted the first reviews here. But no one brushed off IC with a mere shrug, that's for sure. Is this story complete? No not at all -- it sprung off into half a dozen other storylines. However, the cliffhangers don't matter. This is a good, if flawed work that will be pored over for decades to come among comics fans."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Identity Crisis is a compilation of a series of comic books featuring the Justice League and other familiar superheros.

As the search continues, Atom's ex-wife is nearly killed and the heros realize that someone out there knows their true identities and the identities of their familes. They must find the villan before any more of their loved ones are hurt...or worse.This is a story of human (and superhuman) emotion. On display are the strongest members of society; but they have weaknesses as well. Family is no less important to those that boast exceptional skills and talents. What identifies us as human are the bonds that we share with our family and friends. This is depicted clearly as part of an exciting and action packed plot.I have never been a fan of comic books. Truth be told, I've never really given them a chance. I always figured they were for silly boys who didn't want to read a book. I put this book on my wish list simply because it was written by Brad Meltzer - I don't think I even realized what it was. When I received it as a gift I was surprised to see what I had chosen. After finishing it, I am surprised at what a world I've been missing. This story is extremely well written, the illustrations powerful and extremely supportive of the text. My only word of caution is that if you are not already familiar with the superhero world, it will take you some time to keep track of the names and faces - especially when they switch between their superhero names and the names of their true identities. Meltzer doesn't seem to write anything badly and this is no exception. A fine collaboration and highly recommended - even if you aren't a comic book junky."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Pros------ great story line IMHO, sparked my interest in reading more comics- surprised by the detail in the drawings, characters faces were pretty expressiveCons------- as a first time reader, the way the comic book lays out the story was a bit confusing (compared to a novel, it reads like movie or cartoon script might be like), but I into the style quickly enough. Does take getting used to though."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Many many years ago I got hooked on a DC superhero series: Jim Shooter's Legion of Superheroes, then appearing in Adventure and the back of Action Comics. Here were kids just a few years older than me having adventures, but with the beginnings of real personalities and real emotion. Four heroes scared to death and fleeing through time from a fantasically powerful sorcerer Mordru. Teenage romance -- ah! Even heroes with flaws, as Timber Wolf fought drug addiction and Matter-Eater Lad struggled with his father's alcoholism.For the next ten years I read almost every comic that I could lay hands on, but as the overall quality took a nosedive in the seventies I gradually quit. By the eighties the only thing I was reading was the New Teen Titans, with scripts by Marvelous Marv Wolfman and exquisite George Perez art. Again, what I found compelling was a group of kids, this time about my own age despite the misleading label \\"Teen\\" Titans, who had real emotions and real personalities. Dick Grayson was the leader I always wanted to be -- fighting his own inner demons. His alien girlfriend Koriand'r, the most wonderful woman in the history of literature. I think I loved her more than Dick did. Gar Logan, the youngest of the lot, covering up a mountain of pain with his wisecracks and girl-craziness. Wonderful, solid, always reliable Donna Troy. It wasn't just a superhero team. The Titans were family. When Tara died as a traitor I felt like I'd been eviscerated, and I slowly drifted away from the Titans -- and comics.Finally I read Crisis on Infinite Earths, and if I loved Wolfman and Perez on Titans, I hated them now. Fifty years of DC continuity -- down the tubes. Everything starts over. Zero Hour was more of the same but worse. I never wanted to see another comic again. I took up serious literature. OK, that's not entirely right. I took up mysteries, thrillers, and Grisham novels.Brad Meltzer. Good plotter, sometimes the endings are a little weak and require a lot of suspension of disbelief, but so what. I read all his stuff anyway. So, to my utter astonishment, I find . . . Brad Meltzer is writing comics???About heroes I've heard of?Seriously though, this is good stuff. This is what superheroes would be like if they really existed and wore costumes. Powerful, but like you and me they ache when they lose a loved one, and they get over-protective and they get angry.And they face serious moral dilemmas that they try to solve the best they can, and sometimes they do the right thing and sometimes they don't and sometimes they have to worry, and worry, and wonder for years if what they did will someday blow up in their faces.In \\"Identity Crisis\\" a BIG moral dilemma blows up in the faces of heroes you've known for years. The murder mystery itself is good, but typical Meltzer -- resolved a little too quickly and just a little too far fetched to be great. There were some things I didn't quite understand, probably from being away from comics for 20 years, and there were some loose ends that didn't get tied up, and not a little bit of foreshadowing for what lies ahead. I've even heard rumors that \\"Identity Crisis\\" is the springboard for another enormous change in the DC universe, perhaps even more sweeping, if that is possible, than \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths.\\" All I know is, Meltzer has got me interested in comics again.Shooter gave us heroes with personalities. Wolfman gave us heroes we care about as family. Meltzer doesn't give us heroes -- he even calls them, rather derisively, \\"capes\\" -- he gives us people. With ethical struggles. Just like the rest of us.Good job."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"After the \\"big changes\\" in comics brought about by mega-crossovers like Marvel's \\"Secret Wars\\" and DC's \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", the phrase in my review's title became almost a cliche as the publishers felt a marketing imperative to try and shake things up as years went by.Usually these \\"events\\" include such things as rebooting Time, a villain gaining control of the Whatchamacallit of Awesome Cosmic Power, and, of course, killing Superman (who, to paraphrase Monty Python, and to no fan's surprise, got better). But while pieces were rearranged, removed, or returned to the board, nothing really changed.Until Identity Crisis. Meltzer has crafted a rare thing here. In \\"going small\\" instead of big, he has changed everything. With a few deaths - what one might almost call \\"little deaths\\" given the characters' minor status in the DC universe - Meltzer has introduced a powerful dynamic of complication into the cape-and-cowl set. His characterization is powerful and dead-on. One can feel the frustration of the heroes as their leads pan out. We're reminded that the villains, too, are human, and gain insight into their underground. It is, in short, a cracking good yarn.Some fans are hissing about it. That's certainly their right. But for my money Identity Crisis was one of 2005's best reads in comics, if not for anything else but the acknowledgement that the world is a lot more complicated than just \\"heroes versus villains\\"."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Before \\"Identity Crisis,\\" I had all but given up on comics following the downturn of the industry in the 1990's. This ambitious collection by novelist Brad Meltzer got me back into comic books, thanks to its adult themes and characterization. It's not a comic for children, though--it's written at a PG-13 level and features murder, rape, and magical lobotomies. There are some holes in the plot--it's not perfect, but pretty close to it. For a writer's first comic book work, I don't think we'll ever see a debut of this magnitude again.If you like \\"Identity Crisis,\\" I would also suggest the companion JLA graphic novel,Crisis of Conscience, that follows up on some of the loose threads from this collection. DC followed up these miniseries with the popular (but cheesier) \\"Infinity Crisis,\\" aimed at a more PG crowd."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Excellent story, a psychological angle to comics. Who benefits? The reader does. The best villain for super-heroes isnt a big strong monster from another planet, its life.I also love how the big 3 seem larger than life in this book."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"If I were lost on a deserted island and had one comic to bring with me, this would be the one. That being said, I must explain, but for those of you that have already read it, you should understand why. This is probably one of the best written stories in comics I've ever read. Not very action packed, heavy on the character development side, and gritty; I recommend it to anyone wanting to see just how good a comic can be. It has gotten criticism for its subject matter and dark themes (I even remember reading where someone thought DC had gone way too far making its capitol characters harder). I love it. The writers at DC (and recently Marvel) have started to acknowledge that yes, they have fans in their mid-twenties and beyond and that those readers don't have to see \\"good-guys always win\\" type of story-telling. A much needed shake-up to the status quo was exactly what DC needed to stay cutting edge (and not just with Batman or the Vertigo titles).SPOILERS: In case you love comics and have been living under a rock, here's how the story goes: Elongated Man's wife is attacked and set on fire, killed. The heroes of the DCU, after the funeral, go into different directions to search for the killer. But EM and a select few (Zatanna, Hawkman, Green Arrow, and few others) go after their prime-suspect in secret: Dr. Light, who had raped her years before. This opens the door to a secret that the group had tried to lock away for years, after the rape, Zatanna altered Dr. Light's mind with magic. This started a trend of heroes \\"re-wiring\\" villains brains to make them forget certain things (like heroes' secret identities) and actually changing some of their personalities. But worse yet, they altered the minds of some heroes as well.Problem being: Dr. Light didn't do it, and it appears a serial killer is on the loose targeting the families of the heroes.Some amazing story-telling is done around Elongated Man, The Atom, Green Arrow, Tim Drake, Captain Boomerang (whom you end-up really feeling bad for by the end of the book), Calculator, Dr. Light and Slade. Nothing is too much or too little. The artwork is great, not too flashy or over-the-top. Story is well paced and keeps you interested. A lot of characters make appearances, but they are more background rather then \\"let's see how many heroes and villains we can throw in here\\".I'm actually a bit disappointed of the events that followed this book (Infinite Crisis), but it should in NO way stop you from picking this up, reading it in one sitting and then saying \\"wow, that was great!\\".Highest possible recommendation."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"When it comes to comics featuring superheros the storys are slmost entirely character driven, focusing on what the characters are thinking. But in books like these where there are numerous characters the books become more meaningful, the plots and interactions become better and this book is about as good as you can get.It contains the best fight in comics for the last decade: \\"Slade vs. the Justice League.\\"It contains one of the best opening scenes in comics, the death of Sue Dinby.It has numerous great points of foreshadowing that sets up the entire Infinate Crises (something that fell short of this book.)The only thing that fell short, and I'm certain many will agree with me here, was the ending. And that is because there was no way to end this correctly. Its like the movie \\"Seven\\" there is no way to end the movie that would be cooler than all the stuff that came before it, it can't deliver anymore, because there is nothing else to give. This book held nothing back for the end, which is in its own way a good thing.This is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"I grew up reading Marvel Comics and I never found myself ever reading or enjoying the DC Universe titles. As I grew up my taste in comics matured and some of the comics changed with me to reflect that. The best examples are books like Alias, Powers and Supreme Power: but none of those books really did anything to the mainstream comics. Instead they took the second rate characters or just created new ones. DC decided to take the next step with Identity Crisis.I could not put this book down.I have recently been reading DC Comics and had some knowledge of who the characters were, but I don't think I would have needed that knowledge to enjoy this book as much as I did. It was beautiful, edgy and so very real. It drove spikes into my heart and made me love and hate so many characters.This book has made a believer out of me. From now on my comic book stack will now have both Marvel and DC titles in it."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"As someone who grew up and read many DC comics in the '60s I occasionally like to see what's being done lately with the characters I grew up with.Wow.I'm still not sure what audience this book is supposed to be marketed to but it's amazing when I think back on the brou-ha-ha greeting EC Comics in the '50s and seeing the stuff now being sold supposedly to kids today.Not that I have any extreme moral qualms about it but the themes and graphics of this book certainly presuppose an outlook that would have been unimaginable to me when I was 10 years old.Still the artwork is incredible.But I have to agree with many others here that many aspects of the storyline are ridiculous. There has always been a desire to take super-heroes out of the \\"juvenile\\" and transform them to the \\"adult\\" but the plot-twists in this book are at best \\"adolescent\\".But more pointedly, I can't help feeling that the \\"fun\\" has been taken out of comics."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"What would happen if someone would start killing family and friends of the DC Comics superheroes (The Justice League)?Brad (Book of Fate) Meltzer explores this issue in this graphic novel. He taskes the whodunit art form with his writing this novel and put a mystery spin in the graphic novel.It was so easy for a DC superhero to rush into a building and save the day. That was the 1950-1960 ideal and didn't until the 1990's. Then the 1990's Crisis cleaned DC comics house, removing many characters and reseting others. This novel, which came from a seven issue comic mini series, showcases a more real DC universe.Note before this novel, Characters have died before in comics. However this novel fleshes out the emotional content. It is done in comic form, but it is more thought provoking. The issue of Life and death at a family level is brought home, with the Dead of Elongated man's Wife Sue.Over the last few years, comics have seem to get stronger in content and texure. All you need to see is view the Graphic Novels of Batman Hush and Green Smith's Green Arrow Quiver (first 12 issues) for examples of this trend. I thing DC has finally followed in suit as Marvel comic hasIn this book, author Meltzer give these DC heroes more interplay and depth together than just fighting the bad guys. It shows the underbelly of the superheroes relationship. It explores an idea of Life and Death that is more than that Death of Superman, Green Arrow or others. This is more of an internal workings of a hero, we see relationships (bad & good) is not all a bed of roses as comic fortold in the heyday era of 1950-60s.It is also a superhero Whodunit. However ,with all the red herrings that piece has, it is someone you least expect and still the ending does not sit wwll with me. It makes sense, but it does not work in my opinion ...it too patSo is this good?-YES...it is a more real and honest portrait of Suprtheroes and their personal universes and the art is above most comics these days.Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Best selling novelist and one time Green Arrow scribe Brad Meltzer weaves this best selling mini-series, which attempts to begin to turn the DC universe on it's ear. Identity Crisis focuses on the risks that one takes when they choose to become a costumed super hero, and the murder mystery that Meltzer weaves makes a majority of Identity Crisis a page turner. It begins with the murder of Sue Dibny, wife of Justice Leaguer Ralph Dibny AKA the Elongated Man. Soon enough, Ralph joins up with other Leaguers Green Arrow, Flash, Zatanna, Black Canary, Hawkman, the Atom, and Green Lantern to find Dr. Light, who he believes to be the killer because years ago, Light raped Sue. The reason nobody outside of this group knows this happened, is because through Zatanna's magic, Light was made to forget it ever happened, and in the process, his mind was changed forever from fearsome villain to laughable clown. This revelation opens up a floodgate of secrets and lies, including more murders, and the fact that the killer knows the real identities of the heroes, even those of Superman and Batman. You've got to give Meltzer credit where credit is due: no one has ever cared what's happend to a minor character like Sue Dibny before, and the murder mystery he weaves here is great to say the least. The fight between the aforementioned group and Deathstroke is just plain awesome, and it re-affirms the villain's place as the most deadly foe in the DC universe. However, by the time the final revelations are made, it almost betrays everything that came before it. Purist DC fans will either love it or hate it, but Identity Crisis only serves as a prelude for the upcoming Infinite Crisis in which the villains strike back (notice how it comes nearly 20 years after Crisis on Infinite Earths). The art by penciler Rags Morales and inker Mike Bair isn't anything real special, but it serves it's purpose trying to give the characters a realistic/less cartoony look. All in all, Identity Crisis is worth reading just because of it's premise and the promise it will shake up the DC universe (we've heard this before, but so far, so good), but for those who tuned out years ago when DC tried to be edgy by killing Superman, breaking Batman, and making Green Lantern Hal Jordan a mass murderer, this won't help how you feel."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"The monumental seven issue limited series \\"Identity Crisis\\" is finally collected into one large hardcover volume and loaded with extras. This series, which sparked controversy among long time fans of the Justice League, casts the moralistic league in a new, and rather dark light. In many ways Identity Crisis serves to out do Marvel Comics at its own game of showing the frailty of superheroes, long their trademark.As the story unfolds, Sue Dibney, the wife of the Elongated Man has been murdered, and her body badly burned. The Didney's home was outfitted with the most advanced security systems available and yet the killer got in and left without a single clue. Even the combined abilities of Mister Miracle, The Atom, The Ray, The Metal Men, and Animal Man cannot find even the slightest trace of a clue.After the funeral, attended by most of the heroes of the DC universe, teams are formed to track down villains who use fire as a power and soon the Teen Titans, The Outsiders, The JSA, the old JLI, Booster Gold and Blue Beetle, and others are hot on the trail of the suspects. But another group meets in secret...a group including Green Arrow, Hawkman, Black Canary, Zatanna, Atom, and the Elongated Man. When The Flash sneaks in on the meeting he learns of a startling revelation. Years earlier, in the League's satellite headquarters, Sue Dibney was alone stargazing when she was attacked and sexually assaulted by Doctor Light. The maniacal Light then threatened the wives of the other members so this group, without the knowledge of Superman or Batman, had Zatanna perform a magical lobotomy on Doctor Light, but only after a divided vote among the members with The Flash (Barry Allen) providing the deciding vote.The Flash is outraged but reluctantly joins the group in their search for Light. Meanwhile Jean Loring, the ex-wife of Ray Palmer (The Atom) is attacked and hung but survives. Again no clues can be found. Now all of the heroes with family are on edge. Someone is targeting their loved ones. Is it Doctor Light, or another villain?Identity Crisis presents a divided league and one were not uses to seeing. Wally cannot believe that Barry Allen would have voted to mess with Light's mind. What's interesting is how the members are more afraid of Batman finding out about what they did than Superman. Some fans may look at this as tainting the reputation of the JLA but on the other hand this is not the 1960's anymore. It's a harsh world we live in and writer Brad Meltzer has reflected this among the JLA members.The art by Rags Morales and Michael Bair is just gorgeous. The battle with Deathstroke was among the most dynamic I've seen in years. Bair has been a favorite of mine since his days on the Young All-Stars. He's an extremely underrated talent. The book features an introduction by Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon and also features commentary by Meltzer and Morales on specific scenes such as why Batman was not in attendance at Sues funeral, the seating arrangement of the heroes at the funeral, and the science involved in the battle with Deathstroke. They also discuss the scene where Sue is sexually assaulted by Doctor Light and how the colors by Alex Sinclair show the cold tragedy of the scene. This commentary truly helps the reader understand the story in greater depth. Finally there's also a cover gallery of the various variant covers that were produced.Identity Crisis in many ways is an even more important series than the namesake Crisis on Infinite Earths from the 1980's. While that series ultimately generated little change to the DC universe outside of the Death of Barry Allen, Identity Crisis is a story that could have lingering effects for years to come.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS!It's just all a bit much. Jean Loring, the Atom's ex-wife, brings a flamethrower to tea with Sue Dibney. And apparently it's a MAGIC flamethrower, because after the fact, Batman, the \\"World's Greatest Detective\\", and Superman, who can read the driver's license in your back pocket from the surface of the moon, can't find any traces of it. Green Arrow stabbing Deathstroke with an arrow instead of using his bow. I could go on, but there's too many stupidities to list. It just seems really lazy, like Meltzer went with the first draft where a rewrite could have done wonders.The underlying idea, that the superheroes used Zatanna's magic powers to erase the memories of supercriminals who had found out their secret identities, is actually pretty clever. As is the idea that not all the heroes were on board with the mind-wipe. It's the execution that is lacking.Meltzer apparently operates under the idea that \\"comic book\\" means stupid, and he can pull any illogical and irrational bull that he wants, because after all, when you're dealing with a world with Superman, doesn't any attempt at logic and common sense fly out the window with him?\\"A\\" to \\"Z\\" it's a good idea, but \\"A\\" to \\"B\\" to \\"C\\", there's a lot of howlingly stupid things in this book. This is actually in line with Meltzer's previous literary efforts, which rely heavily on unbelievable coincidence and slide right over logic quite a bit, so if you have read some of his previous books, you might not be surprised with the tricks he pulls here. Since there's a lot of people who are giving this five stars, not everybody stumbles over the dumbness in this book the way I do. If you can just grit your teeth and get over the idiocy of some of the plot points, I guess you might enjoy the artwork. That's the only thing that brings this book up from one star to two, for me."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Personally, if you have not read a comic book in a while, this isn't the one to start. It feels more like this book is trying to compete with the fact that \\"mature themed\\" books sell better. To me, it was an ok read, but it further drags characters we've grown up with into awkward situations and further abandons their true spirit. I understand the use of questioning the long established themes of superheroes, ie What happens when it gets personal, when villians attack your loved ones? or ie Does the ends justify the means? These questions are great themes, but I don't believe they are executed as well as they could be. This isn't even in an elseworlds story.*LIGHT SPOILER ALERT*This story really treats Batman and Superman like parent figures of these \\"lesser\\" JLA heroes. Not since Kingdom Come did we elevate Batman and Superman into such monarchy. But unlike Kingdom Come, I dreaded every scene with either Batman or Superman. It was so obvious that this story was not about them, they are not allowed to \\"solve\\" this one so easily. Furthermore, Dr.Light raping the wife of Elongated Man, it was just so awkward. It served no purpose but to jab us where it hurts, the topic of rape, its heavy no matter where it is found in media, and to use it in a comic book, you better know what you are doing and where you are taking it. But here, it goes really no where. Its just like the use of gore in movies, it unsettles you, but does little for the actually plot. Some may argue it is to illustrate the extreme instance that pushes the heroes to \\"alter\\" Dr.Lights personality. I don't buy that, personally, that is weak a plot device.Also, there are many loose ends, one of favorite being like why Batman never found out what his own teammates did to him. It is unbelieavable to me that Batman figures out everything, but he never figures out why the room goes quiet everytime JLA talks about mindwashing."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Title: Identity Crisis (HC)Publisher: DCWriter: Brad MeltzerArtist: Rags MoralesInks: Michael BairCollects: Identity Crisis Mini-series #1-7Price: $24.99So this is the critically-acclaimed, industry-shocking, media darling that everyone was talking about, huh? Well, I have to say I'm a little let down after al the hype. Just like the feeling I had walking out of the theatre after seeing Matrix Reloaded, I felt a bit disillusioned. This was supposed to be great! Fantastic! Ground-breaking and history-making! Well, not for me. Not to say it was bad, because it wasn't. It was pretty good. Great artwork? Check. Compelling storyline? Check. Controversial? Definitely. So what was missing here? I'm not quite sure, but this book just didn't wow me like it seemed to so many others.From my own web-forum-gleanings, it seemed to me that most people had a \\"loved-it\\" or \\"hated-it\\" reaction to this book. While I fell in the middle ground, I can certainly see both sides of the coin. Identity Crisis, for me, possessed qualities and component elements that I both liked and disliked. I'll share a few of both, starting with the easiest: the art. I've had other experiences with Rags Morales (mostly from old Valiant titles), but this newer work is definitely the best I've ever seen from him. He did a great job on the art chores, surpassing his former works in every respect. So, I must compliment him for his efforts. His action sequences, in particular, were leaps and bounds ahead of stuff I'd seen from him in the past. This guy draws a mean Deathstroke! Likewise, the inks and colors were superb. I've noticed a trend in current comics that I prefer the colorists working on DC books to the ones working in Marvel books. The colors in the book are done very, very well. The covers on the issues, drawn my fan-favorite Michael turner, are included here, too, and are (as usual) terrific.This was my first experience with many of these DC Universe villains, and I appreciated the opportunity to familiarize myself with them. I plan on buying Villains United (a follow-up to the events in this book) to see more of them in action. Having never known or read anything about the character of Dr. Light, I found him to be a very striking and interesting character. I'm sure DC has big plans for this character in future stories. I had also never read anything featuring the Elongated Man - a character that was shown here to be a dignified and just person, despite his ridiculously cheesy name. (Why is it that so many DC characters have such obscenely cheesy and childish names???) Meltzer turned me into a mild fan of this character despite his ludicrous moniker. That's a sign of a good writer.Morales truly DID do a good job with the characterization of his players in this book. When you can make third-stringers with bad handles interesting, you know you've done your job well. The story in this book is essentially a homicide investigation, and that made it interesting, as well. Like so many millions of Americans who watch CSI, I'm a fan of murder/criminal investigations, so the book drew me in, in that respect, as well. The story also contained situations of moral crisis that are so familiar in novels and movies. The characters have a dilemma of whether they should do what is morally correct and advocate the rights of an individual, or whether they should supersede the individual's rights in favor of doing what is best for the majority of the population. Decisions like this face leaders all the time, and the way the heroes of this story choose to proceed will lead to major ramifications down the line. This is just one of the reasons that the book was considered controversial.This leads me to my points of contention with this book. Like many people, I believe heroes should act as heroes and villains should act as villains. The lines in this book are blurred a bit, with heroes not always doing what is morally right. I think this is what made so many people upset with this book. They didn't like their heroes taking part in illicit activities and being deceptive to their colleagues. Certainly it is understandable that people would be upset with this. The other reason, of course, is the violent treatment of an innocent woman whom all the heroes are good friends with. Not only does Sue Dibny - the wife of the Elongated Man - get murdered by the unknown assailant, it is revealed that in the past she was raped by a well-know villain. (Sorry if I'm spoiling part of the storyline for you, but if you're at all up on any comic events, you probably heard news of this already!) I had a problem with this aspect of the story. While it was a key plot point that predicated later events in the story, I just don't think that mainstream comics are the place to include material of this nature. I don't care that everything was taking place \\"off camera.\\" There are other non-mainstream titles to include this sort of material in, and I'm really surprised that DC was OK with this. With the genie out of the bottle on this, I wonder if they will choose to include more and more violent acts in their comics. I know that this really turned off a lot of long-time comic fans, and this is no surprise to me. Certainly the editorial staff at DC recognized that this was going to be a consequence of telling this sort of story, so I guess they were OK with that, too. While controversial books tend to sell well and get a lot of media and word-of-mouth buzz, they often are just a \\"flash in the pan,\\" and the popularity is short-lived. While DC has shown quite a bit of market growth in the past two years and they have been open to publishing a broader range of material in their mainstream books, I can only think that the near future of DC's universe looks darker, and I don't find that appealing. These mainstream titles are primarily read by guys aged 15-30, but kids enjoy them too, and I don't like having a narrower selection of titles that are kid-friendly.While I think most adults will find this book interesting and worthy of note, it is definitely not for kids. The extras thrown in for this hardcover collection are pretty decent, too, so if you plan on purchasing this title, you'll probably want to get the hardcover version while it lasts. If you have only a passing interest in this story or in the DC universe, in general, you'll want to wait until you can get this book at the library or just borrow it from a friend. It's clear that this book alters the status quo of DC's primary characters, and that alone makes this book a bit more compelling. This book is not up to its hype and has some pretty contentious material in it, but it is a good mystery/crime drama with good characterization and long-lasting effects, so I can recommend it based on those points. This book definitely isn't for everyone, though.Writing: 8.5/10Artwork: 8.5/10Cool Factor: 4/10Overall: 7/10"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"I'm not hugely into comic books.

This someone has already killed the wife of Elongated Man, and several other family members may be targeted.There's some surprising depth to this story, and a very satisfactory resolution.

And the guy's only prior comic work was a monthly stint on Green Arrow.To be honest, I don't think I've ever seen a mainstream superhero series written with such emotional honesty besides Alan Moore's critically acclaimed Watchmen. From the ground up, Brad established an emotional tone in this book. The characters weren't afraid to speak from their hearts in this one and the dialogue showed that. Everything seemed very real, the superheroes reacted very realistically, dealt with struggles that even we face on a daily basis. I don't think there's another superhero comic that has touched the emotional depths that this comic series has.Identity Crisis is a real triumph in that regard, making us see the flesh and blood beneath even the toughest of skins, making us realize that even superheroes are human, flawed. And that's not all, it also makes us see how depraved a human heart can be, how often we take the easy way out by compromising our beliefs and how sometimes we can do nothing to help the brother beside us. The book moves from emotional height to depth constantly, never giving us even a moment's pause to catch our breaths. And that's a testament to Brad's brilliant pacing.When it comes to plotting, Brad's a genius. The book rarely got out of point, the story stayed very focused throughout, and I don't think I ever hit a point in that book where it got stale. The story's vibrant and the characters driving that story, the DCU heroes, were captivating and larger than life, as they should be. Needless to say, I think comic fanboys, even those who aren't very much into the DCU, will welcome the affection Brad has showered over the DCU characters. Which was why this book turned out so well; every page was created with love and respect for the heroes that have enthralled us so much during our younger days.But you know what's the most interesting thing about this book? It was that DC chose Identity Crisis to be a 'stepping board' for many of their future stories. Till now, we still see the effects of this book being felt in the current books, and that amazing. Brad wrote this book to be a quiet, standalone story.I haven't even begun to touch on the beauty of Rag Morales' art. To draw such a realistic and vibrant book isn't easy by any means, which speaks of just how much in tune both Rags and Brad were during the creative process of this book.So, go get this book now if you haven't. You would be crazy not to."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"When someone close to a JLA member is murdered - and as more family and friends are threatened and attacked - it becomes abundantly clear that there is a killer on the loose who knows the identities of all our heroes. Nerves begin to tense and relationships strain in the JLA ranks. A cabal including Hawkman, Green Arrow, Zatanna, Black Canary, and The Atom look to take matters into their own hands, as fear and tragedy mount and a a series of dark secrets long buried begin to surface.This is the basic plot of Identity Crisis; it's a promising premise, and Brad Meltzer makes the most of it - his meditations on the meaning and importance of secret identities, his ideas about the relationships among heroes and villains, and the nature of teams and teammates are all compelling and interesting. Indeed, his writing exudes a deep familiarity - you get the distinct feeling that these superheroes have a complex, muddy past, a history, and know each other intimately. Meltzer also does a good job of ratcheting up the anxiety and intensity - imagine a comic book where a whirlwind race against time actually feels as tense as a film.The book's chief failing, and what ultimately brings it down, is its ending. I won't spoil it for those still interested, but suffice it to say it does not, by any means, live up to the compelling writing that preceded it; it feels to me as though he just ran out of ideas. The ending is far too clean, far too easy, far too simplistic; indeed, it actually makes the story seem pointless, an afterthought, robbing it of any impact that it might have truly had. A disappointing turn of events."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"For fans of DC super-hero comic books, this is a \\"must read\\" comic.It helps if you have a love for certain characters in this book, and it helps more or less if you are a fan of DC's silver and bronze age more than the more modern age, I feel.The beginning is incredible. There are few scenes in comics more powerful than the viewing scene. I don't want to give any details to those who have not read this book or comic series, but you will be floored.The end, as others have said, is just this far from being a cheat. (I made a little \\"inch\\" motion with my forefinger and thumb as I typed that. All without a typo, too!)I can't help but think there was not a better way to end this book/story.Still, the ride is great and the art is some of DC's best.Still, it helps if you have some pe"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"When I first saw the promotional poster for \\"Identity Crisis,\\" a few years ago, the visual of the classic JLA roster (minus \`Green Lantern' Hal Jordan) in mourning as they surround a mysterious casket seemed like a perfect teaser for a superhero whodunit. Other than Batman's storylines, DC Comics had not attempted before a major murder mystery encompassing a vast array of heroes and villains. I became really excited about the concept. But who would be the ill-fated victim?It had to be someone expendable (at least for the foreseeable future). Could it be \`Green Lantern' Kyle Rayner, as he is inexplicably missing from the promo art? Or the Martian Manhunter (who is also missing from the poster)? Or \`Firestorm' Ronnie Raymond? Perhaps a sidekick? Or would it be a popular civilian character? My best guess was for Snapper Carr (the Silver Age JLA's teenage mascot, their version of Edd \`Kookie' Byrnes), and that DC Comics would briefly reintroduce this guy into modern continuity before killing him off so some long lost JLA secret could never be exposed. Sounds promising, I thought.As I discovered reading Brad Meltzer's engrossing mystery, I was only right about the deep, dark secret. Instead, like virtually all other readers, I was shocked to witness the brutal (and, yes, unnecessarily exploitative) murder of \`Elongated Man' Ralph Dibny's beloved wife, Sue, in their own home preparing for Ralph's birthday. The initial questions are: Who committed this diabolical crime? And, as in the classic \`locked room' mysteries of the genre, how could the killer have infiltrated the various high-tech devices the JLA installed to prevent such a tragedy from occurring?At Sue's funeral, a grieving Ralph Dibny angrily reminds his teammates that he knows who the cold-blooded assassin is: it's Dr. Light. Readers then experience a controversial flashback to the JLA satellite where years ago Sue was sexually attacked by this same villain before he is subdued. The repercussions of this attack force the League to make a fateful decision splintering the team: they choose to erase Light's mind (a magical lobotomy, so to speak). Batman vehemently objects, and a reluctant Zatanna is forced to erase his memory as well of their morally dubious actions. It is hinted that Dr. Light wouldn't be the last villain the League wind-wipes to protect their secret identities.From that point on, other JLA loved ones begin receiving death threats: the Atom's ex-wife, Jean Loring; Robin's father, Jack Drake; and even Superman's own Lois Lane. Whoever the killer is knows the secret identities of the Justice League and is targeting their families. To author Brad Meltzer's credit, he offers several credible suspects ranging from the washed-up Captain Boomerang (a classic Flash rogue), the vengeance-seeking Dr. Light, the ultimate assassin-for-hire: Deathstroke; the conniving Calculator, among others.The JLA, meanwhile, is going in blind circles attempting to locate the elusive killer by rousting every conceivable suspect they can find. During this time, several important events affecting future DC storylines come into play: the death of a popular League member from the 1980's; a less-than-subtle tease of the upcoming \\"Green Lantern: Rebirth\\" storyline; the mind-wiping of Batman; the JLA's vicious street fight with Deathstroke; the introduction of the new Captain Boomerang; and more material to be later explored in the DC mega-event, \\"Infinite Crisis.\\"Even the world's greatest detective, Batman, is nearly brought to his breaking point attempting to solve Sue's baffling murder, as more victims accumulate. Is there more than one assassin? Yet, as Batman points out, the end game of this story is this: \`Who benefits?'In its conclusion, Meltzer, unfortunately, opts to go with the clich&eacute;d \`mentally unstable' culprit whose motive seemingly comes out of nowhere. With all the intriguing sub-plots Meltzer gives, they become nothing more than red herrings, as the killer's illogical actions really don't make any sense when held up under critical scrutiny. I agree with another reviewer that, yes, Meltzer's story, intentionally or not, lifts a liberal dose from author Scott Turow's mystery thriller, \\"Presumed Innocent.\\" Ultimately, it's a disappointing solution for an otherwise superb and haunting mystery. Meltzer at least makes up for this glaring flaw with an appropriately poignant epilogue.As artists Rag Morales and Michael Turner provide fantastic artwork and covers supporting Brad Meltzer's efforts, I highly recommend this book (minus the implausible culprit) to both comic book fans and mystery lovers alike.Overall Story Rating: 4 ****Overall Art Rating: 5 *****Overall Rating: 4 **** (one point, unfortunately, must be deducted for the contrived solution and a few too many red herrings).Side Note: I also highly recommend the excellent sequel, \\"JLA: Crisis of Conscience,\\" by authors Geoff Johns and Allan Heinberg, which explores the JLA's violent implosion, as other secret mind-wipes are revealed to backfire on the League."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"This is an excellent graphic novel the story line is good and the art is great. Reading this will help your knowledge of the DC universe history."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"You get a strong story, great art and some of the cherished ideas of comics are re-worked.To quote the introduction by Joss Whedon, \\"it's unlikely that Elongated Man is your favorite-ever character. But halfway into issue one he was certainly mine. Brad and Rags paint a portait of a man - and a marriage - that is so unassumingly lovely, it's unbearable to think anything bad might happen to either. And inevitable that it will.\\"****Spoiler alert****Thank novelist Brad Meltzer for making you care and thank artist Rags Morales for making you feel the pain of Elongated Man's loss on page 31 (even now, I just glanced at THE page and I felt it all over again).Meltzer re-works some of the bad guys and makes them truly awful. Why shouldn't they be. Regular villains stalk, kill, rape, maim and torture. Shouldn't super villains do even more of that? To combat that, the super heroes are not morally upright in all of their actions. They are after all, human (except for a few of them). They are scared for their families, friends and loved ones that cannot defend themselves against freaks with a funny suit and a good search engine. The scene in which Batman and Robin (Tim Drake) rush to save Robin's father (p. 170) illustrates this fear and is great only because of the art - the art tells the story better than paragraphs of text would. But, the text does add something - Batman says only two words: \\"Not again...\\" as he mashes the Batmobile's pedal to the floor. We all know what the orphaned Caped Crusader's motivations are. On page 182 the art is equally compelling. You can see the horror in Robin's eyes with Batman assuming an unusual compassionate role - cradling Robin and saying, \\"...I've got you...\\" The accompanying narration notes \\"Batman and Robin. Orphans.\\"I give it 4 stars out of 5 simply because I did not like the Whodunit of the whole mystery. It seemed odd and random, but then again lots of life is odd and random so maybe I'm overly critical."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Identity Crisis (DC Comics)this comic makes you fundementally change the way you view the characters and their lives.it shows their complete flaws and humanity in a disturbingly real light.what people do for love and to protect those they love.and the 'true' villian of this story will shock you."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"I rather enjoyed this, in spite of an ending which I found to be a little weak. This particular focuses mainly on some of the JLA's secondary characters. Though I knew who they were I had never really read any stores that had focused on them, and enjoyed this one (I particularly enjoyed the Green Arrow who I never really cared about before). Though this is hardly the deconstruction of the superhero mythos on the level of something like Watchmen, but it does (in my opinion) show some of the DC characters in a different light than you've seen them in in the past. This isn't for everyone though some people might find it too dark or violent. But then again some people are wusses. A highlight for me was the fight against Deathstroke. I also really liked the art workThere were two things I didn't like, be warned they are spoilers. The first one is Dr. Light. I mean really? Dr. Light? He's lame and we all know it. Reconning and saying the tried to change his personality and that is why he is \`stupid' now? I'm sorry that just isn't good enough for me. You can do better guys. Secondly, and more seriously the real villain of the story (Jean Loring) is kind of lame. On the one hand it is a surprise and certainly is nice to have it be someone unexpected. But the reasoning behind it was, well stupid. To be fair people who are insane don't always do things that make sense. However, it's reviled she did all this to get back with her ex-husband Ray Palmer, except that she is the one of left him. So I'm not really sure why she went to all this trouble. This doesn't even account for how she was able to navigate through the human body to get to a spot to cut off blood flow to the brain, or how she could breathe in the blood stream. But other wise I found this very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"My problem with Identity Crisis is that Brad Meltzer doesn't have much experience with comics, and it shows. While the story is commendable, the execution wasn't. The strength of Identity Crisis is the writing, with the art having to make major adjustments.To me, comics is about the balance between text and image. If the writing is the star, why have a comic book in the first place? Sure, it's about DC's properties, but superhero stories aren't limited to comics.Now there are those who didn't like the \\"big reveal\\" of this book's climax. And I'm one of them. I felt I was duped. I should've given this book two stars, but I appreciate the process--the events that led to the climax. And Rags Morales tried to make the book visually interesting."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"There are people who aren't quite ready to deal with the realities of the human condition. Those people will be better off passing over this book.However, if you do have a strong head and heart, and are ready for your comic book characters to appear a bit more human, come on in. This book is a heck of an emotional ride. I'll admit that the brutality of some of the acts in the story were very unsettling to me, but that's what Super heroes would have to deal with most of their lives. Seeing the violence touch their own familes is going to bring out some complex and disturbing thoughts and emotions. However, Brad Meltzer handles the events with the utmost care and we are presented with a much more human side to the people who are supposed to be 'super-human.'I for one was glad for the honest approach that Meltzer took with this story. I was also wracking my brain to figure out how the crimes where commited, and I have to admit that the final answer was a revelation to me. Again, Batman wins the right to be called the world's greatest detective.You may never look at your heroes the same, but don't forget that they are human too. I guess the fact that I know how I would react to a situation like this in my own family gives me the ability to sympathize with the characters of this story.Oh, and I'd give this 6 stars too, for Rags Morales great artwork. I kept feeling like all of the characters looked familiar, and then I read his cast of characters appendix. Great work!"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Brad Meltzer said he wrote this collected seven-issue miniseries as a \\"love letter\\" to Silver Age DC Comics, and the result is a very beautifully detailed and highly powerful account of the Justice League's involvement in solving the murder of the beloved wife of one of its members, the Elongated Man. The fan reaction to the product has been enormously mixed, and I would have to echo it: although the finished product is beautiful, no one really wanted to see Sue Dibny (the murder victim) killed, given that she was one of the few Silver Age supporting characters still left around anyway, and that her murderer is unveiled as one of the few remaining others. The loss of these two characters seems almost willfully melodramatic, as does Meltzer's habit of wildly overdramatizing (even by comic book standards) every revelation or confrontation in the book. Still, the art by Rags Morales is splendid, and the coloring work by Alex Sinclair is nothing short of sensational, adding much to Morales's beautiful linework. Some of the sequences are so beautifully done by this team that they carry almost all before it: of special note are Sue's memorial service in the Central City Cathedral, the flashback to Sue's rape, and the creepy haunting scene of the villains gathered in the decaying empty satellite. Notice, though, that I say \\"almost all\\": the biggest faults of this miniseries (other than the needless loss of the two characters) are in the plotting, and it has an incredible number of holes in it which almost defy explanation. Why couldn't the world's greatest detectives solve this murder faster given their command in this miniseries of so many sophisticated alien technologies? How can the Atom perform his \\"phone trick\\" through cell phones when it has always been dependent on moving through actual phone wires? Why did the murderer (who has twice had nervous breakdowns before in comics history) go suddenly from being simply neurotic and unhappy for over forty years to suddenly being in this miniseries a psychotic murderer? Why was the murder plot and the revelation of it stolen almost entirely from Scott Turow's PRESUMED INNOCENT? And why would the murderer be placed finally in the world's worst and most dangerous insane asylum (in a different city entirely from where she lives or from where she committed the crime) if her partner truly cared for her? And why was she just happening to be carrying that flamethrower, anyway?"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Trashing long-time characters wearies me. I won't divulge any key plot elements, but the solution to the mystery is such a stretch, it reminds me of when writers were commanded to have Alfred rise from the dead and be revealed as \\"The Outsider\\", way back in the early days of the \\"new-look\\" Batman. E.g., at one point, Hal Jordan, another DC character they keep re-trashing, who knows who the killer is since he's now the Spectre (whew!), tells Green Arrow to really punish said killer when they uncover him/her. Well, when you find out who the killer is, you'll realize that Hal would never have said that. Any rate, the motive for the murder is so convoluted, all I can say is, DC should let the pros (Frank Miller, Alan Moore, Keith Giffin) write these epics. And enough with killing and defiling the memories of long-time characters!"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"A darker view of comics and not for children or teens.Many plots circle around murder, psychosis, brain-wipes, and the absolute authority to make decisions. DC has moved from the safe superhero (who are morally justified) into an area where there is little to distinguish their actions from the bag guys. No longer is it good guys against bad guys. This is a real good example of how once cherished absolute ideas of our youth have been subverted into shades of grey to shock the new generation. I see these issues reflected in society, politics and the nightly news. I don't need to see them in my lighthearted 'pleasure' readings. Wasted my money on this item. Calvin and Hobbes would have been a better buy."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"I grew up reading comics and my interests have waxed and waned until I only bought DC Comics. Well I'm not buying them anymore because of Identity Crisis - a story that stinks. This story stinks because Barry Allen, the second Flash, was the deciding vote to mindwipe Dr. Light and then other villains. This is not what Barry would have done in the old days because when the Reverse Flash murdered his wife Iris (although her parents transplanted her mind into another body), he did not kill him then. He killed him later, but he agonized about it what he did and he was found not guilty. Under any circumstance, Barry would not have voted to mindwipe any villain and the fact that later he mindwiped the Top into a do-gooder who mindwiped other villains, including the Trickster not only makes Barry and the other Justice Leaguers who mindwiped villains no better than the villains themselves and also undercuts the Trickster's earnest efforts to reform not only so that he doesn't meet the demon Neron in Hell, but also undercuts his relation with his son.Another piece of bad writing was having not only Jean Loring be Sue's killer, but also have her be insane. Sorry, but the insane Jean Loring plot has already been done twice - once in the sixties and once in the seventies - so why do it again.Further, I don't think the JSA will want to team up with the JLA anymore when they find out what happened and I've alwayslooked forward to JLA-JSA teamups, nor were any of the deaths in IC necessary. Overall, this is a story that DC should have looked at in great detail and rejected as utterly stupid, but then, DC has done this in the past after Crisis On Infinite Earths with continuity-screwing stories like Hawkworld which led to Zero Hour and now they've done it again.I have been castigated for my views on this before and I don't care because DC has put out a stinker of a story that has turned me off completely and I refuse to buy any more of their comics."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"This pretentious and sorry excuse of a graphic novel should be relegated to the rubbish heap where it belongs. It heralds DC Comic's year-long spiral into a miasma of grim-and-grittiness not seen in the comics industry since the 1980s, and does so in such an clumsy manner it deserves all the contempt it received from many comic fans. Brad Meltzer may fancy himself a hotshot bestselling author, but Identity Crisis shows him up for what he truly is - a hack writer unafraid to use gratuitous and misogynistic violence and death in the place of intelligent story-telling. Since Identity Crisis is so bad, I will have no qualms about revealing major plot points in this review. Readers, beware. Avoid reading further if you do not want any spoilers. Identity Crisis begins with a murder - Sue Dibny, beloved wife of Ralph Dibny, the Elongated Man, is brutally murdered in their home. The murderer seemingly got into the house despite an impenetrable web of high-tech security devices of both Earthly and alien origins. Furniture had been trashed and the body of Sue badly burnt. The Justice League immediately assembles a forensics team of their top scientists to study the crime scene for clues. A small cadre of Justice League members (Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman, Green Arrow, the Atom, Black Canary and Zatanna) suspects that the villainous Dr Light might be the perpetrator - Dr Light's powers include the ability to teleport and to generate intense light and heat, and he apparently teleported into the Justice League satellite and brutally raped Sue under similar circumstances years ago. Zatanna wiped the memory of the rape from Sue's mind to spare her the trauma, and then proceeded to lobotomize Dr Light, turning his evil villainy into harmless incompetence. Apparently the gang had been mind-wiping villains and keeping it secret from other Justice League members like Superman and the Batman who would have disapproved of such extreme measures. Caught by the Batman in the act of lobotomizing Dr Light, the group panicked and mind-wiped the Batman as well. Have secrets of years gone by finally come back to haunt the Justice League? While the above synopsis may sound like the beginnings of a tantalising mystery, don't let that fool you. Identity Crisis is so full of continuity errors, inconsistencies, plot-holes, red herrings and bad characterisation that had it been a novel, it would have been roundly trashed by any self-respecting book critic. Fortunately, it is merely a graphic novel, and everyone knows comic book readers can't be very intelligent or discerning, right? For example, Meltzer would have us believe that the top scientists in the Justice League would be stupid enough not to detect the chemical residue of a flame-thrower, the weapon that was actually used to burn Sue's body after her death. Instead, they flail around ineffectively looking for potential suspects with fire or heat powers. Just what sort of idiots are they? The Batman is supposed to be the world's greatest detective, for God's sake. Another example - faced with a cold-blooded murderer who can seemingly teleport into an ultra-secure facility, what does the Atom do? Give his wife a crossbow for her own protection. Hello? Never heard of a gun? And does everybody in the DC Universe and their grandmothers know the true identity of Robin? The same Robin who did not reveal his true identity to his own father and his closest friends for years? And need I even mention the tiny footprints of death? You have to read it to believe it - how the Justice League finally finds out who was responsible for Sue's murder is so inane I felt unclean after reading the last issue of the mini-series. My advice - if you must read it, borrow it from a friend or from the library, or read it in a comic shop. Don't waste your money on this collection. One star, and that's only because I can't go any lower than that on Amazon."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Many successful adult fiction authors try their hand at writing children's books. Some such as Dean Koontz with books such as Santa's Twin do it very well. Others such as James Patterson with Santa Kid fail miserably. Brad Meltzer who has conquered the thriller fiction market has also tried his hand at this genre with Identity Crisis.Actually I ordered this book from my library thinking it would be another thick Meltzer masterpiece novel like his sensational The First Council, The Tenth Justice and Dead Even. So I was a bit surprised when Meltzer's next piece of work turned out to be a comic book. It is not a bad read and all the big superheros are here together in the one book. To be honest comic books are not my thing, so maybe pay more attention to the ratings of regular readers of that genre, but I can realise quality when I see it. If I was looking for a gift for a kid or an adult who never grew out of comics then this would be at the top of my list."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"So Batman erased the memories of a few people, big deal! The JLA makes it into a huge issue paramount to a far greater wrong, if indeed it was wrong to begin with. I'm collecting a few (okay, more than a few) comics for my son, and I find a rape of all things in these pages. The purpetrator of said rape is one Dr. Light, who is able to generate high temperatures through his skin. The panel in question shows only his hands burning those of the victim; aparently not someone that you want to be raped by.Why is there a rape in a comic book?

Very impressed with the quality of the art work and the depth of the story."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"I'm really, really new at the comic scene. I've just recently begun reading comic books - I haven't even read them when I was younger. So one of the things that's really hard, when reading comic books, is to wonder whether you'll be confused out of your mind. I have to say, this is a great place to start for new readers and also old readers (obviously).Identity Crisis takes a look at our heroes who wear a mask, and who they are without it. I actually cried at a couple of parts, and when the wife of Elongated Man dies, it just breaks your heart. I didn't even know who he was, but just within a couple of pages, your heart goes out for him and you start to really wish the impossible (since you already know the outcome). And that wasn't even the end of my tears. There are more heartbreaking moments in the comics and when you find out who actually did it (I was guessing until the very end) you're just as surprised as the Justice League.What's great is that so many superheroes make appearances (not just from the Justice League, but from other superhero groups and even a couple villain groups) and it isn't confusing at all. I loved the interactions between the superheroes because you could really tell that they had been in each other's shoes before and how close some of those bonds are, even if they don't know each other on a personal level.The events are fairly direct, and the art also really moves the story along. The expressions - Ray's expression - was just amazing.Another note is that I felt like Batman was almost the center of attention, maybe not exactly the center of attention, but that's where your eyes kept wandering off towards."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"This was an amazing story, with an amazing cast. It was my first time reading Meltzer's work. He didn't disappoint at all. So much emotion was poured out onto these pages. I love Geoff Johns, but this was a different kind of writing. This was more poetic, packed with just straight up (oh my god I'm going to say it) swag. The bonus material with casting and analysis of moments was fun to read. I really want to read one of his books now. Just get this book. It's a classic."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Believe when I say this miniseries has earned to right to be developed as an animated film. I became interested in the comic-book world because of Identity Crisis a few years ago while I was on my Digital Animation major. It was a boring day in the university so I decided to spend some money in anything from the bookstore. First thing that got my attention was the front page of issue #1. Sad superheroes next to a coffin was something I had never seen so I took 2 or 3 issues. Back home I read all of them but ended up desperate to know who the killer was. On the next days I was first in line waiting for the new issues.Well now let me say why this series is so good. Both the story and art are great!! I took a class for writing screenplays so once I started reading these comic books I was immediately caught INSIDE the story, I could feel like I was WATCHING it, not reading it. The way they managed to present every scene, was awesome. Another great thing about this, was that I was new to DC comics. I knew about the main characters but the only comic books I had by that time where the Star Wars Tales series.Now, I didn't have any problem going through this characters because you would get a brief description of each one while you go from page to another. Again THIS WAS what made me feel like I was WATCHING this story. The characters are already established, there are no origin stories, things just go on a fast track since the first page. All characters from the DC universe have a role in the story. And what is great about it is the arc. Ralph Dibny seems to be a very nice guy who is overall happy with his life, yes I'm sure he has the same problems and issues as any adult person but things change after tragedy comes to pay a visit.Every character is now worried about their relatives and you get to see a side that is a bit unusual in comic books. You get to see great action sequences but again, this is not a saving-the-day story, the scope is HUUUUGE: solving a mystery, running against time, it is a lot like an thriller-action-mystery film. All characters are driven to find out who is the killer and then BANG!!! Something happened in the past, something dark, some memory wiping and some serious adult stuff.I am not getting into details because it would take me forever. But lets say that the story is great, works perfect for a 7-issue but that is not all. Identity Crisis could work as a solo animated-film but don't think this is the end. This is just the first step of something bigger. A lot of subsequent stories take of from here, like 52, Countdown to Infinite Crisis, Infinite Crisis and Final Crisis.After seeing all of the DC animated movies I must say that there are a few who are as good as the comic books. Of course it is hard to put all those pages in a 60-minute animation, I know about that since Animation is my major. Well, so far my favorites are Batman Under the Red Hood and Superman/Batman: Apocalypse. I wish DC animated films could give us more things like these two in terms of style, color palette and story, which is always the biggest issue. Trust me when I say I would love to see Identity Crisis getting the animation treatment, it could be a 2-hour film and I can assure them that fans would want to see more.If this is not enough to convince you let me tell you this. A friend of mine who likes to read about greek mythology, novels, and Saint Seiya came one day to my place and took Green Lantern Rebirth. He liked that one. Next time he asked me what should he take home to read. I told him: take those 7 issues over there, Identity Crisis, you are going to love them, they look like just like a movie. What happened next? He ended up reading all 7 issues overnight, hahaha!!Hope this review helps you, again this is my opinion on why this is a great story for any comic book reader and why it should get the animation treatment."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"This is the Graphic Novel that brought me back to the Comic World. I am not kidding, I stopped reading comics several years ago, and then I heard a lot of fuss regarding Identity Crisis, so it got me curious. Let me just said that this is a perfect graphic novel, great art and storyline, amazing development of the characters and a plot so unpredictable that one cannot stop reading it until the end. If there is a story that deserves to be remembered as one of the highlights in Comics history, this is the one."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Brad Meltzer along with Rags Morales and Michael Bair have created a brilliant Justice League mystery for the ages.Art is a solid 5 out of 5 stars. No question. Morales has the sensibility of another DC heavyweight, Brian Bolland, and the storytelling ability of a Neal Adams or John Byrne. Clean Bolland lines on the inks, solid blacks, great expressions and characterizations.Spoiler-free story review. Meltzer ties the Justice League and Justice Society into a long form mystery involving the murder of the Elongated Man's wife. Third act climax and twist rivals Conan Doyle or Christie. This is frequently on the top ten lists of the last decade and I would concur.Knowledge of the DC universe is not required, some basic knowledge of the League is helpful. Tim Drake is Robin under Batman at this time, and Wally West is the current Flash.Recommended if you like: Watchmen, Jack & Bobby (TV), Blackest Night, V for Vendetta, Murder She Wrote, V for Vendetta, Sin City, Animal Man, Arkham Asylum."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"If you want to see your comics all grown up I recommend this book. It is going to change how you feel about the whole genre. It is an adult tale with moral questions and attitudes. It shows what can be done when publishers set free writers and artists.Both writing and art are greatThis is the book that started a whirlwind of controversy. People loved it for it new fresh take on the superhero world and how it can be undone by one tradgedy.Others thought it to mean spirited and made villans more evil than they were in the past. I can see both perspectives, I however embrace change and feel that the book is just a step into the new comic universe being built.As you can tell I do not want to give away anything of this book. I will close by writing how if you read comics this is a must read. If you have never read a comic please pick this one up it is worth it."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"I wanted to read this immediately after reading just a brief plot description of it. Someone is killing the loved ones of superheroes and they must be stopped before another life is lost. But then I read some reviews online and shied away as it seemed while many people seemed to like it those that didn't, absolutely hated it. After finally reading it I found myself somewhere in between.Like I mentioned, the premise is terrific. It opens with Sue Dibny, wife of the Elongated Man, being tragically murdered and a manhunt for her killer beginning. Shortly after that however, the story starts to go off the rails and is kind of a wreck by the end of it. I don't want to give away major plot points, but personally I thought the ending and reveal of the killer was a major cop-out.I could see how long-time comic fans could be turned off by certain things that happen as some of them seem wildly out of character, however since my comic background is far from complete, I can let some of them slide. I do think that Meltzer tries too hard sometimes to make things seem super important and serious and instead they come off as cliche. One major positive though is his writing of Green Arrow and Deathstroke, two characters I wanted to read more or by the time I was finished.Overall, I would still recommend reading this comic, as its events do come into play later in other works. However I would try going into it with as little as expectations as possible, otherwise you are just bound to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"This is the best you'll get from the modern era of DC Comics. Honestly, you could jump right into that universe with this book and need zero introduction to enjoy the story... which is saying a lot considering it deals in a lot of relatively \\"obscure\\" superheroes and supervillains. The action within the story is exciting enough, particularly the fight between the Justice League and Deathstroke in the first half.Although this has no real reflection on the book itself, I will say that the effect this story had on the DC Universe was atrocious... something best left forgotten. Not in the way that \\"Reign of the Supermen\\" responded to the \\"Death of Superman\\".... no one returns from the grave, but there is a lot of focus on the Justice League's trust breaking down because of what goes on in this book. An idea that went a bit too far, with smaller stories trying to garner attention by riding the coattails of \\"Identity Crisis\\".Most people seem to think that the events surrounding Sue and Ralph Dibny are what make this such an effective shocker of an event... but I disagree. There's a lot of humanity that goes into this, some real emotions and responses mixed with the colorful backdrop of the superhero universe, but it is handled with great care and attention. I particularly like Tim Drake's role.Do yourself a favor and pick this up."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"This graphic novel really blew me away! I went into it with no real expectations other than the fact that Joss Whedon did the introduction and I am a big lover of Joss Whedon (not in the \\"He's my lover!\\" way but I love his work). Anyway, as a Marvel guy (and trash me now, I know) I really wasn't sure if DC mainstream story lines could get into the nitty-gritty like Marvel lines can. Man, was I wrong! Wow, did Meltzer deliver! Wow, is this an awesome comic book!For the longest time, if I was a fan of any DC character, it was Batman. Supes just never did it for me. Too Boy Scout for my tastes. But comics like this and the recent All Star Superman have been changing my mind. Add into that Green Arrow (wow, does this guy kick a$$), Elongated Man (thought he was going to be a Plastic Man knock-off - wrong again!), Zantana (what a babe), and all the rest and damn this was an amazing cast of characters. God, Tim Drake was amazing. I was reading Batman when Tim became Robin (Bregfoyle rules!) but he was never as dynamic and cool as this.I've been staying away from all the Infinity Crisis stuff but maybe I was wrong to do so. Maybe DC Comics is capable of even more in-depth, character-changing writing than I thought they were. I used to say Make Mine Marvel. Maybe I'm a little wrong..."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"As a kid, I was into comic books big time. Every week I blew my entire allowance on comics...both Marvel and DC. Over time, it became too hard for me to continue collecting (part of which I blame on DC's lackluster performance in the late 90s and Marvel's super over-kill of X-titles)...and while I love comics, I eventually fell out of it all.Ocasionally, I drop in to the local comic shops to pick up some trade paper backs... Garth Ennis' Punisher and Preacher primarily my main vices, along w/ titles like Kingdom Come, Sin City and The Dark Knight Returns Pt 2.Last week, I made the occasional trip to the comic store. The friendly clerk at the store happened to pass by and asked if I needed any help. Intimidated by the wall of new comics in front of me, I told him how I've become a casual reader, and how daunting all these new titles and the fear of trying to jump into continuities that I know nothing about, was hounding me. This clerk was passionate about comics, and began to tell me about the 2 current major events: House of M (Marvel) and Infinite Crisis (DC). His synopsis of these titles, and the energetic spark that flowed in his words had me hooked. His passion rubbed off on me, and it made me want to read these titles. He told me if I wanted to read Inifinte Crisis, I should start with Identity Crisis, and follow through with the Countdown to Infinite Crisis books. I bought both Idenity Crisis and the OMAC Prjoect right there and then.Having finished both books, I can say this: I want to collect comic books again.Identity Crisis has injected a new twist, a new outlook on the DC Universe that has me begging for more. I won't go into a synopsis, or my opinions on the writing or art work. You can read other member's reviews for that.The new DCU is rife with re-evaluated relationships...where B and C level superheroes are looked down upon by A list heroes, just as fans see them. Where trust has been broken between heroes... where paranoia and friction exist. A new unvierse where everyone, even the immortal Superman, is vulnerable. The world, the real world, is not perfect. The new DCU reflects this...showing that not all the heroes are so chummy all the time. And rather than 're-invent' the silver age of DC... it's used and remembered just as how the events happened, but revelations of what occured behind the scenes throw an interesting twist and new outlook of those light-hearted and sometimes goofy stories.Identity Crisis is the perfect jumping point into this new, dynamic universe. I see it like this: Battlestar Galactica fans are upset over the latest re-invention of the series...while noobs like me are hooked on each and every episode of the new series. Watch an old episode of Battlestar, and it's damn cheesy. Watch a new episode, and it's intense and gritty. Give me new any day. Screw tradition.Even if you have no intention of reading Infinite Crisis, Identity Crisis is a self-contained mystery that will satisfy you when you finish that last page. You don't have to read anymore after that if you don't want to...it's only the sub-plot elements from this book that continue into Infinite Crisis.For the long-term fans who are dis-satisfied with what DC is doing to it's heroes...perhaps you should do as I had 10 years ago...and quit. Then maybe, in 10 years, you will find something new that excites you, and like me, will be drawn back in."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Identity Crisis was horrible. And I don't mean the quality, I mean it was appalling. The critics who liked this story would have you believe that this story makes superheroes more human, which is what they said about Watchmen. I've read Watchmen, and Identity Crisis isn't even close. It doesn't deconstruck superheroes, it destroys them utterly. It is violent and negative, and there isn't one redeeming quality given to any character, so there isn't one redeeming quality to the entire book.If, like me, you read any DC books in 2005, then even if you didn't read Identity Crisis, you probably have some idea of what happened. So this will contain spoilers for anyone who hasn't heard of this before.It begins with the death of Sue Dibny, the wife of Ralph Dibny, the Elongated Man. Neither character has been making appearances of late, but the Elongated Man was a member of at least two versions of the Justice League, and Sue was always right there with him. The Dibny's were a rarity when I started reading comics. A superhero was married, and his identity was public. Sue was the heart of the team, keeping them down-to-earth.Sue Dibny was what made the team more human.Writers often kill off the main characters' love interest because they think it makes the character more vulnerable, or just as a way of shaking things up: The love interest is expendable, the hero is not. To my mind this makes the hero less human. Now they're back to being a superhero because of noble reasons, abstract reasons like \\"doing what's right\\" which is hard to pull off in this cynical society. But saving the world because you have loved ones living on said world makes a lot more sense to the average person.Then, in a flashback sequence, it's revealed that the old Justice League villain Dr. Light had raped Sue Dibny. So not only did they (the creative team) kill the person who used to be the heart and soul of the team, they raped her too.This starts a cascade effect in which it's revealed that B-List members of the Justice League tried to use Zatanna's magic to restructure the personalities of villains, to change their behavior. Green Arrow shows obvious signs of guilt over what \\"had to be done\\" but they just kept violating people's minds arbitrarily, the way a villain would. It turns out this is why, when a villain first show up they're a threat, but after they keep getting beaten time after time for ten years, the villain is a joke.The mystery continues, another hero's family member dies, a lot of side characters are introduced and followed who add absolutley nothing to the story other than taking up space.In the end the mystery is solved, and it turns out it wasn't a mind-altered villain at all! So the whole revelation about the heroes' mind altering spells had nothing to do with the actual story of who killed Sue Dibny! And the reason why the person did what they did was the absolute lamest excuse I've ever heared in any murder mystery. EVER!!!Oh, and the technique writer Brad Meltzer used to hide who the villain was through the piece . . . Jeph Loeb already used it twice, in Batman: the Long Halloween, and in Batman: Hush. And it's not like he was the first to use it either.At the end of the story the heroes have been knocked down more pegs than I can count. The revelations get worse and worse, making them look less and less heroic, and less and less like people with a sense of morality. And there are no redeeming features. There's nothing in the story to make you feel like the members of that Justice League team are anything other than power-mad scum.There are no heroes, everyone's a bad person, the end."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"DC Comics' Identity Crisis has been acclaimed by critics and fans. The rationale for its success can be attributed to the following main reasons;1) an engrossing plot line that is skilfully written2) beautiful art work3) a gripping story that has impact on the charactersThis is why Identity Crisis will also be considered a standard twenty years from now.The pacing is over-the-top while the passion of the characters is felt with emotions running high in their search for the culprit(s). Meltzer makes us care about Elongated Man's pain, Robin's intense reaction to his inability in rescuing the most important person of his life as well as The Atom's poignant reaction towards the murderer.While the script contains strong elements, it is Meltzer's ability to manipulate the reader with the heroes and villains' characterization that makes him capture our imagination. After battering our senses with death and tragedy, Meltzer hits it out of the ballpark with the final act. Life and the human sprit endure for our heroes despite the loss of their loved ones. They all come to terms with it in their own time and manner with the aftermath of the situation. The interaction between Superman and his mother, Nightwing attempting to reach out to Robin in his hour of need or Elongated Man coping with his grief gives the story the proper closure that makes this series an instant classic.A powerful script does not make a great comic. There........I said it and am glad that I did because it is the truth point blank. Many argue that visual is not important or secondary to which I have to wonder why they bother with comic books instead of a novel in the first place. While Meltzer's ability as a comic book writer is the revelation, it is Rags Morales' artwork for Identity Crisis that has now propelled him as one of the top tier pencillers of the industry. With inspired styling from the likes of Neal Adams and John Buscema, Morales has developed his own that breathes life and authenticity to the characters. Every range of the human expression is to be found here and his realistic rendering is as much to be credited for the series' success as Meltzer's writing.The events that transpire within the story leaves a permanent mark in the DC Universe and have consequences for years to come. Identity Crisis is the best super-hero saga since the cancellation of James Robinson and Tony Harris' Starman. This is not about the fancy costumes or gimmicks but rather the brave men and women who wear them. Specifically, the possible dangers, consequences and regrets that await for committing themselves to be noble with their gifts.Review by Brian Grindrod"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"This is probably a work best enjoyed by readers with a casual acquaintance with the characters and history of the DC Universe. Total neophytes, for instance, would likely be wondering who Zatanna, Dr. Light, Firestorm, the Calculator, and Deathstroke are. Longtime fans will know all the nuances of the backstories of every hero and villain, all the way through all of the revisions, reboots, retcons, and assorted Crises, and they may find the treatment of some of the protagonists to be clumsy, illogical, or even a betrayal of their characters. So if you have enough of a grounding to know who all of these costumed men and women are without being able to name the issue numbers of their first appearances, you're probably the best target audience.In origin, the story seems to have blossomed from Meltzer's musing about how the superheroes have been able to keep their civilian identities hidden for so many years. It's been shown on a number of occasions that assorted criminal scum have figured out who they are, and yet nothing ever seems to come of that knowledge. To this germ of an idea he adds two additional speculations: why are Zatanna and Dr. Light so ineffective? The former is the leading sorceress of the DCU and she can accomplish practically anything just by willing it to be so (and speaking her commands sdrawkcab). And Dr. Light should be far more powerful, but he's regularly been a punching bag for the Teen Titans and is one of the jokes of the supervillain community. (And, perhaps not coincidentally, another infamous joke of the fraternity of evildoers, Captain Boomerang, plays a major role in this tale.)From his speculations, Meltzer puts together a tale in which the heroes have to face a major issue: how far do you go to protect your loved ones from vengeance? What if your ideals and ethics are in direct contradiction to your need to safeguard your family? What rights do vile homicidal criminal scum have? And what happens if your own colleagues take a stand against your efforts? There are no clear-cut right answers. But it's certain that the consequences of decisions made years ago in secret by a minority of the League of Superheroes begin to reverberate in the present of this tale, and indeed are even now currently playing out across the DCU, most lately in the just-launched Infinite Crisis.This is a well-told tale with a number of twists and reversals and revelations, and it gives leading roles to two lesser lights of the DC world, the Atom (who, subsequent to this story, is on semi-permanent hiatus) and the Elongated Man, plus very significant screen time to DC's social conscience, Green Arrow. There are also recurring cameos from the Calculator, Merlyn, and various B-grade villains. (And on the do-gooder side, we even see Firehawk, Animal Man, and the Metal Men.) The set piece battle with Deathstroke is extremely well done and (arguably) makes sense, given his ability and the fact that he spends his time sitting around thinking of nothing else other than how to defeat them with a thousand contingency tactics. The art and coloring are excellent, particularly Sue Dibny's funeral scene.Ultimately, if you think too much about it, there are some serious structural and logical problems, particularly in the events following the climax, and a number of \\"But why didn't Captain So-And-So do this?\\" moments. And, given that the story jumps back and forth across a span of years, there are inevitable continuity problems involving certain characters who had retroactively been written out of one or another incarnation of the League. And the actual denouement doesn't quite play out right, to my way of thinking. It involves a cliched slip of the tongue on the part of the villain, and is dropped in so leadenly that it's as if the antagonist simply wanted to be caught.Bonus material for this volume includes a forward by Joss Whedon, alternate covers from the second, third, and fourth printing of the original issues, and commentary at the end by the creative team on what they were trying to do, how they did it, and what their favorite parts were."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Idenity Crisis gets its name from a time in the JLA past as concxeived by Meltzer whan a group of super villians successfully discovered the idenities behind several members superhero roles and Zatanna used a mind wwipe to magically remove that knowledge.This comes up two other more signifciant times in the book and is used as the focal point of the books plot Someone kills Sue Dibny wife of the elongated man and that someone knows the JLA idenities. The chief suspect is a villian who was mindwiped and who had raped Sue and the assumption is that the mindwipe had worn off. I wont go much further except that besides the dubiousness of a rape scene in a comic book the execution of what could have been a compelling premise is shaky and the ending is awful.Plus Meltzer has to make Superman and Batman less than what they are in order to draw out the story.Rags Morales is really good; some of his best work and that makes it three stars and a marginal recommendation if you are a fan of his work like me. If not you might want to skip this one"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"It started with such hope, and some powerful emotion. The \\"secret\\" some of the characters hold was interesting from a story point of view, but the actual facts in evidence are rather cheesy. As for the murderer being revealed along with the method? Well, that came close to ruining the story for me. Still, a great read with some great moments."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"This truly is a great book. Whether you are a big comic book fan or just a fan of mysteries that this book is for you. The plot is great and it is told mostly from the point of view of the Green Arrow. This was a unique way to tel it, in my opinion because we don't hear too much about him in major graphic novels. Read it and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"I absolutely loved this book - thought the story was engrossing and the art work was sharp and compelling. Identity Crisi was the first I had read by Brad Meltzer, and as recommendations go, you couldn't get a better one.This Who-dunnit style story is told from the point of view of many different characters, not all heroes, and gives a broader, more intimate perspective on the life of a superhero. My personal favourite is Green Arrow, and the scenes where he is explaining some of the harsh realities faced by the heroes of today to a more idealistic Flash.This book highlights why superheroes go to sometimes extraordinary lenghts to protect their identities from the world .... and the worst that can happen when the secret gets out.Prior to reading this book my knowledge of the DCU was pretty much limited to the bigger names - Superman, Batman, The Flash - Identity Crisis introduced me to a much wider range of characters, in such a way that I had to find out more .... and read lots lots more of Brad Meltzers work!"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Who benefits from reading this? Bard Meltzer? Rags Morales? DC? The reader? Certainly not me. The premise may be believable (and done before...it's like a watered-down, stumbling version of \\"Watchmen,\\" and if the latter was full of unlikable characters): someone out to get the caped community's loved ones, however the motivation (even the method), once revealed at the end, wasn't.I'll admit there were some good twists, but overall, I found the whole thing laughable: trying to make superheroes seem more like regular folks by having them sit around chatting but never showing them in anything but their tights just looks ridiculous. Probably because these are such forgettable characters (seriously, how many characters are named 'Doctor' or 'Mr' in the DC Universe? Answer: Too many. Which begs the question, why aren't there any female physicians?) whom, without their equally laughable costumes and names, wouldn't be recognizable to your average comic reader.I haven't read Meltzer's thrillers, nor do I plan to; nor do I consider Rags Morales's \\"muscular naturalism\\", as the Washington Post gushes, \\"timelessly iconic and believably human.\\""},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Identity Crisis was a revelation. I hadn't read a comic book in awhile, but I chose this one because of the subject matter. It was highly emotional read for a comic book. The story was well drawn out, sophisticated and an interesting set up for the Infinite Crisis saga. I recommend Identity Crisis for anyone who desires their escapism to have some bite."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Disclaimer: I am not the most hardcore of comic book readers and prefer to read mostly just graphic novels.I loved this! I thought it was touching and interesting and an overall good piece of literature. Like I said I don't keep up with everything that happens in the DC universe so I couldn't comment on the depictions of the characters, but I found the portrayal of the characters very deep and multilayer. This is a definite must-read whether or not you keep up with the world of DC."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"I think the Watchmen will always be the best graphic novel ever, but this one is a close second for me. I have always chosen Marvel comics over DC, but this book alone, has caused me to become fascinated by the Justice League.This is a drop dead serious story that is not appropriate for kids, but a masterpiece that adults and older teens can enjoy. It will make you think and it might even make you give a family member a longer hug the next time you see them. It's that good. And if you ever wanted to try and get a person who doesn't like comics to try one, I would start with this one, even more so than The Watchmen. Worth every penny."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"A very nice to look at, story. As well as the plot being integral to a lot of what is going on in the dc universe, the style has become influential, with the different colored captains to identify the various protagonists at the time.Meltzer's experience with murder mysteries enables him to handle this quite well.The JLA have to deal with their own internal struggle surrounding a bit of brainwashing, Squadron Supreme style."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"'identity crisis' is one of those books that in the end makes you wish it had been a whole lot more. what's there certainly isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but i think meltzer didn't capitalize or execute well enough his intial premise and set-up. calling it 'identity crisis' lends itself to a lot of thought-provoking possibilities: who are the superheroes, exactly? what SHOULD they do? are they really good? is everything black and white? is mind-wiping a superhero justifiable? does the end justify the means?the pros: meltzer does a great job of show the JLA dynamic. though they are essential a group committed to the common good, they are, as they should be, distinct and separate individuals with different motivations, reactions to events, and moral compasses. i found the characters by and large interesting and compelling, even though there were so many that sometimes wondered if meltzer would've better served his readers by focuses on a couple instead of a dozen or more. i really did feel for ralph dibney. meltzer does a great job of relaying dibney's grief. we feel sorry for him, and especially for sue. i also liked that meltzer humanizes the superheroes. just because they're 'supes, doesn't mean they don't love and worry about their families or are immune to tragedy. it was nice to see family bonds strengthened through tragedy (but it's always sad, in comics and real-life, that it often takes a tragedy--or two or three--to make us value what we have, particularly our families), superhero or otherwise. also, rags' art is for the most part really great. it's funny to read his commentary at the end and see on which real-life people he based his animations.the cons: i found the muderer's motivations a tad contrived and cliched, which given that the whole point of the book centers on the murder(s), this was a let down for me. the reveal should've been a 'wow' moment; instead i was just like, 'oh.' it didn't hit with the emotional impact i wanted and expected and didn't carry the necessary gravitas the murders of superheroes' family members should--at least for me. it obviously works for some people, but personally i wanted more. i also wasn't the biggest fan of meltzer's style -- the 'inner dialogue' bubbles didn't work for me. i'm sure meltzer, being a novelist, struggled with the of expositionary development inherently problematic in comics. how else can you really know what someone is thinking in comics? you really can't, unless you use thought bubbles, or boxes, in this cases. i found it a bit distracting and would've preferred the characters just come out and say what they were thinking. not to mention it was sometimes a bit confusing to know who was thinking what (until i figured out they boxes were color-coded to the heroe's costume). i understand WHY meltzer did it the way he did, i just didn't particularly care for it.in the end i would recommend it as a superhero character study and not so much as a whodunnit/murder mystery. there's merit in superhero character study, no doubt about it. i'm a big fan of it. i'm also a big fan of great plots in which we see our heroes' development. for me, the plot left a lot to be desired. so, if you have a couple of hours to spare, i'd say pick up 'identity crisis.' you're sure to get some enjoyment out of it. i sure did."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Feminist bloggers love to expound on how misogynist this story is, but crime happens, criminals victimize women, and if supercriminals existed they'd be victimizing the superheroes' women given half a chance. It's a good story. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"\\"Identity Crisis\\" is one of the best comic book events of the decade. It's a powerful mix of sadness, shock and suspense that will leave you guessing \\"Who benefits?\\" all the way to the last page. With absoloutely gorgeous artwork from Rags Morales and lights out writing by Meltzer, this book is truly a modern classic.The plot is fairly simple. Someone's targeting the families of super heroes and after the wife of one of their own is brutally murdered, the super community is out for justice. A pretty simple whodunnit plot on the surface, but throughout the seven chapters, this story sereves to humanize the characters in a way no other book has. The line between good and evil is blurred even more by the actions of the Justice Leauge in this book, and it sets the tone nicely for the new DCU. No other comic has ever left images this memorable engrained in my mind. The image of a soaking wet Ralph Dibney craddling his wife in his arms is absoloutely heartbreaking, and the shot of Batman holding Robin is equally as painful.All in all I can't give this book a higher recommendation. It's a nice way to kill a few hours and it might change your opinion of comic books totally. This story proves that much like it's audience, comics have grown up."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"I really think that Amazon needs to give us the option of using half-star ratings so that I could give this a 4-and-a-half-star rating. This is a very intriguing story that, despite a few minor flaws here and there, keeps the reader very interested in what's going to happen next.I should first say that a good knowledge of the DC universe is very helpful for this story, seeing as how a lot of backstory is brought up. Fortunately for me, while I don't have as good a knowledge of DC as I do for Marvel (although I do know a good amount about Batman), my roommates are comic experts and were able to fill in the gaps for me.After the tragic death of Sue Debny, wife of the Ralph Debny, who is the secret identity-less Elongated Man, the members of the Justice League of America as well as pretty much every other superhero team in the DC universe is brought together to investigate. For one thing, Sue was a friend to nearly every member, and (perhaps more importantly) the murderer presents a personal risk to each and every one of them. Even though the public knew Elongated Man's identity, the killer was still able to seamlessly enter the house of a JLA member, kill his wife, and get away. Any wife, husband, parent, or child of the heroes could be next.Different heroes follow different leads. Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman (DC's big three) all pursue different targets, while Oliver \\"Ollie\\" Queene (the Green Arrow), Zatanna, Hawkman, Ray Palmer (the Atom), and Black Canary. Turns out that the five of them (along with Barry \\"The Flash\\" Allen and Hal \\"Green Lantern\\" Jordan) did something to the villain Dr. Light a few years back, and they believe that he wants revenge. The only problem is that they don't want the other members of the League to know about what they did, especially Batman and Superman.As the mystery unfolds, the new Flash and Green Lantern learn about the misdeeds of their predecessors, and the heroes are forced to come to grips with the mortality of their loved ones and the consequences of having secret identities. While the ending is definitely unexpected, it is slightly weak, and could have been done a little better. Also, a few plot points feel a little forced (especially one involving Batman), but overall, the story is great.While the death of Elongated Man's wife is the story's catalyst and Batman has a very important part towards the end, this is essentially the Green Arrow's book. The most time is devoted to him, and he provides most of the book's narration. Most of the big DC characters get their own scenes (with the notable exception of Wonder Woman), and the ones involving Tim Drake (the newest kid who has taken on the mantle of Robin) are especially important, but the Green Arrow is the main character here. I'm not saying that this is a good or bad thing, but just to say who the focus is in this story.Featuring a good mystery, great fight scenes, especially one involving Deathstroke, and good writing, Identity Crisis is a good read for most fans of the DC universe."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"While others on this series of reviews lament the fact that the characters they grew up with (me included) have become darker and grittier, I revel in the fact that these characters are treated as more human than superhuman. There is an increasing grey line that is coming into focus in society where \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\" are hard to tell apart and it plays well in Identity Crisis.This series takes our beloved childhood heroes and gives them soul. It also displays the darkest hearts of the DC villains and makes us fear them even more than the megalomaniacal \\"Rule-the-World\\" archetype of the past. Dr. Light is the prime example. The surprise \\"villain\\" in the story's climax just highlights the fact that the days of \\"good versus evil\\" are gone. You just can't tell anymore who your next enemy will be.The confrontation with Deathstroke is worth the price of this graphic novel ALONE! But it's the poignant moments like the funeral that truly give this series a heartbeat that I thought was long dead from comic books."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"A short time ago, the powers at be at DC Comics decided to create a major storyline. Meltzer was the one who did it. And he reached inside and pulled out a major moral issue. What do you do when a supervillian knows your secrets and you don't kill. The Justice League (or a few members of it) decided that the best nonlethal action would be to have the villians mindwiped, oh, and as an afterthought, mindwiped about ten minutes from Batman. And chaos ensues when the villians start to remember. This is a great story and kicks off the Infinite Crisis storyline. Very important to any fan of any DC character. I think they all are involved at some point (or some book) or another."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Let me start off by saying that I'm not much of a DC fan. I may be wrong, but the company has always seemed to ride big events to big sales and then hand over writing and art duties to second stringers until sales slump to a point when they need to put the big names on projects again. Around the time of Identity Crisis, this seemed to change.Identity Crisis takes the heroes of the DC Universe and has them scrambling to find out who knows their identities. A true mystery which isn't solved until the final issue (or end of the TPB). Every hero reacted in their own way and some of the characters who meet their end will surprise you (even if you thought they were pointless characters). Brad Meltzer did an amazing job of not necessarily re-inventing, but thinking about how each character would react to the situations they encounter. If you hate the DC Universe, give this a shot, it might point you towards a company who appears to be putting their best foot forward again. If you're interested in the storyline, continue on to Villains United, the OMAC Project, and then Infinite Crisis (the other limited series which ran concurrently to Villains and OMAC weren't as good in my opinion and you don't miss anything by avoiding them). Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"The critics were right on this book. It is terrific... Great artwork, great characterization, great story, great drama, moves at a good speed, agrees with continuity, and all covers and variant covers are shown. Can't ask for much more. This book should be in your collection."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"I've have been a comic reader and collector for the past 25 years. Idenity Crisis is one of the best graphic novels I've ever read. This is a story that shakes up the status quo of DC Comic and all that we have come to believe about heroes. This a mature version of comics that will make your think about the cooncept of right and wrong and does the ends really justify the means. A very thought provoking story"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"This book came highly recommended and...I don't understand why. Maybe because people like really lame crap? Well, this was that. Really lame story. Really dumb ending.The story is a ripoff of the Watchmen. It's Watchmen-Lite featuring Superman. If anyone were to say it wasn't, well they're deluding themselves. The Dr. Light rape scene was just really juvenile and stupid. I get it. Watchmen had a rape. Therefore if you're ripping off Watchmen you need some guy in a stupid white hat to rape somebody. Make's so much sense!Meltzer is good at writing narration. He makes the characters almost believable. If only this story wasn't so awful.And the huge anime eyes were just too much.Overrated crap. Hype to sell comics. Garbage. There, I said it. It's not one-star bad, but it's definitely two-star bad.And puh-lease, spare me Joss Whedon telling me how great this is. One complete hack congratulating another complete hack. BOOOOOO."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"In age of great storytelling in the graphic medium we get Identity Crisis which must be good because it has a writer from outside comics who has done some big work elsewhere. Unfortunately, writer-hype and tail-wagging-the-dog foreshadowing of a another yawn-inducing universe shake-up do not a gripping story make.The \\"shocking revelation\\" of the story, might be shocking if similar subjects hadn't been broached before (see original Squadron Supreme) or if it wasn't predicated on characters being complete idiots and/or acting in ways radically different from how they had been presented before. The revelation of the murder might have some emotional impact if it didn't come from left field (a good mystery is suppose to have clues a reader can figure out) and if it didn't fall into old (negative) portrayals of women so common in comics.Identity Crisis is not badly written when taken as individual issues, its only that there are no rewards waiting--other than the sad lesson that all too often hype is only hype."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Reading the other reviews you know how the story goes. The base of the story is outstanding and hypes up the ending to be something great, but the ending is average at best. It's kind of like a great boxing match ending with a tie."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"I found this story predictable and very slow paced. The twist is obvious enough that waiting for the characters to catch on is just a little torturous. I only finished it because I hoped I was wrong."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Seriously, I cannot fathom that people gush over this book.Essentially, what IDENTITY CRISIS was supposed to be was a 'whodunnit' for the DC Universe stable of characters. However, in a world of telepaths, sorcerers and men who shoot laser beams out of their eyes it falls embarrassingly flat on its face. Meltzer composes a story full of plot holes, bad characterization, and enough tired cliches to make any true fan of the genre wince.Quite possibly the only good comment I could make is that the artist is quite talented... other than that, not a lot to recommend."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"This book has fantastic character moments in it, but that isn't enough to redeem this book for being, dark, cruel, and non-sensible.I'm just going to past all the very obvious continuity flaws, this book has a great premise but it comes off as incredibly tasteless.It effectively ruins the JLA by turning them into a bunch of paranoid and moral-less group of vigilantes who aren't a close group of friends, in fact they mind wipe each other, and suspect each other of it.Also this book ruins the character of Doctor Light, and Jean Loring. It pointlessly kills Firestorm, Jack Drake, Captain Boomerang.To anybody who likes this book, answer me this: Jean Loring is divorcing Ray Palmer, so why did she feel the need to start all this for the reason of getting Ray back? Why didn't she just ask Ray to take her back? SHE WAS DIVORCING HIM!!! Why not just make amends and get back together?Why did Doctor Light have to be a rapist? It pretty much had no point. Why did Doctor Light need to be ruined at all?Also if you can sit there and read through the entire Deathstroke fight without laughing at the sheer idiocy, I don't really know what to say about you other then I hope you don't vote.Awful."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"We begin with a romantic story of how elongated man meet his wife Sue, it almost brought tears to my eyes! And then, without warning somebody is threatning his wife. From our hero's end, it may have sounded like she was having a stroke, but no she is being attacked and as you may have guess, she doesn't make it! Well, the question is, who done it? The answer is clear, it has to be one of the many villians looking for revenge, but which one! Dr. Aruther Light, he's the guilty man, your honor, send him to jail! Why the reject? well it appears that some time ago, a select group of heroes within the JLA kindof ... kick him out of the mensa group he belonged to! Yeah, that is putting it nicely! In the battal with Dr. Light he somehow rememebers everything that happens to him and is very pissed off, you would be too, MENSA doesn't accept just anybody ;-) Okay if it isn't Dr. Light who else? Would you believe a super villian w/o super powers who just throws a bomagrang around I believe he's called Captain WTF!!! anyway, WTF manages to make Tim Drake, the current Robin an orphan, it's about damn time DC decided to do something about that. Don't get me wrong, when Drake cried I cried but a Robin with parents! I know things have to change but Batman is suppose to be the father figure to Robin and I know change is good but lets leave some things the way they are suppose to be! Batman and Robin Forever, as it is damnit! Anyway, this killer comes into Batman's world and he going to use his detective skills to figure out who the killer is. Which is the guy, Green Arrow should have called in, in the first place instead of those B rate super heros. Wait, he didn't need to call him, he got there before anyone else! (That's what I love and hate about Batman)anyway, he solves the crime, as if you didn't know! Which to my dismay leads to one of my favorite superhero! Before the last chapter, I keep saying to myself! \\"NOT HIM! NOT MOTHER ******* HIM!\\" So, the killer turned out to be Ato .... Nope, telling you here would be wrong.This book well-written as it is leads to prelude to infinite crisis and sets the stage for a book called \\"Lights OUT!\\" I think is the title, With Dr. Light vs all the figging Teen Titans past and present. After this book, Dr. Light is no joke and he's gunning for Green Arrow and the Titans. So if you're getting into the DC universe in 2006 this book and inifinte crisis, prelude not the actual inifinte crisis, are the places to start so you can know what is going on right now! I can't wait to see how it ends."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"This is the book that made me care for characters like Green Arrow and Elonggated Man. A very good read that puts you on the wrong track with every turn but does not dissapoint when the truth has been revealed. The art is not the best but works great for this book. This book has brought a new and fresh look to old characters that where considerd B-Characters."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Brad Meltzer was uniquely qualified to write this epic story. He grew up reading comics (the first comic he ever bought was an issue of the Justice League) and has been a life long fan and reader. Since he's established himself as a fine writer of thrillers, at first it seemed odd for him to write comics, but it was something he has said that he had always wanted to do.Lucky for the fans that he did. Identity Crisis created enormous buzz in the industry and was given the red carpet treatment that it frankly deserved. It's probably the greatest DC comics event of the decade with the arguable exception of \\"Batman: Hush.\\"Here though, instead of a straight superhero story, Meltzer brings his unique gifts into play as he explores the people behind the costumes and weaves a deft mystery into the plot as well. Meltzer said on NPR once that he was puzzled why there aren't more mysteries written into comics today. This is a valid statement. When a good mystery is written, fans come a flocking and the buzz is usually good. Look at Batman: The Long Halloween. Jeph Loeb wrote a first rate mystery and it became one of the more successful Batman projects of the 90's.Well, here in Identity Crisis, the mystery is first rate and the reader is taken through numerous twists and turns in the plot and by the time the story is finished, the reader will be shocked by the final revelation. The result is an entertaining and satisfying read to be enjoyed by both regular and first time comic book readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"I'm not usually enamoured of the big event comics; they tend to skimp on real drama and just go for the big action and the big crossovers. This comic is a major exception. Deaths of minor characters in this book are explored thoughtfully, instead of being glossed over, spring cleaning moments like in Avengers: Disassembled.Even though I wasn't really familiar with some of the characters murdered in this clever superhero mystery, I really cared about their deaths, their implications, and what they meant to their friends. The crossover and mystery elements are handled ably, making it an easy read.The art is acceptable -- I'm not a huge Michael Turner fan, so the cover and publicity art didn't excite me, but there's nothing terrible here. A good all-around comic, which just happens to be a big summer event. A nice surprise."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"The only reason why i dont give this book a five star is beacuse i'm upset with the writer for showing me a darker side of the heroes that i had come to know and love. That they could do what they did, especially to batman, is unbelievable. But on the otherhand the story is very realistic and keeps you turning the pages for more. I recommend it for anyone interested in mysteries and shocking endings."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"When I first heard about Identity Crisis I wondered how the death of a character as minor as Sue Dibny could possibly be the setup for such an important mini-series but the story turned out to be one of the most emotional comics I've read in the last five years. Unless future writers decide to bury or ignore the events of the story this could have a major impact on the DCU for years to come. It turns out that the Justice League has a very dark secret that could split the team in two. It's actually a very interesting revelation that explains a lot particularly the various times in the past where villains have discovered secrets about the JLA only to have the revelations ignored in future stories.\`Identity Crisis' is one of the more realistic stories portraying some of the older villains as a bit paunchy, a bit more grey and in the case of Captain Boomerang desperate for work. The reader is also presented with a glimpse at the various members of the Secret Society of Super Villains in their off hours; sitting around the old JLA satellite shooting the breeze. I wish more writers would take the time to include characterization on the villains. For instance, Chronos is apparently now capable of seeing into the near future which makes him a pain at poker games. There isn't a tremendous amount of action throughout the series yet it remains tense and intriguing. I made the mistake of discovering the ending before reading the book but still found the story difficult to put down.Of the various lead-ins to Infinite Crisis \`Identity Crisis' and \`The OMAC Project' are the two best mini-series and I recommend picking up both. \`Villains United' is good but not quite as compelling and \`Day of Vengeance' is average at best. I didn't even bother with the \`Thannagar-Rann War' because of the abysmal reviews."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"I never thought a comic would make me cry. More than once.The extreme violence involving characters that traditionally were untouchable support characters through the decades is very upsetting to a lot of fans; but I don't think a death for someone like Sue could be done better.Batman is done brilliantly. He's not just a character, he's a presence, unseen, but watching and thinking. He dosen't appear until after 100 pages plus, but his messages and his effect on those around him are very loud and clear. He dosen't attend the funeral; too busy working in the Cave to solve the murder.Read this book. If not for the touching moments, for the perfect rendering of the characters. Never underestimate the supporting cast."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"The title of the review is simple because the panacea for everyone's dismay towards this story is equally visible: fabricate an Elseworlds logo on the cover of the book and don't ask any more silly questions. I can accept the mixed reactions but, truthfully, being a comics fanatic for 27 years, I've witnessed acts more ludicrous and thoughtless. \\"Identity Crisis\\" is a terrific story when viewed in its appropriate, although unintentional, perspective: a never-was tale in a never-gonna-be reality. We are all superhero freaks; can't we just willingly slide along with the storylines in the regard that it is all fantasy, anyway? Besides, it was STILL vastly superior to Marvel's \\"Earth-X\\" or the subsequently quagmarish (nightmare+quagmire) sequels!!"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Just a great book. The storyline, the emotion in the characters, everything about this story rang true, brilliantly so. Rarely has a comic moved me to tears, or surprised me so well."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"I'm not surprised by all the glowing reviews but it is disappointing.This is another mediocre story riding on the waves of being dark and edgy rather than having compelling storytelling. The story's meat and bones is a murder mystery but delves into some pretty dark stuff. Super hero rape, murder and cover ups. The worst part is not that its a story whose only pull is its dark and shocking material but rather its weak plot.Its a murder mystery with the murderer, when revealed, is so contrived its pretty obvious Brian was just going for shock since it makes no sense in context of all we know of these characters and the DCU. The whole book just seems like an attempt to just write something shocking.It's almost like finding out Jimmy Olsen or Alfred was the murderer. Its shocking and dark but makes not sense and is a gimmick. If you are a fan of comics being made darker for the sake of darkness, or to capitalize on the the trend, then this is for you.If you like your stories to be about plot and writing over shock and gimmick then move along."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"\\"Identity Crisis\\", as outstanding a reading experience as it was, was an event that couldn't fully be judged at the time (and hence I put off doing a write-up for a long time). In short, it was a riveting, awesome series whose ending didn't really make sense, and left me unsure as to whether I was disappointed with the final chapter for that reason, or satisfied with how truly unexpected the finale was. I remember thinking that DC was going to have to address the things that didn't add up, and that if that was done right, \\"Identity Crisis\\"'s claim to being one of the greatest crossover events of all time would be cemented. A couple months after Crisis concluded, elements started appearing in a number of books (the reprecussions of Identity Crisis were, obviously, felt all through the DC Universe) that implied ways in which the parts that didn't add up could actually be plausible. Day Of Vengeance # 1 immediately springs to mind. And while it's still debateable whether everything got squared away tightly enough, it's close enough in my mind that those seeming inconsistencies in IC # 7 are no longer a hinderance. \\"Identity Crisis\\" indeed stands as one of comicdom's shining moments.This collection reprints all seven issues of \\"Identity Crisis\\"; other issues of other titles were also part of the overall event but do not appear here (more on that later). The premise of the event is simple but bold: someone knows the secret identities of some of - perhaps all of - DC's most prominent superheroes, and has begun killing off their loved ones. No one - spouses, parents, friends, etc. - seems to be safe, and despite a relentless effort by such investigation-capable characters as Batman, the Martian Manhunter, and Mr. Miracle (who brings in New Genesis technology), the killer seems to be leaving no clues or evidence.The first victim is Sue Dibny, wife of Ralph Dibny aka the Elongated Man, and what begins as a crusade by the DCU's superheroes to track down the perpetrator of a lone crime becomes even more urgent when further incidents occur, leaving the world's most powerful champions playing defensive against a ruthless, unidentified foe who strikes at them through their families. With every villain a potential suspect, a spotlight is shone on the bad guys of the DC Universe that, from a reader's perspective, is extremely illuminating. In trying to ferret out the guilty party at the same time as the book's characters do, the reader can see a host of the supervillains through a fresh lens, almost as if you're looking at them for the first time. The collective rogues gallery of the DC Universe is anything but a uniform bunch, ranging from the most irredeemable psychopaths - tortue-minded rapists, mass murderers - to characters who genuinely feel themselves to be in the right, to villains who know they're the 'bad guys' of the world but have made peace with it, and who attempt to hold onto some modicum of honor and decency even as they carry out their nefarious endeavors. Within this last type, one group even annoymously sends flowers and a condolence card to a victim's surviving family, troubled that someone among their general peerage is taking the game to such a personal level. The funeral for Sue is disturbingly realistic and moving, and immediately following it, the heroes set out on the hunt. And immediately following it, at the end of # 1, drops a major surprise bombshell, one of many that turn up in a twist-packed, genuinely shocking tale. The art, writing, and characterization is excellent all through. Deserving of special mention is the way characters who'd been relatively ignored in the few years prior to Identity Crisis (Elongated Man, Deathstroke, Captain Boomerang, etc.) surprisingly got elevated to such large roles in DC's pole release of 2004. It was a welcome move, and what that set a precedent as a number of other semi-forgotten characters would rise up to play pivotal roles in a host of DC events following IC.This volume can be read by itself, but to get the most out of it, I'd recommend that you read as many of the other chapters as possible. These are The Flash #s 214-217, JSA # 67, Firestorm (2004 series) # 6, and Manhunter (2004 series) # 5. The Flash issues are reprinted inThe Flash Vol. 6: The Secret of Barry Allen, which also reprints Flash # 207-211 and 213; JSA # 67 is reprinted inJSA: Lost (Book 9)along with #s 59-66; Manhunter # 5 is inManhunter: Street Justice (Book 1)which also contains #s 1-4 of that series; Firestorm # 6 hasn't been reprinted but the original issue usually isn't too hard to find (it may even be on Amazon through one of the marketplace sellers). You may want to just get the individual tie-in issues anyway, instead of the whole collection they appear in. Obviously not everybody is going to want to (or be able to afford to) shell out for all these issues all at once; I myself read the first couple of chapters, then held off until I tracked down a good bunch of the rest before reading on. If you can only get some of the tie-ins I'd recommend Flash 214-217 the most; you get A Lot of additional facets to Identity Crisis here.If you're going to read more than just the 7 issues collected in this volume, I'd suggest reading in the following order (figuring out what order to read crossover issues can get pretty confusing at times, admittedly; perhaps a guide on the inside covers would be something publishers might want to consider): Identity Crisis # 1, IC # 2, IC # 3, The Flash # 214, IC # 4, Flash # 215, IC # 5, Firestorm # 6, Manhunter # 5, JSA # 67, IC # 6, Flash # 216, IC # 7, Flash 217. Identity Crisis # 7 and Flash # 217 are pretty much concurrent, but the revelations pack more wallop in IC 7, that's why I'd recommend reading that one first.I don't mean to suggest that you can't enjoy an excellent story just with the \\"Identity Crisis\\" Hardcover (or Trade) itself, because you can. The experience is just enhanced with the other issues. It's unfortunate there's not a complete collection out, but nonetheless you can't really go wrong, either with just this volume or with some or all of the others. Identity Crisis is a must-read, one way or the other."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Up until recently I've been a very casual comic book reader. After reading various comics published by DC that mentioned \\"Identity Crisis\\" and finding it hard to avoid \\"spoilers\\" everywhere on the web I picked this up the day it was released to get caught up and find out what all the fuss was about. After closing the book, I was shocked about how much a \\"superhero book\\" could affect me emotionally. I had lost a very beloved family member a few days before reading this, and I'll admit it did affect the way I viewed this book. But in looking back at it \\"cold\\", I believe it stands incredibly well as a graphic novel, a tragic love story and a mystery.The plot has already been gone over well, so I won't go there. Basically, it's what would be a fairly standard mystery except for that it surrounds the murder of the wife of someone named \\"The Elongated Man\\", has Wonder Woman deliver the eulogy, and a perplexing question is how a murderer could get around technology from places including Krypton. Typing it, it does sound like the book could have been a huge joke and misstep for DC- but in my opinion it was very effective.I was not familiar with Sue Dibny, but I cried when her husband held her dead body in his arms (and saw the surprise present she gave him for his birthday) and the scenes at her funeral. My heart went out when another character lost a very close loved one, and I really felt the tension when the Justice League were at moral odds with one another. I will admit I was very unhappy when we were shown that Sue had been attacked before- by being raped by someone usually referred to as a fairly silly villian. This scene was the hardest for me to read. However it was done off panel, and we are basically shown reactions and some slurs from the rapist- it is not done graphically or sleazily but the very nature of it is harsh. Personally, I read comics for entertainment and as a break, but I did understand what this book was going for. I do not think sexual violence should have any place in 'superhero' comics and I do not believe it was needed in this story to give it more impact, but that's my own opinion.I think this story has polarized a lot of comic readers. Some would like this genre to stay more classic with pages of fights with supervillians- and that's an extremely valid point. Others are open to and even prefer more adult stories like this one, and the sales of this storyline and the amount of buzz surrounding this have shown it's brought many people back to comics- or even into them the first time. Neither view is wrong, but it makes books like this tricky. Personally I love classic superhero tales but Identity & Infinite Crisis have got me reading current \\"big title\\" books for the first time and I'm really enjoying them.If you go into this story already judging it, and picking apart the mystery aspect and every character action- you'll probably be left dissapointed. It's very well-structured, but parts are manipulated to get things rolling in a different direction. If you're debating reading this, all I can do is recommend that you go in with an open mind and read this with your heart on your sleeve. In the end this is just a book about people, relationships, and the pain we automatically accept when we love and care about someone. If you're ready to believe a superhero, under the mask, can love and lose as much as yourself... then I believe you will get something out of Identity Crisis."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"This story single-handedly led me to pay attention to DC's mainstream superhero fare after years of, justifiably, considering the publisher to be the stumbling dinosaur of the Marvel/DC dichotomy. Who cares about continuity when you've got a story this compelling that makes even the most dust-choked DC relics seem new and fresh and gives modern purpose to the most anachronistic of characters.It's too early to say whether this represents a serious turning point for the publisher, but for seven edge-of-your-seat issues, Meltzer and Morales fleshed out a tale as entertaining and relevant as anything DC has ever produced."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"I used to be a DC comic addict, and in the mid-'80s spent more than I should have buying issue after issue of all that DC and First Comics could put out. As I got older, I stopped buying the mags (I was spending my money on dates, then marriage, now kids...) and lost touch with the genre. But sometimes, while browsing in a book store, my legs would take me to the graphic novel section. My eyes would scan the titles, and from time-to-time I'd let temptation get the better of me. The Ultimate Spider-Man for instance,and the new JLA comics in particular caught my eye.And just last month, I bought this book. I was attracted by Brad Meltzer's name on the spine. I like the guy's thrillers. They're usually mindless fun, perfect for a quick read. I thumbed through the book and liked what I saw of the art. I bought it.And I'm glad I did.This is one of the best graphic novels I have ever read, and it will hold a place of honor on my bookshelf, next to my Dark Knight Returns and Ultimate Spider-Man collection. This will be reread time and time again, and I'm glad I got around my aversion to buying comics again."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"SPOILERS&#34;Identity Crisis&#34; is probably one of the most baffling event books I've ever read. By turns it's unintentionally funny, confusing, and ultimately pointless. At its core, it is a deeply cynical story and seems to be DC's attempt at Watchmen-ifying the DCU - and utterly failing.It opens with two unfamiliar characters speaking atop a rooftop: Elongated Man (yes that really is his name!) and Firehawk, a pair who look like the most generic superheroes ever created. They are failing to blend in with the scenery but aren't spotted despite Firehawk being on fire at night, watching an alley with a box in it, 2 gangsters, and a &#34;super&#34; villain who are somehow all connected. Sue Dibny, Elongated Man's wife, is preparing a surprise birthday for him so he's put on his tights and headed out into the night to give her room. But it's not going to be a happy birthday as she is about to murdered. Sue, it turns out, is the first in a line of family members of superheroes who are being targeted for some reason.This first chapter... I think I could write an entire dissertation solely on how stupid this chapter is. First off - Elongated Man. Does anyone know who he is, let alone his wife? Does anyone care? His wife's dead - so what? We've just been introduced to these characters. Maybe you're one of the Silver Age readers who might remember these characters but I'm guessing most people coming to this book aren't, and I'm definitely one of them. But the response is hilarious. EVERYONE in the DCU mobilises as if their entire world is shook up. Sue Dibny is dead? SUE DIBNY? The correct response would've been &#34;who?&#34; but it seems she meant a great deal to everyone in the DCU despite not being a superhero and being the wife of a superhero called, yes, Elongated Man. The worst name ever created for a &#34;superhero&#34;. Was &#34;Distended Man&#34; taken?This is where DC begin ret-conning like crazy. Elongated Man tells stories of going out on patrol with Batman - I've read a lot of Batman comics and not once have I seen one mention of this character. Hell, in all the DC comics I've read, I've never seen a single mention of this guy. But whoever he is, he's suddenly important because otherwise this book has no impact on the reader, so DC make up a whole bunch of stuff about this couple you've never heard of to build them up as some kind of massively important characters on par with Superman, Wonder Woman, et al. when the truth is Sue Dibny is an easy character to kill off because nobody remembers her.The response is so overblown and melodramatic that, once you realise this is all for a character called Sue Dibny, the wife of a superhero you've never heard of, it becomes really funny. Green Arrow at one point says &#34;Clark and Bruce may be the bricks - but Ralph and Sue... they were the mortar&#34; which just made me laugh partly because he's so solemn when he says it and partly because it's so untrue. And then the funeral takes place. You've never seen such an outpouring of superheroes - for Sue Dibny! The superheroes act like this is their 9/11! At this point I wondered if someone had made &#34;Who the hell is Sue Dibny?&#34; tshirts and that I should buy one - seriously, DC, it's one thing to insist the reader cares so much about this unknown couple, but to have literally every superhero in the DCU breaking down over her death? It's so ridiculous. This leads to the hunt for her killer who is judged to be an unknown villain called Dr Light - with no evidence!To recap so far: the wife of a superhero, neither of whom anyone has heard of before, is killed by an equally unknown &#34;supervillain&#34; whose power is being able to light up like a lightbulb. Oh dear...The Dr. Light connection leads to some baffling revelations and the explanation for the title. Dr Light, a seemingly harmless loony, manages to break into the JLA's moon headquarters (somehow because it's never explained) while they're all away. Wandering about - for no reason! You're never told why he's even there in the first place! - he meets Sue Dibny. And then rapes her! Here the laughter is replaced by an uneasy feeling that DC are now actively channelling Alan Moore. After half a minute or so, most of the JLA appear and stop him, beat him up, etc. Then, out of the blue, they decide to wipe his memory using Zatanna and then go further, changing his brain so his personality is altered! It should be said that Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman - the Big 3 - are absent but it's implied that this has happened many times before and, as they were involved, they must have had a part in this. But for the purposes of this book, the ringleader is winner of the curviest goatee ever seen in comics, Green Arrow, who, in this book at least, manages to win over Barry Allen/Flash, Hal Jordan/Green Lantern, and Carter Hall/Hawkman and together, they watch as Zatanna does the deed.In a book of really strange goings on, this is perhaps one of the strangest reasonings I've ever read in a DC comic. Going waaaaaay back to 1960s Silver Age comics, they single out an issue where a magic box switches the identities of superheroes and villains momentarily. While the villains are in the superheroes' bodies, they unmask and find out the superheroes' secret identities. Aghast, the superheroes, once returned to their bodies, fear for their loved ones as they will now become targets for the villains. So they decide to wipe the memories of the villains to ensure their secret identities remain secret.This highlights one of the biggest problems DC, and Marvel for that matter, have - going back to the past and rewriting it so it's &#34;darker&#34;. It's like they're embarrassed of their history. So those silly Silver Age stories that were aimed at and written for kids? DC have decided to go back and rewrite them to suit where they are - in the 21st century - as a company, creatively. They want things to be &#34;real&#34; and &#34;dark&#34; and &#34;gritty&#34;. First of all, if you're reading superhero comics and want realism - STOP READING SUPERHERO COMICS. You're reading about a guy who can move so fast his can vibrate his molecules and pass through solid objects and a billionaire who dresses as a bat, not to mention the alien who can fly - and you want them to seem more &#34;real&#34;? What a nonsensical complaint! The good news is that there are lots of &#34;realistic&#34; comics out there so you can fill your boots, but if you're picking up a DC or Marvel book then you're choosing to put aside realism and indulge in pure fantasy.Second, why can't DC leave well enough alone? Those Silver Age comics were written for a younger, less sophisticated readership compared to the comics audience of the 21st century which is predominantly adult. Those stories in the 60s were silly but that doesn't mean you have to address the many bizarre stories that were printed and then find ways of explaining them so that there are &#34;real&#34; reasons behind their existence. They were just innocent stories for kids, designed to be silly - there is absolutely no reason to have to go back and pillage the past to suit the current Dark/Modern age of comics. I'm just getting so sick of this revisionist crap - writers who can't come up with something original so they go back and &#34;spin&#34; something old. It's so uncreative. How about a new take on Winnie the Pooh? Hey, you know why Eeyore is so down? He was molested as a young donkey. Yeah, he's on a ton of antidepressants. And speaking of drugs, Tigger? He's on crack. All the time, hence his energy. And Piglet, man s/he is such a whore, the things s/he does with Pooh in his trailer...So that's the &#34;identity crisis&#34; of the book - superheroes performing immoral acts on immoral people. I don't know why DC felt they had to come up with an answer to the question of &#34;how do superheroes maintain their secret identities so long?&#34; especially as if that's a valid question, how about &#34;how can Flash move so fast? Isn't that kind of speed impossible for a human?&#34; etc. Once again, if you're picking up a superhero comic, questions of realism/logic - these shouldn't be valid as they're not applicable.And then we're back to the murder mystery story of Sue Dibny, except now there's another body and once again this victim is someone you don't know nor care about: Tim Drake's dad. I don't even remember his name, that's how unmemorable he was. He was Robin's dad, that's it.To recap again: two unknown and inconsequential characters have died, and superheroes have been revealed as morally bankrupt. Why is this considered to be a &#34;great&#34; book again?So finally we get to the end as Dr Mid-Nite figures out, just as Bruce Wayne does, who the killer is. And on the subject of Dr Mid-Nite, he's been performing the autopsy on Sue Dibny since her death, basically the entire book. The events in this book take place between one and two weeks. Which means Dr Mid-Nite's been performing an autopsy for over a week! Don't these things take a day or two? He's got to be the worst &#34;doctor&#34; of all time to spend this long autopsying a corpse.And who is the killer of two unknown, inconsequential characters? Only another unknown, inconsequential character! The Atom!....'s wife. Who? Yes, the superhero you kind of know about, or might not at all, the Atom is a guy who can shrink himself down to the size of an atom. In this book, he's been going through a divorce with his wife - who left him - and, despite the fact that she could get back together with him at the drop of a hat - he repeatedly reminds the reader how much he's still in love with her - she concocts the most convoluted plan to get him running back to her. Which he already was.So how does Atom's wife do it? Well, I have no idea. I've read and re-read the sequence and am no clearer. She finds one of his tiny costumes in a box one day and then in the next panel she has acquired his powers and is able to shrink to the size of atoms. Um... Then for some reason she decides to try out her new power by going into Sue Dibny's brain and playing around in there...Er...Brad Meltzer, I'm not following. Then she loses control, Sue Dibny dies, Atom's wife tries to hide it by torching Elongated Man's house, fake a murder attempt, and then kill Tim Drake's dad. That's right, this is the most nonsensical resolution to a non-story I've ever read.Before I finish (and congratulations if you've made it through this elongated rant - eh?) I will say that the book contains one of the best fight sequences I've read all year. Normally I'm against superhero violence as it's so inane, two roided-out dudes in tights punching one another - it's dull, right? But the sequence when Deathstroke takes out the group of Justice Leaguers (minus the Big 3) was genius. It wasn't plain fighting, it was tactical, it was clever, it was well choreographed, it was a perfect example of how superhero fights should be and so frequently aren't. That and I just like Deathstroke, this is the one part of the book that is faultless. Rags Morales is the other reason this book gets 2 stars instead of 1. His art is, as always, fantastic and, despite the far-too many scenes of costumes crying, his work only elevated the book.So that's &#34;identity Crisis&#34;. A story featuring nobodies important in the DCU killing one another while the superheroes hover around the edges, awkwardly trying their damnedest to pretend it matters. Brad Meltzer manages to craft one of the most poorly constructed &#34;mysteries&#34; I've ever read while also smearing crap over DC's superheroes for no reason whatsoever. This entire book is pointless, partly because the characters who died didn't matter in the first place. It is a disasterpiece of modern comics, a cautionary tale for future writers to avoid making superheroes &#34;real&#34;. &#34;Identity Crisis&#34; doesn't make you think differently about superheroes, it just makes you wish for the kind of stories that are reviled in this book. The ones that don't try so hard to be &#34;dark&#34; and &#34;gritty&#34; and focus instead on creating original stories that have a balance between drama and levity - the kind of comics a kid would want to pick up.&#34;Identity Crisis&#34;... it just sucks."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"DC has used the 'Crisis' theme since Crisis on Infinite Earths to 'clean up' their canon, really just meaning that they kill off characters in the DCU, until they are resurrected of course. It is my opinion that Identity Crisis is not only a great graphic novel but a very good overall book. It is a MUST READ if you are a fan of the DC universe or a fan of superheroes in general. What are the three things that make comic books and graphic novels great? The story is probably the most important, the art is a close second and last but not least is the writing. The writing is so genuine, even realistic at times when it comes to the relationships between characters. Identity Crisis manages to do in mere pages what it takes most movies to do in hours if at all, that is to build and develop good character relationships. There is a lot of talk about how emotional the book is, and no matter who you are, you're gonna feel something. The art is consistently excellent, in true comic book form, and the story is probably best of all. The characters that were gotten rid of were relatively minor, but to me that wasn't the point, 'Elongated Man' was never a more important character than he is in this book. I rented this novel from my local library, check to see if it's at yours."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"New York Times best-selling author Brad Meltzer takes a crack at the comic book spectrum with penciller Rags Morales, and the result is a life-changing event centered mostly on the minor players of the DC universe. When Elongated Man's wife is murdered, the other heroes suspect a plot to kill their families. As the entire crimefighting community scours the country for answers, five familiar heroes stay behind to guard a secret that not only brings their loyalties into question, but blurs the line between right and wrong.If Gail Simone's \\"Women in Refrigerators\\" theory (the use of the death or injury of female characters as a plot device) is true, this is a prime example (and perhaps the best use) of it. Few minor character deaths leave such an impact on comics as that of Sue Dibly; in a way, her death is felt as much as that of even Gwen Stacy (you're welcome to debate this). Meltzer, also an established novelist, translates his style well in what would otherwise be unfamiliar territory, though the climax of \\"Identity Crisis\\" is somehow lacking. Included are several pages of commentary from the \\"Identity Crisis\\" crew as well as a variant cover gallery.This comic is unrated: Graphic Violence, Adult Language, Adult Situations."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Brad Meltzer and Rags Morales' \\"Identity Crisis\\" collects the original seven-part DC Comics mini-series into an extremely engaging and entertaining superhero epic, which interestingly doesn't have all that much to do with superheroics.What we have here is a clever and well-crafted mystery story revolving around the death of Sue Dibny, wife of Ralph Dibny, the DC hero known as The Elongated Man. The usually gentle Ralph is both devastated and angered by his wife's murder, and soon enlists the aid of his many (and better known) superhero friends to solve her murder and bring the killer to justice. Soon, the likes of the Flash, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Superman, Batman, etc. are on the case.What's interesting here is that the various heroes are portrayed as flawed humans, not moral paragons. Indeed, the story purports that maybe these heroes were never all that innocent to begin with, even back in the early days when their comic book adventures were bright and cartoony and fairly kid-oriented. Maybe in this post-Watchmen comics era it isn't all that unusual to see a little darkness in our comics heroes, but true moral compromise by a big company's flagship heroes is still a pretty rare thing, and made me sit up and take notice in \\"Identity Crisis\\".In particular, there's a flashback to an early Justice League adventure (an actual comic book story published decades ago) where a team of super villains switches minds with the Justice League, effectively taking over the bodies of the League's members. Even then, many kids must have asked, \\"Hey, when the bad guys were inside the bodies of the heroes, why didn't they unmask them and see who they really were?\\" Well, \\"Identity Crisis\\" purports that the villains did indeed do that, and that the heroes, once the villains were defeated, engaged in some pretty controversial activities (somewhat reminding me of the memorable, chilling close of \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\") to restore things to normal and protect their identities. Further, the story demonstrates that those activities, and similar past practices (most would say, abuses), are now tainting the way the heroes are now operating, and are maybe indirectly responsible for the murder now laid at their feet.I didn't mind the controversial, often negative portrayal of the heroes in \\"Identity Crisis\\". This approach made them more complex and interesting to me. In any event, nothing they did was as unsavory as say, the sight of King Arthur drowning babies in the early chapters of DC's \\"Camelot 3000\\". Now THAT kept me from enjoying the rest of the book, no matter that the king later regretted his actions.I hope that Brad Meltzer, who usually earns his living as a bestselling mystery writer, will occasionally return to the world of comics and write more stories as good as \\"Identity Crisis\\". In fact, I'm off to search Amazon to see if he already has.In the end, if you like comics or you like mysteries, \\"Identity Crisis\\" should be quite enjoyable to you; and if you like mysteries AND comics, you should especially run right out and get it."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"That this story is well written cannot be denied. What the author chooses to write about, however, is disturbing to any loyal DC comics fan. I don't think I'll ever be able to go back and enjoy any Ralph/Sue Dibny story the way I would have if I did not read IDENTITY CRISIS. What was the author's motivation for a work that left many fans feeling violated as they helplessly watched one of the most benign/likeable characters in the DC universe being subjected to one violent atrocity after another?"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"I'll start out by letting you know that I'm huge comic fan, but not really into the DC guys that much. In fact, I don't read any of them if they don't have ties to Gotham City. However, a buddy of mine told me that if I really wanted to read a good murder mystery that I needed to check out Identity Crisis. Some of the best advice that I've ever taken (thanks to Gary, Eric, and Mike). I loved the fact that there were characters in the book who I knew (Bats, Zatana, Supes, Robin) and others that I didn't (Elongated Man, Red Tornado, Dr. Midnight etc.), but no matter what you grew to know how they interacted with each other, and grew to even feel for certain characters. Meltzer is one heck of a writer. This is the first thing that I have ever read by him, by I will have to check out some of his novels. Rags is one of my favorite artists in the industry, having grown to love his work from reading Nightwing. And of course, there are the wonderful covers by the late Michael Turner. RIP.

This is such a human yet mysterious story that it is tough to put down.

A+"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"\\"Identity Crisis\\" is a seven-issue miniseries by bestselling author, Brad Meltzer. The story is centered on the murder of Sue Dibny, the wife of the minor superhero, the Elongated Man. Whoever the killer is, he/she was able to bypass a triple-layered alien security system, conduct the murder, and left without a single trace or motive. Sue's death sends a ripple of fear throughout the superhero community, as even the indestructible are terrorized by the threat presented to their more ordinary loved ones. As the puzzle pieces of the mystery slowly falls into place, a darker secret emerges from within the league that has the potential to obliterate the social cohesion of the group. Soon, it would become apparent that the heroes' worst enemies are not the villains, but themselves. \\"Identity Crisis\\" is a dark and emotional graphic novella that illustrates the fragility of the human mind. It is well-written, sophistically organized, and artistically immaculate. Meltzer breaks away from the cookie-cutter comic book mold and creates a story that is deeply imaginative, yet realistic.

He makes each character identifiable whether in costume or out. Overall, whether you are a DC fan or not, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"When I was a teenager, I went through my superhero phase and that ended around Junior year in high school when I started to crave stories with more ambiguity and thematic gravitas. I can't say thatWatchmenruined superhero comics for me, so much as crystallize my distaste for a genre that was solidly marketed to 13 year old boys. The rare moments when I would read superhero comics out of nostalgia, I'd feel the same disappointment for a genre that thrives on soap opera circular plotting, flat characters and the big fight sequence. Most stabs at characterization were of the teen angst varietyEven though Identity Crisis has many of the conventions of superhero comics but it has a great way sof making everything feel new and fresh. First off, we have a wife of Elongated Man dying but before she gets killed, the storyline gives the background of the wedding and the marriage and makes you really like the two of them.From then on out, the comic alternates between an action mystery and a meditation on the price of fame. The action mystery is pretty standard. The heroes think that they know who did it. They try to find that guy and they end up in a fight with an ultra-powerful being. There's a lot of material about memory wiping. The other part of the book is the meat of the book. The superheroes have to come to the funeral in their costumes. They worry about their parents. Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman are always framed iconically.The series does run away from itself at points. There are only so many times you can have these characters sitting around debating what they did to stay safe. The big reveal feels like a letdown. But ultimately this is a fine series that treats superheroes with the gravitas that they may or may not deserve but definitely feels fresh."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Identity Crisis is one of the best graphic novels I have ever read.

GET IT NOW!"},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Identity Crisis was book that DC Published a couple of years ago to compete the other comic book companies attempts at \\"realism,\\" and like those FAILURES this one doesn't live up to it's own expectations.The plot itself isn't that bad. Somebody is moving the characters of the DC Universe, good and bad, around like Chess pieces for an unknown reason. This both sides of the Super powered community to start getting worried and making their own investigations. The characters from both sides are blinded by anger, lust, and jealousy to do their actions, and the person who was pulling the strings decides to act these emotions out also, making the mystery truly a mystery that comes out from nowhere in the story.As said earlier however, the writer tries to make the story seem realistic but the DC Universe isn't realistic, nor is any comic book really. The entire mystery begins realistic with the house that's attacked being under all kinds of investigation: mother box, animal senses, the metal men tested if it had some kind of metal alloy. But then the real question is, if this person needed to be under that amount of protection, why wasn't there a video camera inside and outside the house, especially in the places that wouldn't normally be expected because the husband of the attack was a detective. Bye bye mystery if that happened! So why didn't it? The plot said alien technology, animal sense, and metal alloys was used to scan for evidence, so why not a video camera? Oh that's right, the plot said so.The art in this book, my Rag Morales is just beautiful to look at however, and very emotional throughout the story making one feel as if they were at every scene of the book."},{"Title":"Identity Crisis","review":"This is not your typical super hero saves the day comic. It is not based on the big name heroes and I am not really sure the day is saved. Despite that, or maybe because of it, this graphics novel has been widely popular and critically acclaimed.The story is written by Brad Meltzer, who I believe writes mystery novels. He brings flavor over to this comic. The comic is a \`Whodunit' at its core. Sure there are super powered beings in it, but it shows a more human side to them. They feel pain, they have dark secrets and they tell lies. Meltzer does an excellent job of painting a real and emotional face on these chiseled jaws and hourglass figures.The art fits the story like a glove. Sure everyone has a perfect body, but there is some reality in the mix. This is especially true in the faces. Emotions are captured in sadly beautiful perfection.But this is a mystery novel and everything besides the reveal is just fluff. So was the reveal worth it? It didn't wow me. It tied up nicely and fit in well with the tone of the storytelling. I think I was just looking for some grand, evil scheme.

I did not think any character was misinterpreted. Too often with large group stories - like JLA or Avengers - some characters just come off wrong. Either drawn in a way you just never imagined or written either way off base or to extreme to one character trait (many writers mess up Batman or minor characters). None of that here.This is a murder mystery and though it would not be confused with an Agatha Christie novel, it is well done for the superhero genre.I've read elsewhere that there were other comics that tied in with this story. I don't think that they are needed because the story seems to be self-contained, but they may fill in gaps with side stories that seem to drop. One example is any reaction to what happened to Firestorm. Maybe one of the side comics answers that.Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"Nombres exticos para beb","review":"Thinking this book would provide some unique, &quot;exoticos&quot;, ideas for baby names I ordered it even though IT IS ENTIRELY IN SPANISH.Basically it's a guide for Hispanics not to give their kids reoccuring names and therefore suggests a few names from different cultures including American (e.g. Kenneth).Also, if 110 pages weren't short enough the print and spacing are so large that the book is mostly blank when compared to other naming books that cram the info in.As an alternative I would suggest checking out &quot;Como te Ilamas Baby?&quot; which consists of seperate English &amp; Spanish sides to accomodate sharing between friends or generations."},{"Title":"Nombres exticos para beb","review":"The book at first seemed very thin but inside the set up was great.

His analysis of the contrasting spending habits of Japan and the United States (pg. 26), with a powerful illustration to explain it, and the ramifications for the two countries' futures, is a fabulous insight that kept me reading, and looking for more keen observations.Unfortunately, Mr. Wallerstein's writing, throughout most of the rest of the book, suffers from an all-too-common handicap among researchers and professors: leaden, often indecipherable, academic prose.Here's an illustrative example from page 107: \\"The capitalist world-economy is a historical system that has combined an axial division of labor integrated through a less than perfectly autonomous world-market combined with an interstate system composed of allegedly sovereign states, a geoculture that has legitimated a scientific ethos as the underpinnings of economic transformations and profit making, and liberal reformism as a mode of containing popular discontent with the steadily increasing socioeconomic polarization that capitalist development has entailed.\\"Talking to us throughout the book, with repeated use of words and phrases like \\"bifurcation,\\" \\"chronosophy,\\" \\"praxis,\\" \\"periodizations,\\" and the \\"universalisms [that] presupposed the hierarchies of the modern world-system,\\" the author leaves us wondering what he is trying to say.And the author's over-emphasis on Yalta, the meeting after WWII among the victors of that war, leads to some overly simplistic cause-and-effect statements such as: \\"The collapse of Communism in effect signified the collapse of liberalism...This loss of legitimacy led directly to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, which Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein would never have dared had the Yalta arrangements remained in place. (p. 21)\\"No mention is made here of oil, the geopolitical situation that existed at the time in the Middle East or America's foreign policy under George Bush Sr. and how it affected Hussein's machinations and military strategy; nor is there any analysis of the now-infamous fact of Bush's double-cross of Hussein, wherein one of Bush's diplomats, April Gillespie, when asked by Hussein shortly before he invaded Kuwait, if the United States had any interest in his activities with relation to that country, was ordered by Bush to falsely state that \\"No, we do not.\\"Almost immediately thereafter, Hussein invaded.However, Mr. Wallerstein does have a very topical, intriguing and contrarian argument to make in his book, and one that is deserving of careful analysis: that capitalism is in crisis, and America along with it, and that either, or both, will be replaced or altered drastically, in the coming decades. And his use of \\"world-systems\\" as his method of analysis appears to be highly effective and well-considered.Mr. Wallerstein has done Americans a service by informing them of the very real danger that America is in, economically, politically and otherwise.

We now endure economic stagnation, political instability and social pathologies.He points out that there is no escape from class struggle, internally between those for and those against a more democratic and egalitarian society, externally between those defending nations' sovereignty and those upholding the imperial \`right to intervene'.He has some dazzling insights - \\"The idea that leaders sell out, just like the idea that the masses are falsely conscious, seems to me analytically sterile and politically disabling.\\" But there are weaknesses too, as when he focuses on the \`left' and on \`anti-systemic movements', rather than on the mass, on the necessity for every country to develop workers' nationalism, to control speculative flows of capital and labour.Workers are the immense majority in the world. Migration from rural areas into labour markets has enabled capitalists to relocate, particularly to China. But the world is running out of new sources of cheap labour, and within a generation the new workers learn how to organise for better wages. So wage levels are rising as a percentage of production costs, averaged across the world. Also, taxes to pay for health, education and welfare are rising. Higher wages and taxes squeeze global profits, threatening capitalists' ability to accumulate capital, especially from industrial production.So the USA is a colossus with feet of clay. Its economy is faltering, and it cannot use its military muscle to shape the world the way it wants. Unable to prevail over China and Korea, defeated by Vietnam, it is now trapped in the quagmire of Iraq.Wallerstein concludes, \\"In the history of the world, military power has never been sufficient to maintain supremacy. Legitimacy is essential, at least legitimacy recognised by a significant part of the world. With their preemptive war, the American hawks have undermined very fundamentally the U.S. claim to legitimacy. And thus they have weakened the United States irremediably in the geopolitical arena.\\""},{"Title":"The Decline of American Power: The U.S. in a Chaotic World","review":"Great book.

Johnson achieved national recognition for his decisions that supported Martin Luther King and other leaders of the civil rights movement, and for his defense of the individual rights of women, students, prisoners, mental health patients, and poor criminal defendants. Because these decisions expanded the scope of those Constitutional amendments that assert individual liberties and proclaim the equality of all citizens, Judge Johnson is often viewed as one of the great liberal judges of the Twentieth Century. On the contrary, as Tony Freyer convincingly demonstrates in his analytical introduction and conclusion to this selective collection of Judge Johnson's writings and public statements, Johnson's core values were fundamentally conservative, in that they were \\"based on individual freedom defined in terms of equal opportunity and equality under law.&quot;The law, of course, is the U.S. Constitution, and Johnson's decisions, as his essays indicate, were informed and circumscribed by a profound understanding of the mechanics of the law. As Johnson told Bill Moyers in a 1980 public television interview, the transcript of which is published for the first time in this book, Johnson realized certain limitations when he opposed busing as a tool of desegregation because \\"when you make a child, or children, get up at five o'clock in the morning and wait for a bus to haul them 10 or 15 miles, past schools to which they were formerly eligible to go, then I think you are doing tremendous damage\\". Striving for judicial clarity above and beyond moral fervor, Johnson also said that he had never been inside of a prison or a mental facility because he \\"needed not to go there,\\" but to make his decisions on \\"the basis of evidence that's presented during the adversary proceeding.&quot;Judge Johnson's momentous injunction in Williams v. Wallace that ordered Governor George Wallace to allow a four-day civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery (from March 21 to March 25, 1965), led by Dr. King along Highway 80, was rendered in a carefully crafted opinion based on the principle that the right to protest on public property should be \\"commensurate with the enormity of the wrongs that are being protested and petitioned against.\\"As these essays make clear, Judge Johnson believed that the role of the American judiciary and of the entire legal profession should be one of activism, not on the side of morality, but to maintain the supremacy of the law. Johnson wrote that \\" the lawyer should remember that a disrespect or disregard for law is always the first sign of a disintegrating society.\\"Throughout his forty-one years on the bench, Judge Johnson sought to decide the cases that came before him solely on their particular merits. His injunctive orders that sought to remedy deplorable conditions in prisons and mental health facilities were taken because, in his view, elected officials had failed to discharge their designated and constitutional responsibilities for fair and equitable governance. Judge Johnson clearly believed that all citizens, including the mentally retarded, the insane, and those convicted of felonies, still have certain basic rights to include sanitary living conditions, freedom from unwarranted punishment, and, if feasible, the right to rehabilitation. As he eloquently concluded his essay \\"Equal Access to Justice,\\" the promise inscribed on the Supreme Court Building of \\"Equal Justice Under Law\\" cannot be fulfilled unless there is equal access to justice.Towards the end of his judicial career, Judge Johnson wrote: \\"If we abdicate responsibility to address the difficult questions of our time, those in need of refuge from the torrents of political, economic, and religious forces will find no haven in the law and the law will no longer be supreme. . . . A judge must always be consumed by a passion for justice which propels judgment toward the just conclusion.\\" This forceful summation of an American judge's responsibilities is elaborated in this artfully chosen collection of Johnson's insightful and thought-provoking essays. This is a valuable addition to the biographic literature on Frank Johnson that should be welcomed by all students of recent American History."},{"Title":"Defending Constitutional Rights (Studies in the Legal History of the South)","review":"Federal Judge Frank Johnson achieved national recognition for his decisions that supported Martin Luther King and other leaders of the civil rights movement, and for his defense of the individual rights of women, students, prisoners, mental health patients, and poor criminal defendants.

The person who preferred Moltrecht's book to Sparey's as a source of information about turning obviously got the two mixed up. I too have the Moltrecht texts---they are great as an introductory survey of a huge variety of (mostly outdated) industrial machines and manchinery practices. Sparey's book DOES suffer from poor photography---that seems to be the case with a lot of these English books.But, Sparey really does give a lot of great information. His duscussion, for example, of parting off and how to correctly grind a parting off tool is unsurpassed by any other source of information I have read. Moltrecht's book is better at giving formulaes for calculating cutting speeds, etc. But this is pretty trivial to derive for yourself given a knowledge of basic geometry. Additionally, some of the recommended speeds/feeds are directed towards maximum efficiency in an industrial environment with high-HP machinery--trying some of the cuts on smaller equipment with lower HP (&lt; 5 HP, say) typically found in a home workshop is probably not a good idea. I think Sparey's book does a much better job of presenting information useful for the home workshop.Sparey's quirky British humor is just terrific. His comment, for example, that \\"The acquisition and installation of the lathe is one of the highlights of life.\\" is absolutely priceless.

Finding subject matter specifically targeted for Pattern houses has been difficult.For me, this book would have been worth purchasing just for the introduction. I especially valued the section on Foursquare houses; my home is a Foursquare, which is part of the basis of my nomination. The Sears Roebuck catalog houses and Craftsman sections were also very interesting.In all, &quot;Building by the Book&quot; reflects a thorough study in what is probably a neglected period of building, whereby middle class owners were enabled to build architect-designed homes which would otherwise have been reserved for the wealthy. Pattern books also provided direction for local builders.As a preservationist and owner of a brick Foursquare classical revival pattern house built in the 1920's Craftsman era, I am hopeful that more of these homes will be saved for future appreciation. They generally exhibit a uniqueness that precedes the builder/developer subdivisions we see today.I had hoped to find some history on the &quot;Architect's Small House Service Bureau of the United States, Incorporated&quot;, active in the 1920's, which was administered by the American Institute of Architects and from which my pattern house was derived. If anyone has information, I'd love to have know.Pattern houses were a boon to average citizens here and throughout the United States, enabling them to experience a share of the American Dream &quot;that every American should be able to own a single-family house on its own green acre&quot;.

Is the white male in the work force rapidly becoming a minority? Are 150,000 young American women dying each year from anorexia?Joel Best clearly answers &quot;no&quot; to each of these three questions and, more importantly, shows why many people would say &quot;yes&quot;. His point is that descriptive statistics are the product of a social activity, not just a representation of society. Social advocacy causes people to collect the data that they feel will best support their preconceived notions: They talk to unrepresentative groups. They start to collect new measures and then wonder why the &quot;statistics&quot; have grown since ten years earlier (when they weren't much -- if at all -- measured). They multiply erroneous assumptions. They mutate data. And the press and other publications carry the mutations forward.This book offers plenty of illustrations of intentions run amok. Many of the reports provide useful information for a classroom lecture on the need to discern if a person is &quot;speaking rot&quot;, as Harold Macmillan once said was the primary purpose of an education.A good, crisp 171 pages in length, it is absent discussion of the more difficult inferential statistics and, as a result, it is easy to understand by the lay person."},{"Title":"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists","review":"This is a book about reading and understanding statistics. It is not a book on research methods. As a book that helps to analyze and think critically about statistics, however, it is a book on methodology: the critical comparison of method issues.Best&#8217;s point is a central issue in modern industrial democracy. If we are going to make effective policy choices as citizens and voters, we must understand the issues on which we make decisions. The same holds true for the decisions we make in business life and in research. Many of the choices we make are based on statistical evidence. To make informed choices, therefore, we must be able to think about statistics.A quick summary of the issues and topics in this book offers a good overview of clear thinking on statistical issues. Chapter 1, &#8220;the importance of social statistics,&#8221; explains where statistics come from, how we use them, and why they are important. Chapter 2, &#8220;soft facts,&#8221; discusses sources of bad statistics. Guessing, poor definitions, poor measures, and bad samples are the primary sources of based statistics. Good statistics require good data; clear, reasonable definitions; clear, reasonable measures; and appropriate samples.Chapter 3 catalogues &#8220;mutant statistics,&#8221; the methods for mangling numbers. Most of these arise from violating the four requirements of good statistics, but a new problem arises here. Where is relatively easy to spot bad statistics, mutant statistics require a second level of understanding. As statistics mutate, they take on a history, and it becomes necessary to unravel the history to understand just how - and why - they are mutant. Transformation, confusion, and compound errors create chains of based statistics that become difficult to trace and categorize.Chapter 4, &#8220;apples and oranges,&#8221; describes the dangers of inappropriate comparison. Dangers arise when comparisons over time involve changing and unchanging measures, and projections. Comparison among places and groups lead to problems not merely in the data measured, but in the ways that data may be gathered and collated. Comparison among social problems also creates unique difficulties. Best offers logic of comparison to help the reader understand how to make sense of good comparison and bad.Chapter 5, &#8220;stat wars,&#8221; describes the problems that arise when advocates use questionable numbers to make a case. Chapter 6, &#8220;thinking about social statistics,&#8221; sums up Best&#8217;s advice on understanding statistics. Don&#8217;t be awestruck in the face of numbers, and don&#8217;t be cynical about them, he suggests. Be critical and thoughtful.This book is recommended for every non-statistical researcher who is required to make some use of statistical results in his or her work. It will be especially helpful for those designers who belong to the 2% of the population that one study identifies as victims of UFO abduction. ...."},{"Title":"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists","review":"Joel Best writes a book about statistics for everyman. He does it without using confusing bell curves, without charts of T1 -T2 - T3 standard distributions, and without the i.e. &quot;greater than-lesser than&quot; hieroglyphics one finds in statistical textbooks. This is a book that should accompany a short course given every year of schooling from 7th grade through the end of high school. Think of how difficult this would make it for manipulators of every kind i.e. social researchers, social activists, big corporations e.g. tobacco companies, government agencies, the major media, charities, big labor unions, congress, the White house, who all share something in common; an agenda with which they seek to manipulate the common man.A democracy only works if it has an educated citizenry, and the understanding of the manipulation of statistics, in a society such as ours, probably the most complex in the history of mankind, is essential. The author doesn't try to overwhelm the reader with the many nuances of statistical research and evaluation, he instead implores him or her to rise above being awestruck, naive or cynical about the numbers. He implores us all to engage in critical analysis, in critical thinking. He uses many examples of statistics that are obviously incorrect and tells us how to look behind their numbers and their subsequent conclusions.It doesn't take long to read, and it should be required reading for all of us who vote in our myriad elections. &quot;If it were to be the case the world would be a better place&quot;, and from a practical standpoint the Florida post election fiasco would have been resolved sooner. And, social security would be reformed to the benefit of the bottom half of income tax payers.Learning how statistics are compiled, manipulated, and used is crucial to keeping any society on an even keel.

Or, that 130,000 young women die each year from anorexia? Or, that most medical research has customarily been performed on behalf of men?Joel Best, a professor at the University of Delaware, has written a highly readable treatise on statistics, and how we can become better consumers of the statistical information that permeates the environment in which we live. Not only does he share some egregious examples of the misuse of statistics (as those described in the above paragraph), but he also explains how to become more discerning about statistics as they are (ab)used by partisans of various causes.This book is especially timely in the wake of the furor that erupted at a University of California campus recently when the Independent Women's Forum took out an ad in the student newspaper declaring &quot;Take Back the Campus.&quot; The ad was critical of several statistics that are used by advocacy groups to distort the facts about male college students in their relations with women. One is the &quot;25% of women ... raped&quot; statistic cited above. Rape is a serious crime, that is universally abhorred, but a review of the study used to establish the 25% figure showed that the figure was misleading at best. Professor Best gives a thorough evaluation of this situation, leading to a conclusion that the actual figure is most likely less than 3%.You will not find a better book on how to read statistics and understand their implications.

(3 stars.)"},{"Title":"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists","review":"Statistics are not simple to grasp. Joel Best (a sociologist, past editor of the journal Social Problems) has done a great service by providing the most basic introduction to the topic, indicating how to proceed in trying to make sense of the statistics we encounter every day. I will use it as a supplemental text for my Sociological Research course in the Fall of 2002, and I'm already using examples in my Sociology 1010 (intro) course.Best frames the common views of statistics with a 3-part typology -- Naive, Cynical and Critical. Very similar to the public's reception of mass media news in general it seems to me, Best sees the Naive and Cynical views as only superficially opposite, while in reality more likely to overlap and reinforce one another. (Many people will say they don't believe what they hear on TV, but if they lack any other sources of information, and don't critically evaluate what they do hear, they are likely to absorb and believe much of it regardless.) Best's goal is to educate citizens in the capacity to be Critical of statistics, that is, to start them up a learning curve of questioning, analyzing and judging statistics and claims made on the basis of statistics.How is it, I wonder, that so many first-year college students are seemingly clueless when it comes to statistics? A basic social statistics course would be far more valuable than much of whatever else it is that is taught in high schools these days!"},{"Title":"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists","review":"This is a topic that has a lot of promise and one can do so much with it. However, if you're looking for anything more than just the basics (with a few good examples from social statistics), don't bother with this book. This book starts out by identifying the reasons why statistics get distorted, but then after every 20 pages or so this book reads like the script of groundhog day - the same three points (innumeracy, people with a vested interest and apples and oranges comparisons) are referenced again and again. The topic is fascinating but there is very little substance to keep you occupied for more than 30 minutes."},{"Title":"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists","review":"This book delves into a few of the difficulties an individual would face if he or she tried to get an accurate count of and ultimately make conclusions about a phenomenon. Best gives the reader plenty of examples from the social sciences which demonstrate some of the problems encountered when trying to describe, measure, and ultimately make conclusions about various issues.Best adequately picks up the subject matter just before Darrell Huff's timeless text, How to Lie with Statistics, begins. Like Huff, Best argues that people have incentives to put numbers in front of us (Huff refers to this as axe-grinding), and it behooves us to know who is putting the statistic in front of us, why they chose to put this statistic before us, and most importantly, just how they derived this statistic.Because proponents (and opponents) of an issue, whom Best describes as 'Advocates', can control the way a statistic is generated and presented, we must closely scrutinize the numbers before us so that we can 'untangle the few facts from the various fictions'. Toward this end, the book gives the reader some very helpful questions he or she can ask when attempting to interpret a descriptive (summary) statistic.The practical utility of Best's text is not solely limited to issues in the social sciences. One could easily apply Best's argument to, for example, the ongoing environmental debate. As such, this book is a vital component in developing critical thinking skills that can be applied in all areas both personal and professional.Finally, although this text focuses exclusively on descriptive statistics, limiting itself to contentious and controversial topics in the social sciences, readers should take note that Mr. Best is not presenting a truly original and comprehensive treatment of the subject matter. For example, David S. Moore, author of the text Statistics, Concepts and Controversies, provides a concise, yet rigorous, entertaining and accessible treatment of the same subject matter- including a wider range of examples culled from the fields of education, social and medical sciences, all in the first fifty pages of his text."},{"Title":"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists","review":"\\"There are lies, damned lies, and statistics,\\" everyone knows Mark Twain said. But maybe it isn't really that clear; in his autobiography, Mark Twain includes the quip, but attributes it to Disraeli. In fact, there is a lot about statistics that is not clear, and Joel Best, a professor of sociology and criminal justice at the University of Delaware, wants to clarify it for us. In _Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists_ (University of California Press), he addresses the statistically impaired, which all of us are, more or less. We can judge statistics better, and he has written clearly and enthusiastically about how to do so.The problem is that we are ready to treat statistics as facts. The media like to report them, for they are regarded as little nuggets of truth. The public tends to be receptive of numerical claims, and indeed, some statistics are true, if limited, and useful. But plenty of statistics are bad statistics. It is reasonable, when seeing a statistical claim, to ask who made it and why. An activist group may select a statistic that highlights a social problem, while a government agency may select one that shows there is no need to worry. No matter the origin of the statistic, how it was created needs to be critically evaluated.Best's examples are great fun. Thirty years ago, no one had heard of the crime of stalking, which loomed into importance in the 1990s. There was not a Stalker Information Bureau compiling statistics on the issue, so when an initial news report said that \\"researchers suggest that up to 200,000 people exhibit a stalker's traits,\\" it was not really an arguable number; but it was a number, a nugget, a \\"fact.\\" Then a television talk show declared that \\"there are an estimated 200,000 stalkers in the United States, and those are only the ones we have track of.\\" Then _Cosmopolitan_ modified it upwards to \\"Some two hundred thousand people in the U.S. pursue the famous. No one knows how many people stalk the rest of us, but the figure is probably higher.\\" A statistic has a life of its own, and mutates, just like any story passed by word of mouth, or nowadays on the internet. Activists calling attention to the problem of anorexia estimated that 150,000 American women were anorexic, and noted that anorexia could lead to death. Sure enough, reports based on this began to say that 150,000 women per year were dying of anorexia (the correct figure is about 70)._Damned Lies and Statistics_ will inevitably invite comparison to the classic _How to Lie with Statistics_, but it concentrates more on the social value and advocative use of statistics, as well as how to start to tell the good ones from the bad ones. It is an accessible and amusing book which counsels us to be neither nave about statistics nor cynical, and helps us steer through the numbers so many groups ceaselessly throw at us."},{"Title":"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists","review":"He has some interesting points to make, but the book is very thin, and Mr. Best is a dull writer. For much better books on the same or similar topics, read recent books by Michael Shermer, Barry Glassner, or Wendy Kaminer."},{"Title":"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists","review":"First and foremost, as an avid fan of the topic of Statistics in general, I felt compelled to read this book. I had read another of Joel Best's book, More Damned Lies and Statistics: How Numbers Confuse Public Issues, and it was shocking to say the least. In the process of deciding which book I was going to read I contemplated between How to Lie with Statistics by Darrell Huff, but I felt that book was more of a \`pocket-guide' instead of a dense book. Also, I wanted to read a book that was perhaps more current, in terms of publication than Huff's book. Published in 2001, Best's book shows some current social statistics, which perhaps may be more relevant in our time period.Upon finishing Best's book I notice that it was jam-packed with information that the average person wouldn't know about every day statistics. For example, he touches on the topic of AIDS statistics, and prostitution statistics, in an effort to show that the statistics are skewed. In my opinion, I think it was very appropriate that a sociologist wrote this book because, it is virtually a reflection of how society reports, views, and interprets statistics. It is mind-stirring when he shows that statistics on the same subject cannot be accurately compared if they are from a different time-period. Due to the fact that Ceteris Paribas is not present when comparing statistics from different time periods, in essence they are like comparing, as Best puts it, \\"apples to oranges\\".Also, another startling area of the book is when Best describes the misunderstanding and the fallacies that occur with reporting and interpreting statistics. For instance, in chapter three of his book, he reports that an estimated 150 thousand women are diagnosed with anorexia, or better known as the most common eating disorders among young women. While that may be a \`good' statistic, people began to misinterpret that statistic with the conclusion that 150 thousand women die because of anorexia. This fallacy occurred because people assume that anorexia can be fatal, and since 150 thousand of them had it, they then assumed all of them died. This, as Best puts it, is far from the truth, as less than 100 of them actually die (roughly around 70). He gives other examples of common social problems with statistics and shows that a post-hoc fallacy is very common in a world where people are rather nave when it comes to statistics in general.Perhaps the notion of statistics causing social problems is one too radical for the average American to recognize. How can statistics be the cause of problems? Best also addresses that a \`bad' statistics can cause social problems. On page fifty, Best explains how \\"measurement decisions are hidden\\" and often times some statistical reports ignore controversies about measurement, and even well-established measures can be controversial. Not surprisingly, some of the measurement decisions, are just plain wrong. The reports to some statistics that the media feeds us are just completely wrong.Best mentions another rather relevant problem; \\"questionable definitions\\". He cites that often times the definitions for a particular statistic are vague and can easily be manipulated. He asks us to consider the flurry of media coverage about \`epidemics'. We must ask ourselves, what is an epidemic? More importantly, how does the particular author reporting the statistic define what an epidemic is? Making a vague statement like that can be very dangerous to society. It can spread false fears, and in essence, a misrepresented sense of reality. Another important factor when determining if a statistic is manipulated is based on sample size. Best gives us examples of how a small sample size is really a poor basis for generalizations. For example, let's consider that I ask 3 women to give their view on abortion and they can either choose pro-life or pro-choice. My results are going to be 0%, 33.3%, 66.6%, or 100%, depending on their responses. However, it is absurd to think that a true conclusion can be drawn from such a small sample size.I feel this book is a great book to read, not only for entertainment purposes, but also as a preventative measure regarding everyday statistics that we encounter. In his final chapter \\"The Critical Approach\\", he requests that we use a method of critical thinking when viewing statistics. The author encourages us as a society, to interpret statistics in a skeptical manner, but warns us not to be cynical. We cannot just take statistics at face value. I feel that we hold a responsibility to inform ourselves and view new information with a skeptics view. It is vital to prevent social chaos by swallowing every bit of numbers from the media, politicians, and activists. I think that perhaps if society took a less nave approach to things of this nature, then we would not have so many \\"stat wars\\" in our society. Finally, the most important part of the book is that it encourages the reader to take a skeptic view on social statistics. I recommend this book to virtually any active member of our culture."},{"Title":"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists","review":"This is an informative book on properly interpreting polls and statistics.

This was one I read for my MBA and I really liked it."},{"Title":"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists","review":"Damned Lies and Statistics discusses the use, misuse, and benefits of statistics. Best begins by discussing the importance and evolution of social statistics and their benefits. Statistics began in social policy to relay numbers and give quantitative information about social issues. Statistics are still used for the same purposes today. However, sometimes statistics are used to create new social problems. Activists and government officials use statistics for this purpose. Often society tends to accept statistics as created by officials and should be taken at face value. However, Best recommends society to question how the statistics we trust are created.Next Best discusses \\"soft facts\\" and how statistics are used to evaluate them. \\"Soft fact\\" statistics are statistics of public opinion whereas \\"hard fact\\" statistics are measurable and comprehensible. Guessing is also sometimes factored into statistics. Guessing is often used when enough information can not be gathered and it is obvious other information has yet to be gathered. One example Best uses is statistics of crime rates. Police can only report on crimes reported, however, there are crimes committed that are never reported and those must be taken into account as well.Best also describes mutant statistics. Mutant statistics are statistics that have been changed and twisted. They are distorted beyond the original context and no longer have the same meaning. There are elementary forms of error that create mutant statistics: questionable definitions, inadequate measurement, and bad samples. However, transformation can also be the product of mutant statistics. Transformation occurs when a number is repeated, but a different meaning is portrayed. No matter which type of mutant statistic occurs, confusion will ensue. In addition, once one error in statistical analysis, compound errors, which creates a chain of bad statistics.Inappropriate comparisons can be another source of error in statistics. Comparison can be useful in analyzing statistics, however comparing \\"apples to oranges\\". In addition, changing measures is a form of inappropriate comparisons. Definitions change or measures may become more inclusive or exclusive and comparing statistics over a period of time then becomes negligible. This is mainly covered in chapter 4. This is probably my favorite chapter because it discusses comparisons of social problems, groups, among places and further discuses the logic of comparison.Statistics are useful today in the way we evaluate situations. Not all statistics have been manipulated, but one must be aware of the sources from which they receive their statistics. There are those considered the awestruck readers. These people believe everything they hear or read. There are the nave, these people believe they know about the statistics, but are basically accepting. I would be considered nave readers. I have taken several statistics classes and know how to use basic formulas for statistics, but I am still basically accepting when I hear a statistic. There are also the critical readers. They are not cynical, but rather are skeptical of the sources of the statistics they accept.This book review only touches on a few of my favorite topic Best points out. His analysis is thought provoking and while I hope I may no longer be considered one of the nave, I fear that I will return to the place of the nave, giving up on the amount of effort it takes be remain a critical reader. We will just have to wait and see."},{"Title":"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists","review":"I heard about this book when I was AP Stats trained and have found it to be a great resource for easy to read and relate examples in my classroom. My high school students have been able to understand more difficult topics after I have used some of the scenarios from the book because they have heard similar rhetoric as they have grown up. If nothing else, each one agrees that after hearing me read excerpts from this title, they will each be better aware of the distortions out there and will not believe everything they hear. I highly recommend it for anyone who reads and/ or follows the news and wants to be able to separate fact from fiction.

I hope that my students take away some real lessons. If I could I'd be tempted to ditch the regular text."},{"Title":"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists","review":"Mr. Best's book is really a pamphlet designed to inform the lay person about how statistics are constructed and used. It is also an expose of how statistical information can be exagerrated in the name of a cause. Damned Lies and Statistics succeeds fairly well at both those tasks....And yet, having been through a few courses on statistics in college, I found a great deal of the book was already known to me. This, in and of itself, is not an issue; however, I was somewhat disappointed by the author's analysis of the motives of those who would abuse statistical techniques. I think the book would have benefited from more examples to illustrate his points. After finishing I was left wanting more. I suppose that's why he wrote a followup to this book (More Damned Lies and STatistics).I would recommend this book only to people with very limited knowledge of statistics. If you use statistics regularly or have taken a course or two on the subject, you'll quickly become bored with this."},{"Title":"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists","review":"I teach statistics and research methods to both undergraduates and graduate students, and am always on the lookout for news articles, advertisements, and the like that illustrate any poor and improper uses of statistics in the &quot;real world&quot; in order to get students to recognize them more easily when confronted by them. So it was with great expectation that I came to this book. And I would have to say that I was not disappointed in the statistical points raised. They are all right on the mark. However, as I read through example after example of the misuse of statistics and statistical thinking, I began to notice that the bulk of them were made by liberals. The &quot;subtext&quot; message that was coming across, intended or not, is that only liberals use shoddy statistics to further their political agendas.

Joel Best has done a great job of exposing the fact that most reporters today are either lazy or biased in covering most of the news today that involves the use of statistics. There are many examples in this book of how statistics are manipulated, skewed or just plain invented out of thin air to support a position of many advocacy groups. While Best goes into some of the \\"mechanics\\" of how statistics are misunderstood, he does a great job of exposing the truth about how public policy and opinion are shaped without a full understanding of what the issues really involve."},{"Title":"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists","review":"The indelicate title of this book is taken from the well-known aphorism \\"There are lies, damned lies, and statistics\\" attributed to either Mark Twain or Benjamin Disraeli. It nearly caused me to not read it, unjustly, because the language between the covers is perfectly gentlemanly.Most people, Best tells us, are innumerate. This means that they don't readily spot implausible numbers, and all big numbers are more or less the same to them, whether a million or a billion. Not only the people who hear statistics are often innumerate, but also the people who report them, and not infrequently even the people who generate them.Statistics can be wildly off course for many reasons. They may originate in a guess. But even when they originate in research, there are many factors that can influence their accuracy. The researcher may have interviewed people using leading questions. The subject of the research may be poorly defined. The method of measuring it may be flawed. The sample on which the research is based may not be representative. Or perhaps a comparison was made between two entities that aren't comparable. Numbers may have been mangled by someone who quoted them, such as a reporter. Or the condition described mutates into something else during the retelling. The finesses of complex statistics may be overlooked. Basing new statistics on older ones may result in a chain of bad statistics. And, unavoidably, they are influenced by the interests of the party who compiles them.The author does not mention the statistics used in modernmedical mega-trials, but everything he says about statistics in general applies to those as well.He warns us not to be nave or awestruck by statistics, but not to be cynical either. Statistics, he says, are a valid and useful tool. Not all statistics are bad statistics. So we shouldn't reject all statistics off the bat, just be critical. Of course we should always be critical about everything anyway, he concedes, not just about statistics. I'm afraid I'm not going to take Best's advice. He provides fine questions to ask when examining statistics, but who will answer them? So I am going to join his cynical group, and remain suspicious of all statistics.Best's writing style is refreshingly uncomplicated. This little gem of a book is suitable for a broad audience, including the less sophisticated reader, readers for whom English is a second language, and people who, like me, are innumerate.Best has since (2004) published a sequel to this book, called More Damned Lies and Statistics.Copyright MeTZelf"},{"Title":"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists","review":"This book does what I believe it was intended to do very well: It provides a window through which the general public can get a first glimpse of the dangers of accepting statistics as absolute.

It could have easily been condensed into a single chapter and given the reader the same insight. Many of the same points are reiterated over and over - many times I had the feeling that I had read sentences before. Although it gives several examples of questionable statistics and describes their consequences, the author doesn't do well describing the historical derivation (or motive) in how they were generated."},{"Title":"Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists","review":"\\"Statistics,\\" Joel Best asserts in his concluding chapter, \\"are a sort of fetish,\\" borrowing a term from anthropology to describe objects that different cultures invest with magical powers. \\"We think of statistics as facts that we discover, not as numbers we create. But of course, statistics do not exist independently; people have to create them. Reality is complicated, and every statistic is someone's summary, a simplification of that complexity.\\" And as they say, therein lies the tale.DAMNED LIES AND STATISTICS offers an outstanding introduction to the use and misuse of social statistics. This book is not a mathematical treatise - far from it. In straightforward prose filled with real world examples, Mr. Best deconstructs the processes by which social statistics are created (sometimes as little more than educated guesses) and take on a life of their own, primarily through blind and unquestioning repetition by the media. He also delineates how such statistics are sometimes mutated, misinterpreted, misapplied, and manipulated.In Mr. Best's view, there are no perfect statistics, just better or worse ones. Every statistic involves human choices: defining what to measure, determining how to measure it, deciding whom to count or how to count it, and choosing how to deal with unreported cases (the dark figure) of whatever is being counted. Not only does every statistic contain identifiable but generally unrecognized strengths, weaknesses, and dark figures, but many of the most controversial and heavily publicized statistics were created by people in advocacy positions. As Mr. Best repeatedly points out, advocates use statistics to reinforce public concern about the seriousness of their pet issues. Since large statistics capture more attention, publicity, and financial contributions for the advocacy group than small ones, issue advocates will naturally be drawn toward problem definitions, counting measures, survey methods, and assumptions most supportive of their goals.Mr. Best does a commendable job of citing numerous real world instances of bad or misleading statistics, including several whose original meanings were gradually transformed into altogether different interpretations. His examples range over a full panoply of public domain issues - female deaths from anorexia, prevalence of church arsons, homicide incidence by race, teen suicides, the number of crack babies, attendance figures for the Million Man March, the number of homeless people, the number of children killed with guns, and so forth. The author breaks down his examples into readily understandable classifications, such as bad guesses, deceptive definitions, confusing questions, biased sampling, misinterpretation of results, and improper comparisons between groups or over time. Only in his final chapter, \\"Thinking about Social Statistics,\\" does his penchant for classifications lead him astray. His assessment of how to address the prevalence and too-willing consumption of bad statistics offers little more than a call for the public to stop being nave or hypercritical about numbers and instead become critical consumers. He offers no call for improved practical education about statistics in schools, no demand for better training on this issue in schools of journalism, no request that the media research and report more frequently (even as background on their websites) the methods and assumptions behind the numbers they report. In an age where issue-measuring numbers multiply uncontrollably and are available instantaneously, the public needs more reality check protection and online access to this background information than ever before.DAMNED LIES AND STATISTICS is an easily readable and informative introduction to the human problems of statistics. I recommend it (along with Cynthia Crossen's equally valuable TAINTED TRUTH) as an interesting supplement for high school advanced placement or college statistics classes or first classes in current affairs or sociology. No mathematical background is required, but students and other readers will find much in this text to discuss and contemplate. I recommend this book highly for people of modest math backgrounds who are concerned about the rampant and seemingly uncontrollable growth of fetish-like numbers that purport to define our major social issues. Mr. Best would argue that there is always more to these numbers than immediately meets the eye."},{"Title":"World Without End","review":"Set against a rich background of American and European society, here is a stunning panorama of three unique individuals whose lives have been emotionally interwoven over three decades.CLAIRE: Fragile, intense, seeker of truths, lover of causes, a combination of the conventional and the nonconformist.SOPHIE: Temptuous, sensuous, insatiably curious, a TV star who is professionally tough and privately vulnerable.EDMUND: Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;, painter, art historian, the focus in the women's lives, obsessed with the sacred and the profane.&quot;Emotionally satisfying...delightfully entertaining: a thoroughly adult novel in the fine original sense of the word.&quot; LOS ANGELES TIME BOOK REVIEW&quot;Francine du Plessix Gray displays the one indispensable gift in a novelist - she generates slowly and authoritatively a mixed set of entirely credible human beings.&quot; THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW&quot;A rich, generous book, romantic yet disciplined and brilliantly observed.&quot; COSMOPOLITAN"},{"Title":"John Bonham: A Thunder of Drums","review":"It's nice to finally see a book that focuses on Zeppelin's secret weapon, Bonzo. Not only was he one of the greatest ever, his drum SOUND was without parallel. Reading about how he tuned his drums and other information about he got that sound was invaluable. Like another reviewer stated, too much time was spent on his pre-Zep days, and not enough as part of Hammer of the Gods era. The last chapter, with individual tracks explained was great, but it also have been nice to see some transcriptions of some of his amazing fills, etc. If you buy this book, you also owe it to yourself to buy the new Zeppelin DVD, which allows to see Bonzo in action in a serious way for the first time (it's light years better than \\"The Song Remains the Same.\\").

While I am very interested in Bonzo's pre-Zep days, and how it came to be that he joined Page, Plant, and Jones (although it's mostly well-known by now), I was hoping for an in-depth look and analysis of him as Zep's drummer, the guy I admire so much. Unfortunately, that's not in this book. What I did find was meticulous detail about his adolescent meandering through the local music scene where he lived, leaving one band to join another, and (surprisingly) dressing in somewhat of flashy manner. I wasn't expecting that. I also wasn't expecting this book to devote so much to his pre-Zep work, which is largely uncirculated, while leaving untouched much of his beloved Zep work. Granted, the analysis of select songs he played is on the money, but there's gotta be a whole lotta info about John Henry as Zep's drummer that's yet to be published. Maybe it'll be in the yet-to-be published book by his late brother? Or maybe a biography with contributions from Page, Plant, and Jones (just wishing)? Who knows. Either way, this book is long overdue for those who admire so much of what he meant to Zep's unprecedented sound, and it offers a lot of poignant insights into John that make the book well worth owning.

So, any drummer or rock fan who wants to understand the roots of metal and hard rock, this is one book to read. Sure, the guitarists get all the glory and credit, but Bonham did as much for the sound of rock in the late '60s and '70s as any guitarist.One reviewer wrote that Bonham may not be the most versatile drummer ... while he may not be, he certainly is versatile. Whether employing the Purdy Shuffle in \\"Fool in the Rain\\" or insane bass triplets in \\"Good Times, Bad Times\\" or any number of patterns from jazz, swing, blues, march, or reggae drumming, Bonham is plenty versatile. And the final section of the book helps to show his range through an analysis of his work on most Zeppelin tracks. It is too bad that the analysis didn't include a transcription of at least his signature patterns, but those can usually be found somewhere online. (And it may have been too much trouble for the author/publisher to get the rights to print those transcriptions.) The section on his drums and tuning certainly helps make up for this omission, however.Lastly, while his pre-Zep were interesting, I have to agree with others that too many pages were devoted to it while denying more detail on his Zep days.

He was the reason I wanted to learn to play the drums. This book falls short by skating over many of the Led Zeppelin years. I have read both 'Hammer of the Gods' and 'Stairway to Heaven' and I had high hopes that this book would be as good as those, but just focused more on Bonzo than the whole band. Unfortunately, this book just doesn't cut it as a biography. It's got some neat photos and the analysis of Bonham's playing and his drum setups are great, but the rest of the book is more like a high school term paper. The authors should read 'Stevie Ray Vaughan: Caught in The Crossfire' by Joe Nick Patoski and Bill Crawford for clues about how to write a biography, then try again to write a Bonham biography. The Led Zeppelin DVD is a FAR better investment than this book."},{"Title":"John Bonham: A Thunder of Drums","review":"OK, I love John Bonham, but the authors stated he died when he was 31, CORRECTION!!

A must have for any sailor even if he/she is not a cruiser. Jim Howard deals with all the aspects of cruising under sail with a lot of common sence and safety. If you are a &quot;wannabe&quot; cruiser this book is of great help to organize your dream."},{"Title":"Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising","review":"This book seems to be very thorough, well constructed and executed. I've been collecting alot of cruising books over the past few years in anticipation of a round-the-world cruise (someday), and this book not only answers many of the questions I have, but also is a very enjoyable (and effective) read when your dream needs a booster shot. For this reason alone, it has aearned a place of honor on my nightstand, where it has already, and will I am sure, many times more give &quot;the dream&quot; the neccesary &quot;kick&quot;."},{"Title":"Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising","review":"Nigel Calder's books, although detailed, don't really rub me the right way. Calder tends to analyze boats with everything but a hot tub onboard, and treats HVAC and microwaves like they should be standard issue with a rudder and compass.Howard, on the other hand, is much more basic and simple with his recommendations, but not nearly as spartan as the Pardey's (who are also excellent authors and sailors). Jim's book is generally the first one I'll read on any given subject, and if I can't get enough detail there, I'll look elsewhere.But really, this book should be top of the heap for you. The large section on voices in the night speaks for itself, and shows that Howard obviously has many thousands of miles under his keel."},{"Title":"Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising","review":"This book is the A-Z, top-to-bottom cruiser's guide. There is almost nothing that isn't addressed. Aimed exclusively at the 30-40ft off-shore cruiser. Lot's of good, solid, common-sense tips on every topic.I especially appreciate Mr. Howard's very down-to-earth approach and emphasis on safety first.Very well written with lot's of appropriate antedotes.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising","review":"Jim's book is very entertaining and easy to read. His advice comes from real-life experience and it is explained in terms that any novice would understand. I recommend this book to anyone considering the cruising lifestyle, especially y you are not loaded with a bottomless cruising kitty. This book is full of practical, common sense advice."},{"Title":"Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising","review":"Howard assumes some knowledge of sailing, but you don't have to be an experienced sailor to understand and appreciate this book. It is very well organized and is about as in depth as any *single* book on such a wide subject can be. He isn't afraid to name names when recommending equipment or other books and has a good bibliography and index. If you are at all interested in the *reality* of offshore cruising, buy this book."},{"Title":"Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising","review":"Quite simply, Jim Howard is the voice of reason when it comes to casual offshore cruising. More then once while reading his book I've smacked myself in the head to the thought of, \\"of course, it's so simple, why didn't I think of this before!\\" Yet as informative as the Handbook is, it's an enjoyable read that never takes itself too seriously, often infusing crucial pointers with stories of what's happened in real-life situations and a word on other sailors' perspective of the issue. If you're an amateur sailor who likes to daydream of one day taking a boat around the world, or even just for a hop to a distant island and back, this is a fascinating and thoroughly entertaining read. It will fuel one's daydreams like gasoline on a bonfire, yet keep reality firmly in check.On a more detailed level, Jim Howard ultimately is a cruiser at heart, and leans heavily on the idea of setting up a ship for comfort and, most especially, for bulletproof reliability, and never (as far as I can tell) suggests improvements solely for performance reasons. He'll point out that cruising costs as much as you're willing to afford, and while he'll go into great detail on effectively the cost-benefit of a myriad of ship components, he'll clearly point out what equipment cannot be skimped on, and will even suggest brand names of what is good, what is mid-shelf, and what is to be avoided. The book was copy-written in 1994, which means that while most of the material is still very appropriate (and should remain so for many decades thanks to the timelessness of sailing), information should be regarded with a grain of salt when it comes to more current material such as the cost and functionality of electronic systems, modern composite materials, brand reputations, etc. Everything is written in such as way as to cleanly present you the options, and (usually) not insist on doing things any one way, and so this book essentially forms a very useful framework of common sense with which to make better decisions regarding cruising.If anything, it was a fun read, and one that will make me a better sailor in general, as well as keep an open-but-informed mind regarding offshore cruising."},{"Title":"Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising","review":"I don't know all that much about sailing but I wanted to learn, especially about cruising, and this book is IT if you want to learn about that. It is not for beginners, the author assumes you already have a certain degree of knowledge/experience about sailing, nonetheless the basics are reviewed and I was able to quickly glean the basics from this book without buying \\"sailing for dummies\\" or something like that. If you are considering cruising this is a great book because it has many realistic tips on how to equip your boat for an extended cruise. The chapters about building your own boat are not comprehensive so if you are thinking in that direction you will need additional info there, but it does give you an idea of what you're in for if you decide to build your own. Detailed info on materials and cruising boats in general, plus many references for other sources of info, is a good cruising hand book indeed!

A bit spoiled by intrigue of the nasty sort."},{"Title":"Janissaries Iii Tr (Janissaries, No 3)","review":"In the first two Janissaries books we were introduced to Rick Galloway and his band of mercenary soldiers as they are kidnapped by aliens and transported to Tran, a world trapped in the middle ages, to grow illicit drugs for the aliens. We followed Galloway's adventures as he befriended the locals and tried to introduce technology to improve their lives and defend themselves against their enemies.This final volume to the Janissaries series was a disappointment on a number of levels. Most significantly, while it does further develop the activities of the human servants of the alien civilization off of Tran, that part of the story is never brought to a conclusion. Also not resolved it the question of the preparations of the humans on Tran for the coming \\"Time.\\" We are not provided with any closure on the question of whether the mercenaries will be able to prepare their new friends and allies to survive the coming conflict with the aliens.The first two-thirds of this book delve deeply into the political intrique, and it is only in the last third that we return to the faster paced military story. Unfortunately, the book ends with the battle, without resolving any of the important plot lines. In many ways, it feels like another book was meant to follow this, but no such follow up seems to exist. It isn't clear why so much time was spent developing these plot lines if the ending was intended to leave them unresolved. The ending of the first book was much more satisfying, and that book can clearly stand on its own, but by the end of the third book, the reader deserves a more complete ending."},{"Title":"Janissaries Iii Tr (Janissaries, No 3)","review":"If you like Janissaries and Janissaries: Clan and Crown, you'll enjoy Storms of Victory.

Having read the first two many times, I was excited to find that a third had been written and was very anxious to read it. The book started out very good and includes an appendix to help keep all the characters and geography straight. This was a big help as many of the characters have similar sounding names, and the maps are hard to read. In many ways, this book is the most well written of the three; and promised to tie up many loose ends that were left from the first two. Unfortnuately, it did not. I strongly suspect that the author planned to write a fourth book because the ending fell flat. No spoliers here, but there is at least one major question/issue that has been hanging on since the very begining that is not dealt with. Still, if you have read and enjoyed the first two, it is worth reading. Just be prepared for a little dissapointment at the end."},{"Title":"Janissaries Iii Tr (Janissaries, No 3)","review":"I remember reading Janissaries Clan and Crown first. I was intrigues by the story and the rich combination of cultures and in depth characterizations of the various cultures that Jerry used for Tran. A definite illustration of his rich and in depth knowledge of history. With Storms of Victory we get into an era that Jerry especially excels at. The history of Rome is obviously near and dear to his heart and how he melds it into the rich tapestry of Tran, the horsemen, and the war with the five kingdoms is truly a work of art. Of all the book series I own, this is one that I can start at any time regardless of mood or circumstance. I am eagerly anticipating the fourth book in the series. I was so glad to hear that he had recovered from his cancer. Here's hoping for a long life of creative efforts and a good life."},{"Title":"Janissaries Iii Tr (Janissaries, No 3)","review":"Perhaps if enough of us let him know, Roland Green will finish this series, or turn it over to someone who will!

I won't even start Peace Company, since I understand you haven't completed that series either.Otherwise, an excellent book, but you need to read the books in sequence to understand the background, and to understand why the characters make some of the choices they do.

Often, a young writer will expend much energy on developing their own &quot;voice&quot;, whereas Mr. Ringler seems to have located his already, and it sings throughout this collection of stories. Individually, they range from fragments and parables to film script-like condensed epics. As a whole, they form an emotional montage drawn the vacuum of adolescent angst. The pieces in this book, if at times indulgent and unfocused, are nonotheless brutally sincere, full of subtle and not-so-subtle derisive stabs at a &quot;for granted&quot; society and fine portraits of the &quot;quiet desperation&quot; so many people face every day. I'm anxious to see what is next."},{"Title":"Back from Nothing","review":"I happened across this book by accident, and purchased it because of all the great reviews. After reading it, I went back to this page and came to the conclusion that all the five-star reviews were probably written by friends of the author.It is a wonderful accomplishment for anyone to have a book published, especially small, unknown authors who have to self-publish. I am happy to spend money to support that, however, please don't be mislead by the raving reviews.This is a book of angst, not of truth. Disjointed paragraphs ramble on almost incoherently for pages. Maybe the second half gets better, but I really had no desire to read any further. It seemed like the author was trying to be shocking, artsy and intellectual, but through trying so hard he came off sounding young, angsty, and egotistical. Who knows though... could be a cult hit in the halls of high schools.There may be potential for growth here, if the author would allow the reader to think for ones self and draw ones own conclusions by presenting more subtle hints and suggestions.In short - buy this if you want to suppor the arts. Pass if you're looking for something that will offer intellectual or spiritual growth for the reader."},{"Title":"Back from Nothing","review":"I don't know what book the reviewers of this book read, but it certainly wasn't &quot;Back from Nothing.&quot; After struggling through the first 3 stories I put it away.

Its great, go buy it."},{"Title":"Back from Nothing","review":"Back From Nothing gives readers glimpses into characters. But BFN is more than a character study, it is a full range of moments, awful truths, horrifying images, and painful dialogue that will scar the reader. This book is not to be taken lightly; and it is this specific reason that this book must be read and never forgotten. It is specific moments in our lives that we can see wrong roads taken and relfect upon this. The lives of Ringler's characters are forever changed by the situations they face and the boldness of Ringler's delivery (often his characters do not see outside themselves, they are reacting to &quot;moments&quot;; just as we do not objectively realize the outcome of our actions - THIS is refreshing from a writer. It is great to read characters who are not &quot;know-it-alls&quot; and always right. Ringler captures reality with his first attempt). You can find aspects of true brillience and still see the potential hidden within Ringler's grasp. The book lacks continuity, however Ringler may have done this purposefully to keep his readers on their toes. And a few stories (only 4 in over 3 dozen)lack any defining moments and needed to be played out for one more page. The great aspects of this book out way the quibbles i have just mentioned. The uniqueness of BFN is more than enough reason to buy it and even more of a reason to go back and read 1 or 2 stories every two years. I beleive that Ringler has chronicled the lives of invisible people; people who exist below the surface of everyday life and more importantly; REAL PEOPLE. Open it. Read it. This is the true history of our lives."},{"Title":"Back from Nothing","review":"A Wild emotional ride. An all out assault on the senses. This book will bring out all kinds of emotions in you.

Chris Ringler's style is unique, there's almost no one to compare him to. His stories are filled with horrific imagery that stays in your mind long after you've put the book down. This is also a book that is better taken in short sessions than big chunks, because after a few pages you'll find you need to catch your breath before plummeting back into Ringler's abyss. Ringler's stories involve people of all ages from all backgrounds, and almost anyone will find someone they recognize within his smorgasbord of characters. They are your troubled youths, your religious fanatics, your pathetic souls that have nothing better to do than watch the home shopping channel at four in the morning, and even your star-crossed lovers. Give BFN a chance, you won't be disappointed. You will find it a refreshing, albeit disturbing, change of pace from all the paint-by-numbers writers cluttering the bookshelves. The only reason why this book doesn't get five stars is because the stories are arranged in a somewhat haphazard manner - though I guess that is excusable since this is his first book.

It showed me the steps to follow and I didn't have to deal with pre-conceived notions about different franchises. I really liked the chapter about negotiating the franchise agreement since I didn't know very much about that subject. I highly recommend this book for someone looking to buy a franchise.\\""},{"Title":"Franchising from the Inside Out","review":"I didn't find the book justified its cover price as I didn't feel the author wrote this to help franchisees although he had some sage advice. Instead, the author has worked for Franchisors and he has that mindset. The reader should know that up front and take what he has to say with a grain of salt.Teixeira dangerously explains how to negotiate less significant areas of the franchise agreement such as renewal terms while justifying the franchisor's position not to negotiate other CRITICAL aspects such as termination clauses. This can trap unsuspecting franchisees in a system of indentured servitude for the term of the contract even though the franchisor breaches the contract! Amazingly, to top this off, the author admits never taking a franchisee's house through litigation while implying he was justified to take everything else of value.He also fleetingly mentions that franchisees should expect to accrue equity in their franchise operation from the many years of building the business but it is well known that franchisors often won't allow that to happen. In fact, the author devotes some pages explaining how the franchisor may buy the business for below market value and is justified in doing so.In addition, he doesn't differentiate business format franchises from product franchises (e.g. distribution franchises for Chevrolet, Coca-Cola, Budweiser, etc). He discusses how franchisees should expect the franchisor provide what they are obligated to provide in return for 5-7% royalty payments. This makes it sound like the franchisee receives a recurring tangible product or service from the franchisor when they do not. In fact, the majority of franchisors merely provide trademark licensing and a process of closing a sale. As can be expected, many franchisees of these business format franchise systems become disillusioned very quickly.In order to fairly balance the decision making process, any prospective franchisee owes it to themselves to buy the Purvin book called Franchise Fraud. You won't get that balance from the Teixeira book alone."},{"Title":"Franchising from the Inside Out","review":"This book told me exactly what I needed to know.

It was easy at first to peg the &quot;good&quot; and the &quot;bad&quot; people. But as the story went on, good and bad started depending on your point of view, and as the characters grew. The author's descriptions of sights, smells and sounds make you feel as though you were part of the story.I would highly recommend this book to everyone, at least for it's historical perspective on 1st century English monarchy, religion and Roman relations.

Torn between two women, the gentle warrior Rhiannon, and the Druid priestess, Taran, Caratacus takes his place as the great British battle leader opposing Roman invasion, to be brought in chains but never in defeat to Rome.Every British schoolchild knows the name of Caratacus.

A worthy read."},{"Title":"Pathology Secrets","review":"Finally a book that asks only the questions you need to know. Finally a book that ignores unnecessary details and instead focuses on practical knowledge. This book is for anyone who has ever sifted through a huge pathology textbook wondering what is important. Finally a patholigist and teacher lays out what is important. In addtion to pathology, this book is great for genetics, biochem, endocrinology, and pathophysiology. If you can learn what is in these pages you will have the base you need to answer any USMLE question and you will amaze your residents in year three as you show a broad based knowledge of disease that you can actually use."},{"Title":"Creation Spirituality: Liberating Gifts for the Peoples of the Earth","review":"The previous reviewer claims &quot;Jesus never hated anyone.&quot; He did seem, however, somewhat angry at the money-changers in the temple - not becaue they were carrying on a business as such but because they were cashing in on the gullible under the guise of religion. When I went to a lecture by the Reverend Mr Fox on &quot;creation spirituality&quot; at the local University, it was interested to see tables set out outside the lecture theatre selling his books with a merry jingling of cash-registers. No prizes for guessing what it reminded me of. Who:whom? Lenin was wont to ask. In this case; who got the money? And how does this alleged apostle of anti-capitalism get the wherewithal to travel the world promoting his ill-written and error-filled books? Hardly &quot;religious right&quot; questions but worth thinking about. As for the actual intellectual content of the work, it is beneath criticism but not beneath a proper contempt."},{"Title":"Creation Spirituality: Liberating Gifts for the Peoples of the Earth","review":"Matthew Fox has &quot;rediscovered&quot; mystical Christianity, which celebrates the &quot;Christ&quot; present in all of creation. Such mysticism was a significant movement within Christianity during the Middle Ages, but it was effectively silenced by the centralized Church and then ignored when enlightenment ideologies favored much more reductionistic, as opposed to mysticism's more holistic, thought. Fox astutely notes that the same worldview expressed by mystical Christians has also been appreciated by Jewish and Muslim mystics, and by aboriginal peoples. He is particularly drawn to Native American traditions. Fox suggests, I think correctly, that spiritualities that focus on personal salvation with little regard for the rest of Creation tend to be spiritually unfulfilling for the undividual and destructive for the world."},{"Title":"Creation Spirituality: Liberating Gifts for the Peoples of the Earth","review":"For those looking for a spirituality that is positive and all embracing, vursus one which is exclusive and judgemental, this is the place to start. Matthew Fox introduces the reader to ideas and themes that are more fully developed in his book &quot;Original Blessing&quot;. Original Blessing v. Original Sin is one such theme. Others are the Four Paths of Creation Spirituality, art as meditation, liberation for First World peoples, and the return of true Trinitarian Christianity.Bottom line: Matthew Fox puts forward a Christianity that is a beautiful relection of Jesus the Christ and shows how such a Christianity can help to heal the world."},{"Title":"Creation Spirituality: Liberating Gifts for the Peoples of the Earth","review":"For those of you who dont't know,Matthew Fox is the only man who dares to find the connections between seemingly conflicting dogma. He is the freshest voice. He is a true Christian- one who loves, who accepts, one who ministers. The hate ridden religious right has a lot to learn from Matthew Fox.Jesus never hated anyone. Creation Spirituality is a good primer for the next millenium"},{"Title":"Creation Spirituality: Liberating Gifts for the Peoples of the Earth","review":"Have you ever looked at the Moon with a pair of binoculars? Or at the rings around Saturn with a telescope? Or thought about a Hummingbird flying to Central America? Or saw in a flower the rays of the sun, the minerals of the earth, the awareness of day and night?Jesus was not fixated on any one aspect of reality. He was not a religious fundamentalist. Jesus was a mystic that was so awestruck by the Cosmos that he gave his life for all life. God is no respecter of persons. God is not isolated by anything or anyone. God is a part of everything. God is omnipresent. Everything has value. Everything is worthy of honor. Not just mankind. A shephard without a flock is superfluous. Though each aspect of reality has its role none is above the other for everything is interconnected. We do not have to climb a ladder to get to God. God is within as well as without. Heaven is beneath our feet.Creation theology is a glass is half-full perspective. A holistic perspective. A fresh start. Hopeful. Original Sin theology tends to be a glass is half-empty perspective. A narrow perspective. A dead-end. A never ending dark night of the soul. With that said; Pope John Paul II turned original sin upside down with his affirmation that there is no evil from which God cannot draw forth a greater good. John Paul had the heart of a lion and the eyes of an eagle. He was fearless and could see a blade of wheat in a field of weeds. He was truly a great man of God. Personally, I prefer the easier and more positive approach to my religion. Jesus did not die for our sins, he died for us. This may be more a matter of semantics than an actual difference. Though our perspectives may be different, we are still looking at the same thing. In any event, a Cosmological perspective is the perspective of God. God looked at his creation and it was good. Original Sin theology is for the most part the product of State Religion. It is based on fear and shame. True Christianity, the kind the Pope preached, is fearless. He had enough confidence in his God that he did not feel he had to defend his faith every time he talked to someone of another Faith. He had reduced God down to his simplest terms, God is love. The Pope was more a moral man than a religious man. Jesus was more a moral man than a religious man. (I am amending this review after the Death of Pope John Paul II). Fundamentalist religion, as opposed to spirituality, all too often is used by the powerful to control the weak, to divide and conquer. \\"The Love-Religion has no code or doctrine. Only God\\", Rumi. Creation Theology is a liberating religion based on awe and joy. Wisdom does not start with 'fear', that is a poor translation, wisdom starts with 'awe', wonder, amazement, joy. Go and sin no more. You are free. If the next Pope is from Latin America, I believe even more of the sensitivities of Creation Theology will find their way into the Catholic Church. This would be a good thing. God cares about life, not just human life.Some of the other reviewers have chosen to attack Fox. That the Dominican Order excommunicated him is true. Their Order also conducted the Inquisition. That Fox slips into Pantheism, that nature is God. Actually he slips into panentheism, that nature is part of God. A nuance perhaps, but a fundamental nuance nontheless. All monotheists make 'one' fundamental mistake, that all is numerically one. Trinitarians are onto something but don't quite realize what it is. Let 'us' make man in 'our' image. If all is numerically one then it is all just a game. A license to kill in the name of God. A license to do whatever one pleases like the hedonistic Nicolatians. The background for the despair of existentialism and the schizophrenia of solipsism. This is wrong thinking. All is not numerically one. Reality is much more complicated than that. Everything is not the figment of our imagination. All is more than one but less than two. And this makes all the difference in the world. The whole of everything, the Universe, God, the Tao, is not a linear function. One is a number, God is not a number. Not one. This misperception is due to the fundamental error of applying dualistic logic to the nondual realm of reality.There are fundamentally two aspects to reality. The dual and the nondual. The dual side of the coin is where we find ourselves at present. Up/down, good/bad, duality. Nonduality, the spirit realm that includes duality but goes beyond time and space, good and evil, is not to be understood properly based solely upon a dualistic perspective. All wholes manifest a synergetic effect wherein the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The tensile strength of steel is far greater than the sum of the tensile strength of the individual minerals and metals used to create steel. God is not One. God is whole, more than one, but less than two. And in between one and two lies infinity. God is neither alone nor all one. We are not alone. Things matter. Life isn't just a game of pretense, though there are certainly elements of game playing going on. Life is 'like' a masquerade ball. A dance. More verb than noun. Even Advaita sages create a dualism with their need for Maya as a means of contrasting the One. They are confused. The blind leading the blind. Our world is real. Impermanent in its configuration but real nonetheless. That one never stands in the same river twice does not mean the river is an illusion. Because one cannot put a river in a bucket nor the wind in a bag does not mean they do not exist. To reason purely discursively like the Kantians do is an exercise in futility where nonduality is concerned. Idealized Continental philosophy is a maze in the middle of a minefield. Nonduality is a labyrinth in the holy of holies, the heart. In my Father's house there are many mansions, and if it were not so I would tell you. More than one, less than two. We are a point, a morphogenetic field of spiritual energy, a seed of divinity, between one and two. Made in the image of God we are godlike beings for it takes a god to worship God. We are godlike but not God, lest any man should boast. The Father and I are a fractal symmetry.Thou essence art that essence."},{"Title":"Creation Spirituality: Liberating Gifts for the Peoples of the Earth","review":"This is an easy eye opening read to the cosmos of Matthew Fox and his reclaimed vision of true human spirituality. Having spent his life challenging many long standing, but non-biblical, Christian doctrines and dogmas (and being excommunicated for doing so), he opens the door to the cosmos which is the source, quest and goal of Creation Spirituality and the recognition, affirmation and celebration of all people's spirituality. He doesn't create new senses of spirituality or just another collection of doctrines and dogmas; he affirms the spirituality inherent in our history and in our lives today.Buy \\"Original Blessing\\": his seminal, detailed discourse on Creation Spirituality at the same time an read on...He allows us to embrace all the world's spirituality as common to our own.

During my recent sabbatical, I put some effort into such an essay, and the result is this short book. While on sabbatical I traveled ... and if I was awakened to anything during those trips, it is this: The issues that creation spirituality addresses have worldwide significance.\\"He suggests that after the Galileo affair in 1616, science and religion parted ways. \\"Today, however, science is once again interested in the sacred, and creation spirituality provides a bridge between the two.\\" (Pg. 15) He endorses panentheism (\\"God is in all things and all things are in God\\"), which reminds us that \\"we are all beautiful, all interdependent, all necessary in a single web of life.\\" (Pg. 104-105)He suggests that \\"spirituality is praxis... Thinking about God is no substitute for tasting God, and talking about God is no substitute for giving people ways of experiencing God.\\" (Pg. 74)He summarizes, \\"creation spirituality can be understood as a liberation theology for 'First World' peoples... the movement to liberate the overdeveloped peoples of the northern hemisphere indeed parallels liberation theology in the south. The north... remains severely underdeveloped in our imagination and spirits and indignation. We need to get on with the task of liberating ourselves.\\" (Pg. 87)This book is nevertheless a very accessible introduction to Fox's thinking."},{"Title":"Creation Spirituality: Liberating Gifts for the Peoples of the Earth","review":"This book does a really good job of showing how the world is seen through the eyes of Creation Spirituality. If you have already read Original Blessing, this is a great follow up. I must say though, Original Blessing is a must read. If you want to read anything by Fox, read that first and then come back to this book."},{"Title":"Creation Spirituality: Liberating Gifts for the Peoples of the Earth","review":"Fox draws on many sources such as Meister Eckhart and Hildegard of Bingen to try to craft a spirituality based on awe of Creation. What I fear however is that his slide towards pantheism denies some of the rich spiritual gifts of Christ and the Holy Spirit. For example it is Eckhart who says \\"God begets his Son in you whether you like it or not.\\" (See for example the book \\"Meister Eckhart from Whom God Hid Nothing : Sermons, Writings, and Sayings\\", or Schurmann's analysis of Eckhart in \\"Wandering Joy\\"). Subsequent to this book, Fox was expelled from the Dominican order in 1993.At times Fox also seems to blame all that is ecologically corrupt on traditional Christianity, for example \\"Pantheism is not only democratic, it is also ecological, Theism, on the other hand, reinforces anthropocentrisms \\". Additionally he makes a broad claim that \\"Creation Spirituality\\" encompasses such broad divergent groups as \\"AA\\", Support groups, and Protestant parishes.Though I agree with Fox's quest for a deeper ecumenism, he seems to pick what he wants out of the Christian tradition. I still find ample mining in a more traditional, though slightly broadened views of the Holy Trinity, rather than his Cosmology, Liberation, and Wisdom. Although I don't always agree with Fox, he does offer an injection of joy and awe."},{"Title":"Road through Kurdistan;: The narrative of an engineer in Iraq,","review":"The book \\"Road Through Kurdistan\\" is a fascinating first hand account of A.M. Hamilton, a civil engineer from New Zealand, who built roads in the mountainous Kurdish area of Iraq along the border with Iran. He provides a detailed description of the Iraqi and Kurdish peoples who he worked with in building the roads through incredibly steep and treacherous terrain. It was a formidable effort. I read a first edition (1928) of \\"Road Through Kurdistan\\" belonging to a Swedish geotechnical engineer who designed and built two dams in the 1950's for the Iraqi government in essentially the same region. One dam was located at Bekhme on the Greater Zab River north of Arbil and west of Rowanduz, very close to Mr. Hamilton's road. The other dam was at Derbendikhan on a tributary of the Tigris River, northeast of Baghdad. To pass his spare time in Iraq, my Swedish friend, Svante Hjertberg, read A.M. Hamilton's book with delight. Now I had the same joy reading the book and sharing Svante's experiences in Iraq. The fact is, Svante could have written the book himself because he had so many similar experiences, working and traveling in Kurdistan, as Mr. Hamilton. When Saddam Hussein came to power and began killing his enemies, the U.S. engineering companies working for the government of Iraq were forced to pull out. The book contains unique photographs and maps and is a great read for anyone wishing to learn about the terrain and peoples of Kurdistan and the issues of constructing public works facilities in remote, inhospitable countries using indigenous people."},{"Title":"Road through Kurdistan;: The narrative of an engineer in Iraq,","review":"\\"Those rocks had stood there since before the birth of the first Kurdishman, would they not stay yet another thousand years? 'The ... engineer is just a little mad,' they said, 'but otherwise harmless; let him alone and see what happens.'\\" - the opinion of the local tribesmen on Hamilton's labors to build his road\\"I looked and was satisfied that all was as it should be, and signaled to the men that it was done. And up from the depths of the canyon there arose the exultant roar of men's voices that reached almost to the mountain-tops.\\" - Hamilton's recollection of the moment when the Rowanduz River Gorge was successfully bridgedAfter the First World War, the League of Nations assigned the subject territories and overseas colonies of the vanquished nations to the governmental administration of the victors. Such lands were known as \\"mandates.\\" Mesopotamia (Iraq), formerly a province of the Ottoman Empire, was given to the United Kingdom as a Class A Mandate, and the U.K. administered the area from 1920 to 1932, when Iraq itself became a member of the League.In 1927, New Zealand-born and trained civil engineer, Archibald Milne Hamilton, was sent to Mesopotamia as part of the Public Works Department. Soon after his arrival, he was given sole responsibility for completion of the Arbil-Rowanduz road through the mountains of Kurdistan, an area heretofore inaccessible by motor transport and barely so by animal caravan. The most daunting obstacle to the road's completion was the dramatically rugged Rowanduz River Gorge, through which the paved highway needed to be constructed. It took Hamilton four years to do it, but it was ultimately a miracle of contemporary engineering.ROAD THROUGH KURDISTAN is Hamilton's personal account of the project's undertaking and achievement.Written in the matter-of-fact, detailed, markedly lucid (and always engaging) style that one might expect from a trained engineer, Hamilton's narrative is of a job well-done with a multinational workforce drawn from historically antagonistic factions and amidst terribly difficult terrain and always-dodgy tribal support. Occasionally - and all too infrequently by my mind - the author displays a dry wit, as when he describes the process of calculating his workmen's pay:\\"I sat in my little tent, and computed the amounts due to each man according to his attendance and his rate of pay, while scorpions and large brown beetles clinging to the sides of the tent took stock of my columns of figures.\\"Though arguments can and will rage over the benefits, or lack thereof, of imperialism in general to the lands and societies of the ruled, there can be little argument, I think, that Hamilton and his road represents British imperialism at its finest. The King could never have stood prouder than after the service of this fair-minded, generous, and extremely capable servant of the Empire. Honor is due.ROAD THROUGH KURDISTAN contains thirty-three photographs and two maps.And, for those so interested, the author's observations about the Kurdish people will perhaps serve as the beginning of an appreciation for the nature, strength, and resilience of their independent spirit which has proved so problematic for their neighbors - the Iraqis, Iranians and Turks - who even today would wish to bring them to heel, but can't."},{"Title":"Road through Kurdistan;: The narrative of an engineer in Iraq,","review":"This is one of those rare books that one finds by someone \\"on the ground\\" who writes accurately as well as entertainingly.

By Deirdre Bair. 736 pages. New York and London: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1978. ISBN 0-15-179256-9 (hbk).In 1971, while casting about for a dissertation topic, Deirdre Bair wrote to Samuel Beckett (1906-1989) to ask if she could write his biography. He replied that, while he was not prepared to help her, he wouldn't hinder her either. As things turned out, he did help her to some extent, as did many others, and the result is this well-written, well-researched, and extremely illuminating account which covers the story of Beckett's life up to 1973. Although it has since been superseded by the fuller biography, 'Damned to Fame,' by Beckett's personal friend and official biographer, James Knowlson, which appeared in 1996 and which covers the whole of Beckett's life, Bair's book seems to me to be still well worth reading. The fact that she was not a personal friend had both disadvantages and advantages. Although it meant that certain things were closed off to her, at the same time it left her a certain freedom, the freedom to say things a friend might be disinclined to say.Briefly Bair sees Beckett's mother as the key factor in his formation - a cold, frigid, and neurotic woman dominated by notions of class and respectability, and determined to mold him into an ideal son who would be respected by Protestant and materialistic upper middle class Dublin society. Beckett rebelled against this treatment from an early age, and the regular campaigns of psychological torture which his mother launched whenever things didn't go her way were to lead to his years of misery, repeated bouts of serious physical illness, and eventually to the full-blown psychosis which is evident in certain of his works. With a more balanced and loving mother, and one sensitive to her son's aesthetic nature, Beckett might have led a normal and happier life, though it is doubtful he would have arrived at the shattering insights into human nature and reality that helped make him one of the greatest writers of the age.The story of Beckett's life and his extreme sufferings and spiritual anguish, as told by Deirdre Bair, is both horrifying and fascinating, and she does seem to have done her best to present it as objectively as possible, though she does allow her distaste for certain of his views to peek through at times. From her account, which covers far more than his devastating love-hate relationship with his mother, and which I can't even begin to do justice to here, we come away with an enhanced understanding of Beckett that should help anyone to better understand and appreciate his somber and often difficult works.It's true that as a mere graduate student she could hardly be expected to have a grasp of Beckett's works as extensive as that of a seasoned professor such as Knowlson. It's also true that there appear to be a number of errors and misunderstandings in her work, possibly because of her limited access to materials. But her less unctuous attitude to her subject leads me to feel that we are perhaps getting a more objective portrait of Beckett, though one that in some respects is not as detailed as that provided by Knowlson, and the serious student will want to read them both."},{"Title":"Amours fideles (French Edition)","review":"Richard Ellman gave the the world the casting for what would be known as the perfect biography, James Joyce. Thus, as Beckett recanted when he stated Celine's Journey to the End of the Night was the greastest novel in the English language before pausing and explaining that Joyce is on a level that no one should have to be compared, I must state this is a good effort on Bair's behalf. The pace is well kept until the end, when things seem rushed. It ends with &quot;1973-.&quot; I would love to see her go back and finish the text since Beckett's demise. I would not state that this text gives ample evidence of Beckett's insanity. Anyone wired directly to the world's pulse as we Beckett, will indeed suffer the psychosomatic symptoms that he underwent throughout his life, as do most greast artists. Their illnesses, physical and mental, are defense mechanisms to protect themselves from their selves. Beckett is no different and in some cases to be considered elevation upon the &quot;upper teir&quot; with the world's greatest artists. All in all this is a great text, especially how Bair projects Beckett's comments without interpertation, thus insinuating that he should not be trusted at all times.

Considering the complexity of the play, if any human were able to throw such materials onto the page without effort . . . see for yourself."},{"Title":"Amours fideles (French Edition)","review":"I just read Bair's book. Impressed by her diligence and appetite for detail. Some interesting insights: for example, she claims that much of the dialogue in Godot was taken verbatim from his conversations with Suzanne, his lover, while fleeing from Paris during the war years when his resistance circle was busted by the Nazis. On the minus side, much of her psychology is too simple-minded and pat, with too much emphasis on his love-hate relationship with his mother. Worst of all, time and again she claims access to his thoughts and feelings way beyond what she can possibly have known. So many contradictions in his character that after reading it, still have no idea what really drove him."},{"Title":"Amours fideles (French Edition)","review":"As one who is attempting to read almost all there is to read regarding Samuel Beckett, I have to rate Bair's attempt as weak at best. I can't even begin to explain how far off she is attempting to characterize Sam, as he was a true sympathetic, modest, and generous person. Her allegations of his romantic encounters with actress Billie Whitelaw are completely unfounded, as Billie has explained countless times in interviews and her &quot;chatterbox&quot; sessions.It is also important to understand that Deirdre Bair was a PhD STUDENT when she was working on this book, and that Sam said he would neither &quot;help nor hinder her,&quot; meaning it was not authorized. If you looking for a solid academic study of the life of Samuel Beckett, I suggest you turn to &quot;Damned to Fame,&quot; a work by renown scholar and PERSONAL FRIEND of Sam, and the ONLY authorized biography of Beckett. This book provides a truthful and honest look at the wonderful person Sam was, and doesn't turn to unfounded selacious details for dramatic effect."},{"Title":"Amours fideles (French Edition)","review":"I am surprised no one has reviewed Bair's book. She did a lot of careful research, using what interviews and letters there are. She is circumspect and detailed, learned but not boring.

It is decently written, has an imaginative premise, and is considerably better than many better known books in the genre.

The format and cast of charactors were second to none. Some of the humor with Eddie Anerson's Rochester will make you cringe. Not as racist as Amos and Andy but still playing to a stereotype.

The hero and the heroine meet again after she secretly has his baby. They were separated because she found out he was engaged and his fiance set her up to look like she stole jewelry. Of course, he believed the evil fiance & cast the poor heroine out of his life so that she was forced to have the baby she conceived without his knowledge alone. Read it to see how he finds out he was wrong, gets the heroine to forgive him, etc., etc."},{"Title":"The Italian's Marriage Demand (Harlequin Presents)","review":"The heroine was a temporary nanny working with two small children when her employer's brother stops in to check up on the kids. It's love at first sight and they spend the three weeks left of her employment getting to know each other on an intimate level. Sophie's dreaming of marriage and certain that Ettore is going to propose until on her last night there she finds out he's engaged to another woman. Not long after finding that out she's confronted by Ettore and his fiancee being accused of stealing jewelry which is found in her case. She's sent home, blacklisted from her work and pregnant.Ettore meets her by chance a little over a year later. She's exactly where she belongs, borderline poverty. But when he finds out that she's given birth to his son, he decides that he has to do the right thing. He'll break off his engagement and marry the girl. Her morals are non-existent and she's a petty thief but maybe he can break her of her horrible habits, plus she really is a good mother.This book has so much potential. Great conflict idea and great potential for groveling. The hero spends so much time on his high horse when really what he'd done to the heroine was real and what she'd done was a set up. I was all set up for her to confront him on that. She'd spent three weeks in a relationship with him thinking he wanted to marry her and he'd spent those three weeks sleeping with her while engaged to another woman. Sure he'd planned to marry her, but he didn't feel right offering for her until he broke it off with his fiancee, and he certainly wasn't in any hurry to do that.Ugh. What really ruined it is closer to the end when the hero thinks how great the heroine is for not wanting to upset his marriage by announcing her pregnancy. A lot of horrible women would just throw out that news not caring how they would upset the parties involved. So, if the guy was a lying cheat, the girl shouldn't be evil and confront him with the results of his playing around because she would be hurting other people by doing it?In the end I just didn't like this book because my own moral system couldn't stomach what I was being force fed."},{"Title":"The Italian's Marriage Demand (Harlequin Presents)","review":"The Italian's Marriage Demand by Diana Hamilton~ Harlequin Presents #2491 ~ September 2005Nanny Sophie thought Ettore loved her, but when she's accused of stealing he doesn't believe her innocence and though he does not have her prosecuted for her crime, he does have her blacklisted with her placement agency and any other agency. A year later, he nearly runs over a woman and is horrified to discover it's Sophie, obviously barely surviving, and that she has a child. Putting it together, Ettore realizes the child is his and he demands that mother and child return with him to Italy. Ettore acknowledges that his attraction to Sophie is still very strong and he sets out to find why she felt compelled to steal and to hopefully reform her. He's determined that she'll marry him for the sake of the child. Sophie still desperately loves Ettore and she hopes that she'll be able to convince him that she was wrongfully accused. But in order to convince Ettore that she's not opportunistic she has to keep out of his bed, and this is proving to be more difficult with every hour she spends in his company.Sophie knows that she can't tow Ettore's line, but he has all the control. I felt her fear that she was slowly being cut from her son's life. Early on we see that Ettore struggles with his own feelings and that when he learns the truth, we can feel his anguish on how horribly he had wronged Sophie. Both have tremendous moments of hopelessness. Ms. Hamilton has given us wonderful characters that we quickly care about. Theirs is an emotionally intense journey, one that kept me turning the pages."},{"Title":"The Italian's Marriage Demand (Harlequin Presents)","review":"Unemployed heroine encounters her ex-lover Hero by accident in London & finds out he still thinks she's a thief & sexually promiscuous especially after seeing her with her baby. The only thing that changed when he realized he was the father of her 7-month-old baby was his demand that she marry him for the sake of their son. Heroine tries to convince him that she's not what he believes she is but her ability to be seduced easily by him doesn't help matters. What will it take to convince Hero that she's innocent of the theft & sexual manipulation?This Hamilton book started out badly. Hero was not Hero-material in the 1st 2/3 of the book, with his judgmental, hypocritical, unforgiving, domineering, & cheating ways (He didn't tell heroine he had a fiancee he was planning on breaking up with when they had their fling). Heroine was also maddening with her doormat & passive attitude. But the book got better towards the end when Hero began to realize how much he wronged heroine, apologized for it, & tried to make up for it by setting her free their blackmailed marriage arrangement. It wasn't a huge personality change for Hero but he made good-enough attempts to amend for his past mistakes & jerk behaviors. I still think he should've groveled more for deceiving heroine about his engaged status & believing his fiancee over her re: the theft without giving her a good chance to explain herself. Heroine, on the other hand, not only stayed a doormat but got worse & worse about her victim/martyr role as the book progressed. We know that she's thinking what a vile & hypocritical jerk Hero has been to her but she never tells him that. She keeps her assertive & justifiably angry thoughts to herself & instead says appeasing things to Hero & easily gave in to his demands. What was frustrating was that she knew she was a pushover but didn't try to do anything about it. She seemed to like playing the martyr role too much to want to change.As dysfunctional as the main characters were, this book kept my emotions & interest involved so it was a fast read for me. The passionate sexual chemistry & sex scenes kept the pace going too.Moderately recommended."},{"Title":"The letters of John Keats, 1814-1821","review":"I've been searching for this out of print series for years. I was thrilled to receive it and to delve into the life of Keats once more. Be careful however, when ordering the two-volume set. Because you are technically ordering one item, you'll likely receive only the first volume. In my case, I received the first volume twice, and now I have none, because I have to send them back because there are no second volume mates for them at this time. This is not yet documented. Nonetheless, ifyour order gets straightened out (crossing fingers), this is a unique collection and worth every word on the page. Happy hunting! I'll definitely continue my search. You may want to opt for a more recent compiled version to avoid this problem.

Though A.N. Martin is not the final authority, there is much wisdom and guidance to gleem from the life and teaching of such a godly man. If you feeled called into the ministry then this book will definately cause you to look at yourself and at Scripture and truly see if your heart is prepared for the cause of Christ."},{"Title":"With All Despatch","review":"With All Despatch is chronologically the last of Kent's pre-Napoleonic Wars Bolitho novels. It is also the most recently written depicting that era. As such it is one of his most polished if somewhat familiar.Kent has used the structure of With All Despatch before. Essentially he has written the novel in two linked sections with a mini-climax in the first followed by the major climax and denouement in the second. In Gallant Company was particularly effective using this format and in With All Despatch the two sections are linked even more solidly.In this entry Bolitho who is still mourning the loss of his lady must obtain men for His Majesty's service while battling smugglers on England's North Sea coast. Complicating the matter is possible collusion between a senior officer and the smugglers. The head smuggler seems unreachable and there is an obvious parallel with organized crime and drug cartels of today. As the novel progresses it is also obvious that France and England will be at war soon. Can Bolitho meet all of his objectives and defeat his enemies? To provide a clue, the series will continue with many more novels for 23 more years.In spite of being a popular series the reader has to know that Richard Bolitho is a tragic figure. The chronology in most books shows his death in 1815. By With All Despatch Bolitho has lost both his parents and his brother who turned traitor before dying. His faithful sidekick Stockdale was killed after nearly 10 years with him and Bolitho notes that his replacement Allday has been with him for 10 years. The reader has to be waiting for the other shoe to drop with Allday. The series could be really depressing if Kent didn't fill the novels with nail biting tension and thrilling action sequences. Kent's obvious knowledge of sailing and love of the sea also provide charm to the series.With All Despatch is one of Kent's most polished. Perhaps it doesn't have the fire and intensity of earlier offerings but it is still good. While the entire series is violent some of this novel is particularly gruesome. I wouldn't recommend With All Despatch for younger readers unlike the earlier novels."},{"Title":"With All Despatch","review":"Although not one of the best in the series, this novel captures the grim life at sea and the struggle against nature. In this book, brutal smugglers ply the English Channel between Holland, France and England. The central characters are well written and alive with problems, dialog and several seem destined to re-appear in future Bolitho novels. However, Mr. Kent seemed to have Bolitho dwell in his past too many times. A dark, brooding side of the naval hero seems to fill many pages, but it does make Sir Richard that much more of a fleshed out character. He does feel for his dead friends, former ships and in some cases, former enemies. That aside, the tale moves along like a nimble sixth-rater with all sheets unfurled in a southern wind. The action is swift and brutal as Bolitho gives battle to the smugglers and their allies. Stormy weather, plenty of thunderous cannon fire, smashed bulkheads, parted ratlines and terrified crewmen. The author once again details the sea as an angry foe without mercy. The battle at the end of the book between a couple of corvettes and three cutters is suberb Kent writting. A welcome addition to the collection none the less. Well worth reading and blends seamlessly into the very next novel. An excellent series that has re-defined nautical fiction."},{"Title":"With All Despatch","review":"Two years after the American Revolution, and the British Navy is still licking its wounds.

So officers like Captain Richard Bolitho, who has recently recovered from a South Sea fever (one he barely survived), must beg for a post - any post. For a ship - any ship. Bolitho, a former frigate captain, struggles to be grateful when he's posted to command of a trio of topsail cutters assigned to hunting smugglers in the Nore. He takes this job far too seriously for the liking of some of his superiors, who may well be profiting from the very trade they are supposed to suppress. And what of France, where the Revolution has changed everything except the age-old hostility between the nations that face each other across the English Channel?This is a two-part novel, and a very readable one in both cases. Bolitho grieves for his dead love, Viola, and battles his traitorous brother Hugh's unfortunate legacy while doing his duty in a largely thankless assignment. The plot almost takes a back seat to the story's themes of love, loyalty, and duty. And that, for me at least, worked just fine.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of \\"Granite Island\\""},{"Title":"With All Despatch","review":"Bolitho is feeling distraught. It is peacetime 1791 and he's on the shore. He's recovering from fever. His romance in the South Seas has ended. Of Viola he has only a gold watch. France is under the Terror. Then Bolitho gets his first multi-ship command, a flotilla of topsail cutters with the newly installed Smashers (nasty short-range carronades), but hardly the frigate he deserved. He's in charge of the hated press gangs at the Nore, site of a later fleet mutiny. His loyal coxs'n Allday deserts him! And he suspects his superior and a captain or two of collusion with English smugglers, who are taking heinous advantage of refugee French women. Life is ugly all around, and dominates the dark mood of this novel. Bolitho races about on many filthy errands, in foul seas, and against big odds. That, at least, is nothing new.Deja vu: the story line is reminiscent of \\"Midshipman Bolitho,\\" once again chasing smugglers. Again the smugglers have a deadly intelligence system and protection from a mystery authority. Nominally in command of his destiny, Bolitho encounters a master politician who sends him on highly dangerous secret missions into Holland. Curiously, for all Bolitho's empathy and respect for his crews, he never seems to invite his officers to dinner. There's little in this series of the sumptuous larders most captains supplied.Kent includes nice bonus appendices, one on the specialist warrant officers, the other on the origins of some naval customs.

Although the main protagonist, Wil, is not very likable and it's difficult to sympathize with him, the story is propelled by the evil deeds that he faces and the desire to unravel the mystery. I liked how David Ramus put to use his knowledge of art and art history. It was enough for a layman to comprehend and to keep it interesting, but was not overdone. My favorite aspect was how historical deeds, during the Spanish Civil War, were brought forward into the present day.

When one of the real-life gameplayers decides to destroy Gamearth, the characters have to act independently to escape the game-world and come into the real one, proving that their land is alive and more than just figments of the players' imaginations. You get to see both the side of the real-world reacting to the characters refusing to do what they are told AND the characters' points of view as a roll of the die brings chaos to their land. Perfect for anyone trying to write stories or playing RPGs, as it brings into question the idea that our &quot;imaginary&quot; world might be more than something we just dream up that goes away when we close the book or stop the game!"},{"Title":"Gamearth (Signet)","review":"The entire series was very good.

In this book, Fazlur Rahman explores the transformation of the Islamic intellectual tradition, ranging from philosophy and ethics, to jurisprudence. He brilliantly exposes and analizes the tension that exists in the interpretation(s) of the Qur'an. Rahman ambitiously demonstrates that for Islam and the Qur'an to be what Muslims actually claim them to be, comprehensive in scope and pertinent for every age and society, then Muslims must re-evaluate the Qur'an in positive ways, and in light of modernity and its challenges. In a similar vein, Rahman argues that for Islam to truly demonstrate its principles of social equality and justice, Islamic scholars must re-examine their methodology and hermeneutics. Amongst several other things, Rahman critiques the repetitive rhetoric and anti-philosophical trends that the Islamic intellectual communities faced during Islamic Medieval times.This work is a significant contribution to understanding the Muslim world today. It is a genuine search for broadening the scope of Islam by extrapolating upon its inherent egalitarian principles. It is also a beautiful re-evaluation of the Qur'an, by having studied it throught the context of its revelation. I recommend this book for Muslims as well as Non-Muslims interested in the study of Islam and Islamic Intellectual History."},{"Title":"Islam and Modernity: Transformation of an Intellectual Tradition (Publications of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies)","review":"Here's a sample of the book's prose. After describing the challenge to some traditional Islamic tenets posed by Izz al-Din Ibn Abd al-Salam al-Sulami, and others, Fazlur Rahman writes \\"But orthodoxy had developed an amazing shock-absorbing capacity: all these thinkers were held in high esteem by orthodox circles as great representatives of Islam, but such statements of theirs as had radical import were invariably dismissed as 'isolated' (shadhdh) or idiosyncratic and were quietly buried. It took real rebels like Ibn Taymiya to make any perceptible dent in this stieel wall of ijma (consensus.)\\"I love it. We get a sense of the orthodoxy-preserving process he's describing in visual and tactile terms, and we're drawn in to the \\"buried\\" views that it is some part of his goal to resurrect here."},{"Title":"Islam and Modernity: Transformation of an Intellectual Tradition (Publications of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies)","review":"This small work is essential reading for understanding Islam. The previous review suffices, but I just wanted to add a note about the work's content. During my first reading, I thought that the work was overly bogged down with a discussion of education and its development throughout Pakistan, Turkey, etc. However, upon a second reading, I found this to be the most profound and impactful section of the work, as this is the locus of the true reform of Islam and its true modernization will occur. Thus, this work is partly a late scholar's dream for the future of his religion. Though at the same time, it is deeply grounded in history and its realities."},{"Title":"Islam and Modernity: Transformation of an Intellectual Tradition (Publications of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies)","review":"I found Fazlur Rahman's \\"Islam & Modernity\\" a very helpful and readablesurvey on the prospects for educational reform in the muslim world.

It was the first occasion that an orthodox scholar refused to close the gates of inquiry, and maintains that Islam mandate these gates remain open allowing in questions and solutions sensitive to particular societies; it claims that the Quran requires particularity and not immanence in realising what is a Muslim way of life and refuses to yield to the sheer weight of orthodoxy. Fazlur Rahman is brave and determined not to let the ideologues, the obedience automatons from hijacking the wonderful Message. This is despite the fact that one may critique his theory in Chapter One (also included in Kauzmann's Liberal Islam anthology); his other book 'Islam' is also an inspiring read."},{"Title":"Islam and Modernity: Transformation of an Intellectual Tradition (Publications of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies)","review":"Arguably the greatest Arab-American intellect of the 20th Century, the late Fazlur Rahman's writings are essential readings for the Near East scholar, whether novice or PhD Candidate.

In essence, he breathed back into Islam the very life that the Western Orientalist saps out of it.As for the book itself, it is a critique of Islamic education, i.e., Islamic Intellectualism. For Rahman, a genuine understanding of Qur'anic weltaunschunng was misconstrued, in effect overlooked by early Muslim thinkers, whose pupils were forced consequently to pay a tremendous price: when Medeival Muslim hakmit (philosophy) attempted to apply an Islamic veneer onto its clearly Hellenized rational interpretation of theology, Islamic Orthodoxy crushed it \\"by its sheer weight.\\" Hence the historically truncated hakmit found only in Sufi and Shi'ite schools. Ironically, the orthodoxy did not have a handle on the Qur'anic weltanshunng either: as orthodox scholars developed Islamic jurisprudence and theological doctrine their atomic focus on individual suras outside of the situational context necessary for proper deduction, they too missed the point. Thereby eliminating the once rich intellectual heritage's future of organic and original thought. Tied to Islam's clash with the West and ostensible Modernity, maintaining an appologetic Islamic veneer to justify Western and Modern currents is ultimately self-defeating. Unless the on-going peripheral struggle to restore an organic, genuine understanding of the Qur'an succeeds, this situation will unfortunately continue to increase in the post-colonial world. Affectively leaving Islam as a candle burning at both ends.I recommend this book along with Edward Said's various writings on East/West discourse for anyone interested in present-day intellectual dialogue within Islamic societies.

As opposed to most traders' books that are very much focused on price-centric indicators and pays lesser attention to volume, tape-reading is truly a gem that observes the important co-relation between price and volume, the latter being the fuel of every play.Tape-reading doesnt predicts target prices of a stock play as opposed to most methods (eg elliot wave) but lets volume (or lack thereof) be the ultimate determinant of a continuation of a move or otherwise. Since I have never been a technical indicators' fan, I now trade solely on tape-reading principles with simple charting techniques using candlesticks (paying due attention to volume on formation of important patterns) and doing very decently ever since.Great stuff !!!"},{"Title":"Tape reading and market tactics,: The three steps to successful stock trading","review":"As an active and profitable day trader (who makes a living trading) , I've read almost all the classics, in my opinion better than any book i've read!

It focuses on just that topic and is very clear.It's not really &quot;tape reading&quot; in the sense that he tells you how to spot trends by reading ticker tapes. What he did was write down all the sales and the volume during the day for certain stocks and made a graph of the stock at each sale. Day traders or short term traders may find this book very useful."},{"Title":"Tape reading and market tactics,: The three steps to successful stock trading","review":"This is a good book on volume if you are just getting started. He goes over how to spot accumulation and distribution in detail. However, you can tell that this information has been copied in so many other books on price and volume action of a stock. So if you have a good understanding on volume then I wouldn't buy this book. I bought this book on the recommendation of IBD and after reading I didn't learn that much. I would buy How to Make Money in Stocks if you don't already have it, instead of this book."},{"Title":"Tape reading and market tactics,: The three steps to successful stock trading","review":"Price and volume tell the tale for what is happening with a stock.

These books combine Baby Genius' philosophy with DK's amazing photographs and designs. Baby Genius is a leading producer/publisher of classical, instrumental and vocal CDs and videos for young children.In this book, children are introduced to pictures of:Spring: Daffodils, lambs, splashing raindrops.Summer: The beach, a pool, butterflies, a wet dog.Fall: Leaves, tasty apples, walking in a forest.Winter: Warm gloves, frosty leaves, a chilly snowman.Then, there is a page of children dressed for each season. I like how they photographed the same tree in all seasons. The last scenes shows the animals you can expect to see in each season.Four Seasons is a sturdy book that can be enjoyed for years. The photography is so good you can almost imagine reaching out and touching the page and actually feeling the cold, crisp snow or imagine you are inhaling the scent of autumn leaves. The photography is simply stunning.Highly recommended as a teaching guide for babies and toddlers who are already curious about their world. This book helps to put words with their real-life learning experiences.Also look for:Baby Animals: Colors, Numbers, ShapesZoo Animals~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Four Seasons (Baby Genius)","review":"We have read this book so many times, I can recite it from memory.

I recommend Al Muqdma to any knowledge loving intelluctual."},{"Title":"Raw Faith: Nurturing the Believer in All of Us","review":"This is a good book of deeper looks. There is a spiritual element here that transcends the words of the quotes Mr. Kirvan uses. I found it to be excellent for meditation upon short passages."},{"Title":"Raw Faith: Nurturing the Believer in All of Us","review":"My brother-in-law recommended this book to me. It turns out, it came into both of our lives at just the right time. The chapter headings take on the real questions in life and the mixture of historical quotes, author's perspective and modern prayer are truly delightful. I like that it is not preachy. My edition sits on the bedside table, but is often tucked in my suitcase alongside my journal when I hit the road. It offers a sense of inspiration and opens me up to thinking about faith differently. You don't need to be heady or theological to get the power of the diverse perspectives. Just enjoy it."},{"Title":"Electrical Engineering Circuits","review":"When I was in school our professors were so appreciative of Prof. Skilling's texts that they even had us use a pre-publication issue of one of them. And for excellent reason. Prof. Skilling's knowlededge to me is uncanny, but what sets him apart even more from other authors is his knack of explaining the material so effectively. Dr. Skilling was prof. at Stanford; how I envied the students there even though my profs were first-rate (Harvard) and they used the various Skilling texts for their undergraduate courses. These included the present 'EE Circuits', 'Fundamentals of Electric Waves', and '1st Course in Electromechanics'.I have had a successful careeer in electrical engineering and call it obsequious if you will but I owe a lot of it to Dr. Skilling's peerless textbooks.And no, I'm not related to him, have no stock in any companies he may have owned, etc. This is strictly an arm's-length evaluation.I can't believe there aren't more reviews of this book. I suppose modern graphics have supplanted the book. Maybe the graphics, but no way could the text be better."},{"Title":"Electrical Engineering Circuits","review":"Although this book is for undergraduate students, and tries not to overstep the reasonable down bounds of an undergraduate course, it is written with recent developments in mind. Physics, the general college course including electricity, is assumed to precede the use of this book. Simple calculus is expected of the student, nothing more. Complex algebra is introduced in the third chapter and thorough drill is provided to make it a familiar tool. Each chapter ends with a summary. These are useful for review, perhaps an exam time. If anything in a summary remains mysterious to the reader, further study of the chapter is indicated. Continuity of thought from chapter to chapter is carefully planned."},{"Title":"Inside the Law Schools","review":"I have read the previous comments on the 5th edition. It gets worse, I went to the library found edition of this book from early 1980's. It has the same notes, comments, and phrases about each school as the current edition! I think alot has changed in 20 years, but the authors are apparently too lazy to research."},{"Title":"Inside the Law Schools","review":"Despite the previous reviews, I actually found this book to be very helpful. It gave me a much better feel for the schools that I was looking at applying to, which is more than I can say for the endless dry statistics found in other books.Two drawbacks, though. 1)Many schools were not covered in this book. 2)In some of the articles, the information seemed outdated.Other than that, a pretty good guide to law schools."},{"Title":"Inside the Law Schools","review":"Not having read the earlier edition I can't speak to what the other reviewers said about the 7th edition not containing any fresh material...but I can say, that I found the reviews to be well written, and more importantly on just what I wanted to know about the law schools reviewed.I'd been looking around for a guide that would give insight into the atmosphere, types of students and focus of various law schools and hadn't been able to find much beyond books filled with lists of statistics.Although, I wouldn't use this book as 'the definitive guide' - especially now that I know it hasn't really been updated - I think its reviews are well-written and give good overviews of the kinds of human aspects of a school that really interest prospective law school students when selecting a school."},{"Title":"Inside the Law Schools","review":"This is a very useful tool in the Law School application process. The 2-4 page descriptions of each school give you some added insight into schools you might be interested in that you can't get anywhere else.The one thing holding this book back is that it is ancient... the most recent edition was published in 1998. The law school world has changed drastically since then--the admissions process has gotten FAR more competitive, job prospects for lawyers have gone south, and technology plays a much bigger role in the classroom experience.For the most up-to-date info on admissions stats, use the official guide over at LSAC.org. This book is still worth reading for the school descriptions, but don't trust it as your only resource for choosing schools."},{"Title":"Inside the Law Schools","review":"The information is obviously outdated and in some cases it seems to be incorrect. For instance, in the chapter on the University of Chicago, the book says this school relies on interviews with applicants. To my knowledge, this is not true. Northwestern (also located near Chicago) relies on applicant interviews--not the University of Chicago. I found the chapter on the University of Minnesota amazingly inaccurate."},{"Title":"Inside the Law Schools","review":"I didn't believe the earlier writer who suggested it wasn't worth purchasing this book if you had already read the 5th edition; I wish I had. This edition is exactly the same as the earlier version - same phrases, same schools (do you know, it only has 112 of 179 ABA approved law schools featured?). If you're thinking about buying this book, I would recommend that you go to the library instead and read whichever version they happen to have on hand, even if it dates back to the early 90s. On the other hand, if you don't know anything about the reputation of particular schools, this book can be helpful in giving you a snapshot view. If you do know something about the reputation of certain schools, you may find, as I did, that this book is more of a confirmation of everything else I had heard/read about those schools -- it didn't seem to offer any fresh insights."},{"Title":"Inside the Law Schools","review":"A friend loaned me the 5th edition of this book, which was published in 1991. It was a good book, but I wanted to read the &quot;updated&quot; edition so I would be familiar with how the law schools had changed in the six years in between. While reading the latest edition, I noticed that the only info that had been updated was the stats--most of the reviews and anecdotes about each school were the same--and I mean word for word! I guess things just don't change much in law school. I suggest spending your money on the LSAC guide to law schools, instead. Or send away for law school catalogs from each school--they're free and at least they are really updated each year!"},{"Title":"Inside the Law Schools","review":"There is one great thing about this book. It has the addresses and phone numbers of many (though not all) of the ABA approved law schools in the USA. If you want any other meaningful information, I would recommend another book. After reading comments like \\"They have a Black Law Students Association,\\" or \\"The best students are offered a spot at the prestigious Law Review,\\" for pretty much every school in the book, one begins to realize that their profile of each school tends to be generic and impersonal. As previous reviews have noted, some of the material is also outdated.One specific example... Their profile of Boston College Law, which is one of only two Jesuit law schools in the US, fails to mention this important fact. The BCLS literature dedicates the the first five or so pages of its current bulletin to explaining the importance of the Jesuit tradition to the School... meanwhile \\"Inside the Law Schools\\" publicizes the fact that BCLS has a \\"mercifully short application form\\" as one of the features that makes it unique. Give me a break!!!"},{"Title":"Inside the Law Schools","review":"Excellent resource for applying to law school; helped me narrow my scope; saved time applying to schools that would be a good match for me. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A German-English dictionary for chemists","review":"If you are a chemist or working for the chemistry related field &amp; know little of german then it is the best book to translate your reference papers from german to english by your self than exposing your field of work by giving some agencies for translating the papers."},{"Title":"How 2 gerbils, 20 goldfish, 200 games, 2000 books, and I taught them how to read","review":"This was my favorite teaching literacy book in the 1970's. I took it to a presentation I did and someone took it. The teacher in the book has a class of kids who can't read and who experience poverty of all sorts every day. He fills his classroom with books, games, animals, and high expectations. It's relevant today as well."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"This is a great book and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Bethune's engaging and simple writing style made it easy to read and understand. Outlining his four-fold plan for turning around Continental airlines, Bethune offers advice to all business professionals. He uses numerous examples from his previous affiliations with the airline industry, as well as stories and anecdotes, to make his simple, yet profound points. At the end of the book, I felt like I could run an airline, too! As a frequent flyer who flew on Continental for many years, I was fascinated by the behind-the-scenes account of what was really happening. At times, I did find myself thinking he might have painted the past so bleak as to make his leadership look even better, but I'll allow him that. Bethune understands that the customer is not always right, but the customer is everything to a business. I would highly recommend this business strategy book to anyone looking to change an unhealthy organization into one more healthy and profitable."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"This book is absolutely invaluable for any manager or leader in an organization, regardless of size. The techniques are fundamental and scale to any size, whenever appropriate.I've already recommended this book to many friends and associates and I continue to purchase countless copies as gifts or (effectively) as an &quot;investment&quot; in companies that I'm involved with.As someone with a pre-Gordon &quot;Member Since&quot; date on my Continental Elite card, Bethune's description of Continental in the 80s and 90s brings back some all-too-familiar bad memories of what it was like to travel on the world's worst airline when failure was imminent. Although he accurately depicts the bad times with great detail, those people that experienced the disaster will probably best appreciate and understand Gordon's incredible undertaking and the drastic changes that were the result.Additionally, it's noteworthy (and consistent with Gordon's nature) that all proceeds from this book will be donated to a non-profit organization that assists Continental Airlines' employees and their families in times of need. Best of all, you get inquisitive looks and smiles from flight attendants when reading this book on a Continental flight.It's a shame that every company can't be as lucky as Continental to have a Chief Executive like Gordon Bethune."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"With literary assistance from journalist Scott Huler, Continental Airlines CEO Gordon Bethune describes how he transformed the near-bankrupt airline into one of the best companies in the industry. He describes the massive changes he made to improve the product, changing a low-cost, unreliable airline to a top competitor that emphasizes customer service. The transformations he brought about by exerting strong leadership reshaped financial controls and employee-supplier-creditor relationships. The book is a fascinating read, written in a straightforward, this-is-how-it-was style, typified by Bethune's characterization of the company he took over as a... \\"lousy\\" airline with terrible service. Sometimes he gets a little repetitious in summarizing the action at each new step in the transformation, but that's just a minor complaint about an otherwise excellent book....."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"I really like this book. It is very informative and deals with the state of Continental at the time of the turn around. As an employee at the time, we were not told much about what was happening. Gordon and Greg used common sense to make Continental what it is today. I have met and talked to Gordon, and he talks to employees the same way that he wrote the book. While it doesn't give detaliled specifics on what he did and how he did it, this book gives a general overview of what was done to make the employees happy, and in turn make the airline the success that it has become. To those who say the book is repetitive, get over it. There isn't much to say except Continental was bad, and now people are competing to fill open positions. Also Gordon has directed the publisher to direct any royalties that he was going to make to WE CARE, an internal employee emergency assistance fund."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"This is an excellent book, its full of examples, easy to understand, easy to read, great for everyone who is interested in the basics of management, not only of an airline, but any company.I am new to the airline industry, and this book has let me understand a lot about it. Really easy to read, it is written in an easy language.Contiental was the worst airline to fly, the worst airline to work for, and in 1994-1995 when Mr. Bethune rode the cockpit of it, in a year he made it to have its first profit in 10 years. How did he do it? Read this book.This book was written previous to the September 11th 2001, so it has nothing about the recent economic crisis affecting all airlines worldwide, but it explains the plan (the Go Forward Plan) that has kept CO working these last years and how CO is, among major US carriers, one of the ones with less looses and debt in the industry.Definitely a must read!"},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"I had the pleasure of doing media relations for Continental in the early 2000s, including the years after 9/11. The Gordon Bethune in the book is the Gordon Bethune you meet in person: incredibly smart, driven, concerned about the people whose paychecks he signed, and satisfied with nothing less than the best. Great read. (I sound like a PR guy... But I mean it sincerely...)"},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"In From Worst to First Continental CEO Gordon Bethune discusses how he and his team turned around Continental Airlines (then on the verge of bankruptcy) and produced the profitable, customer-friendly airline that Continental is today.The book is a good read, filled with numerous examples. Bethune takes the reader through the process that occurred at Continental and comments extensively on how the techniques that he applied could be applied to other businesses. However, Bethune neglects, in many cases to explain the thought process behind the decision that he made. In some cases this is expected: most readers will obviously know that a business needs capital to operate. In others, such as some of his less generally-accepted employee relations techniques, he explains only what he did not why he did it. Because of this, the book is more of a &quot;how to&quot; than a case study on Continental.Also of note, this book primarily deals with a turn-around situation, and while some of the techniques presented are clearly applicable in any business, others deal specifically with a business that is well established and experiencing difficulty. Other techniques deal primarily with large organizations, and may be of only minimal use to an executive at a smaller company.Over all From Worst to First is a good read, and the information and techniques provided will well justify the time spent reading it!"},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"An excellant book! Gordan's ideas are strongly emphasized in each chapter as he deals with the strategies of creating a winning team. His stories and metephors for dealing with issues that face all types of business are a slap of reality. They clearly explain his motivation and decision making. Coming from a technical background, Gordan explains this very plain and simple. I am in the IT world now, and see many strong points that could be applied from this book."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"A suberb chronicle of the quest to bring Continental Airlines out of the ashes and mold it into the best airline in the World. Having flown Continental on numerous occasions it is interesting to read about the behind the scenes actions and history of this proud and excellent airline. Great reading about a great airline!"},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"I purchased this book because United and Continental Airlines merged into one company and I wanted some back ground knowledge concerning Continental's trials and tribulations.My initial reaction was I found the repetition of issues and how they were addressed to be a bit unnecessary. I suppose the author wanted to emphasis the gravity of what they were up against, and that comes across loud and clear.I do not want to repeat a lot of other well thought out reviews so I will skip to the main impression I came away with. If Gordon Bethune, the team of managers he was a part of, non-management groups, engineers, ground personnel, front line customer service and mechanics, as well as out side company suppliers, come together with one vision, then anything is possible. It takes knowledge, brutal honesty, integrity, an understanding that this is not about ME but for everyone who works in a company, and TRUST, that will create a great corporation. I particularly want to emphasis trust, because it seems that this is what is at the center of what Bethune is fighting to create and preserve. This seems so basic it borders on the ridiculous to even mention or question as to its roll in a successful organization, but this theme repeats itself in many forms in this book. Bethune understands though, that trust is earned, and when the pot has been scraped dry, the only tools available to you are to; have a deep understanding of what happened, address the issues directly with candor and forthrightness, apologize with sincerity, do not make accuses, honesty, truthfulness, humble, and ask for forgiveness. Once Continental started down this road it seemed that the final step for creating a healthy relationship was not to side step any issues, no matter how uncomfortable, but to address them openly and with candor.I enjoyed this book and recommend it to any one.As an after thought I want to say Continental/United Airlines are on a new path. It is going to be what it is. Hopefully, it won't be the typically dysfunctional relationship that represents a lot of the corporations in our America."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"I had hoped that the book would conver in more detail what was done to bring the airline back from the brink. Yes, we get a lot of soft shoe &quot;we did it as a team&quot;, and &quot;we just got honest&quot; stories, but little in the way of how a company with the terrible internal problems Continental had was able to turn employee morale around enough to salvage the wreck. At the time I witnessed what was going on at the airline, violence between mamangement &amp; labor wasn't only threatened, but was expected. Painting planes &amp; paying everyone $65 a month for on-time doesn't change that. I agree with an earlier reviwer- read Jan Carlzons book for a better overview of saving an airline."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Being one of the many customers turned off to Continental Airlines during the Frank Lorenzo years, I was interested in reading about how people today can call them one of the best. Once again, the formula turns out to be simple: ignore the stock traders, and concentrate on your customers and employees. Keep them happy, within the bounds of financial sanity, and the profits will follow naturally. A well-written book with lots of solid examples. Mr Bethune, however, comes across as very much filled with his own importance -- although he repeatedly makes the point that he is replaceable -- and doesn't give enough credit to the subordinates that worked hard to carry out his ideas."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"This is probably the best and most useful management book I have ever read. It is full of real world techniques and strategies that most of us can relate to, written in an amusing yet direct style. This book should be mandatory reading for anyone in service industry operations management."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Bethune is very candid. He is honest about how poor his company ran for many years, and he explains, very simply, how he and his management team fixed it. His analogies are funny, and it's easy to understand why he's developed a loyal following among Continental's employees in a remarkably short time. Clearly, he's a people person, and his personality makes the book fun to read and not at all a typical business book. Also, Bethune is quick to give credit to his management team and his employees. This book is a lot of fun -- a must read for anyone who cares about managing people and running a successful business."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"I am very imporessed with Gordon's style and approach as well as all of the people at Continenental. What a great American corporate turn-around story.I hope they continue to do well. Every company could learn from Gordon and from all Continental employees."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"I am sure that what Gordon Bethune has done for Continental is truly worth a great deal of appreciation. However, the account given in this book fails to describe the turnaround process at Continental in an exciting and informational way. It is too repetitive. I think that I understand when a person says that &quot;the employees hated Continental&quot; after I read that five times, but to mention that in every second paragraph is unnecessary. What Bethune fails to give us is interesting incidents where he actually used the strategies that he employed. Although the &quot;Go Forward Plan&quot; has been broken into four parts, each part somehow connects to something else in the middle of the section and talks about something not concerning that section at all. But above all, if the Continental employees contributed to buy Bethune a Harley Davidson, it shows that he did an incredible job at Continental. So, maybe he should stick to fixing airlines and leave the writing to someone else."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"This book was way to Repetitive, Repetitive, Repetitive. Because of the anoyance of reading the same thing over and over again I had to quit the book at page 150. We know Continental was bad and the customers hated the airline, but the reader does not need to be reminded of this 3-4 times in each chapter."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"I was very impressed with Gordon Bethune, but I felt the writing was too repetitive."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Bethune makes it clear that a company turnaround requires a lot more than closing facilitities and firing employees (Take that, Chainsaw Al!). It requires a comprehensive plan that includes getting your finances in order, treating your customers right but first treating your employees like valued partners, admitting your mistakes, communicating about everything, involving employees, customers and distributors (e.g., travel agents) in the change process and being willing to make hard choices. The book tells us how Continental did it and those of us who are frequent flyers notice the difference. The main criticism of the book is that it is repetitive, too full of homey stories and a just a bit self-congratulatory (although he is justifibly proud). Our business book club, composed of senior-level human resources professionals, liked the book."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"While I enjoyed the book, I cannot rate it higher because it is in many ways a work of fiction. As a frequent flier on Continental, I have witnessed a decline rather than improvement in the quality of service afforded passengers. Too frequently, business authors write books glorifying their success and business acumen, while the reported benefits are invisible to their customers. This is such a case.Has the airline improved its bottom line. Yes. But that is because frequent fliers like myself don't have much of a choice if we live near a hub. This does not infer that we approve of the airline's service or treatment of its customers. As my neighbor on a recent flight commented,&quot;if I had any choice, I would fly airline XYZ in a heartbeat.&quot;If you would like to read a similar book by a CEO who did in fact turn his airline around (from a financial as well as customer perspective), try Moments of Truth by Jan Carlzon of Scandanavian Airlines.

I'm into the airline industry, so it particularly interests me, but the lessons taught and stories told can be applied to most industries. Amazing book, amazing guy!

With literary assistance from journalist Scott Huler, Continental Airlines Bethune describes how he transformed the near-bankrupt airline into one of the best companies in the industry. He outlined his four-part \\"Go Forward\\" plan for turning Continental airlines around, and offers critical advice to all business professionals. He uses numerous examples, as well as stories and anecdotes; to make his simple, yet profound points.T he challenges faced by Continental Airlines in 1994 are somewhat similar to those faced by many airlines worldwide in the past six years or so, when the industry was going through a rough patch. Many of these airlines need visionary and decisive leadership of Bethune's mould to turn the familiar red ink at the bottom line to black.The book is well written in an easy to follow and understand manner which enables it to benefit anyone in any industry to gain insights into how to turnaround a loss making business with dysfunctional structures and demotivated people. I learnt a lot from the various examples provided which helped me to get his message across. I also enjoyed the various humorous stories which illustrates how badly Continental used to be mismanaged and how the situation was straightened out.Although there was a fair amount of repetition which may annoy some people, I had no problem with it as it helped to reinforce the author's message. This book is absolutely invaluable for any manager or leader in any organization undergoing a turnaround process, regardless of size."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Mr Bethune and his ghost-writer follow the oldest training guide: &quot;1.

And, it can certainly seem simplistic (I suppose it could even seem painful if you're an MBA). However, if you step back and think about it, &quot;simple&quot; may just be the message. Not that the job of managing an airline isn't complex. But the solutions to problems can be so complex as to get in their own way. So, if you stay with it and pick out the pearls, you can have a nice simple list of management prescriptions. Simple in their statement, but often difficult in their execution. Which is probably where Bethune is different. He didn't just talk about, he did it."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"The content of the book is applied not only to the airline industry but to other industry like banking I am working for.(1) Customer: Most Important/ Try to offer what customers want. Stop the service customers don't want.(2) Employee: Secondary Most Important/ Think of employees. They do serveice to customers. They know how we can enhance the service. Share the profit between the emplyee and the company(stock holder)."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Gordon Bethune, a very confident man - you may find him cocky, gives us insights on how he made it possible to turn a major organization around through the management of people, not the management of the company. Definite reading material for anyone who manages people; sales, division, corporate, etc. managers.Note: You may find a few chapters a bit of fluff (bragging about himself)."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Highly recommended for the company officer who is looking for ways to turn his/her division or organization around. It's truly about the management of people, not neccessarily about managing a company. It's all about making people do what you want them to do in a politically correct way. In addition, Gordon Bethune is a very confident person, maybe even a little cocky."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"I got tired of being told to remember what I'd already been told. This book would be much more effective if it treated the readers like adults and cut all the repetition. I'm a fan of leadership stories, and would have liked some factual illustrations of his actions, instead of so much about how good he thinks he is. It was necessary to wade through the excess to get the highlights. I also wanted to hear more about his military leadership experiences."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"With broad brush strokes Gordon lays out how he got Continental firing on all cylinders through his Product, Marketing, Funding, People plans. The book is worth reading for his approach to those issues. However, what could have been communicated in 100 pages takes 282 because of the heavy repetition."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"If your company makes the same mistakes over and over - read this book!! If your employees aren't motivated to do their absolute best - read this book!! From Worst To First is easy to read and full of basic, common sense ideas that you don't find in many of our corporate board rooms. Gordan Bethune is someone we would all like to work for."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Nice of Mr. Bethune to find time to share his success with others. After being in airline business for sometime (working for competitor), find it very honest and helpful resource. Yes, if you want to save an airline (or any other company), you don't have to be Ph.D in management - recipe is simple - be honest with employees, take care of your clients, do thing that makes sense. There is no magic formula. The key is - be committed to the change, don't let politics change your decisions."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"great book, if you're in the airline biz it's simply a must read, best book written in this industry."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Gordon Bethune truly understands the human element and what motivates an employee to put forward his best! Listening and respect is key and Mr Bethune shows a true understanding of this logic. I am 12 year employee and have been through the good, the bad, and the ugly. Gordon should be paid 6 times his salary if he would stay with us. This book was so inspiring that I carry its principles with me each and every day I am dealing with customer."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Although Gordon Bethune tends to be rather repetitive in this story of Continental's turn around, he writes an informative and easy to read book. He gives a basic outline of the major strategies used to change ways at Continental but without too much detail .... this makes it a quick read."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"I've personally endured Continental's problems in the early Nineties as a student coming back from college in Northern California to Guam every year. The total apathy was prevalent in every employee's facial expressions! Continental to me was the anthithesis of customer service. Incredibly, I have noticed the flip-flop changes during my recent flights on Continental -- via Continental Micronesia, an incredibly-together subsidiary based in Micronesia.With easy, repeated themes throughout the book that boil down to the four basic ideas of Market, Finance, Product and Employees, Bethune weaves an incredible but credible story of probably one of the greatest turnarounds in history. His personal biographical information dotted through the book adds tangible, real-life lessons that seamlessly match up to his deep but simple philosophy of today's Continental.I'm getting a copy to each of my senior managers. Hold off on the buzz-word-laden academic books. Buy the book and read it, at least a few times."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Gordon has written management book for the 21st century in a style that's all his own. Although he's clear to point out the ideas aren't new, Gordon's storytelling style offers a fresh, unique perspective for today's managers.Using clear, simple language that anyone can understand and relate to, Gordon explains how his real-life experiences led him to the management theories that made Continental an overwhelming success. You don't have to be an executive to benefit from executive insight. This book shares the ideas and leadership abilities that make Gordon worth his executive salary -- ideas that work just as well for managing 4 people as 40,000.Because he's my uncle, I know these stories are authentically told. It was especially fun for me as a relative to see how much of his personality is communicated in the book. Nothing can substitute for meeting Gordon, but the book is a good start!From Worst to First is best viewed as a coaching or teaching tool. When teaching, repetition is often the rule, and you'll find that here. It can be a slight interruption if you're not actively involved in coaching a team, but if you are, read a little of this book each day and see how many of the anecdotes and ideas you can apply to your own team. You'll be surprised at how much a crop duster's son has learned over the years!"},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Gordon Bethune and Greg Brenneman miraculously saved Continental. Bethune isn't your typical Fortune 500 CEO. His unique style and background are interesting. From the book, you'll read how much nerve it must have taken to pull off this great comeback. Bethune and his team are true people managers, and it is great see this type of approach so successful. By saving Continental, Gordon Bethune has eclipsed Robert Six, Continental's founder and long- time CEO. The book is a must for airline buffs and anyone who manages people regardless of what business you're in."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"I have been a loyal frequent flyer at Continental since the late 90's, and I have no idea the airlines was that terrible at the early 90's. As a frequent flyer, I admire Continental's plane is always cleaner than other airlines, and the flight attendant attitude is always friendly than others. After reading the book, I understand the reasons.If you work at a company need to be turned around, this book is almost a top read. For management, there are some good ideas worth considering from reading this book.This book can be condensed to 2/3. The last one third of the book is somewhat repeating what has been said at the beginning. Otherwise I will give it a 5 stars rating."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Gordon Bethune certainly turned around Continental by using common logic and Management techniques. What is not clear is how did Continental slip to such depths before and also what are the Challenges that still need to be overcome ? The book is interesting but one tends to jump pages since there is a lot of repetition. All the same it is a good book for it does hammer in that PEOPLE COUNT and one cannot ignore that."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"I found the book entertaining and easy to read. However, the content is not very consistent and sometimes very repetitive. All in all, good beach reading."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"My brother who works for another airline recommended this book. I don't follow the industry so I'd never heard of Gordon Bethune, but I have now! Every leader should take the time to travel with and steal priceless leadership nuggets from Gordon as he took Continental airline from worst to first."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"This book outlines the steps Continental CEO Gordon Bethune took to help the company survived its third bankruptcy. Well written, but can be boring if you are not into business strategy."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"This is a great book on how Continental emerged from bankruptcy twice. Bethunes punes run throughout the book which make for easy and enjoyable reading. Even for a college student such as myself."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"The story of continental as depicted in this book is a story of Long term vision, commitment, consistency, and perseverence... The description of what went wrong prior to Gordon's time can be related to any company in any industry.. key lessons can be learnt by all executives: what needs to be done and what needs to be measured for the company to perform. And if you cn't read the couple hundred plus pages of the book, Gordon have summurized all the chapters at the end of the book.The recipe provided by Gordon seems to be successful; the key vision statements that Gordon have presented to the board in 1994 are still in use by the airline in 2005."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Anybody who has been in the workforce a few years will bond with Gordon Bethune's central message: &quot;It's about people, and nothing but people.&quot; Who among us hasn't worked for the secretive sociopath, or the authoritarian arse? These are the creeps whose subordinates are constantly looking over their shoulders rather than at their work at hand. These were the types who created the revolving-door syndrome at Continental's corner office. Let's face it, no matter how big the company, the poop invariably filters down to the rocky bottom, which was exactly where Continental was. It even had employees yanking company insignia off their uniforms before leaving work. Enter Bethune. His solution was simple. Burn the company s.o.p. manual and start over with the Golden Rule. He started to treat employees as human beings to see if they reciprocated. They did. He gave them latitude in decision-making to see if they could resolve problems on the spot. They did. He told them what was wrong, and asked for their patience and help to fix it. He got it. He gave them a timetable and, ever since, he has been meeting or beating his deadlines. Finally, he rewarded employees for a job well done. Mr. Bethune's account initially seems a trifle pretentious. Frank talk often does. On the other hand, he openly admits that he merely used basic horse sense with everyone he worked, eschewing &quot;business-grad&quot; consulting malarkey. &quot;Suddenly,&quot; he exclaims, &quot;our employees are running a good airline.&quot; Speaking of business grads, Bethune's wonderfully-prosaic effort is an all-the-more-reliable gauge to the real world of business in that he is a career sweathog. He learned it all in the trenches, rather than hire ivory-tower pretenders who took notes from the pressbox. Any supervisor who has wondered about high employee turnover should read this book."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Continental airlines was a major disaster in 1994. Gordon Bethune did a major turnaround of that company and unfortunately he does not tell us how he did it with the exception of cutting costs. He was so busy talking about how wonderful he was that he forgot to tell us how to turn the company around and not just the end results. It is still an interesting book for those who are interested in the airline industry but don't expect to get much out of it if you are looking for the story of continentals turnaround."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"This book told the story of the great comeback of Continental Airline in an interesting and straight-forward way. We can understand clearly how Continental could do that within 2 years after Gordon Bethune became the Chief Executive Officer.Continental Airline used to be a low-cost, employee-hated, huge leverage company with terrible service and financial situation. The new CEO Gordon Bethune used a &iexcl;Go Forward Plan&iexcl; which emphasize the product, employees, suppliers and creditor relationship to turnaround this huge but &iexcl;horrible&iexcl; airline giant.Gordon Bethune put the emphasis on the product itself, making employees as business partners through communication, admitting and apologize for the mistakes, controlling financial situation. This shows that transformation requires a lot more than controlling cost.The structure of the book is clear with key points always showing on the topic. Gordon Bethune used numerous examples and stories to illustrate the strategies he applied and what are the rationales behind. Despite the repetition of some contents, it is full of knowledge!"},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"When I bought this book I was looking for a story about Continental Airlines. But this book is much more about economy and financial problems and how to solve them. However, there are some funny and interesting stories about the mis-management of Continental. The first part of the book is worth reading. When reading the second part you always ask yourself: Do I really need to know that? Hey, I just want an insight look into the Airline business! However, the book gives you great general advice to put up a business (doesn't matter if it is selling pizzas or cars)."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"I have read this book over and over again, and it's great everytime. I'm no businessperson, but I understood every word because Bethune's easy to understand anecdotes made the book an enjoyable and understandable experience. I highly recommend this book to any airline enthusiast!"},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"how many times can you say the same thing??just ask Gordon before you waste your money on this."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Though the book is written in plain english with his blunt demeanor and self grandiose, he does not lay down the foundation of how he accomplished the turnaround. The Go Forward Plan that was the foundation to the turn-around was somewhat uninspiring. Today's CEOs know that you have to look internally to understand your companies situation. This is nothing new. Anyone can rally the troops."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"I am an Ex-Con, New-U and really wish Gordon Bethune was back at the helm. I refer to this book frequently as a morale booster and I've passed on a &#34;traveling&#34; copy - I hope it's in inspired hands today!"},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Being a long time Continental Airlines traveller I really enjoyed reading about this airline. It explains how it got to be the best! Unfortunately since merging with United, their present CEO can write the sequel: From First to Worst."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"This book outlines the simple but somehow overlooked basics of how to get along with your fellow man . . . give them what they want and stand back to enjoy the show. Why hasn't anyone ever thought of that! I was one of his line captains. We all loved him for his vision and leadership, the consequences of which gave us a future. Got Bless Gordon Bethune!"},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"the book is written in a style which mixes chronology with agenda points the author wants to make. it is difficult to follow, and a lot of the points are so general that it is difficult to relate them to a specific action the ceo (or the airline executives) took.having read this book twice now, i am at a loss to explain what this ceo really did, but maybe this is just me not knowing in general what ceos do."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"It's a book full of common sense that makes you wonder why Gordon isn't president. Funny, smart and effective -- this is a must-read for anyone in business, aviation or just a fan of how to get things done."},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Fantastic book that I have always wanted to read. Now that United Airlines has merged with Continental, I understand to the go forward plan that Mr. Gordon Bethune created at the Continental division. I was also very lucky to open this book and discover that Mr. Bethune autographed this copy!!!! Collectors item for me!"},{"Title":"From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental's Remarkable Comeback","review":"Once you start you can't put it down.
