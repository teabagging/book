Heinz Heger describes what life was like in one of those camps in vivid detail, and you can't help but imagine yourself there among the dead and dying. Everything from the political structure in the camps to how the prisoners were arranged and organized is all portrayed with terrifying richness. His stories of the SS guards and other prisoners tell a tale of horror and cruelty, but also of love and kindness in the midst of it all. While reading this book, I asked myself many times if I would have had the strength to survive. Would I be willing to do whatever it takes so I could have a meal to eat or so I wouldn't be sent off to die? Let's hope none of us have to answer those questions."},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"The product came on time and enjoyed the book.

Powerfully recounting his persecution at the hands of the Nazi regime, a full picture could have been painted had the author continued to tell its affects on the rest of his life AFTER World War II. An important book, no doubt, and definitely to be included in any Holocaust library."},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"A sodomy law had been on the German law books since 1871, a law known simply as Paragraph 175. Only a few people were ever sentenced under this obscure law until June of 1935 when, after the rise of Hitler and Nazism, the Nuremberg laws were enacted and the consequences of Paragraph 175 strengthened. Where once before, you had to be caught in the act of same sex relations, now simply receiving a letter or the spreading of idle gossip would have you sent to a concentration camp.\\"The Men with the Pink Triangle\\" is one anonymous man's account of the harshness and cruelty faced by gay men at the hands of the SS and the ruling Nazi party, as well as by the other prisoners -- criminals, politicals, emigrants -- who viewed \\"filthy queers\\" as lower than the rest of them. They were distinguished by the large, pink triangles sown onto their prison outfits, making them easy targets for taunts and punishments. Also, homosexuals labored through the worst of the work details and \\"volunteered\\" for medical experimentation, which usually resulted in their deaths.Some advantages also appeared for gay men. The \\"Capos\\" who were in charge of the prisoner barracks, often made lovers of some of the prisoners, giving them some protection and better rations and clothing. As is says in the book: \\"Homosexual behavior between two 'normal' men is considered an emergency outlet, while the same thing between two gay men, who both feel deeply for one another, is something 'filthy' and repulsive.\\" The anonymous man used this to his advantage and survived the camps and the threat of being sent to the front lines.Ths is a moving and powerful story about survival and about the right to be who you are, during one of the darkest times in world history. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"A tremendously moving and easy to read book, The Men With the Pink Triangle provides the reader with not only descriptions of the horrific treatment suffered by gays in the Nazi camps, but also provides insight into the intra-camp politics among the prisoners. The anonymous narrator provides details on how the &quot;capos&quot; and the criminal prisoners operated, and how one could &quot;survive&quot; one's incarceration as long as one was willing to accept the camp heirarchy.But by far, the descriptions of the brutality of the SS troops in the camps is the most rivitting. The terse language of the narrative increases the decriptions' impact. There's no intellectualizing this abuse in this tome. Unfortunately, we need more books like this one. But I'm afraid many of those gays who survived the camps are still unwilling to speak, and that is largely because of how they were treated after the camps were &quot;liberated.&quot; The Nazis were brutal in their treatment, but you knew where they stood because the Nazis didn't hide their contempt. Bureaucrats today, however, are much more sinister."},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"I figure we teach school kids about the Jews suffering in the Holocaust, and the blacks struggle for Civil Rights. It would make sense that kids learn the dangers of homophobic bigotry, by reading this book. It will open your eyes! The same anti-gay stereotypes then, are the same ones now.This book is about a gay man who survived the Pink Triangle, and took him over 25 years to tell his story, as their were still many anti-gay laws on the books there. This man never wanted any public or economic gains from telling his story. In fact the Nazis had more contempt for the gays than they did the 'inferior racial groups' they persecuted."},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"Heinz Heger's book has become the definitive story of life as a 'pink triangle' in a concentration camp. Sadly this is partly because the Nazi's deliberate policy of murder of this group ensured few survived and also due to the understandable fear of those who did survive to tell their story. If you have read Primo Levi you should read this. It is more immediate than Levi's writings, and there is less analysis, making it all the more horrifying. He simply tells what happened, mentioning only his amazement at the hypocrisy and cruelty exhibited by his German captors. The only other book that comes near to it is 'Liberation Was For Others', by Pierre Seel, an autobiographical tale of life in Schirmeck-Vorbruch. Seel continues his story to the post-war period, pointing out that for homosexuals suffering did not end in 1945."},{"Title":"The Men with the Pink Triangle: The True Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps","review":"Heinz Hegel's thin volume brims with the haunting facts surrounding the persecution of gays under Nazi Germany's Section 175 ruling against homosexuality. Hegel provides the shocking historical context which few of us were taught in school, that people even suspected of same gender love relationships were tortured and killed by the Nazi regime in concentration camps in the 1930s and 40s.This is a stirring testament of survival against all odds, peppered with humor, not overbearing in tone or content. It is also a fascinating quick read.While the reader can celebrate the fact that Hegel survived imprisonment in Nazi camps from '39-45, he closes the book by reminding us that &quot;the progress of humanity&quot; has passed by the minority to which he belonged. As of 1970, when Hegel's book was written, it was still illegal for people of the same gender to form love relationships in his native Austria. Furthermore, gays remain the only minority persecuted in Nazi camps omitted from remuneration by the German government.Even more shocking is the fact that the Nazis' desire to &quot;cure&quot; homosexuality, now balked at and dismissed by any credible mental health professional, is advocated in this day and age in the personage of the &quot;shock jock,&quot; physiologist Laura Schlessinger (aka &quot;Dr. Laura&quot;).

A successful drama that has enjoyed continuous popularity for nearly eighty years is worth a read. Most audiences find it very satisfying. Shaw has a gift for lucid dialogue that brings a centuries old story to life. This is one of the most approachable of the great English language plays.Why then does \\"Saint Joan\\" fall short of five stars?Fictional accounts of Joan of Arc's life are numerous and seldom accurate. Shakespeare makes her a witch. Voltaire makes her an idiot. Schiller makes her admirable - and gives her a magical helmet that protects her from harm until she falls in love.In a rare exception to his usual satirical style, Mark Twain spent months in France researching her life and published a fictional biography. Readers who enjoy accurate historical fiction would do well with Twain's \\"Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc.\\" Twain considered this - not \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" - to be his finest work.Shaw pays far more attention to accuracy than most fictionalizations. Several lines in the play are Shaw's own translations from her trial transcript. Shaw's long introductory essay aspires to be history as well as drama. Most scholars agree with his assessment of Joan of Arc's socioeconomic background. Shaw acknowledges a few dramatic economies: he combines the historical Jean d'Orleans and Duke Jean d'Alencon into a single character. What causes problems are Shaw's unacknowledged deviations from the factual record.Shaw argues that Joan of Arc was a forerunner of Protestantism who got a fair trial. Among serious scholars this argument gains no credibility. A surviving letter from the English government that financed the trial guaranteed her execution even if the court found her not guilty. Joan of Arc never rejected the Roman Catholic Church: she rejected the authority of politically biased judges bent on discrediting her and, by inference, on discrediting the king she had crowned. Twenty-four years after her death the Pope reopened the case. The appeals court not only found her innocent but discovered such extensive violations of proper court procedure that it accused the late Bishop Cauchon of heresy.Shaw's choice works as drama rather than as history yet he advocates it on historical grounds. He might be sincere but he is certainly not honest. To an academic scholar who has explained the facts to umpteen Shaw enthusiasts the difference can be infuriating. This is why \\"Saint Joan\\" collects a handful of scathing reviews.A reader who understands this little shell game with history should have a lively time with the drama. If this is your first reading of \\"Saint Joan\\" then I envy you. Nothing quite equals the first encounter."},{"Title":"Saint Joan","review":"While Shaw may have been a gifted playwright, his &quot;Saint Joan&quot; did an enormous disservice to the subject: the view it presents of Joan of Arc conflicts with the historical evidence on nearly every point, echoing instead the propaganda of her enemies. In truth, her trial was orchestrated by the English and their clerical allies (and even Shaw admits that the Inquisition overturned the verdict in 1456, shortly after the English were finally driven out of Rouen); nor was Joan a &quot;rebel&quot; except in the minds of her political opponents. By dredging up this fraudulent view of La Pucelle, Shaw's play was among the first popular works to undermine the efforts of countless scholars whose research had brought a more truthful view of the issue to light. For an historically accurate version, I would recommend any book by Regine Pernoud, many of which are offered here at Amazon."},{"Title":"Saint Joan","review":"What has most stuck in my mind, many years after having read Shaw's book, is the fact that it's more logical to think of Joan as a protestant saint, instead of Catholic, when one considers how she rejected the Catholic Church's authority and was, naturally, rejected in turn.He makes a very good point when he says that, right as that Church was to ban her on those grounds, nothing could give it the moral right (or any other right, for that matter) to condemn a woman who disagreed with it on matters of faith. In all fairness, they should have simply excommunicated her and said: &quot;If you think you have a better idea, then you go ahead and create your own Church&quot;.It may be a thoroughly idealistic point of view of course, too democratic for that age (perhaps any age), but nonetheless it strikes me as completely fair.If you like a club but object to some of its rules, and that club isn't willing to change for your sake, they may have the right to throw you out, just as you may have the right to start a new one on your own - but they shouldn't be given the right to take away your life for having dared to challenge their concepts.This lesson has stayed with me and I recommend this book for the wisdom it contains."},{"Title":"Saint Joan","review":"Shaw was a close friend of a Benedictine Abbess, Dame Laurentia, who &quot;vetted&quot; his plays for fairness to the faith. This play is fun, takes lots of bites out of politicians and clergy, and says something beautiful about the imagination. This Joan is no dolt and had to be burnt at the stake. That is a complement to her faith."},{"Title":"Saint Joan","review":"Radical feminism, to which I pledge complete allegiance, has put gender issues at the forefront of historical interest in Joan of Arc, but historiography is scarcely pertinent to the reading of George Bernard Shaw's play 'Saint Joan.' I'm told that this awkward play was a smash hit and held the stage for decades in Britain, but it's hard to imagine how or why. The first problem is not gender but 'genre.' Is it intended to play as a farce, before an audience that will chuckle genteelly at hearing Jehan d'Arc speak with a Yorkshire brogue? Or as a philosophical tragicomedy, preparing the stage of the future for Samuel Becket? The dialogue is half music-hall burlesque and half pompous twaddle. I'd have a hard time declaring which is more juvenile, the humor or the sententious lecturing.If anyone who reads this review has seen a staged production of the play, I'd be interested in hearing whether it was 'played for laughs' or performed earnestly. Shaw is of course taken quite seriously in the world of anglophone theater, though actual productions of his works are rare in the USA. Shaw was not reticent about assuring \\"us\\" of his intelligence, and not particularly chary of condescension, but this play features some of the dumbest jokes and most preposterous dialogue I've ever read. Any audience that wasn't overawed by Shaw's elevated reputation would groan out loud at Joan's flippant folksiness.There seems to be a \\"Joan-of-Arc\\" effect on the minds of writers, which disposes them to bizarre extravagance. I turned to Shaw's 'Saint Joan' as a follow-up to reading Mark Twain's romantic novel/ biography \\"Joan of Arc.' Both works are based on historical sources, chiefly the trial records, yet neither can be interpreted as 'history' in a modern sense. Shaw was aware of Twain's book, and regarded it skeptically, yet the two works have more in common than not. Both are polemics against humanity's inability to comprehend sainthood."},{"Title":"Saint Joan","review":"\\"Cauchon: If you dare do what this woman has done - set your country above the holy Catholic Church - you shall go to the fire with her.\\"So speaks a more engaging, complex executioner of the legendary young soldier put forth by Bernard Shaw in \\"Saint Joan.\\" Even if the Bishop put Joan to death for political reasons he likely believed that her execution was just. The Catholic Church's problems with Joan lingered for nearly 500 years. Her active assertion of nationalism as a holy endeavor intuited by her own judgment undermined the Catholic church's political authority, and yes, presaged the Reformation, even if Joan was not a Protestant (Shaw labels her \\"anti clerical\\").And she willingly asserted a non-traditional feminine role (soldiering and politicking), which by its nature required non-traditional feminine behavior and dress. Reviewers who say that Joan wore armor to keep from being raped are half right, since Joan's soldiering included such hazards, like being wounded. But she did and thrived at it anyway. In fact, I agree with Shaw that the voices spurring her on were Joan's own subconcious, but that is another debate...Those who are skeptical of Shaw's ideas would do well to consider the year of her Canonization: 1920. It's no accident that a year after the Great War, in which the world's powers successfully mobilized against each other in the name of Nationalism (the churches providing prayers and getting out of the way), Catholicism threw up its hands and recognized the genius of the French teenager. This too as women had been called on in support roles like nurses and ambulance drivers, and were being enfranchised by their European and American nations.The play itself is typical Shaw - bright, smart, very worthwhile. None of the play's acts goes on too long. None is weak, except for Act III on the eve of the battle of Orleans, but Shaw is Shaw and seems embarassed by the warlike bluster. Joan herself, as others have observed, often speaks in lines that are taken directly from the trial transcripts. When she doesn't it's usually to give her a flash of wit that rarely seems contrived. This is Joan for grown-ups. And it is Joan for the 21st century: post-modern, the old sentiments put aside.Also reccomended: Regine Pernoud's books. If you need to hear what a pretty, chaste, tear-provoking, goody goody of a girl Joan was buy Mark Twain (I myself donated that volume to the public library when I was 17)."},{"Title":"Saint Joan","review":"Shaw's keen understanding of French Patriotism as illustrated in Joan of Arc story transcends borders, cultures, languages and skin colors.

Shaw's play brings the soul of Joan to life. A girl with no formal education - defeated the English, won a crown for a king, and was tried and burned as a witch - dead at or under the age of 23. No wonder she was made a saint. The story would almost be a horrible fairy tale, if it wasn't true."},{"Title":"Saint Joan","review":"Well,I have read the applecart before reading this book and i had high expectations when i started saint joan.my expectations were truly met with.The best part of the book is the preface.Shaw clearly points out His Joan and not the Joan of a romantic author.if the play would have been any different from this i wouldnt have liked it because everyone knows there is nothing romantic about Joan.Well,the main topics of discussion between me and my friends about this book are &quot; role of church in joan's time &quot; and &quot; Shaw's theory of Life Force when applied to Joan &quot;.To sum it all up,it is a truly remarkable work by a genius of Shaw's calibre."},{"Title":"Saint Joan","review":"I have seen this performed, I have read it and I have heard it on a tape from Books on Tape for the Blind and Disabled. I loved it every time. I agree fully with Shaw that the Catholic Church has gotten a bad rap over Joan. When you listen to her words she was espousing overt Protestant beliefs -- God can, should and will speak to one person, individually and doesn't require a mediator like the Pope or Mary or any of the saints.I actually got the most out of this play by hearing it on a tape from Books on Tape for the Blind and Disabled. I was able to speed the tape up and suddenly the wimpy, silly voices of the court officials came out perfectly. The farce inside the tragedy revealed itself clearly.Shaw is brilliant and astute -- but no one needs me to tell them that!"},{"Title":"Saint Joan","review":"This version of \\"Saint Joan\\" includes not only the play, but also commentaries about the play by George Bernard Shaw as well as the transcript of the original trial and the Order of Rehabilitation.The play itself is excellent. It tells the story of Joan's triumph and tragedy with wit, humor and power. The play includes not only the dialogue, but also occasional instructions on how the play I to be presented. I read this book in anticipation of seeing the play. I was a little concerned that knowing how it proceeds may spoil it, but the dialogue makes me more eager to see it. I want to see how this work of art is played out.Shaw's interpretation of the play is contained in the Preface, some letters and an interview. Shaw places the play in its historical context, which helps the reader assess the merit of the positions of each. He also presents his own interpretation of the proceedings, asserting, among other things that Joan was burned, in part, because she was ahead of her time in ways which challenged the authorities of her day. Her claim of direct communication from Sts. Margaret, Catherine and Michael is portrayed as a precursor of Protestantism, in the claim that an individual can communicate directly with God. He presents this as a threat to the Church by eliminating the need for its role as a mediator. Shaw identifies Joan as an apostle of nationalism, a concept alien to her medieval world and a threat to the feudal powers which judged her.I found the play itself to be intellectually and emotionally stimulating. The supplementary materials aided my understanding of the play. I have an increased interest in knowing more about St. Joan as a result of reading this book. This will aid anyone wanting to understand this play."},{"Title":"Saint Joan","review":"Audio recordings of plays are usually done with different actors reading the roles as in a radio play. This is the first time I have listened to a play being read by only one reader. It is not at all the same experience, but better than one might expect. The reader uses a neutral American accent for the French characters, but a slightly British one to differentiate the English characters. There was a recording on Caedmon of the play with Siobhan McKenna repeating her famous performance, but it is not available. (Some libraries still have it on vinyl, but that doesn't help me pass the time while commuting.)Shaw's play is intriguing, coming as it did so soon after Joan's canonization and Ireland's war for independence (\\"France for the French\\"), but there is no denying that is rather untheatrical, save for the climactic scene. Joan confesses to her supposed sins to save her life, but then withdraws the confession, choosing execution and martydom. I had never realized how much Arthur Miller owed to Shaw; I was reminded of the scene in The Crucible when John Proctor confesses to a lie and then recants, preferring an honorable death. These scenes are both based on historical events, of course, but the resemblance in the way they are dramatized is striking nonetheless. Here's a potential trivia topic: How many plays and movies can you think of that use the device of a false confession followed by an even more dramatic retraction?"},{"Title":"Saint Joan","review":"In one surviving account, Joan of Arc was quoted as saying that her judges were merely putting her on trial because they were members of the pro-English faction and therefore her \\"capital enemies\\"; unfortunately, this play tries to claim otherwise. One of Shaw's primary themes is the notion that Pierre Cauchon and Joan's other judges were acting as \\"sincere\\" defenders of the Church in their prosecution of her, a view which is contradicted by document after document as well as the above quote from Joan herself. Cauchon and his cronies are well known to historians as having been long-term supporters of the English and Burgundian factions, and the eyewitnesses said repeatedly that they prosecuted Joan out of revenge for the defeats that their side had suffered at the hands of her army, rather than out of any genuine belief that she was guilty of heresy. Cauchon even allowed her to take final communion (which was never done in the case of heretics), indicating that even he didn't truly believe the charges against her. As Shaw was aware, these charges were soundly debunked when the case was appealed after the English were finally driven from Rouen in 1449; and the arguments put forward in this ruling have been confirmed as accurate by experts in medieval theology and canon law, whereas Cauchon's arguments can easily be refuted by consulting medieval theological works - his arguments are, at best, merely distortions of what the medieval Church actually taught. Here are some specific examples which factored prominently in Shaw's play:- Shaw, like Cauchon, claimed that Joan was guilty of heresy for wearing male clothing allegedly as a personal preference, despite the fact that both of these men were aware of her own statements to the contrary. She was quoted as saying that she wore soldiers' clothing (of a type which had \\"laces and points\\" by which the pants and tunic could be securely tied together) primarily to protect herself, as her guards had tried to rape her on several occasions; this reason is also given in some of the 15th century chronicles, along with similar quotes from Joan herself on the need to protect her chastity while surrounded by the men in her army. The medieval Church allowed an exemption in such cases of necessity (read St. Thomas Aquinas' \\"Summa Theologica\\", or St. Hildegard's \\"Scivias\\", for example): the practice of so-called \\"cross-dressing\\" was only condemned if it was done as a preference. Shaw rejects all of the above based on the specious argument that the \\"other women\\" who accompanied armies in that era didn't wear such clothing, ignoring the fact that these \\"other women\\" were: 1) prostitutes, who wore provocative dresses because they were trying to encourage sexual encounters rather than the opposite; and 2) aristocratic women sometimes were given command of their family's armies in the absence of their husband or son, but these women did not bed down at night among the troops in the field, as Joan often did. Shaw chooses to ignore these circumstances.- On a somewhat related subject, Shaw tries to portray her as a rebel against \\"gender norms\\", again ignoring her own statements and the circumstances of the era. She was quoted by one eyewitness as saying that, quote, \\"I would rather stay home with my poor mother and spin wool [rather than lead an army]\\", which hardly sounds like someone who is trying to reject traditional gender roles. When another woman, Catherine de la Rochelle, wanted to get involved, Joan told her to \\"go home to your husband and tend your household\\". At no point do we find her making any 'feminist' statements. She was given titular command of an army for the same reason other religious visionaries sometimes were given such a role in that era, not as part of a \\"feminist crusade\\".- Shaw admits that Joan was a devout Catholic and yet claims her as \\"the first Protestant martyr\\" - in the same sentence. This seems to be a rather willful contradiction, and the claim of \\"Protestant tendencies\\" is merely based, once again, on the old business of accepting Cauchon's claims about her at face value while ignoring the circumstances. If you read the documents you will find that Joan never opposed the Church as a whole: she merely stated her objection to being tried by a panel of pro-English clergy, and repeatedly asked to be given a non-partisan group instead or to be brought before the Pope. It was a violation of Inquisitorial procedure to stack the panel of assessors with people who were pursuing a secular vendetta against the accused: what Cauchon and his cohorts were doing, as Inquisitor Brehal later pointed out during the appeal, was itself an act of heresy. The notion that the medieval Church viewed all Inquisitorial panels as \\"infallible\\" and therefore not open to question is just a stereotype, bluntly contradicted by actual medieval theological writings: St. Hildegard, in her 12th century book \\"Scivias\\", warns the clergy against judging someone in error or out of anger, as it would be the offending clergy who would be punished for it by God. Joan was perfectly within her rights, even under the rules of the medieval Church, to question her biased judges, and was declared a martyr for Catholicism by Inquisitor Brehal when her execution was declared invalid in 1456. Shaw ignores this. The claim that his play is somehow vindicated by the fact that it was \\"vetted\\" by one Catholic (out of the hundreds of millions of Catholics worldwide) is a pointless argument: there are \\"Catholics\\" who claim that Joan was having adulterous sex, and all sorts of defamatory allegations. The bottom line is: this play does little more than repeat the slander leveled at Joan by the men who cruelly put her to death, despite the work of generations of scholars to bring a more accurate picture of the issue to light."},{"Title":"Saint Joan","review":"I'am an actress.

I was more disappointed by the play itself-it is not a play about Jehanne's life, but rather about the pompous musings of male peacocks spreading their tails like an eclipse over the Maid herself. Shaw portrays Jehanne as a silly little tomboy who threw off her skirts and donned trousers to play soldier and skipped into the King's chambers cooing &amp; giggling about God and war. Jehanne is rarely actually IN a scene - much of the play is, as I said, dominated by the peacocks of her trial discussing her, ranting about her, defaming her, etc. She only skips in throughout to swoon mindlessly over God and stamped her spoiled foot for war. Shaw gives one the sense that her presence in a scene is only disrupting the continuation of his wordy play of peacocks! Redeeming quality: the last scenes - Shaw actually allows Jehanne to grow a sudden brain and speak out intelligently against the peacocks, which he has already condemned her for in his preface! For real facts and a true portrayal of The Maid, stick to Regine Pernoud."},{"Title":"Saint Joan","review":"I have read this book for about 6 times. It is an interesting book telling us about how St Joan also known as The Maid leads France into a battle against the English. &quot;France for the French ; England for the English&quot; is what she says. Joan hear voices from Saints Catherine and Margaret and makes us wonder if it's true. When she was asked by Dunois to pray for a west wind, it did happen. She knew that foul mouthed frank was going to die and told him that he shouldn't swear just before his death. She works miracles like the hen not laying eggs and the cow not milking when The Dauphin refused to see her. Read the book and enjoy as much as I have enjoyed..."},{"Title":"Adventures in Understanding","review":"I had heard a lot about the author's work from a friend of mine, but hadn't had an opppurtunity to read him. Finally I managed to secure this book, and I must say it is excellent. The book is primarily a collection of essays which the author writes from his own experiences. He is a countryman who has moved to the city and describes his dilemmas of living in a city as compared to the country, and the adventures he has, as he goes along making friends and understanding people in the city. There is nothing melodramatic in this work, however it is excellent literature. The author's style is superb and as you read the essays, you get a feel of the cosy atmosphere of the country and the warmth and simplicity of human relationships, which is what most of us crave for but somehow overlook. In his essays Grayson brings out simple but most profound truths about people and the process of living in general. After reading it one can't help but get the feeling that human relationships are so true, simple and beautiful. All that is required is an open, kind, friendly and fearless mind, so that we can understand (as Grayson says)and thus be at peace and in harmony with nature, ourselves, others and life in general. Overall an extremely charming, enjoyable and enlightening read."},{"Title":"Adventures in Understanding","review":"Written at the turn of the century 1900\`s David Grayson takes you to a simpler time but it is his time.In a series of books, He reminds us of the importance of Friendship, Contentment, Understanding and other social values forgotten in our active lives. My Grandmother found these books during the Depression to be an escape from everyday trials and torment of raising eight children by herself in the 20\`s and through the 40\`s. And she passed them on to me which I love and read over and over like she did. But I found she did not have all his books so when I find them I buy them.My collection is first edition but if you see one buy it, and read it.

It's also known by a variety of other names best left out of this review. It stretches for some 130 miles of desert from Sonoyta, in Mexico's state of Sonora, to Yuma, Arizona, on the Colorado River. There is precious little permanent water and ground temperatures can, and do, reach 150 degrees and more. It includes parts of two national monuments, a national wildlife refuge, and a gunnery range in Arizona not to mention various intities in Mexico. The are can be explored via foot or four-wheel drive vehicle. It can be done. It's done every year by experts and fools, lots of fools, legal and illegal. Many don't make it. It is a killer. If you are intrigued by scorpions, drug smugglers, sidewinders, bandits, illegal aliens, rattlesnakes, sand storms, unbearable heat, lack of water, a military gunnery range, and a host of other unbelievable challenges this is the trip for you. I don't know of any typical travel or guide book that will prepare you for this trip but this book comes as close as any to providing one with a sense of what to expect and when to go. It is probably the very best book ever published about this special place. The author and photographer have a knack of presenting a highly readable, visually accurate account of the dangers and beauty that await the visitor to a place noted author Charles Bowden says \\"...we finally get to face ourselves because we are alone with life itself.\\" I have done this trip in a four-wheel drive vehicle and can only say be careful...very careful. This is a must read both for the armchair traveler and boots on the ground type."},{"Title":"Sunshot: Peril and Wonder in the Gran Desierto (Southwest Center Series)","review":"No fair.

Not without reading this first...then thinking througly about the adventure before setting out."},{"Title":"Sunshot: Peril and Wonder in the Gran Desierto (Southwest Center Series)","review":"Of all the books my brother, Bill has written, I most love this one. SUNSTRUCK is about the area of the world on which he is an expert, a remote area of the Sonoran Desert, but more importantly, these are thought-provoking essays on life and living. Even if, like me, you don't usually read essays about the natural world I think you'll appreciate his writing style and world outlook. Bill shares anecdotes about the outdoor life, hiking, those he meets and gets to know in the desert (including la migra and people escaping the border patrol, mountain lions, rattlesnakes, bighorn sheep) that make the reader feel as if they are there with Bill at the moment of encounter.So I hope you'll enjoy a book about a wondrous place in the world that few people visit, and even fewer understand: El Gran Desierto, the Devil's Highway. Yes, this review is written by the author's sister, but don't hold that against me. Given my proclivity to reading fiction, I might not have picked up this book if my brother hadn't written it. I am so glad I had the opportunity to enjoy his vivid use of language and to vicariously experience some of Bill Broyles' adventures in the desert."},{"Title":"Glas 17: Sonechka and Other Stories (Glass Innactive Series)","review":"We have just finished reading and discussing &quot;Sonechka&quot; in our reading group, and it was the first book all year that we could all agree that we simply flat out liked. Ulitskaya's gentle, bookish heroine leads a life with a strange charm to it. The 'real' world of World War Two and the Soviet Union is going on somewhere beyond the world that Sonechka and her family inhabit. but rarely does it intrude on their lives. Sonechka, like many a Chekhov or Bunin character, leads her quite ordinary life, full of both happinesses and tragedies, and in the end the reader is drawn into her quite world and can be quite touched by it. Ulitskaya writes in a gentle style, and is quite removed from the shock writing and &quot;chernukha&quot; ('black' stories full of grim/horrific details) that has dominated the Post-Soviet Russian Literary Scene. If you are a fan of Chekhov's stories, you should definitely take a look at Ulitskaya!"},{"Title":"Movie Nights: 25 Movies to Spark Spiritual Discussions With Your Teen","review":"Here is a helpful tool for Christian parents of teens who ask the question, \\"What movie do you want to see tonight?\\" It also helps to answer the question, \\"Why?\\"\\"Movie Nights\\" is edited by Bob Smithouser, of Focus on the Family's \\"Plugged in Magazine.\\" In his introduction, Smithouser writes, \\"Parents, you have a wonderful opportunity before you. Aside from the simple pleasure of spending time together and discussing films over a big bowl of hot-buttered popcorn, there are teachable moments in these modern parables and character studies. We have a brief window, usually when our children are between the ages of 13 and 18, to watch and discuss mature-minded movies *together*, before they're out on their own.\\"In this helpful introduction, Smithouser states that the pitfalls of a legalistic approach \\"often breeds rebellion\\" and the other extreme, permissiveness \\"inevitably leads to indecent exposure.\\" He goes on to say, \\"the answer lies somewhere in between. That's because teaching discernment inspires critical thinking based on clearly defined boundaries, bonds families, and gives adolescents life skills they'll carry with them into adulthood.\\"He makes clear that Focus on the Family does not necessarily endorse the films suggested in this book. The 25 titles range from G to PG-13 ratings, with the majority of titles made since 1990. I personally think the list is a wonderful selection (based on the films I've seen).Here's the complete list, in alphabetical order: Apollo 13; Chariots of Fire; The Count of Monte Cristo; Ever After; Fiddler on the Roof; Galaxy Quest; Groundhog Day; Hoosiers; It's a Wonderful Life; A Knight's Tale; Life is Beautiful; Little Women; The Mission; Mr. Holland's Opus; October Sky; The Princess Bride; Quiz Show; Remember the Titans; Searching for Bobby Fischer; Sense and Sensibility; Sergeant York; Shadowlands; To Kill a Mockingbird; The Truman Show; and Unbreakable.The section for each movie gives the rating, mentions themes, the running time, stars and the director. Then the body of each chapter discusses cautions; story summary; things to do \\"before you watch,\\" Bible bookmarks with related scripture references; talking points, follow-up activity and \\"just for fun\\" information about the film.There are two appendixes. The first, called \\"Hollywood and the Bible,\\" provides some topics for discussion \\"across the dinner table\\" on things like character, despair, discernment and human nature. The second appendix discusses \\"the power of story\\" by analyzing the classic Jimmy Stewart film, \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\" This chapter alone would be helpful for any student studying literature in a high school English class.It might also be added that Plugged In Magazine has many more reviews that can be found on the Focus on the Family web site. But a book like this is helpful for pointing you in the right direction at the outset, as opposed to wading through reviews on this and other sites (or in other books) until you find an acceptable film you all will like."},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"Of all of C.S. Lewis' books, this is one of the few that I sincerely disagree with. Lewis here lays out a claim about the difference between two basic kinds of aesthetic appreciation - on the one hand are people who appreciate the form of art, and the other, people who inject their own private meaning into it, thus viewing art and aesthetic experience in primarily functional terms. This distinction seems to me to be fundamentally flawed, and although Lewis gives a periodic nod to the artificiality of the dichotomy he has here created, the language he uses only obscures the reality of his fundamental point.I respect C.S. Lewis a great deal, but I believe that this book is evidence of his insulation in academia (and this review is being written by an academic, no less). For someone like him, who has made careful thinking his life's business, the 'dark gods of the woods' that call so imploringly to the 'common man' appear quite vulgar and pagan (and he has said as much elsewhere). The participation that normal people have with art is, from the point of view of someone who has spent a lifetime isolating and clarifying this very experience, quite sloppy and low. In this book, he has let those intuitive reactions get mixed up with his philosophy, and it makes for a fairly sloppy book. This surprised me, because Lewis' work on medieval thought is excellent, perhaps the best there is. As Barfield points out, medieval aesthetics are highly participatory.For books on aesthetics and literature from a religious perspective, I would sooner recommend Owen Barfield (oddly enough, one of Lewis' closest friends). Barfield seems to me to be much more careful in his thinking on this particular topic."},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"I can hear it now. The disparagement that Lewis is guilty of classism. That Lewis represents that awful \\"elite\\" attitude. He doesn't (really) but would be jusitified if he did considering his age, upbringing, cultural heritage, and education.However, what he actually does is carefully describe how NOT to do that where literature is concerned. He states, and I agree, that persons individually expect things from the books they choose to read. Because this is true, it is nonsensical to label a book as \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" without considering the audience to which that book was intended to be played.Once, however, that distinction (in vulgar modern parlance), the intended demographic has been identified AND that demographic includes those \\"who read seriously\\" as Bauer defines it in her excellent The Well-Educated Mind then one can almost start talking about whether a work is good or bad. Almost.Lewis says, \\"Now the true reader reads every work seriously in the sense that he reads it whole-heartedly, makes himself as receptive as he can.\\" This is not the same thing as being \\"serious\\" or grave - it means paying attention! It means treating the act of reading itself as something worthy of time, effort, and value. There is a spectrum of \\"reading seriously\\" and I fall near the beginning of it. However, Mr. Lewis very clearly helped me realize \\"what\\" gives me the intense pleasure I experience when reading (although very catholic in selections.)I especially appreciated his opinion (near the end of the book) about the impact of those \\"evaluators\\" - the writers of literary criticism as opposed to the reviewers of individual works. He said, \\"...young people drenched,dizzied,and bedeviled by criticism to a point at which primary literary experience is no longer possible. This state of affairs seems to me a far great threat to our culture than any of those from which the Vigilants would protect us. Such a surfeit of criticism is so dangerous that it demand immediate treatment. Surfeit, we have been told, is the father of fast. I suggest a ten or twenty years' abstinence both from the reading and from the writing of evaluative criticism might do use all a great deal of good.\\"This, IMO, coincides perfectly with Lewis' discussion of Logos and Poiema - \\"means\\" and \\"is.\\" He says that it is unnecessary to require that literature \\"improve\\" the reader or alert him to faults in the world or himself. I will further construe and say that much of modern literary theory invests far too much emphasis on mining works for that feature. I have become increasingly impatient with the literary theorist who appears to build his self-esteem on the simultaneous \\"discovery\\" of world-shaking wisdom in a work and the boast that he, alone, has discovered it. But I digress ...Lewis helped me see my own reading experience as follows: \\"Here [ reading ], as in worship, in love, in moral action, and in knowing, I transcend myself; and am never more myself than when I do.\\"Simply an excellent book with, IMO, a very rational approach to literary criticism. Shame, really, that no one ever seems to have practiced it in the professional world of that field.DLReview of An Experiment in Criticism (Canto Classics) [Paperback] - yes, bought from Amazon but no one is reviewing that edition so I placed my review here.DL"},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"Quote:Secondly, the majority, though they are sometimes frequent readers, do not set much store by reading.

Stemming from his \\"day jobs\\" at Oxford and Cambridge, Lewis' essay turns literary criticism on its head. He proposes that, rather than analyze what a given book seems to be saying, we analyze why we read a book. The whole is an interesting venture into reading books with open minds, but may prove obtuse to the casual reader. Only recommended for the serious student of literature."},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"Being an admirer of C.S. Lewis, I have often wondered what it is about his writing that I find so appealing. Many times I have had the experience of reading an especially good passage from another author and thinking to myself \\"that sounds like something Lewis would have written.\\" Notice that I used the word \\"sound\\". Lewis doesn't simply convey information; he, like any good writer, writes with liquid words. And this book (\\"An Experiment in Criticism\\") is no different. The main point of the book, as many other reviewers have stated, is that readers should \\"receive\\" books instead of \\"using\\" them. In other words, don't fight the book you are reading, even if it is something that you disagree with. Lewis says that \\"we can find a book bad only by reading it as if it might, after all, be very good,\\" and that \\"...no work can succeed without a preliminary act of good will on the part of the reader.\\" Lewis defines a good book as one that \\"elicits good reading.\\" Now, to find out what he means by \\"good\\" reading you have to read the book. When it comes to criticism, Lewis says that \\"You cannot be armed to the teeth and surrendered at the same moment.\\" How many times have you read an Amazon review in which the reviewer clearly never put down his weapons? It's a wonder that they could even hold the book up to read with all the weaponry in their hands.In a chapter about realism, Lewis presents, very charmingly, a brilliant and simple argument for the adult reading of children's literature and fantasy. I myself like to read classic children's literature from time to time--admittedly wondering, all the while, if it is a fault to do so--and Lewis clearly shows how erroneous and silly that worry is. He is famous for his asides. The man truly possesses a philosophical mind. I imagine Lewis as a little boy trying to convince his dad that it would be okay if he stayed up late to read. \\"Dad, let me tell you why it wouldn't hurt anything; I have some pretty good reasons.\\" \\"Jack,\\" says Lewis's dad, \\"just go to bed; tomorrow is another day.\\" \\"Yeah but just listen.\\" \\"Fine, go ahead.\\" Lewis then proceeds to lay down such a tight logical argument that his dad can do nothing but turn and leave the room as little Jack runs to the bookshelf. Ha! Ha!There is a very interesting chapter on poetry. Lewis wonders if poetry will suffer the same fate as rhetoric: once being important and vital, but eventually being confined strictly to academia. Lewis wrote this in 1961, and my own opinion is that poetry is now there. For example, I took a literature class a few semesters ago that completely--and intentionally--ignored poetry. But Lewis has plenty more to say about poetry. I thought this was a great quote about modern poetry: \\"It is a pity if a glazed picture is so placed that you see in it only your own reflection; it is not a pity when a mirror is so placed.\\" In other words, in reading \\"old poetry,\\" one should be able to grasp the authors intention; but when reading modern poetry, it is sometimes only possible to ultimately see yourself. And \\"that's not a pity,\\" says Lewis. With that being said, I think Lewis prefers the old--as do I.Lewis is utterly fair in this book. There were a few times when I thought that he was going to slam a certain style or book or way of reading, but he never does. To put it simply, the man is very kind. He is also very interesting to read. If there is anyone with the credentials to discuss books and reading, it is C.S. Lewis. I have heard many a Lewis scholar talk of their amazement at the amount of books he read. Peter Kreeft once offhandedly commented that \\"it seems as if Lewis has read every book ever written.\\" But before we read as many books as Lewis, we have to read this book first. As Lewis says in another essay, \\"You can't get second things by putting them first; you can get second things only by putting first things first.\\" Read this book and gain the tools to tackle, and fully digest and receive, all other books. If you're a big time reader--or if you don't presently enjoy reading but want to acquire the taste--this is a book you need to read. I have found that I can go back to this book again and again, and I continue to find things that I never knew were there.(If your main interest is with non-fiction, I would suggest Mortimer Adler's classic book entitled \\"How to Read a Book.\\")"},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"Why read? C.S. Lewis says because it is a hedonistic pleasure and it is \\"good\\". Good for Lewis does not mean the subject matter is true or even logical but dependent on individual need.In the first chapter he compares buying a book to someone who buys a picture. The need can be very different from one person to the next. One might buy the picture to cover a bare spot on the wall and then after a week or two the pictures become mostly invisible to them. The good news is that the bare spot is now invisable too. Another person would buy a picture, live with it, and actually feed off of it, for years. This book helps to understand what it might mean to \\"feed off\\" what the book said showing that reading allows one to become what they had not been before. He likens this condition to a Greek poem saying, \\"I see with a myriad of eyes, but it is still I who see\\".The book has eleven chapters and an epilogue. Many of these chapters deal with the different choices and kinds of things people read. It concludes with a final chapter that draws conclusions about how literary tastes, reading choices and the process and approach to reading. The book concludes that the way we read is more important than what we read. Mastering the process suggested enables us to become, as he suggests, \\"a thousand men and yet remain myself\\".Rather than pushing a point of view, something it could be assumed and even expected that a Christian writer would do, this book pushes the idea of real agency of reading choice. He then shows how pleasurable the experience can be."},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"What is most original about this work for the reader is that C. S. Lewis leaves the literary reader free to be open to new and old works of literature and non-fiction without suffering the false limitations of snobbery. He writes that he finds the standards of what constitutes great literature insupportable either by Logos or by science. His \\"experiment\\" in criticism in this work, largely but not exclusively, is to criticize the main false standards of literary taste and the critics who helped make them -- including Matthew Arnold, Aristotle, and I.A. Richards, for it is not they, the critics, who made great works like \\"Oedipus Rex\\" and \\"King Lear,\\" but it is these great works of literature that have made the critics worth reading.C.S. Lewis here advances a number of interesting insights about novels, some of which involve false and subtle notions of realism and what constitutes the realistic novel as well as what is the modus operandi of science fiction and how impossible it is to classify it even as a genre. His defense of the fairy tale to be read by adults, not children, is another bit of evidence that the discussions in this work, even about non-literary reading and literary reading, are not predictable, pre-cut, academic lectures but come out of his personal journey in reading and the intellectual introspection that accompanied it, all of which are provocative and refreshingly unusual.This book definitely rewards the reading time spent, and certainly as well it bears a rereading with justified expectations of newer delights. C. S. Lewis's style here is succinct but somewhat stodgy and formal, though not one word is wasted and the big picture eventually emerges with an amazing economy of language. In final, great literature takes the reader out of himself or herself and enlarges the reader expansively in a manner that no other mode of expression can, enhancing his or her familiarity and sensitivity to lives far beyond one's narrow, time-bound perceptions."},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"This is the best book I've ever seen on reading books. Lewis does not judge books but readers here. He breaks us down into the literary and non literary. It's fun to see which category one fits in via his thoughts on the matter. If you bother to read this book at all then you surely fall into the former; the latter wouldn't bother with a work like this.Lewis teaches us the difference between \\"using\\" art and \\"receiving\\" it. He bids us to get lost in books and fully enter the world of the writer. And in the Epilogue he gives the best defense for reading fiction that I've ever seen (this goes for his thoughts on reading Myth as well).This is also a great book if you're trying to improve your writing and story-telling.I read this book twice, took lots of notes, and can honestly say it has not only made a difference, but will continue to do so."},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"After purchasing, reading and being wowed by the author's A Preface to Paradise Lost, I opened this book with great anticipation. I was not disappointed.Even though Lewis separates readers into the unliterary and the literary, I don't think his main point is to condemn the reading habits of the masses. His main point is to clarify the nature of the literary experience. Lewis ends up criticizing the academic discipline of literary criticism rather sharply. In Lewis's view, these academic practices will harm the literary experience for the serious reader with their obsession over critical reading and the obligation to state a clever opinion.However, this point does not become obvious until the second half of the book. He gradually builds up to it through a series of clever but deceptively simple ideas. If you would like a quick summary of Lewis's position on the literary experience, it may be worthwhile to turn to \\"Survey\\" (Chapter 9) first. Of course, I wholeheartedly recommend starting from the first chapter again.Lewis performs a great service for those \\"who seek more in their reading\\" by clarifying the difference between the literary experience and the philosophical experience. One reads Dante not to derive a theology, but to experience what it feels like to be a theist. To me, this is the most valuable lesson of the book."},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"Reading this book I was reminded of the book on writing by Dorothy Sayers called \\"The Mind of the Maker\\". That was itself a wonderful book with the writer having a clear scheme of how she saw the role of the writer. What was most insightful was her perception of a Trinitarian structure to writing. Lewis' book is very different - its about the art of reading, namely what makes a good reader of a book. The question of what is or what is not a good book is not addressed head on. Instead we get reflecting on how and how not to read a book. The book does not have the organic unity of Sayers' book and I am not sure after a single reading whether I can encapsulate what Lewis is trying to say. Undoubtedly a key element for Lewis is that reading must not be utilitarian, the reader must surrender or rest in a work and given himself over to it like he would to play or to contemplation (\\"The first demand any work of art makes upon us is surrender\\") . He contrasts this with using art: \\"Using is inferior to reception because art, if used rather than received, merely facilitates, brightens, relieves and palliates our life, and does not add to it\\".So, for Lewis, there is a quasi spiritual aspect to reading. For Lewis, the person who is only interested in what happened is unlikely to be a good reader. The value of this book lies not therefore in the coherence of its message (its not entirely clear to me) but rather in a number of highly perceptive statements scattered throughout the work such as:\\"Those who read great works, on the other hand, will read the same work ten, twenty or thirty times during the course of their life\\". This statement surprised me - yes I have read some books 2 or 3 times but this number?Lewis describes a first reading as \\"an experience so momentous that only experience of love, religion, or bereavement can furnish a standard of comparison.\\"Lewis emphasises the importance of reading contextually: \\"For he will read, in the same spirit that the author writ\\"Lewis sees no problem with the desire to escape: \\"Now, there is a clear sense in which all reading whatever is an escape. It involves a temporary transference of the mind from our actual surroundings to things merely imagined or conceived\\"Surprisingly he is prepared to praise works whose themes he despises: \\"A true lover of literature should in one way like an honest examiner, who is prepared to give the higher marks to the telling, felicitious and well documented exposition of views he dissents from or even abominates\\"And, in this statement Lewis reminds me of discussions on the Liturgy where one desires that the celebrant is almost invisible (at least that is my wish!): \\"The necessary condition of all good reading is \\"to get ourselves out of the way\\"It is in the final chapter of the book that we begin to mine pure gold and Lewis shows us why he is a great thinker where he discusses what we are trying to do when we read:\\"We seek an enlargement of our being. We want to be more than ourselves. Each of us by nature sees the whole world from one point of view with a perspective and a selectiveness peculiar to himself..We want to see with other eyes, to imagine with other imaginations, to feel with other hearts, as well as with our own...to see what they see, to occupy, for while, their seat in the great theatre, to use their spectacles and to be made free of whatever insights, joys, terrors, wonders or merriment those spectacles reveal. Literature gives the entree to them all. Those of us who have been true readers all our life seldom full realise the enormous extension of being which we owe to authors, We realise it best when we talk with an unliterary friend. He may be full of goodness and good sense but he inhabits a tiny world. In it, we should be suffocated. The man who is contented to be only himself, and therefore less a self, is in prison. My own eyes are not enough for me, I will see through those of others. Reality, even seen through the eyes of many, is not enough. I will see that others have invented. Literary experience heals the wounds, without undermining the privilege, of individuality.Now we get to the final ecstatic moment:\\"But in reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself. Like the night sky in the greek poem, I see with a myriad eyes, but it is still I who see. Here, as in worship, in love, in moral action, and in knowing, I transcend myself, and am never more myself when I do\\".Does Lewis go too far in waxing so lyrically? I don't think so but as long as we realise that Lewis is reflecting on one aspects of man's being - his intellectual sphere (although it does include the heart). Man also enlarges his heart and transcends himself when he lives a life of virtue. So both the mind and the heart need, in so far as possible, be engaged to live the enlarged life!"},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"I now have a great appreciation for book reviewers and pay much more attention to my own styles of writing and reading.There was an interview with JK Rowling in which the interviewer asked her when she found time to read, and she replied (to paraphrase), \\"When I'm standing at the stove, when I'm on the john, when I'm waiting for a bus, when I'm eating, when I'm about to fall asleep ... How could I ever be too busy to read?\\"And if I am not mistaken, this illustrates pretty well what CSL tries to say about readers - we fall into two groups: those who receive books and those who use them. We can learn from what we read, or we can use it and forget about it. JK, CSL, and myself (I'd like to think) fall into the former category.This is not all he has to say, so by all means read it (it goes quick) and revel in CSL's uncommon good sense."},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"Whether one otherwise adores or detests C. S. Lewis, this is a book every reader can love. Arguing that the focus in reading should not be on whether a book is a great work or not, he insists what is important is whether a book is susceptible to great reading. The result is that otherwise flawed and perhaps imperfect books (e.g., Toltoy's &quot;Master and Man,&quot; with the previously unhinted conversion of the master at the end) can be read well, while others cannot. Lewis was one of my earliest influences, and while I have over the years come to hold his religious works in lower and lower regard (I prefer Kierkegaard's passionate uncertainty to Lewis's smug confidence)I have come back to this one again and again for insight and stimulation. Along with STUDIES IN WORDS and the Narnia books, this book is Lewis's masterpiece."},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"This book was a wonderful read and more than a read. While I read it, it was cutting the support from under my reading inhibitions and applying a solvent to the cement that held my reading in its grasp. In the end Lewis offered me to see the whole world and something more than the whole world in new light with new eyes. :)"},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"How do you review a book about reviewing? Or more accurately, about how one should truly read? Worse yet, what if the author comes right out and says that, if one reads a book with the intent to review it, they can never get the real meaning of the book?With great miserableness, I must admit, I agree with Lewis on that point. As I've reviewed for Amazon these past eight years, I find that I often am reading a book while trying to determine the good and bad aspects of it. I am often thinking in the back of my mind what star rating it will receive, and what I will be writing. There are certainly some books that get past my defenses, and flood me into a new world, likeThe City of Dreaming Books- but not the majority. Perhaps I can console myself that I often review and read nonfiction. But the result is I am not fully engaging in literature as art. I am not fully allowing the author to wash over me, as Lewis suggests, and accepting the author's worldview, if only for a moment. When I review, or read with the intent to review, I use the art, rather than am immersed in it. And Lewis is right- all art, including literature, deserves to be accepted for what it is, and what it intends. It is not that the literature needs to be pedantic, but rather, if it is good, if it is well-written, then it will change us- if we allow it.So I resolve to remember this book, in my future reading, and my future reviewing. And I could say, of this particular book, that it is well-written. But I think that is said enough when I confess that it will change how I read all future books, and it will affect how I approach all future reviews."},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"C.S. Lewis' \\"Experiment in Criticism\\" is one of those great books that gives one a new lens with which to view life. This book caused me to do a lot of self-examination and reflection on how I interact not just with literature, but also with culture as a whole.Lewis' point is that there is not a real \\"bad\\" or \\"good\\" literature. The value of what we read is in how we interact with it. Lewis defines how people interact with culture in terms of \\"The Few\\" and \\"The Many.\\"\\"The Few\\" are the literary (in other fields they would be musical, have a palette capable of enjoying the best food, or an eye for art). The literary count reading as valuable, read books more than once, are able to be changed by what they read, and remember and share works or pieces of works with others.\\"The Many\\" are the unliterary. Unliterary people generally don't accuse the literary of reading the wrong books-they wonder why literary people make such a big fuss about books at all. They never read a book twice. Their interaction with a work is not deeply felt. Though they may \\"read a lot\\" they don't \\"set much store by it.\\"Lewis draws some interesting comparisons with other forms of cultural involvement. He compares these two styles of reading with how some people interact with art and music. Just because one is in the literary \\"Few\\" does not mean that they are part of the \\"Few\\" in other venues.Chapter five, \\"On Myth,\\" is incredibly valuable in discussing myth as well as the value of modern genres such as Fantasy and Science Fiction. It is a wonderful area to start exploring what has come to be termed \\"Mythopoeic literature.\\"Another notable section is chapter seven which is a discussion of realism. Lewis' definition is broader than the usual. Personally, in changing my perception of what \\"realistic\\" fiction is, this chapter probably influenced me more than any other.This is a book capable of changing the reader's view of culture. It is therefore of great value. I give it my heartfelt recommendation."},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"Typical of Lewis's deeper insight into things, his &quot;Experiment&quot; consists in a reversal of the usual method of literary judgement. Instead of classifying BOOKS, he classifies READERS and how they &quot;use&quot; or &quot;receive&quot; books. The true (unbiased) critic does not pontificate a judgement of 'good' or 'bad' upon a book without careful cosideration of the possible confusion between degrees of merit and differences of kind. &quot;I want to convince people,&quot; says Lewis, &quot;that adverse judgements are always the most hazardous... A negative proposition is harder to establish than a positive. One glance may enable us to say there is a spider in the room; we should need a spring-cleaning (at least) before we could say with certainty that there wasn't. When we pronounce a book good we have a positive experience of our own to go upon... In calling the book bad we are claiming not that it can elicit bad reading, but that it can't elicit good. This negative proposition can never be certain.&quot;Central to his argument is the fact that the same book may be read in different ways. It follows then that there is a certain speculative nature to evaluative criticism, and therefore no amount of reliance upon literary criticism can absolve one from the responsibility of becoming a GOOD READER. And what is a good reader? Well, that is the question isn't it? In my opinion (and it is just that... an opinion) I feel that reading Lewis's &quot;Experiment&quot; can answer that question more effectively than anything I've ever come across. Read it, and see where you fit into Lewis's categories of the &quot;literary&quot; and the &quot;unliterary&quot; person (too lengthy to enumerate here). If at any point, you feel offended and want to hurl the book across the room... you are of the latter category.Lewis deplored the technical dissection of what he loved so dearly... the simple act of reading. I loved his image in chapter 2 of the &quot;status seeker&quot; type of readers, gathered to discuss the finer (and, of course HIDDEN) points of &quot;approved literature&quot; while the only real literary experience in such a scenario &quot;may be occurring in a back bedroom where a small boy is reading Treasure Island under the bed-clothes by the light of an electric torch.&quot;Lewis sought in books (as he called it here) an &quot;enlargement of his being&quot;. He says on page 52, &quot;I am probably one of many who, on a wakeful night, entertain themselves with invented landscapes. I trace great rivers from where the gulls scream at the estuary, through the windings of ever narrower and more precipitous gorges, up to the barely audible tinkling of their source in a fold of the moors. But I am not there myself as explorer or even as tourist. I am looking at that world from outside.&quot; This is a terrific/significant book that will be read, re-read, and cherished by anyone who has ever had similar musings. Oh, and by the way... all GOOD readers have !"},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"As a person whose life is dedicated to art in all its various incarnations, this has proved the single most enlightening work I have ever had the pleasure of reading. While it itself is literary criticism and in one sense not literature but a study thereof, it's the most radical, revolutionary book I have read regarding art. Before I can continue, one point needs to be cleared first.I'm a Christian, and I believe the single most important priority is to lead people to the knowledge and saving grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. You can do such through art. However, anything that Lewis wrote that lead someone to Jesus is, of course, more important than this book in that respect. Jesus comes first, art comes underneath that in priority, as do all things. That being said:AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM is the single most important work C. S. Lewis has produced when it comes to literature and the arts. THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, the SPACE TRILOGY, and TILL WE HAVE FACES are literature, but this overwhelms them all - not because of what it is (a universal principle that can be applied to art), but because of what it is not (a story or work of art that not everyone will have the same taste for). People may or may not like his fiction (although I find it rare to meet a person who doesn't like NARNIA) - but this book anyone can appreciate, especially those interested in literature in specific and art in general (for, although it concerns itself primarily with literature, this book also stands in defense of drama, music, painting, and the artistic endeavours of humankind in general). Because there are differing tastes in terms of fiction, people who will not read Lewis's own literature will (or should) read this. This element comes into play at the last chapter, where Lewis brings out how hard it is to take down a work with this apparatus, because, while you may not enjoy a work, others may. Literature is a very highly subjective experience.CRITICISM's central argument rests in the fact that books should not be judged by some arbitrary critical analyses, but by what response it elicits in the reader. This book contains one of Lewis's famous quotes, at the end of the Epilogue: \\"But in reading literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself.\\" That is the central thesis of this work: not to approach a piece of literature, or movie, or painting, or drama, as something to experience and forget immediately afterward, but to enter into it, surrender to it, and approach it with an open mind. That is one thing that is so great about this book - even people who have prejudices against Lewis can read this work.It also points out the central flaw in evaluative criticism: it may dominate and wipe away the chance at a reader appreciated the work for what it really is, and to experience it in the reader's own way. Lewis does not argue that all evaluative criticism is bad - there's a very human need, he says, to \`compare notes', and that is normal, but to much has been given over to this \`note comparison' and not enough to the actual work of art. People, especially students (Lewis was, by profession, a medieval literature professor), had quite a broad range of knowledge concerning Chaucerian and Shakespearian criticism and hardly any of Chaucer or Shakespeare (he cited this example at the end of the last chapter). To much has been given over to criticism.Although I will continue to write reviews, this book has forever changed my approach. Lewis states that one can have an appreciation of a work without the critics, but one CANNOT have an appreciation of the critics without the author. Now I propose that all reviewers should read this book, and keep this in mind when writing. I certainly will. It is also my personal belief that anyone in universities who are studying literature should be required to read this book at the start of their very first semester, so they may examine their motives of precisely WHY they are in this study.Indeed, the biggest tragedy of this book is, I fear, it is not highly enough read. Regardless of your views on C. S. Lewis, this is one book everyone should read who professes a love for art, and ESPECIALLY by all who write literary criticism. And while that profession does have a place in our world (where would academia be without it? \`Publish or perish!'), it is superseded in importance by the art that it deals with, and we should first immerse ourselves in it, sometimes several times over, before we turn away and reach for that scholarly volume. And if it's a good work, it will only encourage you more to go to the work at hand and discover for yourself what the art can do for you. (Shippey's ROAD TO MIDDLE-EARTH is a good example of a well-written criticism). Lewis said one good element about criticism is, if the critics truly care for the art, the enthusiasm will be apparent, and it may cause you to read literature otherwise unknown to you. Also, a central element is the difficulty in producing condemnation to a work. It's a good case against censorship, because although a great work can be abused, it can also be used properly. One may classical images and use it as pornography - while one may look at it and fall in love with the Renaissance. Of course, PLAYBOY is mainly used for lust.A side note: Pay close attention to the chapter on MYTH, which is a central element in both Tolkien and Lewis. This alone should make it required reading for anyone who study the lives of these two great Christian writers. This work also shows you the depth of versatility of how well-read C. S. Lewis actually was, and shows his phenomenal memory of such things."},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"Contents:I The Few and the ManyII False CharacterisationsIII How the Few and the Many use Pictures and MusicIV The Reading of the UnliteraryV On MythVI The Meanings of FantasyVII On RealismsVIII On Misreading by the LiteraryIX SurveyX PoetryXI The ExperimentEpilogue, AppendixWhile this work is clearly a scholarly work, aimed at a scholarly audience, it is neither desirable that it be excluded from the modern scholar's library (because it is written by C.S.

In fact, this text is so lucid in analysis, so reasonable in proposition, and so erudite in perspective that it is a must for every English or Humanities undergrad or graduate student, and any person who desires a deeper understanding of literature.Lewis examines what makes for beneficial reading and why. He does not judge; he merely describes. However, he does draw some startling conclusions (especially to the modern literary mind) as a result of his analysis-conclusions that are in many respects more applicable today than when they were first composed.Regardless of the reader's agreement with Lewis' propositions, the mere journey through his critical process is an enrichment and a delight. I urge all serious students of literature to engage in the dialogue contained herein. It is well worth the effort.--The Medieval Chick"},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"According to Lewis, we judge a person's taste by what he or she reads. Instead, Lewis proposes an experiment: to judge literature by the way person read it. Thus, good literature is that which compels good reading.Lewis begins his discussion of good reading by an analysis of viewing pictures and listening to music - to the experience of art generally. Of the two ways to experience art, receiving and using, receiving art is best because it helps us transcend ourselves. When we receive art we allow our senses to follow the pattern defined by the artist. The art thus enriches our life, allowing us to see or experience something foreign and new. On the other hand, when we use art, we are merely using it to confirm or facilitate ideas, feelings, and beliefs that we already hold. We have not allowed art to enrich our life.Lewis mostly defines good reading by comparing it to bad reading. He, of course, describes in detail these habits. Ultimately, Lewis believes that we read literature to transcend ourselves, and yet paradoxically we are never more ourselves than when we do."},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"Well-worth your time! Yes, Lewis is elitist, and yes, he creates a binary of sorts between the many and the few. However... talk about a fresh look at reader-response criticism!Lewis argues that the best readers do not &quot;use&quot; texts to write their own stories within. Rather, the best readers are those who &quot;receive&quot; the text. In an era where ideology threatens literature and authors, Lewis offers a more noble route.This book changed the way I read. And its not too long. =)"},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"Like famed Canadian novelist Robertson Davies, C.S. Lewis believed that a great reader is someone who enters fully into the experience of the writer, who gives his whole attention to what he is reading, and who brings to a book a curiosity and a sympathy to surrender to the work on which the author is engaged. In this way, great reading is similar to love, moral action, and intellectual achievement. Even those who with whom we disagree can teach us to see the world through their eyes. As Lewis says, &quot;in reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself.&quot; In this way, literature can enlarge ourselves and our view of the world. Lewis argues it is less important to decide between reading what is considered &quot;high brow&quot; versus &quot;low brow&quot; than it is to learn to read greatly. AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM was a delightful book to read, chock full of illustrations to demonstrate the points being made. Avid readers will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"Despite the dry title, this book is a must-read for anyone whose life has been shaped by books. In AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM, Lewis explores the experience of reading. He suggests that the majority of people &quot;use&quot; reading, for information, or entertainment, or distraction. Others use reading as a subject to be studied and become experts at technical criticism. But for some few people reading is a much more significant activity. Such people don't use the books they read; they receive them. They return over and over to the same books which provide &quot;a sort of iconography by which they interpret or sum up their own experience.&quot; For such readers, reading changes the consciousness, and the experience of reading a particular book may be as significant as experiences of romance, or travel, or spiritual insight for other people. Lewis doesn't suggest that the few readers who have this experience of reading are more intelligent than the many who do not. Other people may create the iconography of their lives based on music, or visual art, or personal relationships. But for those few who read in the way Lewis describes here, reading is central to life. If reading is central to your life, you must experience this book."},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"\\"You can't get a book long enough or a cup of tea big enough to suit me,\\" C.S. Lewis once said. Well of course-- an Oxford and Cambridge prof. I'm the opposite: I should like a small cup and a brief book, preferably one with short chapters I can read at a sitting. This brief book doesn't fulfill Lewis' criteria, but it does mine. I also like to read slowly, with a book mark under the line, savoring every word. This book reads delightfully slow and is, oddly enough, a book about reading.Given the fact that Lewis seems to be replying to some thesis or idea of which I am unaware, which is far more the case in The Abolition of Man, which many people nevertheless read with profit, and that one might question the very idea of a book about reading (who needs that?) this remains one of my favorite Lewis books and has done its work so well that I nearly cannot say why. What I do know is that it's entirely changed the way I read (and view reading), and made it a pleasure above TV and video games. I still don't desire to delve into thick tomes or to quaff large steaming cups of of Earl Grey, but this Oxford don has given my small small draughts and slim pages a deeper enjoyment."},{"Title":"An Experiment in Criticism","review":"C.S. Lewis is the very embodiment of the open-minded Christian, of which \\"An Experiment in Criticism\\" is perhaps the best example.Many Christians today have what C.S. Lewis calls a \\"problem of belief.\\" If they read books like \\"Harry Potter\\" at all (which they usually do not), they quickly voice their disagreement with certain ethical implications or their concern that the books incite dangerous magical practices (they also frequently voice their disagreement even when they have not read the books). Or they point out that God is totally left out of the picture.Aside from the question whether such qualms are justified, C.S. Lewis would reply that in good reading there ought to be no \\"problem of belief.\\" \\"A true lover of literature should be in one way like an honest examiner, who is prepared to give the highest marks to the telling, felicitous and well-documented exposition of views he dissents from or even abominates,\\" says Lewis in \\"An Experiment in Criticism.\\" \\"I read Lucretius and Dante at a time when (by and large) I agreed with Lucretius. I have read them since I came (by and large) to agree with Dante. I cannot find that this has much altered my experience, or at all altered my evaluation, of either.\\"In the book, C.S. Lewis maintains that one of the prime achievements in every good fiction \\"has nothing to do with truth or philosophy or a Weltanschauung\\" (worldview) at all. This is especially true of Lewis's favorite kind of fiction: fantasy. The primary value he saw in reading fantasy was not that he could learn truths about life but that through it he could be more than himself. He wanted to \\"see with other eyes, to imagine with other imaginations, to feel with other hearts,\\" as well as with his own. Reality, even seen through the eyes of many, was not enough. He wanted to see what others had invented.He would therefore (I think) have delighted to enter into the beliefs of J.K. Rowling or Philip Pullman, even though, as a Christian, he would have thought certain aspects of them untrue. His defense for doing this, \\"for occupying his heart with stories of what never happened and entering vicariously into feelings\\" which he tried to avoid having in his own person, was that in reading them he became \\"a thousand men and yet remained\\" himself. He saw \\"with a myriad eyes,\\" but it was still he who saw. \\"Here, as in worship, in love, in moral action, and in knowing,\\" he transcended himself; and was never more himself than when he did. \\"The man who is contented to be only himself, and therefore less a self, is in prison,\\" he wrote.It is needless to say that in this way C.S. Lewis learned much more from his reading than a person who looks in every book for truths about life, only to find on every page his own face staring at him. Such a person, says Lewis, \\"attributes to his chosen author what he believes to be wisdom; and the sort of thing that seems wise to him will obviously be determined by his own caliber. If he is a fool he will find and admire foolishness; if he is a mediocrity, platitude, in all his favourties. At best he is a profound thinker himself, and what he acclaims as his author's philosophy might in itself be good, but in reality be merely his own.\\"C.S. Lewis was not like that. He honestly tried to put himself into the shoes of the authors he was reading.Whether or not you agree with C.S. Lewis's approach to reading, if you want to get to know Lewis the READER and not just the writer, \\"An Experiment in Criticism\\" is your prime source.An admirable and provocative little book.- Jacob Schriftman, Author of The C.

Nothing helps you more in understanding religious differences and truths than to study the history of the Reformation. Today's TV evangelical churches are in serious need of another reformation as people are being misled with doctrines of Freud, feeling good, becoming properous, and entertainment. It is not Biblical (or possible) to make a personal decision to believe as faith is a gift of God. In additon, faith comes from sound doctrine in the form of Biblical scripture, not man's doctrines. The Bible warns of this pitfall, and your soul is at risk if you fail to understand this, 2 Peter 3:15-16. There exists a serious lack of spiritual knowledge and doctrinal discernment.

I dismissed it then as racist garbage and a crude caricature of Black folklore.Essentially, this book contains parodies of biblical tales as supposedly imagined by Black Louisianans and inspired the classic \\"The Green Pastures.\\"I was at first put off by some of the book. The ending of the story of Cain (you have to read this yourself to \\"get it\\") was repulsive and the imagery of black biblical characters using minstrel dialect and crap shooting and such made me dislike this upon initial reading and I took it back to the library. However, I read where the white folklorist Roark Bradford got much of this material from actual imaginative sermons from rural Black preachers who often used such imagery to help their often non-literate congregations relate to the tales of the Bible. In reading some WPA interviews with ex-slave preachers such as Isaiah Moore of South Carolina (who told a Nicodemus story very similar to the version used here), and listening to Document Records' sermons of actual rural black preachers of the 1920s and 30s (Rev. J.M Gates, \\"Sin Killer\\" Griffin, and the \\"Black Billy Sunday\\" in particular who were usually more entertaining than inspirational), I see this may have indeed been the case.However, as is the case with Marc Connelly's \\"The Green Pastures,\\" there are moments of real warmth, humanity, and whimsy to these tales beyond the stereotyping. This is evident particularly in the renditions of Lot and his wife, the Noah scene (recereated in detail in the movie version), the Moses epic, and the struggles of Joshua. Beneath the foolishness lies some basic and eternal truths about human nature. Bradford can also be credited with some serious Biblical knowledge, as a good deal of the tales are from the more obscure Biblical stories (such as Ballam & the Mule).While the stereotyping and dialect make this uncomfortable for most modern readers, there is value here if you are able to get past those aspects."},{"Title":"The green pastures: A fable suggested by Roark Bradford's southern sketches, \\"Ol' man Adam an' his chillun\\"","review":"one of the best things i have read in a while. it was very pleasant to revisit this classic.

This is a difficult book from the standpoint that without some exposure to the London Underground transit system, one is reading the story from a slight disadvantage.

So I will leave you with this enticement. It is, in a very odd way, a fun read that goes by all too quickly. As in all of Barbara Vine's novels, justice is served up sooner or later (usually later) and, as always, it is never polite justice. Barbara Vine delivers the kind of justice that one dreams of but rarely ever sees. The last page of this novel is well worth the wait.A word of warning to the readers who are squeamish around the subject of feeding the animals. The hawk belonging to Jed, Abelard, is especially fond of a certain delicacy that is very hard to envision without a lurching of the stomach. Not for the faint of heart!On that note, if Ruth Rendell ever reads her reviews on Amazon, and she really should, I hope that they will serve as a justification for no imminent retirement from the world of writing.

All the characters are wonderfully drawn, and all are INCREDIBLY interesting. From Jed, the loner who lives on the top floor of the house and keeps his hawk in the garden. To Jarvis, the owner of the house who is obsessed by underground systems and is writing a book chronicling them. To Alice, the young mother who has run away from her humdrum life, leaving her daughter and husband behind. And then there is Tom, the busker who once aimed to study at a musical college, but is now content to play for the armies of people who walk through London's cavernous Tube. Then there is young Jasper, who, along with his friends, finds his thrills amid the bustle of the dangerous underground. And then, Axle. The enigmatic, strange man whom little is known about, and whose secret will cast shadows over all their lives.The story is told brilliantly, as i say. All the charaters living in the old schoolhouses each have a different part in the story, and rarely do their own seperate stories interact, until the end. It is like watching several little planets revolving around the sun (in this story the sun is the london underground system). Their orbits do not cross, but still they revolve around the main body of the story, until they are finally drawn together.Rendell skips between each persons's story (each persons story varies greatly) wonderfully, while the reader hardly notices the transition.The climax is not completely unexpected, but i often find that that is the beauty of Vine/Rendell. You can sometimes see or tell what is going to happen, and you know that absolutely nothing any of the characters can do to prevent the inevitable awfullness.At first i thought the ending was shocking, and powerful but anticlimatic. Then i realised it is shocking and powerful BECAUSE it is anticlimatic. (Rather like when we meet Hannibal Lecter...we are shocked by him because we were expecting a monster.)"},{"Title":"King Solomon's Carpet (Onyx)","review":"King Solomon's Carpet is a rich tapestry of unforgettable characters and events that haunt you long after the book is put down. For a long time I put off reading it because I didn't know what King Solomon's Carpet referred to, which turned out to be the London Underground. If you like this book you'll probably also enjoy A Dark Adapted Eye and The Brimstone Wedding."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Carpet (Onyx)","review":"Having read all Ruth Rendell's books as either herself (I'm actually half way through &quot;A sight for Sore Eyes&quot; at present) or Barbara Vine, I think this is my personal favourite, but I sympathise with those who didn't like it. Perhaps a knowledge of the London Underground system is necessary to get really into it. I do have the advantage of living in England and knowing many of the places she discusses. Barbara Vine books are not really crime novels, so the fact that no crime really happens till nearly the end shoudl not surprise. I would recommend A Dark Adapted Eye to the person who found King Solomon's Carpet hard work."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Carpet (Onyx)","review":"I must sympathize with the previous reader's comments, but having read Rendell/Vine's most recent novels I can't be as harsh. King Solomon's Carpet is barely worthy of the mystery genre (a crime does occur - 75 pages before the end of the book!) and is more of a character study of a motley group of subway musicians and their relatives. I persevered though and made it to the end. No surprises though. The terrorist element is fairly obvious to guess. Not one of her best and not one I would recommend. No Night is Too Long and Anna's Book are far more engrossing and suspenseful. I'm anxious to start The Chimney's Sweeper's Boy - her latest."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Carpet (Onyx)","review":"I was glad to find this wonderful unabridged edition here at Amazon. Our local bookstore (a big chain) carries a 3 hour Penguin version that is a shadow of what this very special, just right, made in England tape set is. Maybe if you're short on time the Penguin edition would be okay, but since it cuts out about half the story you really ought to get this one if you can."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Carpet (Onyx)","review":"If anyone said they were going to write a novel about the British Underground railway or tube, evryone would think - who would want to read it? Well, Ruth Rendall (or Barbara Vine in this case) has done just that with this book, and she's done her usual awesome job! This book is totally weird and wonderful, in true Barbara Vine fashion. The tension builds throughout the book, until about halfway through, I was waiting for something dreadful to happen. And indeed it did. As a word of warning - if this is your first Barbara Vine book, you must read through until the end because stuff keeps happening right until then. The thing I really like about Barbara Vine books are her characters. They are all so weird and wonderful, and catastrophic stuff seems to happen to each of them when they finally meet up with each other."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Carpet (Onyx)","review":"Although I felt driven by the plot to read through to the end, I was disappointed with the overall mood and characters. Each character was well developed but none were likable except the villain, who I found myself rooting for."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Carpet (Onyx)","review":"Very interesting and thoughful account of the inner lives of Londons wastrels, wanna be artisits, hangers-on to society and people in general just trying to survive. Rendell's (even writing as Vine) always fascinating insights into the minds, moods and actions of her characters do not fail here. She REALLY knows people, the bohemian flakes, like Jaspers mother, the emotionally damaged and obsessed, and the way children like Jasper know more than the average adult about what is going on around him. The psychological novel is at its height with Vine."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Carpet (Onyx)","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. The cast of characters, as always in a Rendell/Vine book , are explored with compassion and understanding, no matter how tradionally dysfuncional, obsessed or bohemian they are. Rendell/Vine has the ability to explore her characters lives from the inside out, and she not only writes about the dispossed in society, the lost, the angry, the sad, the flighty, and the ones just struggling to maintain the status quo, she understands them, better perhaps than a psychiatrist would, and with more compassion. The story itself is interesting for its characters, a wide assortment of players in this novel, their actions, and the way they interconncet with each other. A taste of foreboding is in the first chapter with a young girls death by her exposure to mass-technology and the helter skelter world we live in. Everyone in this book is struggling to survive, and those who are not struggling, are confronted with those who are. The children in the book are wiser than their elders, and more observent, and have learned to stay totally way from adult society, as much as possible. Very suspensful, interesting story."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Carpet (Onyx)","review":"Ruth Rendell, writing as Barbara Vine, crafts a suspenseful tale that somehow manages tocombine a fairly extensive history of the London Underground (subway), buskers andinterpersonal psychology.

With the exceptions, perhaps, of &quot;Gallowglass&quot; and &quot;The Brimstone Wedding&quot; she has been unable to maintain the elegant mix of structure, character, and mood she created in &quot;A Dark Adapted Eye&quot;, &quot;A Fatal Inversion&quot;, and &quot;The House of Stairs&quot;. The characters here are one-dimensional and the plot &quot;twists&quot; are so obvious and well anticipated that they leave you saying to yourself &quot;I knew that!&quot; and &quot;It's about time!&quot; If you are a diehard Rendell/Vine fanatic you will probably like this book; however, if you want something more than a run-of-the-mill suspense novel (which is what you expect from Barbara Vine), indeed if you want some suspense, this book is not for you."},{"Title":"King Solomon's Carpet (Onyx)","review":"My first Barbara Vine book, and definitely the last. I persevered through about 2 thirds of the book and never once understood what was going on.

As Angelo moves from one place to another, characters and names pop up that one is never sure whether one is supposed to know from history (such as Allemandi or Thurn) or from somewhere earlier in the book (Bondino, Lecca).While Giono remains a master in bringing to life places, people and moments, the combination just does not hold together this time. If you don't know anything about the events of 1848 in Italy, you certainly won't learn much from this book. One does get the notion that it was a time of big confusion and people did not know on whose side their neighbor or friend was. But the situations and characters in the book are so disconnected that you could read pages at random and it would not make a difference. Angelo is the only thread to hold on to, but even he gets lost in place and time. Also, in this book he does not come off as such a wonderful young man, untouched by the ugliness of the sick world around him, as he did in \\"The Horseman.\\" If I hadn't read that book first, I would probably never finish \\"The Straw Man.\\"Furthermore, there is no mention in \\"The Straw Man\\" of Angelo's acquaintance with Pauline from \\"The Horseman.\\" In the last (and very small) book in the series about Angelo, \\"La Morte d'Une Personage\\" (which is the death of Pauline) we learn that Angelo and Pauline had a son and a grandson, all named Angelo. \\"The Horseman\\" ends with Angelo delivering Pauline to her husband, their own relationship having remained totally platonic. So their love relationship developed outside any of the books. If there is a purpose to that, and I don't see it, I would have loved to have read at least a little bit about Angelo's thoughts about Pauline while they were apart.In any case, unless you are a great Giono fan and are interested in vignettes from Italian cities and countryside during the 1848 revolution, this book could be a hard read."},{"Title":"Biography - Motoyama, Hiroshi (1925-): An article from: Contemporary Authors","review":"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!The \\"biography\\" is 1097 words long consisting of a detailed list of Motoyama's places of education/employment and of his life accomplishments (various institutions founded), followed by a list of his published books.

They're written in classic style, and at first I thought they may be translations from Plato or something.I've only read a third of the book, so I'll restrict my comment to that. Hippocrates asks Socrates if mathematics is worth studying, thus initiating a genuinely Socratic dialogue on the nature of mathematics and its relationship to the real world.Even as a long-time consumer of mathematical thought (and now a mathematics teacher) there was plenty of substance in the dialogue for me: nice analogies and a sense of conviction of the importance of mathematics.I picked this book up at a university book sale for $6. At the time, it seemed expensive compared to the other offerings, especially as it's only 100 pages. I now offer this brief review to encourage anyone who reads it that this book is well worth obtaining if you have the chance."},{"Title":"The Garden Lover's Guide to Italy (Garden Lover's Guides)","review":"This is the most comprehensive guide I have found to Italian gardens open for visitng. Written by Penelope Hobhouse, one of England's foremost garden designers, it offers a real garden-lovers insight into what makes Italian gardens truly unique in style. The book is laid out in sections according to regions of Italy with good regional maps attached for route planning. Each garden has its own summary including an history of its design and later modifications, with elegant pictures, symbols denoting especial features, hours of opening, and other nearby sights worth visiting. &quot;Gardens of Italy&quot; is a slim volume perfect for not only plannning a comprehensive garden-accented trip from home but also small enough to carry whilst travelling. It is best used as an aide for advance planning rather than ad-hoc garden visits as many gardens are privately owned and visits are by appointment / advance arrangement only, a fact which Hobhouse notes in herforeword, but which after all is hardly her fault!"},{"Title":"The Garden Lover's Guide to Italy (Garden Lover's Guides)","review":"I visited Tuscany & the Marches & Florence this past September (2005) and bought this book to guide me through planning a garden tour itinerary. Initially I thought the book's organization structure of grouping gardens in chapters devoted to a particular region would be perfect. It turned out to be very hard to use and frustrating. In the chapters, the gardens are sometimes listed by their name and sometimes by their town so there is no logical order. Plus on the maps the gardens are numbered haphazardly - the five gardens around Padua should be numbered sequentially but instead they are 2,3,4 and 8&9. The info for each garden though is detailed and lists the hours, fees, who to contact for appointment only gardens and nearby sights. It also covers the history of the garden. If you are going to tour gardens in Tuscany and Florence I would highly recommend a book I found in Florence at the Boboli Gardens. It is \\"Gardens of Florence and Tuscany - A Complete Guide\\" by Mariachiara Pozzana and is published through Giunti. The ISBN is 8809020642.

Even so, it does not focus on the U.S. and the Soviet Union, nor great power politics as such. Instead, Vadney broadens the focus and gives due consideration to the Third World which, as he notes, accounts for the vast majority of the world's population (since India and China can be placed in this category). The general emphasis is on major political events and trends, with only some attention given to economic and social factors. Nonetheless, this is still a highly useful book, as Vadney provides essential background and details on a number of events and regions not normally covered in standard \\"world history\\" or \\"Western civ\\" texts. The book's organization and uncluttered writing style also make it an outstanding reference work for this period."},{"Title":"The World Since 1945","review":"I'll keep this short. The book is a terrific overview of what has been happening in our little world since 1945. There is so much here that you will never learn through our media and through other historical text books.

The book is comprehensive in its coverage of not only key (or apparently key) events in world history, but also for the particular focus Vadney brings to the experiences of the third world.Vadneys writes from a tradition that can be broadly described as left of centre. It is certainly not dogmatic, for example the standards he holds the United States to are the same as those that he brings to his coverage of the Soviet Union, but it is one that gives the book an internationalist flavour and a tangible concern for those who live in the third world or under oppressive situations of whatever kind. Another strength of the book is that Vadney doesn't let himself become chained to the standard cold war narrative, and the fruits of his freedom from this are excellent accounts of post-war Latin American, Asian (especially Indo China) and African history that deal with external factors in a rational and reasoned manner. This is particularly important given that at the time these countries were struggling for economic and political independence, which Vadney rightly regards as the key theme of the period. He is also excellent at summarising the pre-1945 histories in a way that gives the reader an insight into the historical context within which the developments and events he describes occurred, and also pays serious attention to events internal to nations, as well as those between nations. The generally good coverage of third world countries in the book doesn't preclude Vadney from coherently accounting for events in Europe, North America and within Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.Unfortunately the book is by no means perfect, there are a few noticeable bloopers (e.g. he states that the Shiites are a minority in Iraq), and in the vast array of events and developments he writes on it is easy to make a case for problems of selection, emphasis, and (less frequently) accuracy. This is most systematic in his coverage of the confrontation in the Middle East between Israel and the Arabs. Vadney, and it was not uncommon amongst apparent lefties at that time and since, follows a line that is sympathetic to the official Israeli discourse to a degree that ought to be a major embarrassment to anyone serious about narrating and explaining historical reality,In general I find that books of this nature that synthesis a large amount of material in a relatively short space can form an excellent introduction to a subject. In this case the subject is the post-WW2 world, and Vadney not only stimulates a curiosity to discover more about particular developments from third world de-colonisation and economic development, to nuclear weapons and neo-colonialism, but also provides a basic framework for understanding them on a global basis. With the exception of the material that pertains to the Middle East, \\"The World Since 1945\\" provides an excellent and intelligent summary of world history for the period that is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The World Since 1945","review":"This is an older edition and that was not made very clear in the description"},{"Title":"The World Since 1945","review":"Some time ago, I bought a second edition copy of this book and read it.

People with little knowledge of Javascript should get a Javascript tutorial (I recommend SAM's teach yourself...) first.Mr. Cranford-Teague has taken the trouble to explain both the documented use and the real-world implementation of CSS. He has taken away much of the testing that is often required when designing against the CSS2 specification. (He makes mistakes so you don't have to!) His quick reference appendix of what-style-elements-work-where should be the most heavily thumbed pages of any book in your HTML design library.The book is a quick, delightful read with clear, textbook-class examples of every aspect of every CSS specification out there, along with a perfect cross-browser Javascript model that should be the industry standard.The book is small, and cheap enough to keep up with the latest browser platforms.

This one works for me on several counts -such as extent of information, usability and clarity of content.I like the book - it was pitched at the level I needed; - competent coding HTML and basic JS - but shaky with CSS.It starts with detailed look at CSS - controlling and modifying html tags at tag, page and site level.I found this section a model of clarity - very well explained and laid out.Addresses numerous areas where the CSS can add power and flexibility to the formatting of a web site. Clearly explains the \\"cascading\\" nature of style sheets, and the class, id, tag modification, and contextual selectors - all of which were somewhat mysterious to me beforehand, in spite of already using and creating some of them via editors. Would be especially good for someone just starting to look at these.Consistent lay out in the book helps you scan for the relevant attributes for the CSS keywords -I will use the book as a reference as well.It then proceeds to introduce the interplay between JavaScript and CSS in DHTML.This is done carefully with detailed examination of cross browser issues. It explains the differences in document object model used by different browsers, including NS6. It provides and explains generic code to help alleviate cross browser incompatibility and to identify and use the relevant DOM, including \\"feature sensing\\" and \\"browser sensing\\".This is clear enough that it can be followed in detail, or just implemented by downloading the templates and examples on the companion web site.The examples proceed from rollovers, layer manipulation, to navigation systems - drop down links, expanding breadcrumbs and other nav systems. I was familiar with similar scripts for all these but had never seen them explained so thoroughly in the context of CSS and cross browser Javascript.There is more in here I haven't digested yet about dynamically adding CSS rulesAlso succinctly surveys some other aspects of the web (Flash, SVG, XML, XHTML) and summarises some s/w (eg Dreamweaver) and graphic manipulation issues.It has some self confessed \\"gimmicks\\" as well - swirling text, moving pictures, \\"fridge magnets\\" etc.Good index of further resources at the end.Companion web site contains lots of examples, all the code, and prebuilt (but customisable) nav systems etc -scripts are clear enough to easily modify.I like the fact that cross browser issues are consistently and thoroughly addressed.There is a lot of well presented technical info in here on CSS, good DHTML code and examples, sound cross browser stuff, some good design advice, bug info, lots of hints and cautions, and interesting reading - so yeah, I liked it."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"This book is targeted toward the beginning to intermediate level Web designer who is looking for a great reference to better DHTML and CSS programming.

Thank you, Jason!"},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"This book is very good at carefully explaining how to code cross-browser and cross-platform DHTML. It's not only a good book to read and try to understand and absorb, but also a really good reference to help you get started right away with some very cool DHTML tricks."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"There wasn't enough on Javascript to really justify the DHTML in the title. Though the book is a reasonable introduction to HTML and CSS. On the positive side I thought the organization was good, the text was easy to read, the use of red to hilight important code fragments, and the reference section were all very good. On the downside I thought the Quick Start format made the book a little hard to read. And the Alice in Wonderland examples weren't always the most appropriate way to illustrate each point. I would have rather had examples that were closer to what we would see in the real world."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"Having read a Visual Quick Start Guide previously, I expected an easy, basic and short introduction to both DHTML and CSS. What I received was much better. Yes, the topics were explained in an easy to understand and logical sequence, but there is some good intermediate information here as well. Cascading Style Sheets is the subject of the first sections of the book. I found this information to be invaluable. There is no reason that every web page is not constructed using CSS, due to its flexibility and time reducing factors for setting styles. The majority of the chapters are on DHTML. DHTML allows you to add dynamic content to your web site such as, Drop-down Menus, Pop-up text, and Sliding Frames. The author steps you through the code for designing these and several more projects. I found that much of what was mentioned in the text led to many of my own ideas based on the foundation I learned with the book. For this price I recommend that all beginning and intermediate Web Designers buy this book today. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"I don't know how all the mistakes in this book got past the editors. It is more than just careless typos. There are numerous inconsitancies between the CSS examples given and the web page results. Only as far as the second chapter, I've lost count of the inconsistancies--enough to make me give up on the book. I've checked out the companion web site, and the corrections are not to be found. The poor quality of the book also shakes my faith in Peachpit Press's Visual Quickstart series, which up until now I have enjoyed using."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"This is a great reference book, it gets into how to actually do things you're going to want to do. Each CSS facility is described, an example is provided, and has a quick-reading chart showing which browsers it is, or not, compatible with.Then the author goes on with a wonderful introduction to DHTML, again in his understandable, informative way.An excellent book with great information you will keep as reference!"},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"Jason Teague does a nice job of introducing CSS and its use with Java to create DHTML pages. Teague is stronger on design than programming, however, and that's where the book falls short.JavaScript is the engine that makes DHTML work, but there is very little coverage of JavaScript basics in this book. Teague apparently assumes the reader knows basic JavaScript. So, he focuses his efforts on explaining the Document Object Model (DOM) that allows JavaScript to interact with web pages, and how to use the DOM to accomplish various tasks.One shortcoming of the book is that it devotes inordinate attention to legacy web browser issues. At one time, there were three different DOMs (Microsoft, Netscape, and W3C, a standards organization). The current generation of browswers have fallen in line behind the W3C, and its DOM has emerged as the dominant model for DHTML pages. Teague spends many pages explaining how to address these legagy DOMs, which makes the discussion longer and more complicated than it really needs to be.Be aware that Teague misuses the term 'DOM'. He talks of 'creating a DOM' every time one gets a reference to an object on an HTML page. The DOM is actually created by the browser when it loads the page. We access the DOM to get an object reference. I personally found Teague's use of the term very confusing, and that steepened the DHTML learning curve for me.Teague's JavaScript code is very difficult to decipher, which is surprising in a book that is apparently targeted to web designers. One would expect simple, clear code that non-programmers could follow. Instead, the code violates a number of good programming practices--variable names are generally not descptive, and program logic is often knotted up in a tangle of nested 'if' statements. The drop-down menu code in Chapter 24 provides a good example of these problems.But the biggest problem stems from a simple lack of formatting of the code. Teague prefers the older style of packing as many statements as possible on a single line--the code reads like a 'C' program from twenty years ago. In order to decipher the code, one must first unpack the lines to spread out the code, then apply proper indentation to figure out which 'else' statements are nested within which 'if' statements. That's a tedious, time-consuming, and very avoidable exercise.I'd recommend this book for its exposition of CSS, and I'd give it a 'pretty good' rating for its handling of the DOM. But if you are diving into DHTML, use this book to get your feet wet. Then find a good JavaScript book to learn the ins and outs of manipulating the DOM and adding client-side interaction to your web pages."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"This is definitively the best presentation I've seen for beginners and intermediate users. Besides a great reference, it goes beyond the usual &quot;what it is&quot; and gets into how to actually do things you're going to want to do. Each CSS facility is described, an example is provided, and has a quick-reading chart showing which browsers it is (or is not) compatible with.Excellent.But that's only half the book - the author then goes on with a great introduction to Dynamic HTML, again in his clear, concise style.By the end of the book, you should easily be up on the next plateau with your CSS and DHTML skills.I didn't mind the low price, either."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"I was pleasantly surprised that this book could be so useful. I bought it because a former course mate recommended it. I didn't use this book for weeks after I got it. When I eventually did, I found it very helpful. The complete examples given by the author were just what I was looking for.In my opinion, this book has saved me far more than what it cost.For those who want in-depth coverage of DHTML, I suggest a bigger book. For those of us with little time however, we'll have to make do with this book. I wanted a whirlwind coverage of the essentials of DHTML, and this book delivered--at a ridiculously small price."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"This book has to be the best Dhtml/CSS book on the market. I have gone from knowing nothing about CSS to learning how to create effective pages using this wonderful new tool. FrontPage users: don't be afraid of investing some time with this book &amp; learning CSS- with the new CSS/Dhtml features in 2002, you will enjoy knowing how to create better code and sites. The author has provided wonderful examples - not just snippets - but full code samples with explanations clear enough for even this novice to understand."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"Another brilliant addition to the Visual Quickstart Guide series! You simply cannot be a web developer and NOT be in possession of this and at least a half-dozen other titles from this series!Since I own over 20 Visual Quickstart Guide titles, I feel qualified to rank DHTML &amp; CSS for the WWW by Jason Cranford Teague among the top 5 best-of-series, right up there with Elizabeth Castro's HTML 3.2 &amp; 4.0, Castro's PERL &amp; CGI for the WWW, Debra and Eric Ray's UNIX, and lastly, I'll cheat by treating PHOTOSHOP 4, 5, 5.5 and 6 as one book because of the consistent and informative efforts by authors, Elaine Weinmann and Peter Lourekas. (I hear the DREAMWEAVER 4.0 by J. Tarin Powers is pretty awesome as well!) In my experience, all, but for a couple of marginal misfires, are excellent.Be forewarned, however, the Visual Quickstart books are not project or tutorial driven. These are the books to use AFTER you've cut your teeth on the application tutorial-- when you're out there in the REAL webdev world, building stuff, even if it's your first time. These books are worth 100 times their weight in gold! Think of a cookbook where brevity is key and success is guaranteed if you follow each step as directed.Anyway, enough free advertising for Peachpit Press and back to DHTML &amp; CSS by Jason Teague! The writing is clear and concise. All of the style and script examples are useful immediately and relevant in the real world of webdev. Each step of every script or style is prefaced by referenced snippets of code so you know exactly where you are in any particular script, which can sometimes be pages long.Teague is also a master at anticipating problems you might encounter when deploying some of his examples. So, he includes on-the-spot browser-compatibility info, helpful hints and browser-specific workarounds, just in case woeful rendering in a misbehaving browser gives you fits! (and because he probably doesn't want to invite litigation for property damage when you throw a brick at your computer out of frustration when you can't get a script to execute properly in say, Netscape V4.715367894508061182745? Or a stylesheet doesn't render as you intended in Opera V2.0 or Explorer V3.0-if at all!!!)Another credit to the author is that he never leaves out steps relying on the happenstance that his readers maintain a preconceived level of knowledge about what might be considered obvious (which is all relative anyway, depending upon whether the reader is left or right-brain hard-wired!). He shows respect for his readers by leaving nothing to chance, while appealing to all levels of audience technical capability.In short, it doesn't matter whether you are a newbie or a seasoned coder. You WILL find a treasure trove of useful information and a bountiful number of useful scripts and style examples for just about anything interactive you could ever hope to add to your web site. GUARANTEED!And, now? TA-DAH!!! I saved the best for last! The prized characteristic of this book? When you need to zero in on a particular task, style or script, the index is magnificent! The subject, phrase or task you are looking for in the index corresponds directly to a page containing the information you need. So when you go to the page noted in the index, THE INFORMATION IS REALLY THERE--FIRST TIME AROUND!!! No guessing games or a dozen hit-and-miss trips back to the index to unlock some kind of elusive clue or national security clearance code known only to the author, that reveals the secret location of the information you seek, the exposure of which carries the obligatory condition of having to kill you! The index, on its own merit, is quite the workhorse that more than justifies the modest cost of the book in time saved, BEFORE you ever key in the first character of code!No, I'm not a representative for Peachpit Press, nor do I play one on TV!!! I'm just a hardworking web developer trying to keep up with ever-changing technology in the blazing speed of internet time. Anyone who contributes to the shortening of my learning curve is my best friend for life! Thanks, Jason. Your book rocks!!"},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"As a Web Design firm, it is mandatory that we stay on the cutting edge of site development. We required our entire staff to study the first book in this series and we've already started passing out this second edition. Nothing provides better control over site appearance than DHTML/CSS and we have not found a better manual than this for our designers.Note, this is for people who are serious about web design and not FrontPage amateur hour users. This manual gives our information architects the cross browser/platform reference material they need to not waste development time. If you don't know this book's content, you're not a web author."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"I am about half way through the book and like it so far. I wasn't quite sure what to expect though I have purchased Visual QuickStart books before and have been happy with them. All in all I feel like it was a good purchase that I can use."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"I have a background in HTML but I know nothing of Javascripting or DHTML. In CSS, I really enjoyed the author's insights into the W3C standards, Microsoft, Netscape, and it was well rounded. There were good tips in the extra blocks and the CSS examples were understandable, and easy to follow. The syntax was somewhat off, which should never be acceptable for a programming book, but it wasn't very difficult to get past in CSS because the syntax rules are stable for the most part. Also, the author boasts of how much money they've saved us by not including a CD and instead including a support website, and a contact address by which he can answer our questions. I submitted a question 2 weeks ago and I have yet to receive a response.Once I got past the CSS section of this book, the author's definitions and explanations became cryptic and the tips consist of heavy criticism of Netscape and Microsoft. The website is a good start to supporting a book with syntax errors that doesn't indicate when it is referring to literals or when there is a space in something, or not. Personally, I would have preferred the CD.This book is very good for CSS. However, it is not worth the price if more than half the book is not easily understandable to the person reading it with no previous experience in the language and its a waste of valuable time trying to understand it."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"Although the work seems thorough at first, the author appears to make it a point to ignore Internet Explorer's extensive editing features, vaguely covers IE 5.5 and doesn't cover IE 6.0 at all.No mention of Opera, early or current version. Nothing, except a quick word in an appendix about how Opera browsers stick to most of W3C edicts.Even more disappointing because I was looking for a something like a newer version of Danny Goodman's 'DHTML Definitive Reference' published by O'Reilly. He is currently working on a 2nd edition which would encompass the drastic web development since first edition in mid-98, but I needed something as complete as possible in the meantime.\`DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web' seems to aspire to be both a tutorial and a reference book, but fails in both, in my view. It probably is too confusing a tutorial for the beginner, much too superficial for intermediate to advanced web programmers, and the organization and indexing make it really irksome as a reference book.Furthermore, the coverage of JavaScript is a joke.If you can, save your dollars and wait for Danny Goodman's second edition; in such a fast pace moving domain as IT technologies, knowing that your book will be outdated within the year, the least you can expect is a complete and unbiased coverage of the current technologies. I regret this purchase, and would have returned the book, had I not left my mark and spilled coffee on it. Regardless, Goodman's first edition and online documentation will do it for now."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"How much you like this book depends on what you want out of it. When I buy a book that touts &quot;teach yourself DHTML and CSS the quick and easy way&quot; on the cover, I expect something that's readable and has a series of lessons. What I got was more like a reference manual than a book. If that's what you're looking for, this certainly has a lot of details on how CSS works. But if you want an engaging series of lessons that are easy to read, compelling, and keep your attention -- that's what I wanted -- this fell short for me. Too many lists of commands surrounded by lifeless prose; too few sections that were actually interesting to read."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"Well done as usual. Peachpit's Visual Quickstart series always seems to deliver exactly what I need."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"Unimpressed with this book I was looking for much more of a CSS/DHTML reference.

In fact I found it so off-putting that I took it back!The Peachpit idea of liberally peppering the text with screen shots and code samples is excellent, IMO, and in their Javascript book I found that it worked really well. But not here.One major problem is the eccentric sequencing of the topics. Why, for example, do the CSS \\"pseudo-classes\\" only appear in Chapter 24, well into the second half of the book - which is supposedly all about DHTML?Why isn't it included way back in Chapter 4, for instance, which discusses CSS text controls?A second key issue was the emaciated index.How many web designers would know, if not already familiar with CSS, what a \\"pseudo-class\\" is? Not many, I'd guess. Yet the index makes no mention of \\"hover\\", \\"active\\" or \\"visited\\". The \\"link\\" pseudo-class, on the other hand, IS referenced in it's own right - 16 times!Bottom line: You get what you pay for....."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"...It's not that there isn't any good information, it's just that it's all so shallow and disjointed that it really doesn't serve as much of a reference. The sections are VERY brief, give you hardly any idea of what's good, bad and ugly about various elements, and the \\"code\\" available on-line is nothing more than poorly (read that as \\"NOT\\") documented snippets. It seems like the author had a check list of properties and styles to show off, so he raced through, hacking at HTML until he could say, \\"yeah, there's an example of that.\\"This book is a great example of great intent gone very, very wrong. It's just too rough around the edges to serve as a decent reference, and unless you just like reading a book cover-to-cover for the thrill of turning pages and not actually getting any knowledge whatsoever, you'll probably want to pass on this one.The saddest thing is that I haven't found a decent CSS reference out there (not that I've searched that thoroughly) that really walks through topics like cross-browser issues, best-practices and design considerations in a readable format. Just goes to show that even a mediocre book w/ a really good index can still be usable. Unfortunately \\"DHTML and CSS\\" can't even claim that honor.I just can't believe I bought this book."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"The editing and proofreading processes in publishing this book seem to have been bypassed altogether.

They stand apart and a reader could just focus on one or the other if they needed to.CSS is a huge part of the future of web design, it is a fairly easy subject, but that doesn't mean a bad technical writer couldn't mess it up. Teague doesn't, grabbing the reader and leading them through. I could argue with the placement of certain information, I often asked a question only to find the answer a few chapters later. That said once finished I had all the answers and am at the stage where I can (almost) confine tables to history in terms of web design. In fact the only suggestion I would have for the next addition is to cover the WASP initative proposal of using CSS to hide style from older browsers (cough Netscape 4 cough) as an option the reader should at least be aware of.The DHTML book is bigger and Teague does a good job of focusing on all the major parts, does a bang up job of explaining the various DOMs and what they do and provides a bunch of great code to work from. There are a couple of areas that seem too general to be useful - how to make an animated gif in fireworks/photoshop etc - but I would rather a section I can skip over than missing information.Great book, great value."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"I'm a tyro in the subject matter of this book. I purchased it to grab snippets from it for immediate use in re-vamping my web site. It seemed ideal for this sort of thing. Unfortunately, the very first item that I tried to use; controlling white space, would do nothing at all in my browser. After beating my brains on the examples for a while, I sent an e-mail to the author. To his credit he answered promptly, asking which browser I was using...(IE 6.0). He then came up with what I considered a ridiculous answer...IE 6.0 must have a problem, as it worked in earlier browsers. I then researched his usage of &quot;PRE&quot; and discovered that it was &quot;deprecated&quot;, especially in CSS, and that it &quot;might not work in all browsers&quot;. I have not examined other sections of the book closely, as I have lost a little faith in the capability of the author.The book has helped me, but I'd rather have one in which I can trust. I don't want to run into any more problems which cause me a lot of research to help me decide whose problem I'm dealing with."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"Good book, but nothing you can't find on the net. Really, that sums it all up. The author goes into a lot of detail about things which a lot of people already know if they're diving into DHTML and CSS. Go to some tutorial webpages and you'll be able to find the exact same information - and more."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"All the Peachpit Press Visual QuickStart books are organized well and progress in an appropriate logical manner. The index for this book helps to quickly find the information you need. I build website's regularly and this book extended my knowledge. A good buy."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"Not a comprehensive book, but really easy to read. The information is organized and presented clearly from both the architectural and visual standpoints. Good reference, and good learning tool. It could be improved by adding some summary table \\"cheatsheets\\" on browser rendering differences, bugs, etc., and a few more examples, but I recommend it for begining and intermediate designers."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"Teague is thorough in his coverage of CSS, but there's nothing here that Castro's HTML book doesn't cover better, and the CSS appendix doesn't reference the relevant pages so it's harder to use. Teague appears to favor a hard-coded positioning approach over a more semantic style to achieve the same layout, so it's already behind the prevailing trend in design.The DHTML section is short on foundations and uses object-oriented code without explaining how or why that aspect works. It embodies the worst of the Visual Quickstart Guide format: cursory descriptions (at best) for the first appearance of a bit of code, then it glosses over every subsequent use with not even a reminder. Thus it's not a good choice for someone new to Javascript or programming, and those who are familiar with Javascript and web design would probably choose another method over the bloated, API-style programming in this book.If you're mostly interested in using Javascript's styles object in concert with CSS, this is a poor choice. Peachpit's Javascript book is easier to use and more in tune with web standards."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"Second Edition (June 2001) of this book is very good, and is - at the time of writing - the only DHTML book I've seen which teaches you W3C standard DOM based Dynamic HTML. This is a very important point in my opinion, and it really makes it the one and only book to choose until other books gets updated or new titles emerges. W3C standard based DHTML are supported by browsers like Internet Explorer 5+, Netscape 6+, Opera 4+, Konqueror 2.1+, Mozilla and other Mozilla/Gecko-based browsers, and is _the_ standard &quot;all&quot; browser will support in the future. But the IE4 and NS4.x browsers are not forgotten, the book teaches you how to make your code compatible with these browsers too, even though they don't support the W3C standard DOM.The book has support and bug-information about various Netscape and Microsoft browser versions, but do not go into deeper details with the alternative browsers like Opera and Konqueror. Actually Opera is the only &quot;alternative&quot; browser which is briefly mentioned in the book. However the coding style used in the book always favours &quot;feature sensing&quot; over &quot;browser sensing&quot; when ever possible, so most code should work with the lesser known W3C DOM compliant browsers too.The book is split into two parts, a CSS-part and a DHTML-part. It seems like a wise idea to teach CSS before starting DHTML, since most people starting on DHTML problably haven't used CSS that much yet.It is a book for beginners in CSS and DHTML, not an advanced book. The style is typical of the &quot;Visual Quickstart Guide&quot;. This means the book is designed to be a combined reference and a teaching-book. In my opinion the book can be a little boring reading from start to the end, because it has a tendensy to repeat things. For example when you have learned the basic CSS syntax for defining styles you don't really have to get it spelled out how the syntax is for every style-property in the rest of the book. Just mentioning the name of the property and the possible values should be enough, and you can always check the code-examples if in dought. This is problably a matter of taste, but it is the reason I can &quot;only&quot; give this generally very good book 4 stars."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"I only read the CSS part of the book, which takes up the first nine chapters.The contents are logically presented in a concise manner. The format of the content is rather boring, and the presentation of the code samples and screen shots is not great. I found myself struggling to make headway. Compare this to the stunning presentation of Castro: \\"HTML for the WWW\\" (which also covers CSS), and Meyer: \\"On CSS\\".Other comments:1. The running example, (\\"Alice in Wonderland\\"), throughout the book is hardly a real-world project.2. Book binding - pages are individually glued to the binding and fall out too easily with frequent use - this alone would be reason not to buy the book.3. Difficult to gel the points just covered, since there are no exercises at end of each chapter.4. No section heading numbers within chapters; so it is difficult to get feel for book structure, also difficult to navigate the book's on-line companion site to find the code samples corresponding to each sub-section.5. The book uses forward referencing - in the code samples, tags/keywords are introduced which are only explained later in the book.6. The book's on-line samples differ to the code in the book."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"I recently purchased this book and a few of the examples were not working. I spent hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong and then I decided to download the codes from the website. I then realized it wasn't my mistake at all, there were typos everywhere. on page 62, the print example, is one of those I could not get to work. When I compared the book example to the online code example I noticed they were very different. For a nooby like me, this was very frustrating because I spent hours on this one small example. And from reading the other reviews, it seems like it gets worse when he talks about DHTML."},{"Title":"DHTML and CSS for the World Wide Web, Second Edition","review":"I am experienced with HTML but not with CSS. I picked up some CSS from web sites, but I wanted a reference.I looked through this book and Eric Meyer's in the bookstore, and surprisingly I chose this one. It seemed to be more accessible, with a lot of examples that are very clearly displayed.I have been quite successful at adapting the examples. The author has included some helpful little features, such as a list of font families and which operating systems/browsers support them.So far, I've found one example that displays differently on my configuration than it does in the book. My guess is that I may find other &quot;mistakes&quot; as I go along.Frankly, I was not interested in DHTML when I bought this book, so I cannot review that aspect.Overall, I think that this is the best introduction to CSS that is available right now.

The third edition out in 2004 has a great deal more focus on DHTML navigation and Mozilla-only code.The navigation scripts he provides shows his complete grasp of both CSS and javascript. Unlike the examples in sites like javascriptkit.com and dynamicdrive.com which are written by javascript gurus, JCT's scripts are hybrid models of both advanced CSS and javascript. The code and mark-up combination are so tightly written, it is absolutely necessary that every web developer gets this book. You won't find code like this anywhere else on the web!Also, JCT provides excellent examples of code that shows the new directions taken by the Mozilla development team. He reveals a way of making rounded corners using only a few lines of CSS, and no graphics.My one caveat is that the editors of JCT's 3rd edition did a piss-poor job of copy-checking. On the second chapter, one of the paragraphs in the tips section is duplicated word-for-word. And on page 105, the example is missing a period, thereby making it completely useless unless you spot the mistake. These are only the ones I spotted as I flipped through the book -- I am certain there are many more errors. Buyer beware!"},{"Title":"Art Deco in Australia: Sunrise over the Pacific","review":"Despite its popularity amongst art loving folk for many years a scholarly vacuum has existed in regards to publications on Australian Art Deco. For while we have a wealth of beautiful Deco buildings, design and art from the interwar era that deserved to be celebrated in print until very recently no books at all (hard to think why) had been published on the Australian variant of this well loved style. So you can imagine I had looked forward to the publication of Art Deco in Australia: Sunrise Over the Pacific with considerable relish for some time. But unfortunately on purchasing the book it was something of a letdown (an understatement) to say the least and I was truly disappointed by its overall lack of academic quality, rigour and general superficiality. Let me explain in a little more detail...Normally I can't be bothered to review a product that I dislike, but as an Aussie who is passionate about all things Art Deco I had to make an exception for this shockingly bad book. If you want a good lesson in how not to publish an art book then Sunrise Over the Pacific is it, as it has the look and feel of a book that was quickly cobbled together from old articles culled from magazines such as House & Garden or Women's Weekly and (oh dear) even the layout is more like that of a glossy lifestyle magazine than a serious art book! Sunrise Over the Pacific is an intellectually lightweight and mostly unrewarding read for there is little or no discussion of the wider cultural context of Art Deco in Australia or of the many competing artistic trends of the period such as Interwar Gothic, Spanish Mission and Functionalism. Even \\"the great depression\\" is for the most part glossed over, giving one the impression that life was grand for everybody who lived in Australia during the 1920s and 1930s. Sadly the interwar era cannot be considered an elegant Art Deco playground, at least not for the average person who struggled to make ends meet and feed their families. If you really want to see how a book like this should have been written I suggest that you read Alastair Duncan's seminal classic American Art Deco, or even the wonderful A Spirit of Progress: Art Deco Architecture in Australia. What a great shame it is indeed that Craftsman House and its editors didn't spend a little more time on crafting a better book that might have become a classic title in its field of research, and perhaps, shown a more sophisticated side to Australia than many people overseas are aware of. So if you do decide to buy Art Deco In Australia: Sunrise Over the Pacific all I can say is that while it might be nice for the pretty pictures please don't expect to be enlightened about Australian Art Deco, because you won't be."},{"Title":"Wavelets and Multiwavelets (Studies in Advanced Mathematics)","review":"While there has been a number of recent wavelet books on the market covering a variety of aspects of this important subject of applied math; of those books only a few are good for use in a beginning course; the kind of course aimed at advanced undergraduates, and at students in related fields of math such as numerical analysis; and students from other departments, especially students from engineering departments: EE, medical imaging, and Computer and Electrical Engineering; to mention just a few.The present book seems especially pedagogical well designed for student needs; and the author clearly had students in mind. Rather than delving into a variety of technical issues, the book goes directly to the underlying geometric ideas that students can understand at an intuitive level; without too much background. The algorithmic steps in the subject well presented, and they are essential both for the theory, and for the applications to the analysis of number sets (data mining), of pictures, and of many other applications.The book is certainly more limited in scope than for example Daubechies's book that appeared in the SIAM series in 1992, but it is also gentle on students, and is likely to serve as a lovely invitation to the subject.When the students progress in the course, they will then build up a deeper understanding of the fundamental ideas, which in fact are quite simple when isolated from the traditional rather heavy notation and terminology. The fundamental ideas are nicely illustrated with tree diagrams which also serve as the underpinning for wavelet programs.An additional advantage of this little book is that students will be able to get hands-on experience with graphics, and with MATLAB routines, as they work their way through the book.Review by Palle Jorgensen, December 2004."},{"Title":"The Headache Cure","review":"This book is great! It covers \\"cervicogenic headaches,\\" which are headaches that actually stem from neck pain. Who knew! The doctors say that some people have been diagnosed for years with migraines or tension headaches when the problem is really a pain in their neck which goes to the head. (They explain how that can happen.) So, drugs for headaches may work if you have neck headaches (or may not) but either way, you're not addressing the real problem. I followed their suggestions for neck exercises, medications and practical advice (like not holding the cell phone between your neck and shoulder) and feel much better!This book also covers migraines, tension headaches, combination headaches and more. For example, some people get daily headaches. The authors discussed a study in which people cut their consumption of cola (with caffeine) and in some headaches, their headaches disappeared completely.If you get a lot of headaches, you need this book."},{"Title":"The Headache Cure","review":"I have had headaches for years.

Does this sound like you? Then get this book!I was diagnosed with migraine 5 years ago, but the medications were not working.I decided to do research on my own and first read \\"Heal Your Headache\\" by Buchholz, since it was rated the highest on Amazon. I followed the diet, tried the drugs, etc. I tried this for over a year and the headaches became worse and more frequent.I decided that I must have been misdiagnosed, so back to Amazon I went. I discovered this book 3 weeks ago and it has changed my life! I wish I had known about cervicogenic headaches at least 5 years ago. I have never heard of them, but after reading the book, confirming it with my neurologist and chiropractor, I am now on a completely new program to treat my chronic daily headaches. And it's working.I wish the media would devote more attention to this little talked about problem so that others that have been misdiagnosed with migraine can get the relief they need!"},{"Title":"The Headache Cure","review":"This is a very good read, written by 2 neurologists.

The one thing that it didn't mention; however, was the difference between passivelly venomous and activally venomous. You can kind of say that it is MY theroy. I can't give out my name; but, I will explain it to you. Activally venomous animals like scorpions, snakes, cone shells, etc, use their venom to capture and subdo their prey.

Gide provides an interesting reflection on the clash that occurs when optimistic Christian idealism comes head to head with the realities of life. The zealotry of this good samaritan is brought crashing down to earth when his ambitions are expressed to his exasperated wife and his less than enthusiatic family.What proves more interesting however is Gide's development of the relationship between the minister and the young blind girl. The affection that develops in the heart of the minister forges parallels with Vladimir Nabokov's 'Lolita', however Gide develops this bond in a different manner. This closeness is on far more of an emotional and spiritual level and does not have the lascivious or explicitly sexual leanings of Nabokov's novel.Gide's talents in respect of both depth of character and richness of prose, are well exemplified in this very attractive novella. For those interested in reading Gide, 'La Symphonie Pastorale' is a perfect starting point."},{"Title":"La Symphonie Pastorale","review":"La Symphonie Pastorale deals with the semi-acknowledged love affair between a married Protestant priest and Gertrudes, a blind girl he takes into his home and educates. Blinded by love, the priest continually neglects his wife and children, deceiving himself and Gertrudes in the process. Many themes run through this amazing novel: love, family, duty, blindness (literal and metaphorical), sensibility, moral conventions, and so on. All is dealt with with a subtle, highly intelligent touch and in a language that evokes the world at its most beautiful and painful.The priest himself tells the story and as we go with him on his narrative journey, we feel his deep humanity and the yearning for understanding that only Gertrudes can appease. Unfortunately theirs is not a sanctioned love...Read it. ;-)"},{"Title":"La Symphonie Pastorale","review":"This is a beautifully written tale of how a good person can deceive himself (or herself) and do great damage.

It is one of the best French books I have ever read. It is by far the best Gide book.

It is considered to be a lyrical prelude to his major novel \\"the Counterfeiters\\", published seven years later. This story is similar to \\"the Counterfeiters\\" in a way that it explores the falsehood that exists in the relationships between people.The story tells about a rural pastor, who adopts, out of mercy, an orphaned girl, whose condition is further aggravated by the fact that prior to becoming an orphan, she had been living with an elderly and somewhat deaf aunt; therefore, she is not adept in understanding the language that people speak and the connection that exists between words and perceptions. The pastor undertakes the responsibility of educating the blind girl - her name is Gertrude - in accordance with the methods that are used to educate the blind. At the same time, the relationships within the pastor's family grow complex ...This story is a rebellion against rigours of religious postulates. At one time it enjoyed a great popularity in author's native France and in 1946 its screen version was released. However, the likelihood that the story, the way it is described, could take place indeed is somewhat low. Not only the believability of the plot line is questionable, the emotions seem to be overdramatised. \\"The Counterfeiters\\" does not share these drawbacks, though."},{"Title":"La Symphonie Pastorale","review":"This book--the exact same edition--costs less than 5.41 euro in France.

For me, the underlying quality of this collection is its ability to transport the average individual to a world that admittedly could never exist on a widespread basis in the Western world. Mr. Sturges has a sense of what NEEDS to be accomplished in order for this 'special effect' to take place. The result is that one senses innocence instead of guilt, beauty instead of filth, and an ability to stand on Earth and in Heaven at the same time."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"This book is the book to have if you enjoy Jock Sturges's work.If you are not familiar with the photographers work after seeing this book you will be an ardant fan.Black and white photography at its best.The subjects draw you into the photos and enchant you with their beauty and honesty.It is a book you will revisit often and leave you waiting in anticipation for Jock's next book.Well worth the price."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"A family friend got this book for Christmas this year, and from the first time I opened it I was mesmorized.

It is so full of gorgeous shots, you wonder how anyone can take offense at this book. It is understandable why some people in the English-speaking world would look askance at this work, because it is not everyday that a book is published that consists mostly of pictures of nude girls who are in the midst of puberty. Yet, in places like northern California and the French Riviera, these photos are taken for granted (which they should not be; they are so well done.), because beachfront nudity is perceived as normal. I am glad that Jock decided to publish a tome of this size, because his last two works seemed too much like samplers for Aperture. Scalo did a great job in assisting Jock. Hats off to both of them!"},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"It is always a let down to read nasty comments and misinterpretations of Jock's art. It is too bad that some people are so closed minded that they can't possibly understand that many people choose to be nude and it is not some sick or perverted thing that has been forced upon them. Jock's work is and always will be beautiful because the families he photographs are even more beautiful on the inside than they are on the outside... which is far more important than whether someone has clothes on or not. This book as well as Jocks other books are sitting right on my coffee table for all to see. They are and I am sure they always will be excellent. Once again GREAT work Sturges!"},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"Many would say that art needs no message, that it is created simply to enjoy and not to inform. That may well be true most of the time but not for this body of work. We live in a world where, from the earliest age, we are told over and over and over again that we must always be afraid. You can't trust anyone or let down your guard for even a moment because if you do bad things will surly happen. Most of us wear cloths not just for modesty and for protection from the elements, we wear cloths for protection from each other.By casting their fears aside the young people in this book prove their trust in Sturges. But even more remarkable then that, they prove their trust in us. The models in these photos have placed their trust in you and me and anyone else who might view or buy their images. They trust us to respect them as beautiful and natural and not regard them as lewd, indecent or obscene. Unfortunately not all of us pass the test. Some people believe that these images should be illegal. They consider them harmful for both the models and the viewers. I feel that that is more of a slap at the models and their parents then at Sturges.I have only one small complaint and one question about this book. First the complaint. Why are images that have previously appeared in other books repeated here? Sturges is an incredibly prolific photographer creating more than a hundered stunning new images each year. There is more than enough material to publish twenty books without any repeats so why give us reruns?Finally the question. Sturges has shot so many gorgious images of young boys and yet the best of these never appear in his books. In his published works we see a few boys with girls or their parents but seldom alone. A major theme of his work is simply missing. Why is that? Do publishers believe that girls are more marketable or less controversial than nude boys? If they were to publish a book called, \\"The Young Boys of Jock Sturges,\\" what would the reaction be? I'd rather like to know."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"I can be summed up in one word &quot;Awesome&quot;. Jock knows how to bring out the beauty and innocence of the young. Many of the models have multiple photo of them at various stages in there life. His work has brought caused lot of controversy.Some people think his work in nothing more than child pornography. The only thing I can say to them is, go on vacation, take a trip to Europe. Go to Germany, France, Greece, just any were outside the US and see that most people do not have this sick obsession on the naked body. They do not have &quot;nude beaches&quot; They just go to the beach some with cloths some with out. Our country has the largest % of sex crimes in the world. Why, be cause at a early age we tell our children that it is a sin to be with out cloths, we make every aspect of our bodies sexual in nature. Wake up people, being naked has nothing to do with sex."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"I happened upon the book this weekend while browsing the photography section of my local book store.

Flawlessly printed from 8X10 contact silver gelatin prints, this shows the other pictures of the subjects we felt like we knew from the previous two books,often running us through 5 or 10 years of a model's life in as many pages. This work is important, because hiding something away empowers it- in a society where nudity between ages 6 and 18 is considered somehow wrong, it is no wonder we have so many perverts. Take away the thrill of the forbidden, and just enjoy the peaceful, respectful portraits in this 200 page retrospective. Their bodies are not the problem- your mind is."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"I think that with even all of the controversy over the book being child pornography or just art it was a very good book. i think that a lot of people don't understand the difference between child pornography and child art. Also, as is stated the book shows none of the subjects in a sexuall manner. Quite the contrary, it shows each human being as a miracle of art, not as an age plasterred to a face. I think that Jock should continue with his works of art so that people one day will understand what art TRULY is.

I give it a 9 out of 10 with the hope that in the future Mr. Sturges will consider including more boys in his published work. This, however,is not a complaint, merely a suggestion.

These are photographs to admire. Controversy aside, this collection, the photographer, and the beauty it celebrates, deserve to be respected."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"Beyond the initial subject, a photograph also captures the intention with which it is taken. Whether it be an advertisment, a magazine cover, pornography, or your family album. The motive behind the photographer rendering the image is evident within the image.

I look foward to the day when my photographs are as gorgeous as yours. Michael"},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"Jock Sturges photographs are of nudists (including children). If you offended by nudity, ignore his work. If you appreciate sensitive high quality photographs and can approach them with the recognition that it is &quot;normal&quot; for his subjects to be unclothed, you might want to look at his photographs. Most are seemingly casual portraits of individuals who happen to be nude. They are actually as deliberate as any studio portrait. A few are clothed and a few others are anonymous figure studies.

This book is a treasure: flawlessly designed and printed, with a humane and personal vision which shames Jock's critics into confronting their own hostility to art, innocence and beauty. Amazing how so many people whose knowledge of art is mininal suddenly develop such strong opinions about nude photography. To quote a famous poem: Shame on you for interrupting our vision."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"You'll find some very good photography here, nothing pornographic and mostly well composed.

Transformed into human currrency from basic uneventfulness, one tends to think that thou are that which the Eye reveals... and nowhere but the child can show this to others and Be Believed...

I like to contmplat the poseble simbolism of each one. there is a sexuality to many of these pitures, but they are all as far from pornography as you can get. the modles mostly look serios. some of the compositions are oveasly poesed in intresting ways, but many appere casual and candid. they are all black and white .one or two have boys in them also.the reason these pictures are not phornagraphic is that each modles dignaty and identiy is striven to be expresed by Sturges. truly the finest example of what nude photagraphy can be."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"I have the Sturges books and I really like the photography.

The photos are tremendous, and certainly more disarming than alarming. Yet I wouldn't be caught dead continuing to own this book. The subject matter goes so extremely far against the grain of culture, of my town, that my friends would certainly think the owner of this book a potentially dangerous member of society.

There are some photos here from his other books such as The Last Day of Summer and Radiant Identities.As a photographer, his technique is very good. However he only use one style of photography and all his photos are in grey-tone and not in colour.Compared to other studies of nude photography, the many of the models of Jock Sturges are plain-looking and it shows in his photographs. Among his more attractive models, he is only able to partially brings out their beauty in his photographs."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"Gerry Badger, in a listing of 250 key photographers, refers to Jock Sturges as the leading photographer of the \\"natural\\" nude (p. 170, Collecting Photography, Mitchell Beazley). This is fine, as far as it goes, but is too limited an introduction to Mr. Sturges's work. Mr. Sturges's photography is not limited to nudes. Neither can his subject matter be properly described as the nude or the natural nude. Rather, Mr. Sturges cares deeply about people. He is interested in people - in the whole of what a person is - and his work reflects this valuing. Simply turn to page 114 of the first Scalo book - the book I'm reviewing here - or page 31 or 87 or 126 - this is a wonderfully rich book - to find the definition of a great portrait.I find that I can go back to Mr. Sturges's books again and again with pleasure and for profit. I look at people differently since meeting the books - with greater pleasure and discernment. Having Mr. Sturges's work in my home makes my house feel more like home. Enough said.Mr. Sturges's monographs include Jock Sturges (Scalo), Jock Sturges: New Work 1996 - 2000 (Scalo), The Last Day of Summer (Aperture), Radiant Identities (Aperture), Notes (Aperture), and Evolution of Grace (Gakken). The Gakken book is printed too darkly (at least the copy I have is) but I'm grateful to the book, nevertheless, for the images it shares. Those wishing to catch a glimpse of Mr. Sturges's Irish work could look for an April 2001 copy of B&W;: Black & White Magazine.Addendum, December, 2012Does a flipped perspective help?Nakedness isn't inherently salacious. Naturist communities aren't places of unnaturally inflamed, sexual desire. The perception of nakedness as salacious (or the perception of nakedness as of no moment) is culturally instilled. A cringe reaction when looking at a Jock Sturges photograph isn't an authentication of the truth of one's perceptions. It may be a suggestion that one is a fairly typical American.Imagine a visitor from Saudi Arabia on a downtown street in the U.S.A. The visitor notices women in pants and slacks and jeans and women with their heads uncovered. The visitor might very well experience gut level revulsion at American licentiousness - a cringe reaction every bit as equal to that of one considering a Jock Sturges photograph - but when a bystander is asked why the women are so dressed, the visitor might be told, \\"Well, maybe she's scrubbing the floor today,\\" or \\"That's how a woman might dress to go out with her boyfriend,\\" or \\"She probably works in an office.\\" An American in Montalivet might have a similar experience. When asked why the community is remarkably short on clothing, a bystander might respond, \\"Well, it's summer.\\"I'm one who would find myself writing: \\"The good is always touch but not hold. But in a shared experience, even as the gold slips between our fingers, we can turn to the person sitting next to us and read, \\"Yes, I saw it too.\\" The apparent transience of a person's value in the face of time. This is what draws me to Jock Sturges photographs. A Jock Sturges photograph captures a person for a moment so that the person can be cherished and remembered. Two photographs of the same person taken at different times can be haunting and profoundly wise."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"This book contains nude young girls either by themselves or with family and friends. A guide tells you what models are in each picture. You will get to follow many of these young ladies as they start at the adolescent age and progress to young adulthood. There are a good many photos of some models and only one or two of another one. These children are very beautiful and Sturges will always have a large audience for his work."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"After viewing this book several times I believe I have come to understand what the photogrpaher is doing. Seeing the models progress in age and maturity is both exciting and thought provoking. The poses gently force the viewer to see the models as real people verses just bodies or shapes. They, (the models), are there because they want to be there. Their beauty is self evident and the viewer can almost hear their voices saying, &quot;here I am; deal with it world!&quot; The fact that many of the models are nude only makes the voices seem louder and more forceful. How brave of the models and the photographer to stay with their vision in a mad world. Also, after viewing the photographs; I can only view their critics as small minded, misguided, book burning, insecure fanatics uncomfortable with themselves and their own bodies and emotions. God created beauty and Jock Sturges photographed it as only a master could, in all it's beauty."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"This is by far the best collection of Sturges' work in publication. Unlike the previous Aperture monographs, it displays the images as the artist intended. It follows his chronology, and that of the models, so you can see how they developed over time from young women and men; through their teens, to adults raising their own families. Telling their stories as well as painting their portraits.He portrays them with the familiarity and intimacy of one who is almost family himself; and captures their characters as well as their forms. It is wonderful to watch how the girls and their families grow over time, how they change and develop. One wishes to know more about them as people, to understand the story behind the pictures.His models, though nude, are more comfortable in that state than most people are clothed. There are no clothes, no outside trappings, to get in the way of the full expression of the person. The people he photographs are relaxed and peaceful.His work is free of gimmicks, of artificial tension, of blatant eroticism. It is all about beauty and innocence.He has received numerous accusations of child pornography and exploitation from narrow-minded and perverse individuals. One only needs to look at his work to dispel all notions of such. Only the most twisted and sick-minded person could find his work pornographic. As a Christian, I find it to be a wonderful expression of the beauty of God's greatest creation.The tones of his images are mostly soft, low-contrast. The beach images reflect in sand and sea the same light gradations and textures visible on the bodies of those he photographs; the models seeming to become a part of their environment, but still standing out from the background. Others are more contrasty, both in tone and setting, complimenting rather than echoing the models.The printing is exquisite. Having attended two gallery shows of Sturges' work, and seen the prints, I can say that the book, though it can't reproduce the richness of the tones of the silver prints, does admirably in approximating them. The quality of the binding is superb; and the introductory texts are well-worth reading.A book that i highly recommend for all lovers of find photography."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"I am a white, male, Christian, conservative, Republican grandfather that teaches Sex Education to students the same age as some of Mr. Sturges' friends. How wonderful it is that my students can now see what other normal people their own age actually look like, and that their own body is OK!. Usually, they only get to see what Madison Avenue thinks that they should look like. How sad that Jock is persecuted, while everyday we see the use of little bare babes to sell toilet paper, skin lotion or fashionable pants. I love the book. Thank you Jock, and thank you, Amazon, for carrying Jock's work."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"There is one mysterious thing about the work of Jock Sturges: 99% of his pictures are all very artistic and impressing. They are from real life, but they look like something from another world. You don't believe it. In those cases you see, that Sturges is the difference between art and simple photography. However, the last 1% of his pictures are pure nonsense. They are dominated by mistakes, that you can read from Beginner's Guide or Photography for Dummies. Or, they are just silly and meaningless, a waste of paper. But that's only 1%. The rest is enough for 6 stars, if I had the option. If you would like to have a look at Jock Sturges, but still short of money, you should buy only this book. It has got a number of the same pictures as in his other books."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"I have always known that Jock Sturges was a genius, but this book proves it.

I have completely analylized both of Sturges' other books and this one tops them both. His use of light and his angle of photography is unbelievable. He captures his shots excellently. Very few photographers these days take the time to take the picture the exact way they had orginally planned it. I used enjoy the work of David Hamilton more than Mr. Sturges, but after reading this one I will defiinitly support Mr. Sturges with a greater passion. My &quot;co-viewer&quot; and I both agree that this is the best work of photography of its kind in a long time!!!"},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"I found this to be the best of the Sturges books. Not only did it contain the most photos, it allowed the viewer to follow the progression of his models through the years. Having raised two daughters, it was like deja vu to see how Sturges' girls &quot;grew up&quot; in front of his lenses. I only wish my two girls could have posed for him."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"This was my first Jock Sturges book so I wasn't completely sure what to expect. I found it to be generally very well done with few pictures that were particularly erotic even though most were of nudes (generally of girls or women). I sometimes thought that the composition and lighting were a little odd (off centered or speck in the distance shots for example)but most poses were good. I especially liked the way Sturges showed some of his subjects as they aged through the years from childhood to womanhood. I do wish that the photo titles and dates were on the same page instead of on a separate paper, that made for very inconvenient reading having to constantly refer back and forth. Much better photographer than David Hamilton."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"If one of the main purposes of art is to challenge, this book has certainly done its job. What's more interesting is how what it challenges is our conception of beauty. Our society, steeped in a Judeo-Christian philosophy that denies the beauty of the human body, has become so fearful of any image of nudity as to lose sight of what it is that makes our lives wonderful. And, yes, that can include the beauty of other human beings of all ages. Jock Sturges' work also challenges our notions of childhood, which we have so over-sentimentalized as to lose sight of the human beings who are the children we look at. Sturges' children are individuals; they are not there to amuse us or to do our bidding; they have the qualties of humanity denied to children by those who wish to keep children and childhood within the limits defined by Precious Moments figurines."},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"I have looked through the book several times and I feel that it is honestly and truly the best of its kind around. I do not see how anyone could be offended by the art work in the book. If people were more open minded in our country (the United States), they would realize the beauty of Jock Sturges' art work!!!"},{"Title":"Jock Sturges","review":"It is too bad that people cannot get beyond their own shallowness to enjoy such a chronology of models.

It is the largest collection of some of Sturges' best work"},{"Title":"Japan's Re-emergence as a 'Normal' Military Power (Adelphi series)","review":"Hughes provides us with an important and timely paper on modern Japanese security policy. What Hughes does in this paper, is to outline the development and changes of Japan's post-WWII defence policy, and the reasons as to why, in his opinion, these shifts have occurred. The paper is quite up to date, taking into account events just prior to the announcement of the new National Defence Program Guidelines (Dec 2004).I agree with Hughes on many of the points he makes regarding the meaning of Japan's \\"re-emergence\\", the catalysts being a relatively new domestic political acceptance (by elites and others) of defence issues and a new international politico-military environment. I also agree with Hughes when he states that Japan has chosen to tighten the alliance with the United States significantly, as opposed to pursuing a more independent path. Indeed, it can be said that Hughes's interpretations of shifts in Japan's defence policy are moderate, fair and accurate.If you are looking for a general (but comprehensive) overview of Japan's defence policy then this is the paper for you. But if you are after something more \\"meaty\\" that goes into the finer details and particularly the politics behind the changes that have taken place then you must look elsewhere to supplement this paper.All in all a very good paper, which I'm sure many students of Japanese politics and international security will find useful."},{"Title":"Japan's Re-emergence as a 'Normal' Military Power (Adelphi series)","review":"I'm one of the novice readers on modern Japanese security affairs for whom the prior reviewer said this book was very good, and I can vouch for his judgment. \\"Japan's Re-emergence\\" does a wonderful job in outlining Japan's past and current security policy, with some careful projections of its probable future course. The author writes with careful objectivity and great clarity, and is very adroit at breaking down the widely divergent implications of what to the non-expert are almost indistinguishable terms, such as \\"required defence force\\" and \\"standard defence force\\" for instance. The book is peppered with acronyms throughout, but a handy glossary in the front of the book makes the alphabet soup navigable. The exposition is clear and helpful without dumbing down the material, balanced and level-headed without being bland. And far from becoming dated as of late 2006, the book provides some much-needed context on recent developments in Japan such as the upgrading of the Japan Defense Agency to a full-fledged ministry, Abe Shinzo's rise to prime ministership, and the continuing tensions with North Korea. Whether you are looking for a good, readable introduction into this complicated subject or just trying to get some background knowledge on the headlines, this small, concise book will serve your purposes admirably."},{"Title":"Who Built the Ark?: An African-American Spiritual","review":"This is a very appealing version that celebrates the African-American origin of a traditional spiritual. As an early childhood educator, I like the way this book offers many possibility for cross curriculum studies."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"Don't go through life without reading &quot;Anna Karenina.&quot; This novel is excellent on so many levels that you can read it again and again, as I have, and still thoroughly enjoy it. Tolstoy skillfully tells two different stories simultaneously, based on the same theme: How does one find true happiness? Anna makes a choice and tries to bravely see it through, trying all the while to persuade herself that she's found happiness, but you can feel the strain build as the novel nears its climax. Levin nearly drives himself insane in his mental tug-of-war over where his place in life should be, but eventually comes full circle. In their journeys, Anna and Levin cross paths, with fascinating results. I can't stress enough that this book is a must-read. Be prepared to be thoughtful, depressed, elated and emotionally drained."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"&quot;Anna Karenina&quot; is why the novel was invented. It is a colossal achievement that fully exploits the possibilities inherent in the literary form. The purpose of the 19th-century novel was to explore character and to critique society, and Tolstoy here has achieved the quintessence of both aims. The thing about Tolstoy is that you can trust him -- he is utterly honest. He doesn't revise, or simplify, or sugar-coat. He presents the human mind, in its various guises, precisely as it is. Levin, to my mind, rivals Hamlet as the most vivid, fully living character in literature, and he is probably much more self-consistent than the Melancholy Dane. Anna's story, which is more melodramatic and plot-heavy, might strike some as a flaw in comparison to Levin's. And maybe it is a flaw. But one must talk about flaws in &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; as one talks about flaws in Beethoven's 9th Symphony -- blemishes on a masterpiece which, if it errs, errs only in striving further than the art form is supposed to go.Tolstoy's genius at depicting character and psychology is matched by his ability to construct vivid, memorable setpieces. No one who has read &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; can ever forget the hay-mowing, or Vronksy's horse race, or the heartbreaking scenes of Levin's sickly brother.Even Dickens, with all his glorious phantasmagoria, never achieved what Tolstoy has done here. Tolstoy caught lightning in a bottle: homo sapiens, captured in 800-odd pages. There are only a handful of comparable achievements in all of Western art."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"For the longest time I have been reticent to write a review of Anna for fear of not being able to do the book justice. I still have that fear, but the time has come to at least say that this is my favorite novel of all time. I refer to the Magarshack translation which I have read and now re-read. I can't imagine a more intriguing story... admittedly however, it would help if the reader had an interest in the world that Tolstoy inhabited. There are so many (often lengthy) asides into his thoughts on abstention from worldly riches / social reconstruction etc. Tolstoy gets his character Levin to do reams of his own preaching on these subjects but again, because I find Tolstoy himself to be one of the most interesting characters Russia has ever produced, I don't mind finding him so obviously entrenched in his own story here.But &quot;Anna&quot; is first and foremost a LOVE story which depicts the fleeting and disastrous effects of tempestous/undisciplined love (Anna and Vronsky) over against the lasting and mutually beneficial results of patient/disciplined love (Levin and Kitty). This book is an important masterpiece without rival in literature. Reading such a book on one's death-bed would not be a waste of time.When I think of Anna, I am reminded of something that Solzhenitsyn made one of his fictional characters say in his book The First Circle: &quot;In the 17th century there was Rembrandt, and there is Rembrandt today. Just try to improve on him. And yet the technology of the 17th century now seems primitive to us. Or take the technological innovations of the 1870's. For us they're child's play. But that was when Anna Karenina was written. What can you name that's superior?&quot;Read Anna... and you will be as silent as I am on that one!"},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"There are two stories in this novel, which are connected at the beginning but become pretty much completely separate in the end. There's the title story of Anna, who runs off with a good-looking army officer leaving behind her stolid politician husband and young son. Then there's the highly autobiographical story of the quiet, unconfident Levin, who's quite happy to live a peaceful life in the countryside (and gets regarded as a fool as a result), except when he ventures into society (quote unquote) to try and woo the woman he loves, who sadly has eyes only for the man Anna fixes her attention on.I have to confess that I found Levin's story a lot more interesting than Anna's. I sympathised a lot with his lack of confidence and search for purpose in life, and ended up rushing the bits about Anna to read about him.However, both are well-excecuted, Tolstoy's piercing insights into human nature creeping in. Levin's behaviour in particular was eminently understandable and recognisable.I have a hard time deciding whether I enjoyed War and Peace or this more - certainly the character of Levin surpasses the ones in War and Peace. Read them both, that's my advice."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"It's not necessary for me to repeat the high praise heaped upon ANNA KARENINA, which although slow-going in spots is nonetheless highly recommended by practically everyone, a world class read. But an argument is handy among those who would argue the merits of various translators and translations. Below are four of them with four representative passages from the opening paragraphs of this novel:Constance Garnett (1901, with many revisions by others, many available for sale here, also for free online):\\"the wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl,...\\"(Introducing Prince Stephan Arkadyevich):\\" -- Stiva, as he was known in the fashionable world -- \\"\\"He turned over his stout, well-cared-for person on the springy sofa,\\"Louise and Aylmer Maud (1918), available here as an Oxford World Classic:\\"His wife had discovered an intrigue between her husband and the former French governess,...\\"\\" -- Stiva, as he was called by his set in Society[note cap. \\"S\\"] -- \\"\\"He turned his plump, well-kept body over on the springy sofa,\\"David Magarshak (1961), Signet(Mass Market) Paperback [and this version]:\\"The wife had found out that the husband had had an affair with the French governess,...\\"\\"(Stiva, as he was called by his society friends),\\"\\"He turned his plump, well-cared-for body on the springy sofa,...\\"Peavar/Volokhonsky, 1991 (Penguin Classic and [same pagination, fancier cover] Oprah's Pick):\\"The wife had found out that the husband was having an affair with the former French governess . . . \\"\\" -- Stiva, as he was called in society -- \\"\\"He rolled his full, well-tended body over the springs of the sofa,...\\"The first thing to say is that these four quotations have a great deal more in common with each other than not. Nonetheless, there are differences: note that only two of the four mention that the object of Stiva's affection was a former employee. Despite several layers of revision, Garnett's translation, nearly a century old, at times slips into archaism: note the reference to high society as the \\"fashionable world,\\" a term for which modern readers could be excused for construing something along the lines of couture, high fashion in clothing. Both the Garnett and the Maude version maintain the euphemism \\"intrigue\\" for \\"love-affair,\\" while the two more recent translations keep to the more contemporary and less euphemistic \\"affair.\\" In the Magarshack translation (1961), the use of the pluperfect in \\"the husband had had an affair\\" is technically correct, even today, but the P&V; version with its \\"was having\\" just rolls by better to me.Overall, though, of the four my personal favorite is the 1961 Magarshak translation, also the cheapest (but smallest in trim size). If I had to conduct a group discussion of ANNA KARENINA, though, I would almost cetainly gravitate to the much-better-distributed Peaver/Volokshonky edition because the differences or any presumed demerits, to me, are not as significant as granting the easiest accessibility to a group of individual readers. I could probably muddle through the archaisms in the Maude version -- it is the most reworked and in many respects the most solid, despite its age -- but I know I would have problems with the Constance Garrett.The important thing to remember is that ANNA KARENINA is a book that demands to be read, and the reader who takes the time to read it fully will be well rewarded in vivid characterization, deft plotting, romance, social insight, and history, despite how one feels about the (sometimes exasperating) agrarian-political theorizing of Tolstoy's stand-in, Levin."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"What a great reason to learn Russian -- the book is much better in its native language. However, even the English version is rather beyound words. This true masterpiece of literature is worth rereading many times. Tolstoy has an amazing insite into human nature; his characters and far more than 3 dimentional -- the palate of detailed nuances that Tolstoy supplies his readers is unmatched by its completness. The scale of the book is grandiose and it rather indescribable. You simply MUST read it and experience for yourself -- you will NOT be sorry!"},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"The book is magnificent. Just read some of the other posted reviews.The translation is less than ideal.... After working my way through half of the David Magarshack's translation, I found myself sitting on the floor in a bookstore re-reading sections of the book in other translations. This translation uses dated idioms, often (seems to) tranlate different Russian words into the same English word (judging by other translations), rarely translates the French, and often uses rather banal (maybe 'academic') wording where more emotive words could have been used to better evoke the mood of the passage."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"This book made me want to take notes--I didn't want to lose one insight into human sympathy, societies' hypocrosies or Russian history. Tolstoy's unparalleled exposition of the psyche and soul amaze, and the scintillating plot propels through the long read and through time."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"I am not exaggerating when I say Anna Karenina is the greatest novel I have ever read. I have read quite a lot but still have a great deal to go to say I've tackled the world's greatest works of literature. I will, however, give myself my due for reading this wonderful novel by Leo Tolstoy. Like many before me and many after I was greatly intimidated by the sheer size of the book. I doubted whether or not I could keep myself interested in the story. I was wrong. I should have trusted Tolstoy from the beginning because he literally held my attention from the first page until the very last. This is not an exaggeration. I was truly glued to the pages of this book and I was taken into its pages and story in a way no other book has ever managed to do. I could not go anywhere without this book near me. Every second I could get away from people around me I had my nose deep in this book and wanted to lose myself in it. Anna Karenina transported me away to Russia to a land that was foreign yet similar to my own and told a story that was as compelling and shocking as if it were on a soap opera. I loved it! I kept noticing when my friends saw me reading this leviathan of a novel they would offer looks of sympathy and misunderstanding. \\"Wouldn't you rather read something more modern and shorter? Something from James Patterson, perhaps?\\" I would smile and explain how I was really enthralled with the book and how my friends should do themselves a favor and read it as soon as they could. They all seemed too intimidated which is a shame for this book brought out of me every emotion known to man and really held my attention in a way many books can only do briefly. Yes, it is an undertaking but the book will pass quickly as you read it and you will not even consider that a reason to read it. It is the trip through Russia itself and into the lives of these poor, unfortunate souls that is the joy (or tragedy) of reading Anna Karenina. I loved this book and it continues to be my favorite literary novel of all time. If you've been thinking of giving it a chance I assure you it is easy to read and will hold you to it by its scandalous and romantic story. Start the book when you have time to sit and get involved with it without so much going on in your life. The winter months are excellent times for reading Anna Karenina. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"Like many people who begin reading Anna Karenina, I was intimidated by the size of the novel. As I'm a slow reader, I took it at my own pace. It's 900+ pages took me just under 2 months to read.Now that the story is over, I miss my window into Tolstoy's world. I loved the array of characters in this novel and while I found that I identified with certain characters more than others, I think there's something for everyone in one story line or another. I did find that there were parts of the novel that bored me, such as Levin's confusion at the election process and the hunting trip that took place in the later part of the book. However, I was captivated by Levin's struggle to find meaning in life and his consideration of what it means to have morals without religion.I enjoyed getting into Anna's head, but also appreciated understanding the feelings of her husband as well as her lover. Tolstoy's ability to write from different perspectives and opposing points of view, male and female, was my favorite aspect of the book.Oblonsky was, without question, my favorite character. You meet him right away, and though he's not always a key player in the novel, Anna and Levin's lives always intertwined with Oblonsky just enough to leave me wanting more. His character is larger than life, and one I will keep with me as a literary favorite."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"Half the content is elaborate banal detail used to establish context, but in it's more consequential moments this novel is the final word on the disingenuous nature of institutionalized aspects of social behaviour. It's a theme I've pondered and seen touched on in a few other books, but I was blown away by how comprehensively Tolstoy articulates and extrapolates my own thoughts.This novel is primarily a work of philosophy, using the characters to illustrate social observations at the expense of a fully cohesive narrative.It's difficult to understand how fans of classic fiction, who generally consider \\"reading\\" a neccessity for respectable people, don't take offense to this book as it seems to be constantly critcizing that kind of cultural pretense.Another interesting thing I got from the book is how culture 100+ years ago doesn't seem as formal and conservative as I had previously been led to believe. Parents were already complaining about tradition falling out of favor among the younger generation and governmental red-tape was already something criticized as getting in the way of practical goals. On the other hand the doctors of the era are presented as having no medical knowledge whatsoever.my fave quote:\\"The word talent, which they understood to mean an innate and almost physical capacity, independent of mind and heart, and which was their term for everything an artist lives through, occurred very often in their conversation, since they required it as a name for something which they did not at all understand, but about which they wanted to talk.\\""},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"Reading this novel turned into quite a project.

It is needless to say that I was greatly disappointed not so much in style of the book but with the content and its characters. I have read others' reviews and found it astonishing to believe that people actually felt sorry for Anna Karenina. She was nothing but selfish and deceitful character that made everyone else miserable to ensure her own happiness. She is the main reason that I was so greatly disappointed with the book. I could hardly believe that people thought this was the greatest love story of all. Her behavior and attitude showed nothing but her selfishness and wantonness. The book might have been accurate in providing what it was like in 19th century Russia's high society but other than that it was horrid example of tasteless and contemptible adulterous affair between two very selfish and undeserving people. It poorly measured up to its reputation and praises."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"Anna Karenina Alex Latushkin Leo Tolstoy Entry #4, March 21,1998Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina is a definite masterpiece. I had always thought of the book as a tragic love story in which Anna Karenina falls under a train at the end. After reading the novel I came to conclusion that this aspect is just the basic foundation for the book. Leo Tolstoy conveys philosophy in to life's broadest issues such as love, hate, determination, religion, sin, and most importantly related to the novel, revenge. The novel includes many characters but its nine leading ones are Anna Karenina, Prince Stephan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky, Dolly, Konstantin Levin, Sergey Ivanovitch, Alexey Alexandrovitch, Kitty and of course Count Vronsky. These nine characters lead the novel to its height and Leo Tolstoy tells the story through their beliefs in an overall limited 3rd person point of view based upon each of these characters. The novel includes many stories in it; one is of Anna Karenina's determined passion for Vronsky and her sin of betraying her husband, Alexey Alexandrovitch. The tale slowly grows to a final tragic conclusion with the help of the other six characters. Levin's tale possesses just as such significance towards the overall view of the story as Anna's though. The story involves Levin, a decent man who is madly in love with Kitty and almost loses her to Count Vronsky, who decides to go after Anna instead. Through Levin's worries he finally proposes to Kitty but one problem still aces him; Levin is unsure of God's existence and at the end he comprehends that he is a true believer even though he is unsure of somethings (He is sure that God exists though). Prince Oblonsky and his wife Dolly first introduce Anna to the reader when Anna makes a visit to their home to set things right between her brother and sister-in-law. Their problem is based upon the fact that the Prince had an affair with a French dame and Dolly threatens divorce. After some important advice from Anna, the couple reunites! and continues their relationship with less zest however. I am very glad that Leo Tolstoy (also known as &quot; Count Leo Tolstoy &quot;) kept the reader up with the feelings of all of the main characters, otherwise, the story would have not possessed such a strong value as it did with the limited 3rd person point of view. At first when the reader was introduced to the fact that Anna proposed to run off with Vronsky and demand a divorce from her husband Alexey, I was much disappointed by her unethical actions. However, later in the story Tolstoy explains that Anna first married him from an early-arranged marriage because of Alexey's strong position in the world. Later in the book Anna conveys herself to be a well-sophisticated woman who is deeply in love with Vronsky and is very ill inside from her partings with her son, Seroizha. At that moment I began to see her a more decent person. In the early introduction and biographical profile of Leo Tolstoy the following quote sets the mood and summarizes the main theme of Anna Karenina: &quot; Vengeance is mine and I will repay&quot; (Tolstoy, 1968, p.ii). I think that this quote summarizes the theme because it deals directly with Anna's sins and how she paid with her life for the peccadilloes that she committed. Her sins involve not staying faithful to her husband, desiring a divorce, and when not receiving one begetting another man's child as her own. Anna believes that Vronsky will stay true to her forever but after a few years Anna begins to question his faithfulness. Her jealousy looses Vronsky and the end of part seven Anna purposely jumps under a train believing that this will escape her tragedies. I knew that this was destined to happen because I had quite good background knowledge of the plot before actually reading the book but I found one part of her death to be the saddest; I had not known of this part. After Anna jumps under the train she realizes that she is once again committing another sin and that she more than anything else desire! s to live. In the seconds that she spends before she death under the train, Anna changes her mind. When she decides to live though, her vengeance is repaid. Upon leaping from the train tracks &quot; something huge and merciless struck her...&quot; (Tolstoy, 1968, p.1248). I found this to be a very sad and scary moment; Anna had the chance to live but her decisions of living came too late. In conclusion, I would like to say that there is really original no way to characterize the book, or to make a great analysis of it; Leo Tolstoy already did so. Overall, I really enjoyed the book even though it was well over 1,000 pages and took me all quarter to read. Anna Karenina is well worth the pages that it takes up because every page conveys a new thought and idea while also staying to its main theme. The complexity of the book is not just of the main theme however. It is of the themes and lessons that each of the nine main aristocratic characters learn throughout the book."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"Anna Karenina is the best book I have ever read.

The value of the story doesn't lie within the plot but rather the writing itself. Like &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; Tolstoy and his fellow Russians have captured every detail of the human emotion and the juxtaposition of thoughts and inner turmoils are engrossing to say the least. What makes a book a &quot;classic&quot; is its ability to reach an audience across time and place. That's what made Shakespeare great and Leo is not far from it. Everyone of us (even the ones in high school) has experience the feeling of love and betryal.

Rather than give my synopsis and analysis, I'd like to also recommend Vladimir Nabokov's &quot;Lectures on Russian Literature&quot;, which contains a long section devoted to Anna Karenin. Nabokov's study increased my appreciation for Anna Karenin immeasurably (it is an analysis with an artist's eye for detail rather than an academic's penchant for pedantry).I'd also like to point out that there are different translations available, and not all of them are good. I can recommend the one by Rosemary Edmonds; And, I have heard that the Maude translation is also good, but I have not yet read this one. I am not an expert, so you might want to visit a well-stocked bookstore or library and compare for yourself.P.S.

What absurbity. Has our society come so low that we see every thing on the surface now. Anna cheat, Anna bad. Anna beg boyfriend not to leave, Anna weak. Karenina is a loveless, passionless person, stodgy, consevative without empathy,a man who refuses to let his son see his mother, a man influenced strongly by the old biddies in his neighborhood. And Kitty, she is charming and youthful, but refuses steady Levin for a handsome beau. I just don't understand what constitutes good in this society anymore, Alas.And a note to the school girls reading this, there was a time, not very long ago, when women, and their wealth, were the property of fathers then husbands. There were only a few professions open to women, so going out getting a job was rarely an option. Anna risked everything to follow her heart. She broke convention completely and paid the price which was to be completely ostarcized by everyone but her brother. Of course she begged her lover to stay, what could she do without him, not just emotionally but practically. That is not weakness it's survival. Please learn about our history. it is so important. The world wasn't always like it is today"},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"Tolstoy had talent most of us can only dream about. In Anna Karenina he examines the central problem of life through two distinct lenses - Anna, whose discontent is acknowledged in the affair with the dashing Vronsky, and Konstantin, also disillusioned, at first spurned, and later rewarded for accepting what seem to be Tolstoy's views of the truest of virtues.The novel is brimming with ambitious ideas about love, family, society, religion, service, deceit, you name it. In addition, the writing is well exectuted and highly compelling even to the modern reader. Without giving away the ending I would simply say that the outcomes both follow the logic of Tolstoy's opinions about right and wrong. A long novel that one only wishes could never end."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"The question whether love can rise above social condition is the contradiction that has puzzled the world for centuries. Even in modern fairytales like The Bridge of Madison County and Horse Whisper, the paradox manifests itself in readers' imaginations with two different strands of solutions trying to unite. Tears are shed when passion indeed thrives but social constraint separates the hungry hearts, but when one focuses on the other side of that paradox, we see tragedy in both Emma Bovary and Anna Karenina.When Anna deserts her husband, a sophisticated bureaucrat, and her young son, ultimately her status to succumb to her desires for the dashing Vronsky, society abandons her as well. She is moved by Vronsky's words that solve the mystery of her unhappy marriage life, &quot;But how often the happiness of marriages founded on reason crumbles to dust because the very passion that was disregarded makes itself felt later&quot;. Running in parallel with Anna Karenina's adultery is Levin's, a young nobleman a.k.a. Tolstoy's fictional counterpart, quest for truth in love and in religion. What he seeks in life manifests the same physical and mental burden as he struggles to gain control of a life that is indeed under the dominance of social status.What puzzles me is if Anna's tragedy is to be presented in a modern setting with fewer social constraint, how the outcome would differ. Morality of society alters while morality of mankind alters little; that statement itself may create some obstacle in a replay, but perhaps more freedom is indeed allowed in the modern world which explains the frequency of divorce and of course, crimes. No one can abide the law according to Tolstoy, and that certain doesn't change with time and progress. Love cannot exist free of social influences, but passion could. Yet at the end, love thrives over social boundaries while passions dies tamed perhaps by the iron claws of systematic limitations."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"Tolstoy is the greatest writer ever, which he proves in WAR AND PEACE, and I found parts of ANNA KARENINA to be brilliant, but, funnily enough, not the Anna Karenina parts.

Dostoeyevsky said of ANNA KARENINA, &quot;I found it to be tedious,&quot; and I would bet he found the parts about Anna herself reason for such a comment. If you want brilliant Russian writing, read Turgenev's A SPORTSMAN'S [or HUNTER'S] SKETCHES.

Even Tolstoy thought this book was crap when he finished it. He almost never published it.

The first line (one of the most famous in literature) hints at Tolstoy's own views about happy and unhappy marriages having these same three families also represent three very different societal and physical locations in Russia in addition to distinctly different views on love, loyalty, fidelity, happiness and marital bliss.Tolstoy seems to stress that \`trusting companionships\\" are more durable and filled with happiness versus \\"romantic passion\\" that bursts with flames and then slowly; leaves ashes rather than a firm, solid foundation to build upon.It is like reading a soap opera with all of its twists and turns where the observer is allowed to enter into the homes, the minds and the spirits of its main characters. The moral compass in the book belongs to Levin whose life and courtship of Kitty mirrors much of Leo Tolstoy's own courtship of his wife Sophia. Levin's personality and spiritual quest is Tolstoy's veiled attempt at bringing to life his own spiritual peaks and valleys and the self doubts that plagued him his entire life despite his happy family life and the fact that he too found love in his life and a committed durable marriage. At the other end of the spectrum is Anna, who also because of her individual choices and circumstances, falls into despair.It is clear that Tolstoy wants the reader to come away with many messages about the sanctity of marriage, love and family life. He also wants us to be mindful of the choices that we make in life and the affect that these choices have upon ourselves, our station and path in life as well as the affect upon those that we profess to love. Tolstoy also wants us to examine what makes our lives happy or not; and what is at the root of either end result. Levin and Kitty are the happiest married couple; yet Levin faces his own double bind when struggling against domestic bliss and his need for independence on the other hand and how to achieve both (if that is possible) without relinquishing that which made him who he was born to be.Anna Karenina and Konstantin Levin are the primary protagonists in the novel and both are rich and fine characters in their own right. Both of them focus on self; one however finds the self to be a nurturer which puts value into life very much as a farmer; while the other views self with despair and as a punisher or destroyer. Both views, diametrically opposed, force the characters on very different paths and lives for themselves. Then there is the dilemma of forgiveness versus vengeance. The very epigram for the novel from Romans states: \\"Vengeance is mine; I will repay.\\" Yet vengeance upon oneself or others is not up to individuals but God; and yet the characters are haunted about what forgiveness is or isn't and by the hollowness of words versus heartfelt and soulfully reflective actions. The themes of social change in Russia, family life's blessings and virtues and farming (even if it is simply the goodness one puts into life and how one cultivates it and others) dominate the novel's landscape. Trains also play a symbolic importance in the novel and it is odd that Tolstoy himself years after writing Anna Karenina dies himself in a train station after setting off from his home in an emotional cloud.Sometimes the names of the characters themselves can be confusing: so a hint to the reader might be to think of each Russian character's name as having three parts: the first name (examples here are for Levin and Kitty) like Konstantin or Ekaterina, a patronymic which is the father's first name accompanied by a suffix which means son of or daughter of like Dmitrich (son of Dmitri) or Alexandrovna (daughter of Alexander) and then the surname like Levin or Shcherbatskaya. Thus the explanations for the Ekaterina Alexandrovna Shcherbatskaya (nicknamed Kitty) and Konstantin Dmitrich Levin (Levin).I loved the book and its details and the richness of the characterizations as well as the storytelling technique of the great Tolstoy and I have to agree with Tolstoy when he stated, \\"I am very proud of its architecture-its vaults are joined so that one cannot even notice where the keystone is. \\" The vaults: \\"Anna and Levin\\" are joined with the very first line of the novel and with their focus on themselves.Rating: ABentley/2007"},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"This remarkable story by one of the few mega-novelists of all times is an ageless story that is more real than fiction. I decided to read a copy of this book on my way to vacation last the summer and ended up spending most of my first week being glued to the book. Though it is a Russian story of a century and a half ago, its essence still resonates today.Anna who is married to the wealthy and older Karenin lives a life of comfort without any excitement, a life that is full of routines and no zest. It is a life she had become used to until she meets the elegant Vronsky and falls in love. Now she must pay the price of adultery or seek marital stability and forgo the echoes of her heart, a soul searching trial that destabilizes the life of her family and that of her lover. In essence she abandons the meaning for her life and pursues the zest of life.On the other hand is Levine who is in search of the meaning of life and abandons the zest of life for a purposeful life that includes a family, ideas on the advancement of humanism, being at peace with ones world and hard work in is farm and being at peace with God.In a way, both Levine and Anna can not be blamed for opting considering one choice above the other. They all wanted happiness without having evil intentions and found a balance between the zest of life and the search of its meaning in their own different ways, hurting and find love in the process and in the end, enriching and destroying themselves in their different ways. A highly recommended read and the most insightful love story I have ever read.Union Moujik, dr Zhivago, Eugene Onegin are some of the other books set in Russia that I enjoyed alongside Anna Karenina."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"Anna Karenina was an amazing book.

One good thing about it is that there are no villains, no one-sided characters, who are only out to get the heroines and heroes. Everyone is flawed and everyone is likeable. I found the ending very sad, the Anna ending that is, because you get the feeling she is changing her mind at the last minute and there is nothing she can do about it. At first I didn't like Vronsky, but because I was seeing him through Levin's eyes, but later you get a more rounded view of him.

Tolstoy utterly amazed me with his ability to bring his characters to life and sketch their subtlest reactions. He is not only a magnificent author, but an insightful social historian describing tenderly the very passionate Russia. &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; tells the story of a woman (Anna Karenina) engaged in an unhappy marriage, gasping for air. When Anna meets Vronky, a young and passionate soldier, her lust for life rekinddles as she awakes from the dead. Such behavior is inexcusable in her reserved high society environment and is something that will haunt her. The other main character, Konstantine Levin, struggles also with life. When he eventually achieves his long term goal and wins the heart of a young beauty named Kitty, he finds that he is still not content with life. &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; is an amazing novel that entrapps the reader in the mystic high society of Russia and expresses to him the conseuqences that being human can often lead to.

This book by Tolstoy has all the elements of sin, redemption, sanctification, and renewal. The character portraits are amazing. Tolstoy provides an interlocking profile of three marriages and a relationship, each with its own distinct character. As the opening sentence implies, some of the relationships are more harmonious than others.Tolstoy was a master of depicting character - a few pages into the story and Oblonsky comes to life for the reader. The same is true of Ann, Kitty, Levin, and all of the other main characters.

In any case, I have often, as a woman, referenced back to Anna's situation, both from my own as well as friends' experiences.

It all becomes clear at the end. Next time I read it Ill definitely read it differently, even though this time I still obtained the true meaning of the story. Some parts may seem obsessively long though, like about the political and agricultural stand points in Russian society, but read them still in order to understand those bits about the book."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"Without question, one the most wonderful books I have ever read.

Recently (after 25 years) I re-read Anna Karenina. I still say Tolstoy was a great thinker and a great writer. But I also have to say, my understanding deepened by my own religous experences and by being a husband and father, that most of the characters in Anna Karenina are not people I would like to associate with. In fact, they have serious mental and character problems, especially Anna and Constantine Levin, who is modeled after Tolstoy himself. My advice: Read it. It's a great book. Learn something about human nature and human weaknesses and also about traditional Russian society, which of course came to such a sad end in 1918."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"The average review of this work is four and a half stars! It should be infinity! This book is the greatest book ever written! It is extraordinary. I will not discuss its greatness because I am not consciously cabable of it. Just read it and then you will know. There is a reason literature classes make you read this book. Its because of how damn good it is!"},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"I took up Anna Karenina thinking that it would be an epic saga concerning a woman victimized by a male-dominated, 19th century Russian society. In fact the novel Anna Karenina is only partly about the title character; a majority of the book is about the travails of her relatives, especially a thinly-disguised Leo Tolstoy going under the name of Constantine Levin.While Anna Karenina is indeed beautifully written, especially remarkable considering I read an English translation, and it does transport the reader back in time to another part of the world. But the book falls far short of perfection because of its rather unlikeable (!) main character (..Anna Karenina was more a victim of her selfishness and neurotic behaviour than a victim to her husband and a sexist 19th century Russia), and due to overly-deep (read: boring) Levin character who thinks that it's better to be a uneducated peasant than a rich man (..as if!).While not wanting to criticize Anna Karenina too much, I have to add that I was disappointed in Tolstoy's &quot;rose-colored&quot; view of peasants. There is almost no depiction of the squalor and disease which obviously tormented the Russian working class. Dostoyevsky, in Crime and Punishment (for example), certainly handled this area much more realistically (..almost to a fault).So while Anna Karenina is brilliant effort to a certain extent I cannot think of it as a masterpiece. And since it is overly long and contains too much pie-in-the-sky socio-economic commentary by the Levin character (aka Tolstoy) I really can't recommend reading it. Certainly if you are looking for a romance novel where a Garbo-esque herione will bring tears to your eyes I suggest avoiding Anna Karenina at all costs."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"Leo Tolstoy's greatest work? Most definitely. No doubt about it. This book is everything that you could ever want. It has power, love, betrayal, sex, devastation, family, and everything in between. It is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. And, boy did I have to work to get it all done. It was long and hard, but completely worth the effort. I loved every minute of it. I found Anna's struggle mesmerizing and heartbreaking. I was filled with so many emotions that I couldn't even sort them all out until I was finished. I wept with everything last page and fell in love with the language, Russian customs, time period, and settings. I don't think that this book could have gotten any better. It's a true and wonderful masterpiece. Wonderful Classic Book!"},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"This is a delightful soap opera which is as current now as it was when it was written.

Anna Karenina is the famous Tolstoy tale of a wife who has an affair. At first, I wanted to quit it was such a difficult read, but once I got through it, I loved it. I have to say, I thought Kitty and Levin's relationship was really cute, especially when they finally kissed! I was super-sad when Anna killed herself, it just sucked that was so sorrowful that she felt the need to die. I didn't really like Vronsky, he seemed sort of like a jerk who just lost interest in Anna, after she left her husband and son for him. I like the parallels between Anna and Levin. Sometimes, it did get a little boring, like when Levin worked with some peasants in a field, it took like, a huge portion of the book to explain about the field-work. Also, I got a little confused when Levin started to believe in God. All in all, a good read, not for those who get bored easily, though."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"While I have not yet had a chance to actually read the book (because of other reading obligations with grad school), the book itself appears to be in good condition."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"This book is &quot;the best novel ever written.&quot; Of course, the people who say this also rave about James Joyce. The truth is, Anna Karenina is a book you should read, if only so you can say that you read it. The characters range from amusing to annoying, and you'll probably want to drop-kick Anna by page 500. Levin's internal struggle over peasant-noble relations and the agricultural revolution are nausiating. The religious conflicts several of the characters experience become equally tedious. The book is saved by the lovable near-do-well Oblonsky and his wife Dolly. So read this &quot;classic&quot; and just be glad it wasn't &quot;war and peace&quot;; that's even longer."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"It's just typical. Long, and wordy, and oh, so dramatic, but if you love the Russians, you'll love Anna K. Lots of panting, and off stage bodice ripping, but also a back story about politics and a wonderful subplot about living in the Russian countryside that gives it just enough of a break from the drama. This is my second copy (I wore out the first) and am still not sure I like Anna, but I do oh-so-like some of the other characters. In the end, it's worth your time."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"Spoiler Alert!: In this summary/review I try to give a description of some of the characters in the novel and some topics you will find in it as well. There might be more information than you want to know, although I try to keep it as vague as possible. However, do stop reading here if you want to start the book with a blank slate, which I highly recommend you do.Anna Karenina has been regarded for a long time as one of the --if not THE--greatest novel of all time. While there are many classical novels I have yet to read, this book has set a very high standard. I have to admit it took me a while to finish reading this novel but every time I picked up the book I was immensely captivated by the development of plot, and the evolution of each of its characters. You'll see the changes that the Anna Karenina goes through in which you as the reader are a bit unsure if she is the heroine or the villain. If anything, I think she transitions from one to the other. But, by using the word villain, I don't mean it in its natural definition, because I don't believe her intentions were borne out of malice but more out of desperation with her situation and due to a deteriorating condition.Then there is the other protagonist of the novel in intellectual Levin. The man is so conflicted with questions about his purpose in life, not just society, but in general. He has questions regarding religion, the education system in 19th century Russia, the role of peasants, the working class, and the nobility. Throughout the entire novel you see his character trying to find answers or at least an understanding to the important topics that roamed his mind. There is the juxtaposition between Anna Karenina and Levin but there are also similarities between them, especially when it comes to love and doing what they consider is fair and right in their own way.It is a great novel to read and I recommend it to absolutely everyone. There may be times when you put the book down for an indefinite amount of time like I did, but when you pick it up again, and once you finished it, you'll be glad you read it."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"This translation sucks! Just kidding! I just love when I read a classic and I look at negative reviews, it's always about the translation. As if we all have the energy to read several translations of these great books. Go to the origional russian if your that picky, sheesh. I could be wrong but it just seems those people are trying to show us how superior they are. So for the rest of us laymen here's my review.I don't feel even worthy of writing a review on this book. It's like asking \\"what's your opinion of life?\\", well that question is so broad you'd have to narrow it down to \\"in what regard\\". That is what this book is like, life itself, if an alien wanted one book that would sum up humanity it would be Anna Karenina. Most people would focus on the title character and her story and narrow it down to a love story in victorian society (victorian in the larger societal sence of the word, not specific to england). That's a mistake because this book is about everything, about love, hate, birth, death, politics, religion, philosophy, forgiveness and an ever changing world in which the old morals and customs clash with the new progressive attitudes. Sound familiar? Yes just like the times we live in. That is why this book is so relatable cause even though the times change, styles, governing system, cultures, and social mores, one thing that never changes is human nature.(I must be a reactionary, is the responce of a certain type reading this. you know who you are!)Anyway for those wanting specifics, I'd say the books main focus is the juxtaposition of Anna and Levin who take differing paths toward happiness. Don't forget after 900 pages to reread the 1st page, a bible quote \\"Vengeance is mine; I will repay,\\" saith the Lord -Romans 12:19. So as not to spoil the book for anyone who hasn't read it yet I'll just say this, one character searchs for happiness in the now, goes for the quick fix, the sensual, chases after love, a nobal goal for sure, but destroys the lives of at least four people in the process. The other character really wants to do what is right and good but it's hard to tell what that even is in those changing times. This makes this character misserable in the short term but eventualy finds love and contentment and even God in the end."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"Anna Karinina makes a bad choice in marriage and tries to make up for it by abandoning her husband and child and running off with young cavalry officer Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky.

I'm sure it will take me a while to complete it but I am taking my time and absorbing every word."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"Dostoevsky hailed the novel as a great masterpiece. Of course I concur. Stiva and Dolly Oblonsky quarrelled. Stiva headed a government department. His post had been obtained through the influence of his brother-in-law, Alexey Karenin. Konstantin Levin had been Stiva's close friend since boyhood Levin was in love with Dolly's sister, Kitty Shcherbatsky. The Shcherbatskys were a cultured aristocratic family. Levin was in love with the whole family. Levin learns from Oblonsky that Vronsky is a rival for Kitty's hand. Levin asks her to marry him and she declines. He is mortified.When Anna Karenina visited Moscow, husband and wife, Dolly and Stiva, were reconciled and Kitty was infatuated. Anna became the eighteen year old's model. Then Kitty becomes heartbroken at the ball when Vronsky asks Anna to dance the mazurka with him. Anna cuts short her visit to avoid running into Vronsky again, but Vronsky, it seems, is a passenger on the same train she takes to return to Petersburg. There is foreboding, Anna return to Petersburg with a shadow-- Vronsky. There is also the accidental death of a man by falling onto the tracks taking place as she arrives in Moscow for her visit to the Oblonskys. Finally, there is the death of Vronsky's horse. Subsequently Anna meets Vronsky everywhere and Karenin can do nothing.Notable is Tolstoy's realism. When Oblonsky visits Levin on his country estate, (he is negotiating to sell wood from a parcel owned by Dolly), the food and atmosphere and the lives of the peasant workers are described. The social classes are portrayed with understanding and precision. In fact, two characters in the novel, Levin and Dolly, draw closer to the peasants when they are in the country. Religious practices are described. The financial circumstances of Vronsky are reviewed. (He is stalled in his career as a cavalry captain.) The advanced social set is pictured, along with the unseemly ways of its members. Tolstoy uses irony. The characters read English and French novels, (and play English games, croquet, the steeplechase), and use knives to cut the pages.ANNA KARENINA is two stories, that of Levin and that of Anna. In that respect it resembles DANIEL DERONDA. Do the stories support each other? Well, in a way they do, and both intersect with the Oblonskys. Levin and Anna are two aspects of their creator, Leo Tolstoy. On the one hand there is the reformer, the spiritual philosopher, (and conscientious landowner), and on the other the excessively loving social creature, a product of the environment.This may well be the best novel ever written. A contender for such a designation is WAR AND PEACE, but this is better art in its sophistication and harmonious, finely-balanced construction. I envy people who are reading ANNA KARENINA for the first time."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"I loved the book I got here, Anna Karenina. This is a timeless classic by Leo Tolstoy about a woman torn by the decisions of her past and the confines of society and their affect on her happiness and her family. There is also a sub story about socialism, communism, and the rights of the people and peasants in Russia. The main point of the story, is that Anna had an affair with someone that she actually loved- the reader is left with the question, \\"Were her actions justified?\\" There is a lot of wonderful symbolism in this book, as is seen by the metaphor of the train throughout it. While many would enjoy it, it is a fairly difficult read with some dry passages so I would recommend this to people over the age of 17 who have an interest in women's rights and politics. The story was engaging, though it may not be appropriate for anyone under the age of 13 as there are some thematic adult elements. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has an interest in politics, sociology, literature, philosophy, or questioning the ties in society that bind us down. This was a fascinating novel on the affects that society can have on one lone woman and what a single decision can do to her and to her reputation. Anna Karenina is a timeless classic not just because of its engaging story line but because of the reflections of what Anna felt that we can see in our own lives today."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"Anna Karenina. She was an amazing woman. But no less amazing than the other characters in the novel. Tolstoy was a brilliant man and writer. He knows how to blend plot and thought like few others. After reading his novels, I am convinced that he was a keen observer of human nature and interactions. I believe he must have spent hours reflecting on why people act in the way they do. And the result, clear and penetrating novels on the human experience.I highly recommend this novel. I feel enriched for having read something so well written. Just the way that Tolstoy mixes words leaves me with a feeling of awe. This novel is much more direct than War and Peace. He left his characters out of his writing in War and Peace, while he digressed about other topics. In this novel, digression sometimes happens in his dealings with Levin, but not as frequently as in War and Peace. The novel is great, the plot is fantastic. I see similarities to War and Peace everywhere. Natasha and Kitty. Levin and Nikolay. Tolstoy's dislike of the medical profession."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"Many themes of Anna Karenina are timeless: marriage, infidelity, the roles of men and women, personal fulfillment, honor, spirituality, and naturalism. If that isn't enough, then Tolstoy offers an 18th-century look at Russian society and culture, still well before the run-up to the revolution. Don't look to Tolstoy for enlightened feminism, although one of the characters argues for education and equality for women, and one of the minor threads relates to the status of peasants.Tolstoy is not especially subtle in portraying his characters, full of emotion and conflict. Nobody is idealized, yet all still prompt some sympathy. The main characters are so richly drawn. Anna's decline was inevitable, but it's the loss of someone far from pure evil, with her significant talents and deep capacity for love.Read Brothers Karamazov and Anna K at around the same time, as I did, and you'll get an excellent opportunity to compare two of the greatest Russian novelists head-to-head. Two thousand pages well spent."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"\\"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\\" That line opens and sets the tone of \\"Anna Karenina,\\" a tangled and tragic tale of nineteenth century Russia. Tolstoy's story of lovers and family is interlaced with razor-sharp social commentary and odd moments that are almost transcendent. In other words, this is a masterpiece.When Stepan Oblonsky has an affair with the governess, his wife says that she's leaving him, and now the family is about to disintegrate. Stepan's sister Anna arrives to smooth over their marital problems, and consoles his wife Dolly until she agrees to stay. But on the train there, she met the outspoken Countess Vronsky, and the countess's dashing son, who is semi-engaged to Dolly's sister Kitty.Anna and Vronsky start to fall in love -- despite the fact that Anna has been married for ten years, to a wealthy husband she doesn't care about, and has a young son. Even so, Anna rejects her loveless marriage and becomes the center of scandal and public hypocrisy, and even becomes pregnany by Vronsky. As she prepares to jump ship and get a divorce, Anna becomes a victim of her own passions...That isn't the entire story, actually -- Tolstoy weaves in other plots, about disintegrating families, new marriages, and the melancholy Levin's constant search for God, truth, and goodness. Despite the grim storyline about adultery, and the social commentary, there's an almost transcendent quality to some of Tolstoy's writing. It's the most optimistic tragic book I've ever read.For some reason, Tolstoy called this his \\"first novel,\\" even though he had already written some before that. Perhaps it's because \\"Anna Karenina\\" tackles so many questions and themes, and does so without ever dropping the ball. No wonder it's so long and imposing -- Tolstoy covered a lot of ground in here.And while \\"Anna Karenina\\" was not the first book he wrote, it is probably the deepest and most moving. Tolstoy steeps the book in social commentary, and his personal philosophies. It's also one of those books that takes a very long time to move itself forward -- Tolstoy's writing is slow and ponderous, with a lot of serious discussion about religion and relationships. But his intense, slightly rough writing is worth it.In some tragic books, you get the feeling that the author really despises his characters, and doesn't really care what happens to them. Tolstoy never gives you that feeling -- no matter how annoying his characters are, they always have something interesting or endearing. No caricatures at all -- even Anna's irritating, arrogant brother is given some quirks to make him seem real.Oddly enough, the most moving character here is not Anna, but Konstantin Levin -- the tortured, passionate landowner is so earnest that it's difficult not to care about him. Apparently he was Tolstoy's alter ego, which explains his depth. But Anna and Vronsky are strong leads, a passionate pair who are both selfish and seductive, but never boring.A beautiful look at living right vs. living wrong, \\"Anna Karenina\\" is a truly magnificent book. This book is undoubtedly Tolstoy's opus, and a stunning look at human nature."},{"Title":"Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics)","review":"This 80000000000000000000 page &quot;book&quot; isn't just boring and depressing, it's frighteningly so. Tolstoy wasn't just writing a boring book, he was trying to convince us that life is boring and dull. He deliberably avoids any sort of plot developement that might spark the slightest shread of joy, excitement, or even mild interest (One might point out Anna's collision with the train, but I did not find this interesting. It was malevolent, sad, and in the context of the rest of the book, spooky in an ill-defined sort of way, but it was not interesting.) He has here milked life of all it's flavor and left us a soggy tale to digest. It's no wonder that Levin finds himself retiring into morbid preoccupations with his own death, feeling himself unable to enjoy anything in his life. This whole novel seems to have been generated in such a pessimistic mood. In the preface to my edition (which gives an account of the history of Tolstoy's progress on the novel, and amazingly manages to surpass the novel's dullness with its rediculous redundancies about the dates of Leo's stops and starts on the novel.) Tolstoy is quoted, &quot;if only someone would finish Anna Karenina for me.&quot; The writer himself was bored with this pulseless corpse of a book. No one does anything in this book, and barely anything happens. Levin spends a whole constipated summer with Kitty living down the road from him, and aside from accidentally passing her carriage on the road one morning, absolutely NOTHING becomes of this. Characters have to be sent out into the woods to shoot at birds for lack of anything better to do. Newlyweds are made to spend continuous chapters at a dying man's bedside just so the author can make sure that the slightest fly-speck of happiness isn't allowed admittance to the musty cell where this crap was composed. Several scenes are bungled and character's are often left without discernable motivation. Why does Anna fall for Vronsky? Who knows. They have hardly said four words to each other in print before they end up in bed together. Everything else that proceeds their consumation must have happened off stage somewhere. As far as the final pages of the book, where Levin discovers &quot;faith&quot;, some weak-headed folks might find this inspiring, but I was disgusted. Levin's epiphany is less about faith as it is about giving Tolstoy an oppurtunity to spit in the face of reason. (As an illustration of what goes through a person's mind when turning to faith, I think it unintentionally sheds a lot of light on all the disgusting rationalizations a person is making in such a moment.) Why this book is considered a classic, and what sort of enlightment and enjoyment anyone is expected to get out of it, is beyond me. It must appeal to some masochistic element that makes people feel that the revolting boredom that this book induces is somehow their fault and their duty to overcome, (like the guilt people feel in church when the preacher makes them drowsy.) Tolsoy, of course, was a realist and he argued, in effect, that that he was protraying life without &quot;implausable&quot; flights of imagination or wildly extrodinary people or events. But a life without flights of imagination or extrodinary events is not worth living, (nor is it, in my experience, very realistic.)

Girl cheates onhusband. Girl loses child and then grows depressed. Girl commits suicide. Pretty basic plot. For all the time put into reading it, over half the book focouses on the politics and irrelevent views. I think the initial story line was a hook to make us end up reading about Levin, a thinly disguised alias of Tolstoy and his personal views. Tolsoty should have named this book: &quot;The Personal Struggle of a Man Named Levin&quot;. If you have not read too many classics, try something else first (ie. a Robert Louis Stevenson book). Tolstoy's descriptions of life make for lovely reading but are self-indulged. (Don't forget that authors were payed by the word!!) Anna is a selfish creature and very irresponsible. However, you get to know the characters after a while and do feel a sense of loss when the story finally ends. Either read this book in small incriments or be increadibly disciplined.

Girls would make up excuses to leave him of their dance cards.His revenge for the terror of his childhood? This book is he revenge for his childhood. What is the plot, the plot is about an amiable dodo (read Tolstoy) who flounces around and is unlucky in love. What happens in the end he finds true love.

But for most people who have extreme difficulty with women -- as opposed to those who at least have occasional success -- truly understanding our inner working and how we came to be this way is paramount to overcoming the obstacles. How can you defeat fear if you don't know where it comes from? Well, maybe some people can brainwash themselves, but not lonely, introverted, critical thinkers. And that's where this book stands out. The author offers keen insight into fear and shame and how they evolve throughout our lives, and in particular, in those early formative years. In fact, the first few chapters of this book may as well have been my autobiography! (Although he hardly mentions religion, which in my case, was a significant contributor to my self-defeating attitude and behavior.)I also appreciate his approach to courting women (as opposed to \\"picking up\\" women). Most other programs advocate manipulation (\\"negs\\" or \\"cocky-funny\\" etc.), sneeking under the radar (\\"ask her opinion on something\\" or \\"talk to her friends while actually ignoring her a bit\\" etc.), and other \\"techniques\\" that basically only work in crowded, trendy bars and strip clubs, because they ignore the essential nature of the mating game -- we present ourselves, they choose. This is a powerful perspective because it is universal among organisms that reproduce sexually. This perspective is in stark contrast to the banter that most other pickup artists employ that only describes certain limited social characteristics of certain species. Consequently, while other programs advocate gimmicks to \\"beat the system,\\" Pilinski acknowledges the hard truths (like the shortcomings of being short, or the fact that you will not bed every chick you hit on no matter what Mystery-Cocky-Funny-Hypnosis-whatever methods you use) and instead focuses on the natural dance of courtship. For example, most guys still struggle with women when using the aforementioned methods because these methods all skip the fundamental first \\"step\\" -- eye contact. Sure, they give you \\"rules\\" for making eye contact, like \\"don't look away until she looks away\\" or \\"move in on the third look.\\" But then they drown you in \\"approaches\\" that have you butting into other people's space uninvited. Hence the shenanigans.This is not a book for the so-called \\"average frustrated chump\\" (or AFC in geek-speak) who's looking for that 100%-fail-safe-money-back-guaranteed method.This book is for guys who are grounded in reality, not kung-fu pickup artist fantasies. This book is for the highly intelligent, creative, wonderful guys out there who find themselves paralyzed by shame and fear and thoroughly naive and ignorant in the mating game. This is for guys who simply want to feel like human beings, not pimps."},{"Title":"Without Embarrassment: The Social Coward's Totally Fearless Seduction System","review":"I read the ebook version that Mike sells. When I bought it, I was a complete loser with women. (Since then I've gotten much better.) I can without hesitation say that Without Embarrassment was absolutely a godsend for me. My problem used to be that I reeked of a low-status male. I was the classic guy who was dumped on, who acted way too nice to everybody. Mike explains how to cure your low status craving for the approval of others, but at the same time how to display high status without becoming a jerk.Plus Mike gives some tips and techniques for how to get women to be attracted to you.When I got Without Embarrassment, I read it over a 2-day marathon. (It's a long book.) It helped my improvement tremendously.Now, a definite disclaimer about this book: it is NOT for guys who are already good with girls. If you've already got a lot of self-confidence, then you're better off getting more advanced books.

The author doesn't brag but admits his failures and how he dealt with them.The book is huge and has a lot of information and detail.Since I went to an all-boys high school I did not get a chance to learn dating skills and how to deal with the opposite sex, so I found the book especially useful in improving my social skills.I've read the book twice already because there is so much in it, that I missed a few things the first time.Thank you Mike Pilinski!"},{"Title":"Without Embarrassment: The Social Coward's Totally Fearless Seduction System","review":"I think a lot of the bad reviews here are from dudes who are already good with girls. When I got this book, I was painfully shy, and I credit this book for helping me break out of that."},{"Title":"Without Embarrassment: The Social Coward's Totally Fearless Seduction System","review":"This is one of the better books on dating. Michael Pilinski speaks directly to the social coward. Never have I read a dating book that speaks squarely to its intended audience. He only mentions problems the social coward is likely to experience (nervousness, anxiety, self consciousness), defines it, and destroys that belief system. The beauty of the book comes from Michael Pilinski's empathy for the social coward, as he claims to have been one himself. This book deals with the issues preventing shy men from dating, so you won't find too much on the opposite sex."},{"Title":"Without Embarrassment: The Social Coward's Totally Fearless Seduction System","review":"This book is one of the best of not THE best self improvement book ever written. The author is honest enough to reveal some of his failures and experiences.Author speaks to readers in a manner of a friend speaking to a friend rather than being a teacher which makes it easier for reader to connect with the author on equal level. On top of that, the author seems to be genuine in his effort to help rather than try to sell as much book as possible which make the information in this book a trustworthy source of inspiration.The BEST self improvement book I'd read so far!"},{"Title":"Without Embarrassment: The Social Coward's Totally Fearless Seduction System","review":"I have a background in Psychology and I studied several classics such as Freud, Jung, Kubler-Ross etc. When I picked up Without Embarrassment my expectations were low, instead I was pleasantly surprised: from cover to cover this book is full of intelligent perspectives about the male/female relationship and the attraction between sexes, all told with a sparkling sense of humor. This book is practical, subtle, and it's miles ahead of all the \\"alpha male\\" kind of unrealistic books that you can find around.I can't praise \\"Without Embarrassment\\" highly enough, and I just wish I had read it much earlier. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Without Embarrassment: The Social Coward's Totally Fearless Seduction System","review":"I loved this book. It is officially now one of my favorite reads. You know you're enjoying something when you don't want it to end. This is how I felt with reading Without Embarrassment: The Social Coward's Totally Fearless Seduction System.This book that Michael Piliniski wrote will help most, men, who are normal but for whatever reasons have psychological flaws like being shy, having fear, being ashamed, possessing low self-esteem, or being afraid of rejection and as a result deathly afraid to approach women for courtship and thus void of having a girlfriend or life-partner.My \\"powerful loner\\"(coined by Pilinski) shame hates me for admitting this but I am one of those guys I described above with the flaws. I just finished reading the book so I haven't had the chance try everything Pilinski says you do but I can already tell his common sense approach and methods does work. One of the things Pilinski say men must do, is dress nice and look stylish, just to initially attract women and you know what, it works! I always had a sense for dressing stylish and cool but for a long time now just dressed down and typically looked plain because subconsciously that was how I felt about myself, not realizing, I was projecting a low-status male image to women everywhere.Now that I am more confident, better informed on men/women courtship, and enjoy dressing stylish...guess what? I'm getting more women checking me out. That is not something that was happening before I read Without Embarrassment and before I started dressing nice and being more conscious and aware of things around me and myself.This is only one small example how this book has helped me improve my life.Thank You Michael Pilinski."},{"Title":"Without Embarrassment: The Social Coward's Totally Fearless Seduction System","review":"I found this book gave me a deep understanding of all the steps that he describes. He prefers to describe a few technics and ideas, but they are of a profound value and he elaborates a lot about it so you have a very deep understanding of it. I would say it is definitely for BEGINNER to INTERMEDIATE level of expertise... , but it is the BEST to have!"},{"Title":"Without Embarrassment: The Social Coward's Totally Fearless Seduction System","review":"I was with my wife for 8 years (faithfully I might add) before my marriage failed miserably leaving me with some confidence issues and very very single. I felt out of practice on dating and the game seems to have changed considerably since I was a freshman in college. I have read many books in this genera since then, and it has helped me allot with confidence in general as well as specifics on dating. This book without Embarrassment and :Secrets of the A Game: How to Meet and Attract Women Anywhere, Anyplace, Anytimeare two books that stand out to me in this genera as being particularly well done. Neither are really PUA manuals, while the tools are there, but ultimately about being a man and helped me to realize some of the things I needed to work on. I wish that I knew back then what I know now. Consider getting an e-reader, I like mine and it has paid for itself with just a few e-books."},{"Title":"Without Embarrassment: The Social Coward's Totally Fearless Seduction System","review":"I tried to approach the book with an open mind. However, from the start, the author engaged in a number of irritating, unfunny, worthless, and just counterproductive insults and mind-reading of his audience. He couches all of his concepts in extreme black and white thinking (e.g. Either be a chest beating alpha-male or a wimp) and says things that simply aren't correct (You are either in the platonic zone or the romantic zone with a woman. Make the choice now because it will never change!\\") Mr. Pilinski makes a number of grand pseudo-psychological claims about men and women that are based on the a fore mentioned black or white thinking (as well as observations and junk-science pulled from his backside), and gives advice that can be picked up for free elsewhere without so many hilarious \\"Jokes\\" that he makes as asides to his armchair psychology masturbating.Mr. Pilinski's claims that you are either an alpha male or a beta male, a strong, dominant tough guy or a pathetic wimp, that women are basically computers that you can manipulate by following a script are classic PUA BS in disguise. He condescends to the audience, puffs off his chest, and makes claims that you have to possess a laundry list of characteristics or you will never be a desirable, alpha male. I spent 9.99 on this book, and sighed, laughed out loud, cringed, and was disgusted by the author as a person, his world-view, and his hack, cliche a minute writing style that seems like it was written for idiots looking to be told by the \\"master\\" on how to behave with these mysterious \\"creatures\\" (author's term) known in the urban jungle as... women.My biggest regret, besides paying 10 bucks for a junk product, is that it is an e-book, so I cannot burn it to release the evil demons within! Putrid writing, filled with buzz words, cliches, unfunny jokes, wacky anecdotes, and tons of contradictory advice marketed to people with zero experience with women. Please Mister ever-so-tough, omniscient, alpha dominant male that will eat all those wimps and inferior men for dinner along with his steak the size of a skateboard, tell us more! Avoid, avoid like the plague. One star is generous. You asked for a review? You got it!"},{"Title":"Without Embarrassment: The Social Coward's Totally Fearless Seduction System","review":"Well, this review is gonna be short. I read over 25 dating books (ofcourse probably all of the ones that you can easily find here by searching) and watched about a dozen DVD seminars - and I find this book among the best materials hands down (out of like 3~4 top ones). Hands Down. The dating other books I found were SHALLOW, ROUTINE BASED, and LEFT STUFF OUT for additional sales. Not this book. It was such a bulls-eye kind of a dating book that everything he said stuck like a glue in my mind.

I perused one or two of the other books when they came out, years after Mr. Pilinski's. But \\"Beyond Embarrassment...\\" is to me not only the first, but still the best, of the genre. After much informal \\"field testing\\", I can say that the tenets of the book do hold true, and gave me and my buddies many fun times to look back upon. In a different phase of my life at this point, I note that the book instilled in me an interest in social biology and psychology that I still enjoy.Mr. Pilinski handles a subject of interest to all guys at some point (admit it or not) with a mixture of good, funny writing, straight-on accuracy, and class. If you're interested in the topic, I cannot recommend this book enough. I'd like to shake the author's hand for a job well done."},{"Title":"Without Embarrassment: The Social Coward's Totally Fearless Seduction System","review":"This book is full of useful information/insights. You don't have to be a social coward or awkward with women to benefit from this text. Parts of the book were a rehash of some things I already knew, but then I found some real &#34;gems&#34; of advice sprinkled through out the text. Doesn't matter if you are 18 and new to the seduction game, or 60 and trying to freshen up on your skills; this book is worth the read."},{"Title":"Without Embarrassment: The Social Coward's Totally Fearless Seduction System","review":"I read this book about ten years ago when it first came out and it literally did nothing for me. I don't know what book these other positive reviewers read, but it couldn't have been the same book I read. I have a feeling they may be either paid or related to the author. I can assure you I am not affiliated with this guy in any way, nor am I biased either way. I am simply a regular guy telling it as I see it.I hate to give a bad review, but this book is just so bad and there are so many other better ones available.

Wish i could get my money back."},{"Title":"Return of the Exile (Dragonlance: Linsha Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"At the start of this trilogy I greatly disliked Linsha, I thought she was annoying, boring, and not well developed in a literary sense. By the end of the second book however, I had begun to consider this trilogy fairly good. At the end of this book I learned that this trilogy gets proggresivley better as it goes on.The third installment of this trilogy begans with Linsha going to the Tarmack homeland, and the new life that ensues there. This part of the book is particularly intersting to me because it shows us a whole new light to Linsha during her struggles to live in an alien society. After a daring escape on the back of a sickly dragon, Linsha sets about getting back the stolen dragon eggs.Overall I was very pleased with the plot and continuation of the story. I feel that Mary Herbert is definitley one of the better DL authors as of now. Linsha's character is fleshed out more in this novel then the other two. We get to see a kind of darker side to her when she battles and kills a rival woman on Tamrak homeland.The ending of the novel is very good, particularly because it is not like most of its other new DL counterparts, were the ending is scrunched into 30 pages in a sudden climax. Slowly throughout the book the tension increases, with the climax taking place near Sanction in a dormant volcano. No big suprises in the end really happens but that doesnt make it any less fun. I'll spare revealing the ending to you but I practically jumped for joy when a certain character kicks the bucket.Overall this book was very good, and in all actuallity it suprised me just how good it was. It ranks in my top 20 for DL books at this point in time. Even if you are dissapointed with the current state of DL books, this book delivers in so many ways."},{"Title":"Return of the Exile (Dragonlance: Linsha Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"This was a trilogy of books that I went into with a little bit of reluctance. Linsha Majere a Rose Knight, something that is a recent addition for the Majere household. However, this entire trilogy is awesome. There are unique characters, which have good story lines, and the ending I find, personally to be completely awesome."},{"Title":"Return of the Exile (Dragonlance: Linsha Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"If you like Dragonlance and good strong female warriors, this book is great; this triology is great."},{"Title":"Return of the Exile (Dragonlance: Linsha Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"I have read most of the Dragonlance books and like all other series/trilogy's I end up wanting more. It might just be me but I hate when I have to put down the last book in a trilogy. Grrrrrrrrr"},{"Title":"Return of the Exile (Dragonlance: Linsha Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"Return of the Exile, by Mary Herbert is the third and final book in the Dragonlance: Linsha Trilogy.All the loose ends that were created in the first two books are nicely wrapped up. The way Herbert concludes this trilogy is just fantastic. I was enthralled the entire time I was reading this. The first book in this series was a good read, the second book was decent, but this book blows the doors off of either of the first two. It's a fantastic book and one I would recommend to anyone.Mary Herbert has staked her clain to the Dragonlance world with this trilogy. She certainly stands above a lot of the recent sub-par books that have been released. Rest asured this book is int he upper teir of recent Dragonlance novels."},{"Title":"100 Simple Secrets of Happy Families: What Scientists Have Learned and How You Can Use It (100 Simple Secrets Series)","review":"This book is a pleasant and inspirational read. It's a good book to pick up and put down, as each chapter is independent of one another and takes only a few minutes to read. I question its claim that it is based upon \\"the research of noted scientists,\\" as a quick scan of its reference pages show that a high percentage of the studies cited come from doctoral dissertations. Hardly the stuff that \\"sociologists, therapists, and psychiatrists have spent entire careers investigating\\".I questioned some of the more startling claims made by Dr. Niven based upon some of these dissertations, but even going to the universities' websites, I was unable to obtain copies of the original papers in order to determine the accuracy of his interpretation, and indeed of the studies themselves. A search of the authors of the dissertations did not indicate that they had gone on in any way to distinguish themselves in their field.So, that being said, I have found it an enjoyable book to read, but one that I will not be relying upon for necessarily accurate information or statistics. I give it a 4 for enjoyment and a 2 for credible research."},{"Title":"100 Simple Secrets of Happy Families: What Scientists Have Learned and How You Can Use It (100 Simple Secrets Series)","review":"Short chapters with nuggets of truth about family life. Not real profound stuff but the chapters end with a result from a research study. However, not real impressed with the correlations made because they do not indicate cause and effect. For example people who receive a large inheritance are less likely than others to be satified with life. This statistic alone can be misleading because it does not say that the reason for this dissatisfaction is due to getting the inheritance but that there is a correlation. It is an easy read but not real inspiring."},{"Title":"100 Simple Secrets of Happy Families: What Scientists Have Learned and How You Can Use It (100 Simple Secrets Series)","review":"I have enjoyed every title by this author, and this one is no less.

I don't like to think about gurus sitting around in a cave somewhere dreaming things up. Niven's series of books offers substance to what he offers. Empirical studies aren't a sure thing, but they're a lot better than most of what's out there on the market. Families have never been an easy puzzle to figure out, but this book takes us up the mountain.I'd recommend this to anyone who is in a family and is open to new ideas. Great read."},{"Title":"Crystal Raine","review":"I know Deb personally, so was thrilled when she said she was getting a story published.

I've always liked fantasy, and would rate this up there with a number of the David Eddings, Anne McCaffery and Robin McKinley books I've read over the years. I can only say that I fully intend to get a copy and it will be a book that I will read to my kids (when I have them) as they grow older. WELL DONE!!"},{"Title":"Crystal Raine","review":"To be honest, I picked it up out of curiousity and then couldn't put it down!

It's very fun, and you'll love it!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Christmas Carol is a story of social conscious, where wrongs are righted and kindness prevails. Set in a time much like today: where poverty is widespread, being of the middle class is popular and a small population holds a large potion of the wealth. Social class dictates life, most lifetimes are spent in a single class and there is seldom movement within the classes. The characters of Dickens novel live, and for the most part, thrive in this environment. They trust in the Lord and their fellowman; during this Christmas season they are charitable and kind, with the exception of Ebenezer Scrooge. He is a cold, heartless man with no compassion or sentiment. He hates Christmas and refuses to give any portion of his wealth to the needy and less fortunate. Scrooge is a cheap man, who doesn&#65533;t trust banks, so he heats both his home and office with one small fire, keeps his money in a safe and counts it regularly. It is the only pleasure he allows himself. He is also a lonely man; his business partner, the closest thing he had to a friend, died seven years ago and he has disowned his one remaining relative.The life of his office clerk, Bob Cratchit, is entirely different. Bob works from dawn until dusk for a poor fifteen shillings a week, and is only begrudgingly given Christmas Day off. Despite this, Bob is a happy man. He has a loving wife, six beautiful children and a warm, cozy home. The Cratchits where not happy with their situation, &#65533;but they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another and contented with the time.&#65533;The lives of Scrooge and the Cratchits are permanently interlocked after the three ghosts pay Scrooge a visit. His journeys with them and the realizations he comes to, leave him a redeemed man. He changes his behavior, vows to amend the wrongs he has done, but he is not a totally new man. Although Scrooge donates his money to the less fortunate and spends his time with the Cratchits, his actions are purely to appease his conscience. His motivation is to make himself to feel better and to prove that he has not lost all the decent qualities he has when he was younger.Charles Dickens wrote this novel, his shortest, for the sole purpose of making money to support his family. He had several wives and many children; he spent most of his life living like Bob Cratchit, barley making bills and struggling to get his work noticed. A Christmas Carol was Dickens best selling novel, his intention was for his story to be popular, which it was, but he also added elements that would dig at the emotions of his peers. His depiction of a poor family at Christmas has become a tradition for years, and every Christmas someone reads his story and gives something of themselves to help make Christmas a better holiday for others."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I love this book and all its movie versions.

Yes, they're all A Christmas Carol, but some of them are from people who tried to read the book, and didn't like it, or got a badly formatted Kindle version, etc...What I bought, and what I want to review is the Signature Performance audio book read by Tim Curry. I already loved his work, but even if you're not familiar with him, his reading of this classic is wonderful.I admit I had a hard time for a few moments, not picturing him in a French maid's costume, or a concierge uniform, but that's my problem, not yours.This is a fantastic reading; Curry inflects every character perfectly. Thoroughly enjoyed this, and plan to listen to it every Christmas. Love it!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"To borrow from Dickens and A Christmas Carol: \\"An intelligent book...a remarkable book...What a delightful book!\\"I got this book at the \\"Dickens on the Strand\\" festival in Galveston, TX, in December 2012. The book is all the more special because it was signed by Dickens' g-g-granddaughter and g-g-g-grandaughter, who were special guests that weekend.The illustrations are excellent and really bring the story - and, especially, the characters - to life.And the story! Oh, what a story! I think my favorite aspect is the descriptions of the characters and settings. As a morality tale, it is so interesting that there is very little sermonizing. The three ghosts do not jibber jabber...they let Scrooge come to his own realization by placing him in situations where he can see and contemplate his own actions. The most biting part is when his own cruel words are turned on him. But other characters, too, act without charity, and if we don;t see ourselves in Scrooge and his outlandish meanness, perhaps we can see ourselves in the minor characters and their snide remarks, and improve ourselves on that account. While Tiny Tim seems to be the iconic character of The book, I actually like several others more, including the nephew, Fred; Fezziwig and his family; and the folks who stole the very curtains and clothes from Scrooge on his deathbed - their behavior was atrocious but their characterization was superb!This book capped off a year when I read two other Dickens works - Bleak House and Great Expectations for the first time. I plan to read more of him next year and will once again end with the Carol.Merry Christmas!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I finished this just before midnight on the 25th.

This is an advanced book. Although it is family friendly, it's not something I would suggest reading to a child because I don't think they would be able to keep up for the most part. You would constantly have to explain the meaning of many words. A good book for high school age and up.Although the words portrayed in A Christmas Carol give you a sense of cheer and you can easily see the grump that Scrooge is, there is a 'hidden' message that you will find in the second half of this book. Christmas is not just about good cheer or being neighborly. It's about overcoming your personal 'demons' and being stronger than your issues. Choosing to be joyful as opposed to being sorry for yourself.I'm rambling.

Unfortunately, I did not read it until I was well into my adulthood. My review will focus on aspects of the story from that angle.The initial part of the story provides the reader with a portrait of Ebenezeer Scrooge that is a little overdone and a bit comical. I can only say that it came across as being a bit 'corny.'The best part of the story lies in its middle chapters, where Mr. Scrooge receives upon himself several visitors during the night. As a reader you feel drawn into the lives of the families that are visited and you find yourself caring for them rather quickly.The payoff ends up being somewhat weak. It seems rushed and concluded rather a little too hastily. A slightly lengthier expansion of the final pages would have increased enjoyment of the story immensely.Still, even with such criticisms, I realize that the story will appeal to people of all ages, and have given the book a 5 star rating. I encourage parents to let their children enjoy this classic as soon as they think it is age appropriate and not view the book with a little bit of a cynical eye, as I myself might have had."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I will admit that, until now, I have never read \\"A Christmas Carol\\", but instead - like most Americans - have watched countless film and cartoon versions, from the wonderfully classic 1951 film version with Alstaire Sim and the Mister Magoo cartoon version to the most recent film incarnation starring Jim Carrey. Having just purchased a Kindle, I decided to take advantage of the free copy offered in the classics section of the Kindle site so I could finally read the actual Dickens tale. I was certainly not disappointed.I won't bother with a rehash of the story - who doesn't know this tale? - but will only say that I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I recommend to everyone that they put it on their \\"to read\\" list (it's a rather short story, I was surprised to discover). As an actor and filmmaker, I was particularly interested in comparing the story to the many film and cartoon versions I referenced above, and this has given me a new appreciation for those versions that were truer to the original, capturing the \\"right mood\\" and maintaining a sense of anticipation, fear, wonder, melancholy, and - ultimately - pure joy.You don't have to relegate your reading of this tale to Christmas time, so I encourage anyone who hasn't read it to do so. For those who have read it, it's worth a return visit."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I read Dickens' A Christmas Carol over the holiday. It was free to download on Kindle. Sadly, I don't believe I've ever read it before. I remember Great Expectations from high school (also free on Kindle), but honestly don't ever remember reading A Christmas Carol. It's another one of those classics I blame my teachers for cheating me on back when I should have been reading it, but a small town high school curriculum spent too much time on Shakespeare instead.All of us know the story. It's Christmas tradition, right? If you tried, you could probably tell a decent version of it out loud to the children at your Christmas party and do a pretty good job at it. First published in 1843, it's been a part of our American lives for a long time. Like I said before, it's tradition. Most of us know it from the big screen. If not the 1951 black and white version (also available colorized), you definitely saw the 1984 version with George C. Scott. The Muppets did it. Even Bill Murray spoofed it in 1988, a good spoof which is a classic in itself from the 80s.Community theatre groups have also embraced it and made it tradition on the stage. I was almost in a musical version myself back in high school, but it got canceled for some reason. I was cast in dual roles, one that I don't remember, but I was also going to be the Ghost of Christmas Future and I remember the director obsessing over how I should point. When I lived in Memphis, I went to see the annual production of it at Theatre Memphis. My point is, and I do have one, is how many of us can honestly say we first learned the timeless tale from the book itself. I know I didn't.It's like a really good memory that we embellish year after year for whatever reason, until sooner or later we forget how it actually happened. We're so numb to it. We've received more pleasure telling it our way, so why rediscover how it actually began, how it actually went, or what the truth is.That's exactly why I wanted to read it. It's there. Scrooge. Marley. Tiny Tim. The ghosts. All there. As I read, my brain played it out just like seeing it on the big screen, even some of the dialogue (including \\"God bless us, everyone!\\") was right there on the page. So, what does this tell us? Throughout history, we haven't changed it much. We've at least stayed true to it, not counting the Bill Murray version of course. I tried - very hard - not to picture versions of the characters I knew from the movies.Honestly, it's not very good writing in most places. Dickens loves to list things in order to describe them, like opening the thesaurus searching for a better word and deciding to just use them all. Case in point, when the Ghost of Christmas Present arrives he is sitting on a throne made from food. Dickens names almost every food there is. I'm paraphrasing here but it was a throne of ham, sausage, turkey, chicken, grapes, apples, bananas, oranges, pies, custards, puddings, bread, muffins, cakes, Reeses Peanut Butter Cups, M&Ms;, Yoplait Yogurt, Froot Loops, Candy Bars.... and this isn't the only place he does it. The children were happy, glad, gleeful, joyful, cheerful... bleggh! Some of the lists take up half a page or more!It was kind of like reading Shakespeare for the first time, be it Romeo and Juliet or Hamlet or whatever you read in high school, and your getting it. You are comprehending it okay, enough to know what it's about. But your really having to dig through the muck to find the parts that make sense. But overall, in the end, it does make sense. You found yourself scheming through it or focusing your attention elsewhere during parts, at least until you got to something you could understand. I didn't scheme through any of Christmas Carol - I read every damn word of it - but believe me, there were parts where I found myself slowly drifting off and thinking about something else.In the end, I felt no different than when I did before I read it. A sense of accomplishment? Perhaps. Now I can at least say I've read it. I know the truth, although everything I knew before wasn't much different. I want to question what makes this a classic, but I already know the answer.Time.So...I don't have much more to say about it. God bless us everyone!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is a fantastic edition of Charles Dickens' classic holiday story of Ebenezer Scrooge's transition from Miser to Man of the People. It is unabridged (original text that includes wonderful lines such as \\"solitary as an oyster\\") and bound well for a smaller paperback. An excellent edition for an unbeatable price! For a gift idea, tie these books with ribbon and gave them as gifts to coworkers, neighbors, and even as stocking stuffers; I did, and they were a terrific hit."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Yes, modern - and not so modern - media have bombarded us with version after version of this classic tale. Some have been good, some have been ridiculously horrible (e.g. Kelsey Grammer in a \\"musical version\\"....aaarrrrgghhh!!!). However, none of these forms have ever accurately conveyed the imagery so wonderfully as the original written text by Dickens. Though written some 150 years ago the mastery of the English language portrayed in the book can never be duplicated by video. Take for example Dicken's description of Scrooge as a \\"squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\\" Tremendous ! Or Scrooge's nephew Fred's description of the season as \\"a good time: a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time: the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely\\" The literary version also contains numerous snippets of marvelous text such as Dickens desciption of Scrooge waiting for the first spirit when he notes that Scrooge could \\" no more go to sleep than go to Heaven \\". Or when waiting for the second spirit that he was: \\"ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much\\". I know of no media version other than the written text which delivers these literary gems.In the book, Dickens notes that he is \\"standing in the spirit at your elbow\\". Do yourself a favor. Read the book ! Give Dickens a chance to spend some time in the spirit at your elbow and you thoroughly enjoy what he notes in the preface is a \\"Ghostly little book, to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me.

Each detail is described with simple clarity, from the horror of Marley returning from the grave to the humor of Scrooge's encounter with Bob Cratchit at the end of the story. Further, Dickens makes the characters as real people, and as the reader you can't help but get swept up in their lives and learn to love them, beginning with Scrooge's loving nephew Fred, and the innocent Tiny Tim, to the original \\"Grinch\\" himself, Mr. Scrooge.

May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.\\"~Charles Dickens, 1843.And so A CHRISTMAS CAROL has since its publication; it has never been out of print or truly out of fashion. It is the quintessential Christmas story and the easiest of Dickens books to read. The narrator introduces us to Mr. Scrooge, a man whose heart has turned to stone from ambition, care, avarice, and greed. We see him at his desk in Scrooge and Marley Money House dark and chilled since he is too tight fisted to permit decent coal fires and candles. He scorns everyone that visits his office Christmas Eve, especially his nephew, Fred. But when he finally gets home, the massive door knocker transforms into Marley's face and strangely lights the foggy dark night.But Marley specter follows Scrooge to his bed chamber with chains, locks, and money boxes wrapped about his transparent body. He means to save his friend the fate that he has endured since he died seven years ago on this very night. Three Ghosts will haunt Scrooge: The Ghost of Christmas Past, The Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come - whom looks much like Death. Through the lessons these specters will reveal, Scrooge has a chance to become a different man and employer and lead a different life.Scrooge's transformation is genuine as it is remarkable. Through Dickens's simple narration, we not only witness Scrooge change but we also feel his emotions. We cry at the possible demise of Tiny Tim and the true affection Fred has for his uncle. Scrooge on Christmas morning has rediscovered faith, hope, and charity and his heart is full of love for the season as well as his neighbors.

But taken just by itself, Charles Dickens' yuletide novella is a pretty bleak and bittersweet affair, with brilliant imagery and lots of ghostly weirdness.Scrooge is... well, a scrooge -- a professional miser who hates Christmas, goodwill, charity, puppies, kittens, his relatives, his employees, and virtually everything else except money.And on Christmas Eve, his dead partner Jacob Marley comes back, wrapped with supernatural chains, and claims that Scrooge is doomed to the same fate. But he has a chance at redemption: three ghosts representing will visit him that night, taking him on a guided tour of Christmases past, present and yet to come.So Scrooge is transported on a trio of hourlong trips through time. The childlike Ghost of Christmas Past takes him to his bleak childhood, when he was less jaded and hard. The jolly Ghost of Christmas Present takes him to people's homes on the very next morning, specifically of of his nephew and the poor miner Bob Cratchit. And finally a Ringwraith-like spirit gives him a glimpse of Christmas years in the future... a bleak and terrible future, unless he changes his ways.You can read plenty of symbolism into a story like \\"A Christmas Carol\\"; I've heard speculation about Dickens' father, the Industrial Revolution, spiritualism, and all sorts of other stuff. But at its heart, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the most powerful when appreciated for its story alone -- a story about a greedy, miserable man who redeems himself by learning to love all humanity.Dickens' writing is utterly brilliant here. Most of the book is bleak, grimy and painted in shadows, with Dickens only rarely holding back from showing the dark situation of England's poor. A great example is the symbolic children Want and Ignorance (\\"a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds\\"). As for the Grim-Reaperlike third ghost, it's the stuff of nightmares.But all isn't dark here. Occasionally Dickens splashes it with moments of crystalline brilliance (\\"It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and... its dress trimmed with summer flowers\\"). And as dark as the book is, Dickens offers hope for the future.He also does a brilliant job with Scrooge, \\" a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner!

Its written in a way that makes you feel like a kid and of course tries to teach you the real meaning of christmas.I would recommend it even to non christian readers because in some chapters makes you wonder about why we speak the way we do and you can extrapolate his lesson to be that every action has its consequences in others."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Who doesn't love A Christmas Carol?

It not only evokes the true sense of what Christmas should be about, but uses the message out of scriptures to empasize it beautifully.

It has some formatting issues. The page numbers from the print version appear at random places throughout the text of the Kindle version. The captions from the original illustrations appear, but the images themselves are not shown.The chapter headings are a bit misaligned, etc.But you get what you pay for, and I don&#8216;t intend to complain about a free version of this great story!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The Dover Thrift books are usually unabridged, and in a concise, compact paperback format.

Too much good stuff is left out. I prefer the unabridged Jim Dale version. My favorite is the unabridged cassette version read by Paul Scofield, but it seems to be out of print. If I could find that one on CD, I'd buy it in a heartbeat."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is a fabulous, UNabridged version of A Christmas Carol.

It's the most faithful adaptation I have ever seen of A Christmas Carol, which is one of my favourite novels.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The quintessential Christmas story read by Jim Dale with all the skill (and voices) with which he read the Harry Potter novels. Wonderful to listen to as you do your Christmas decorating or baking. I bought copies to give as gifts for several people this year."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The only thing wrong with this edition is they replaced the nifty picture of Jim Dale dressed as Scrooge with a silly illustration, but you don't have to look at the cover while you're listening. Jim Dale did a fantastic job reading Harry Potter, and he does just as well with Dickens. (I hope he'll do more books soon.) With the many voices, he really takes you to Victorian England where you feel the cold, sense the ghosts and smell the food. Everyone knows the story, so I won't review that. It was a bit of a tradition in our house to read the Carol outloud at Christmas. We will probably still do it because it's fun to try to do the voices yourself, but if I'm away from home on the holidays I know where I'll turn for a substitute. And what better way to pass the time as you drive to Gramma's?!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The best of Charles Dickens' work. Ebenezer Scrooge is a bloke that pretty much anybody who came across him would classify as a miserable old coot.When he is particularly miserable towards an employee at xmas, a few spooky spectral spirits take him to task."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"My class have to read some external readings and I choosed this one. With a Christmas-atmosphere title and its author, Charles Dickens-- the most talented one, this book is very attractive. It grows a wonder why does the title sound like a Chirstmas song.Then, I read it and found that this book is great! It told about 'the grasping, covetous old man', Mr. Scrooge, who hated the Chirstmas feasta (and so do the other festivals, I think.) Then he was visited by the 3 ghosts of Chirstmas who recalled his complete-forgotten joyful of this feasta in his younghood and revived his Chirstmas spirit that had changed him to become the great-hearted one!My fevorite charactors are 'Tiny Tim' and Mr. Fezziwig who has a grateful mind. There are many life lessons still waiting for you to found them. Just try!!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This book is one of the most meaningful of all time and one I think should be read more often than just watched on television during the Christmas season. It is a tale of a small, cruel, and heartless man changing into a kind and generous soul. He is helped by a long dead friend, Jacob Marley, who wishes to save Scrooge of a eternal fate of walking the Earth forever with the weight of his sins upon him. Jacob changes Scrooge by having him haunted by three ghosts who show him all the people he has hurt and all the people he will hurt if he does not change.After the spirts visit Scrooge he rewards the Cratchit family with an anonomously sent Goose and immediately finds a charity, to which he generously donates. He also makes amends with his nephew Fred that has been trying to change Scrooge for years. Finally he helps Bob Cratchit by raising his salary so that Tiny Tim may survive.I think this book is great for the family and though it is a little difficult I think it is suited for anyone over 12 years old."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I have read this book many times and I love it every single time.

It is a short read, enjoyable and you will feel better for having read it!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"It's a classic. What else can you say?

It was great to read it again and remember the classic story of Ebenezer Scrooge and his Christmas ghosts."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Critiquing Dickens' Christmas Carol is a misnomer. Rather, it is Dickens who critiques us with this masterwork.A Christmas Carol has burrowed into the very heart of our Western Culture to where few people would be confused if you referred to someone as a \\"Scrooge,\\" that is to say a skinflint, miser.Aside from presenting us with some of the most memorable images in literature as Scrooge is taken by the Ghosts of the Past, Present and Future to review his life and probable ending, we are brought along with his and given opportunity to review those elements in our own lives.A Christmas Carol was not just a nice story of the Christmas Season to give warmth and cheer.Far from it!Dickens had an agenda. Just as in his other famous works, like Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Dickens longed to make a social statement to draw attention to the poor in England, their plight and hardship. A Christmas Carol is about Scrooge as a person, but also as representing a class of the wealthy whose abundance is wrested from the large working poor such as Cratchett and his family. THEY are the point. THEY are the ones Dickens sought to draw to public attention.Heaven help us is we simply see this book as nostalgia and fail to see the point Dickens had to make then and which still applies today!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The book A Chrismas Carol was great! It was very inspirational. I would recommend the book to any adult or child. The book is basically an overview of how you can ruin your life, and even create death, by being mean. A Christmas Carol was a well- written example of how your attitude in everyday life, and even the way you celebrate holidays effect you and those around you. I enjoyed reading the book, because it inspired me to enlighten those around me that are like Ebenezer Scrooge or similar to consider changing. There were many interesting parts of the story. For example, in the story, the mean grouch, Ebenezer Scrooge had three ghost to haunt him. One of his past, present, and a ghost of Christmas yet to come. When each of these ghost haunted Scrooge, his attitude to each scene changed. He loved his past, hated his present, and pleaded for a better future. My favorite part of the story was the end. I enjoyed the end of the story, because Scrooge decided to change, his life improved, and he became a better person before it was too late."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is one of those stories that tempts a reviewer to succumb to grade inflation; it is so much better than other books that I've rated five stars, that I'm tempted to give it a higher than maximum rating.Granted, there are people out there who claim that this book is too cloyingly sweet for words; it's very stylish to be cynical. So call me a sucker for a happy ending if you must, but this is unquestionably the best thing that Dickens ever wrote; not only does it have his usual marvellous characterizations, but the plot moves better than most of those in his longer works, and, being a very short piece, it doesn't have the tendency to ramble that some of his longer works fall prey to.But beyond that, the story is an absolute classic, one that eveyone should have the pleasure of reading on a regular basis. What I find particularly pleasing about it is the frequently-overlooked fact that when Scrooge becomes pleasant and generous not only is it the right thing to do, and not only does it make the lives of those around him infinitely more pleasant, but it actually makes Scrooge himself much happier; it isn't WORK to be pleasant, it's FUN!The movie versions generally do a fairly good job of portraying the story, but nothing can compare to the original written story itself; even better, it's available from the &quot;Dover Thrift Editions&quot; for only a dollar!If you cherish your cynicism, you may want to avoid this story; but if you enjoy a good bit of delightfully playful writing that winds up with a classically upbeat ending, DO NOT miss this book."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I think it is for children and is very easy to read and very childish to me and I don't really like it"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I love to read classics and Ive seen A Christmas Carol movies so many times I felt compelled to read the book.

Everyone knows this Christmas story; Dickens' narrative never grows old and his writing is beautiful by itself.

I have read much Dickens, but of all his books I like this the best. He writes about Christmas like no other writer. He captures the very essence of the holiday.

The origional version Dickens told was nice but had a large vocabulary. This made the book chalenging to read. The book &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, is about a lawer named Scrooge who is not very giving or thoughtful. When Christmas time comes, which is Scrooge does not like at all, he gets visited by ghosts. These ghosts are special ghosts who come to him at night and try to change his ways. These ghosts are the ghosts of Christmas past, preasant, and future. When Mr. Scrooge sees what he lived, lives, and is about to live, he realizes something about himself and his life that he doesn't like. He realizes that even he doesn't really like himself. I think that Charles Dickens was trying to say in this story, was that even a bad person can turn into a good person."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Dickens does not go enough into the senses in his descriptions of flashbacks.

Loved it."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The Kindle version I read didn't have the illustrations that some reviewers have mentioned, and it obviously didn't have the wonderful binding, but it did have the story the way Dickens wrote it, and that was a joy to read.I've watched many film versions of the story down through the years, and I'd expected to be so familiar with the story that I'd be bored reading it, but the opposite actually happened -- I loved it.I sometimes found myself noticing bits I'd either never seen in the films, or, if I had seen them, I hadn't paid them much mind. Reading the book allowed to take things in at my own pace: if I wanted to pause and think about a particular wording, or if I wanted to back up and re-read something, I did, and it took the experience to a whole new level. Rather than an abbreviated, two-hour video, I got to enjoy the entire thing and spend as much time as I wanted savoring morsels the video would have glossed over."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A christmas carol is a great classic.

Great book for everones collection."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Yes, yes, I hear you say: why bother reading this old book when you can watch it on TV, in several different versions, during the holidays. Let me tell you, if anything, this is a better read if you've already seen the movie. The sense of bitter cold in London in 1840, and in Scrooge's heart, are all the more real in this slim text. Scrooge's isolation is shown to be something we have all felt at some time in our lives. His joyous redemption will evoke emotions you didn't know you had. Finally, for those of you who may have been tortured with Dicken's in highschool, this is an easy, single evening read."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"It's hard to think of a literary work that has been filmed and staged in more imaginative variations than Charles Dickens' &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;--there's the excellent George C. Scott version, the delightful Muppet version, the charming Mr. Magoo version, etc., etc. But ultimately true &quot;Carol&quot; lovers should go back to Dickens' original text, which remains a great read.&quot;Carol&quot; tells the story of cold-hearted miser Ebenezer Scrooge, who despises the Christmas holiday and scorns all who celebrate it. But a visit from a series of supernatural beings forces him to reevaluate his attitude--and his life.With this simple plot Dickens has created one of the enduring triumphs of world literature. It's a robust mix of humor, horror, and (most of all) hope, all leavened with a healthy dash of progressive social criticism. One thing I love about this book is that while it has a focus on a Christian holiday, Dickens puts forth a message that is truly universal; I can imagine this story resonating with people of any religious background, and also with more secular-oriented people.This is a tale of greed, selfishness, regret, redemption, family, and community, and is enlivened by some of the most memorable characters ever created for English literature. Even if Dickens had never written another word, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; would still have, I believe, secured his place as one of the great figures of world literature."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Dicken's A Christmas Carol is a classic that we often see retold every Christmas. Everyone loves it, but few people have actually read it for themselves. I always prefer reading then viewing the story because then I have to use my own imagination. I would recommend to anyone that at least once they should read the story. Dickens is a wonderful writer although a bit longwinded (He was paid by word when he wrote!)."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"In Charles Dickens' classic masterpiece, the miserable Scrooge is given a chance to repent of his selfish lifestyle when he is visited by four spirits -- first, his tormented former business partner, sentenced to wander the netherworld until he has atoned for his sins -- and then three \\"Spirits of Christmas,\\" who show him the past origins of his lifestyle, the present effects of his selfishness on people in his life, and the future toward which his life is tending. He wakes from the final vision a changed man, renounces his selfish ways, and lives a generous, loving life from that time forward.This hope-filled moral tale contains themes of redemption, hope, and generosity that resonate with Christianity, but it isn't really a Christian story. In fact, it is a good example of how a Christian holiday has come to be observed in a way that diffuses its religious meaning.For Christians, Christmas is a day to celebrate God's gift of his Son to humanity. The familiar phrase \\"Peace on earth, goodwill to men\\" was first spoken by angels announcing Jesus' birth (Luke 2:13-14). This peace primarily refers to the relationship between God and humanity (Romans 5:1-2). God miraculously extended Himself to us in the body of Jesus, ending the hostility that had separated us from Him since Adam's rebellion (Romans 5:15-17). As Christians rejoice in the miracle of Christ's reconciliation, God's love naturally pours out into joyful generosity toward other people.This significance of the holiday has been largely forgotten in our post-Christian society, but you can still feel the shadow of that joy in a general sentiment of humanitarian goodwill recognized as \\"Christmas spirit.\\" In Dickens' story, the Spirit of Christmas is personified in the three figures of past, present and future Christmases, and it is to Christmas Spirit, not to God, that Scrooge turns in his repentance. In his own words:\\"Spirit!\\" he cried, tight clutching at its robe. \\"Hear me! I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse..... I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach.\\"For Christians, who believe the only way to change your life is to trust in Jesus, Scrooge's repentance will be somewhat unconvincing -- but that doesn't mean thoughtful Christians can't appreciate the author's brilliant portrayal of human sin, selfishness, and suffering. This is a moral tale, excellent for demonstrating the consequences of sin and the benefits of goodness. Unlike many moral tales, this one is infused with joyful hope, executed with a literary excellence that has endeared it to readers for over 150 years.Dickensian language can be difficult for children to follow, and the content of this story may be troubling to an elementary audience, but for parents who think their kids will enjoy this story, an illustrated version can go a long way toward bridging the language gap. My favorite edition is illustrated by P.J. Lynch, whose exemplary gift for depicting human emotion makes his characters very real. They almost seem to breathe on the page, and the reader is effortlessly drawn into their thoughts and interests."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Having just read 'Great Expectations,' I am a big Dickens fan, and I found A Christmas Carol almost as good as his other. It is well-written, powerful, and as always, insightful into human nature. The story gallops along as well, wasting little time, which is rather amazing consider it is like 170 years old. So many books of that era are deadly slow, probably because they didn't have to compete with movies and TV.I loved the transformation that Scrooge made, and the framework Dickens created for fomenting that change had me convinced. Dickens really handled it beautifully.My one criticism, and to me it's a big one: Although Scrooge was clearly a Class A Jerk in the beginning of the book, I liked that at the beginning he wasn't just liberally squishy as regards \\"Surplus Population\\" (that is, overpopulation). Kudos to Dickens for even touching the subject. Granted, Scrooge was a creep to suggest that the world would be better off, and the solution most easily found, if poor kids should just die or go to the workhouse. I was disappointed when Scrooge just turned liberal and squishy at the end when he just gave money to the downtrodden. Heaven forbid Dickens give Scrooge real critical thinking along with his newfound compassion! Heaven forbid Dickens had compassion for the living, but really instead spoke out against people like his weak employee Cratchet just mindlessly having kids he couldn't support. The answer is not handouts; that doesn't solve overpopulation. People need to wake up and quit having so many kids, and whoever leads this world should put that message front and center."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"For fans of Patrick Stewart, this is an awesome rendition of an old favorite.

Rather, it is Dickens who critiques us with this masterwork.A Christmas Carol has burrowed into the very heart of our Western Culture to where few people would be confused if you referred to someone as a \\"Scrooge,\\" that is to say a skinflint, miser.Aside from presenting us with some of the most memorable images in literature as Scrooge is taken by the Ghosts of the Past, Present and Future to review his life and probable ending, we are brought along with his and given opportunity to review those elements in our own lives.A Christmas Carol was not just a nice story of the Christmas Season to give warmth and cheer.Far from it!Dickens had an agenda. Just as in his other famous works, like Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Dickens longed to make a social statement to draw attention to the poor in England, their plight and hardship. A Christmas Carol is about Scrooge as a person, but also as representing a class of the wealthy whose abundance is wrested from the large working poor such as Cratchett and his family. THEY are the point. THEY are the ones Dickens sought to draw to public attention.Heaven help us is we simply see this book as nostalgia and fail to see the point Dickens had to make then and which still applies today!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This was a wonderful surprise for me after having to put hard times down through boredom. It's about a hundred and thirty pages long with large gaps in between the lines so it took me about three or four hours to read it. Of course I've seen countless actors play Scrooge (George C. Scott my favourite)but really, because there's been so many, none of them dominated my mind while reading. The plot moves along very quickly and little is in the book plotwise which is not in the films. In fact I'm now aware of how much the films 'fleshed out' some of it.Also in the movies you can't get a lot of the Dickens humour which is sprinkled through the prose so it was a great choice for me and will be for you."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Dickensian prose is dated, and at this point I personally enjoy the movie versions more than the book.

It is best used as an inexpensive stocking stuffer. This version of the immortal Xmas classic cannot be destroyed by splotchy editing and a difficult to read font size.

Dickens Christmas Carol is the type of read that must be completed via a REAL book, preferably an old leather bound edition with decorative end papers and such. The tactile creases in the paper, the creak of the bindings, light dust thumbed away on the top ream, the smell of old musks radiating from text, natural oils reflecting off the leather binding...The Kindle serves a purpose but nothing beats an old book."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I ordered the audio book A CHRISTMAS CAROL to use with my class.

This book is perfect to read on the computer because it's short and seasonal."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The story, about a tight fisted bitter and selfish miser in 19th century London, who despises all that brings joy and comfort, has a plethora of adaptations but is best in it's original.Ebenezer Scrooge is visited on Christmas Eve by three ghosts who show him the evil of his ways and its consequences.A Christmas Carol is one of Dickens's most famous narratives, and written in lively, intelligent, penetrating and witty prose, a prime example of Dickens's literary genius.Certainly there is the very strong theme, for which Dickens works are well known, about social injustice and poverty, which we read in such works as Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, Bleak House and Hard Times.It is also a ghost story for which Dickens also showed a flare, although his other ghost stories are less well known but equally enthralling.Essentially the story revived the spirit and message of Christmas and contains a powerful social message about those members of the wealthier classes who shun responsibility for the less fortunate people in their country.Such pearls as the following light up this story:\\"Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, which if persevered in, must lead, but if the courses be departed from, the ends will change\\".Charming and engaging in it's original."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"First, the tale: Dickens' story hasn't aged at all. On the first page, there's this wry joke about how Marley was \\"dead as a door-nail,\\" then goes on to speculate about why door-nails are more dead than, say, coffin-nails. This sets the tone for a powerful tale of redemption and change laced with both humor and a bit of fear (all these ghosts!). At the end of it all, Dickens inspires us to be better with this old story; he really captures a \\"spirit of Christmas\\" (and I listened to the story in March).Second, the reader: Jim Dale is simply one of the best in the business. He lends similar creative, dramatic interpretation to his characters here as in his masterful readings of the Harry Potter books. We plan to initiate a family Christmas tradition of listening to this audiobook every December, letting it both entertain and inspire us."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Mr. Dale provides his usual vocal magic to bring Dickens' immortal holiday classic to life. Excellent narration, sprightly character voices and the reader's sense of good fun make this recording my personal favorite of 'A Christmas Carol'.If you enjoy this then pick up more of Mr. Dale's audiobook recordings. I highly recommend all 6 of the Harry Potter audiobooks *on CD of course as you will wear your tapes out & replace them constantly* and 'Peter & the Starcatchers'."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This edition of Charles Dickens classic is doubly wonderful in its timeless tale of redemption as well as the wonderful illustrations executed by American artist Everett Shinn. In no way either slick or modern, when one is handed the book, it seems as you are holding an artifact from another time; a time of coal fires, slate roofs, horses in the streets, a time that predates the sad state of comercialism that permeates contemporary Christmas season.

And my book club selection was A Christmas Story: The Book That Inspired the Hilarious Classic Film by Jean Shepard. The first created our modern Christmas. The second, well, the second was the basis for a gag-filled, funny movie. Both are touchstones of modern, American ChristmasesI'm not a Dickens fan but in reading these two short works almost simultaneously, I was surprised by one thing: even though I'm separated from Dickens by the Atlantic and one-hundred and seventy years and unfamiliarity with the Victorian world and a familiarity with the the settings -- if not the times --- of Shepherd's stories, I so much more preferred Dickens to Shepherd.I've given some thought to this. It's not like I'm was surprised by the narrative. They're pretty much what I've seen on the TV for decades. It's not that I knew that after Jean Shepherd divorced his second wife, he completely ignored his under seven son and daughter he'd had with her for the rest of his life. Dickens' wasn't a great husband or father either. (Then again, he at least didn't publicly deny their existence and did support his children.)I finally realized why I liked Scrooge's story over Ralphie's. It's that Dickens is Charles freakin' Dickens and Shepherd is, well, Jean Shepherd.Dickens can be \\"a vein of saccharine sentimentalism\\", true. But it is called A Christmas Carol. People are wanting saccharine sentimentalism. Ayway, it is leavened with rather dark passages that offer great balance. In fact, there's one scene that Dicken's writes that I've never seen touched on the the many films. It's part of the tour that the Second Ghost gives Scrooge.\\"Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remember those he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him.\\"I found that wonderful and joyous. It's Christmas.Compare that to the moment after the Bumpesses hounds ruined the Christmas turkey. In the short story, it's actually an Easter ham.\\"Finally, he [the old man] spoke, in a low, rasping voice: \\"All right! OK! Get your coats. We're going to the Chinese joint. We're going to have chop suey.\\"Ordinarily, this would have been a gala of the highest order, going to the chop-suey joint. Today, it had all the gaiety of a funeral procession. The meal was eaten completely in silence.\\"Not quite a chorus of Chinese Fa-La-La-La-La's of the film, is it? Not very....Christmas-y, really?In other not-so-obvious ways, you can feel the sharp edge of post-modernism -- or is it nihilism? Well, whatever -ism it is that tells you not to have joy in this world -- creeping it's way into stories.The final thing that turned me off a bit to Shepherd was, again, the Bumpuses. The family -- not just the dogs -- is detailed in the story. I found it offensive. While Dickens almost beatifies the poor. Shepherd depiction is so full of cultural smears and stereotypes that would be considered very bad taste if applied to another group of people. And Shepherd just keeps going on and on with pilling cliche after cliche on them including a mention of father-daughter incest. It just got tiring.With A Christmas Story, stick to the movie. With A Christmas Carol, read the book...and watch the 113 movies made of it."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I would have given this book a good rating before I even bought it, having read the story and had it read to me decades ago and a re-reading simply confirmed it - five stars.

It is a short story that most of us are familiar with but may have not taken the time to actually read. I have seen versions of it on TV, movies, and this year even seen a good performance of it done in a play. This year I decided to pick up the book and devote a little bit of time to reading the story. It of course is a classic written by one of the greatest writers ever, Charles Dickens. The story has a lot of meaning and reminds us that we should be aware of how we treat others not only at Christmas time but in all we do. Ebenezer Scrooge may be in us all at one time or another but like him there is time for redemption if we allow ourselves to reflect and appreciate what we have and are willing to be giving of ourselves to others."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The quality of the color printing of the illustrations is poor.

Though he could meet the expense of the most expensive clothes available, he chose to dress in the fashion of a lower-class civilian. He worked in a counting house with only his clerk Bob Cratchit for business. Scrooge was a grumpy old man whom believed that Christmas is for rich people. He also thinks that Christmas is also just a reason to miss work and get gifts to one another and also to exchange the gifts. Every time the Christmas holiday would come Scrooge would get the same feelings as the years before which are not very Christmas spirity. Most people respected his dislike for Christmas holidays, and continued to dislike him, despise him, even hate him. He doesn't believe in all of the good cheer, happiness and charity that the season promotes, and he makes sure everyone knows how he feels about the Christmas spirit. His money was what he lived by. One night Scrooge was visited by his friend, which was Marley, who was also grumpy and cold as Scrooge was. When Marley visited Scrooge, Marley told Scrooge that if he continues to be stingy and so selfishly he would continue with greed as his assemble. He also tells Scrooge that three spirits will haunt him. On Christmas Eve, Scrooge received three visits from three specific ghosts. The ghost names where the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. Those ghost showed him the true meaning of Christmas and the true meaning of his life. They showed him his error in valuing money over people. Scrooge saw his long forgotten past, realizing all the good quality he had deserted, and all he had done to guide him where he was now. He saw his childhood, his grief and pleasure. He saw his relatives and acquaintances. He also saw himself turn from all these through his greed as his age progressed."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I choose this rating because it was a pretty boring book but it was finda interesting itself.

In any case, one of Dickens' classics, and deservedly so."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"(In my blog review of this (visible at basicallyamazingashley.com) I have some really awesome pictures from a stage performance.)We all know that there are myriads of great (and not so great) books that have been turned into movies, plays, animated cartoons, TV shows and etc. etc. etc. I always roll my eyes at people who respond to the question- How did you like that book? With some variation of, \\"Oh ya, I loved it! The movie was so great!\\" Gag. Really?! You just said that?! You just smeared the name of literature by telling me a book was great because you liked the movie?! (Ahem...) Well, the other day I shamefacedly realized that I was guilty of this myself. (Insert horrified gasp here) One of my fondest memories of Christmas, most beloved childhood memories and in my top 3 favorite Christmas stories was missing something...A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens is one of the most recognized, well known, and cherished Christmas stories in existence. There are numerous versions and adaptations for both children and adults, in animation, live action or produced live on stage. You can find it serious or slightly comical or even as a musical. Some follow the original script closely while others use only a loose interpretation of the story. Whatever versions you've seen, most people are very familiar with the plight of the Cratchit family and Tiny Tim, the cold, miserly heart of Ebenezer Scrooge, and the eerie spirits who visit him during the night of Christmas Eve.However familiar we are with the story, how many of us have actually read the book? I imagine not very many. It's included on BBC's The Big Read and I wonder how many people include it because of the story rather than the book itself. So, to avoid this horrible reader faux pas, I decided to pick up this favored story and read it for myself. It's a short book, more of a novella than a novel, and I already knew that I loved the story.I did really enjoy reading this book and I'm glad I can now say that I've actually read it. However, I must admit that I am a tiny bit more in love with the idea of this book than its reality. It's a wonderful story, with a wonderful message and wonderful characters, but I didn't have the same emotional connection to the written story that I do to the various productions I've seen. I know that this is more due to past experiences and the relationship it has to my childhood than anything negative about the book. I loved the book and will definitely reread it in the future, but it's just not the same as watching Scrooge, the Musical or The Muppets.The book places more emphasis on the characters and the realizations they make than just the story of Scrooge. Most movie or live productions emphasize Scrooge's discovery of the Christmas Spirit, and becoming a more generous person. I love that, and it is a very important part of the story. However, I love that reading the book offers more insight into why Scrooge became the way he did and the relationships he had with those around him.It is a great story to invite the Christmas spirit and remember the true meaning of Christmas, but it is also a cautionary tale. Be careful the emphasis you place on money and things. It is usually more important to focus on the people in your lives than the things in your life and this story, no matter how you experience it is a great reminder of that."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"An apt reminder of what makes a timeless classic!

It was magical.The narrator impressed me with all of the voices that he did. In scenes when multiple characters were conversing, it was easy to follow along due to the unique voices that he gave each character. His British accent made me feel as though Dickens himself could be narrating the story.Listening to this book together would be a wonderful family tradition! Both young and old will love this story!

I thought I knew the story pretty well. I mean, I knew that the ghost of Christmas present struggled pronouncing pistachio, I knew that there was a funny rat. I had no doubt that I knew all that there was to know about the Christmas Carol, but I decided to read it anyway.Boy was I in for a surprise (insert sarcasm here). I'm not gonna lie, this was a hard read. It wasn't because of the content or writing ability of Dickens, but it was the language barrier. Sometimes I swear it was like I was reading a different language. It took a while for me to read some parts and I had to use the wonderful dictionary feature of the Kindle many, many times.I did enjoy the story and it is incredible how Dickens can describe even the most mundane details and make them interesting. I could see the ghost of Christmas past's flame, I could hear Marley's chains and see the shock on Scrooge's face when he sees his own grave. Dickens is incredible at painting pictures with words.After reading this book I saw the newer animated Christmas Carol with Jim Carrey as Scrooge and I was very impressed at how well they brought the actual story to life. There were some differences, but overall they did a magnificent job.Definitely a good read during the Christmas season or any time really, whenever you need to remember that we should value other people and treat them as we want to be treated.If you like my review and want to read more of them I have a blog chronicaling my first year with my Kindle.

When I read a Christmas Carol, I was truly touched; anyone reading this story should grasp the concept that we all need to love one another: That includes sharing, helping, and just being kind. The best way of getting it over to the reader that as a person one should live so that a happy afterlife is ensured is the ghost voice of Marley, Scrooge's partner. Marley had lived as a tight grasping old man, just like Scrooge. He died, and Scrooge is the heir. Scrooge takes over, but he is NO BETTER than Marley. He is such a greedy, stingy person that even the dogs hate him! He has not friends--PERIOD. And then...one day...On Christmas Eve, Scrooge's nephew drops in to invite him over for a Christmas dinner. In his usual manner, Scrooge dismisses the young man with his usual 'humbug' word.That night, he is visited by Marley's ghost. Scrooge is not a scary man. He talks to Marley as if it is nothing, but inwardly he is a bit shaken. What really scares him is when he is told by Marley that he will be visited by the ghosts.Marley is right.First, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past. Then the Ghost of Christmast Present. And last...and scariest...of all, is the Ghost of Christmas Future. In a short while, he shows Scrooge what will happen to him if he does not change his way. And he shows Scrooge his own grave! Imagine being shown your own grave! In the end, Scrooge has a complete transformation. He is no longer stingy or greedy. I like to think that he devoted the rest of his life to helping others. Now, I don't believe in ghosts, but I sure do think that this little ghost-like story is one of the best!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Works on first try on my Cruz tablet.

One can really feel Dickens' love of humanity and joie de vivre throughout. At the end, Scrooge overcomes his addiction to money, misanthropy and greed to partake of the joys of participating in mankind.It is revolutionary because it is the transition of a miserly man to one, who at the conclusion, shares what he has with his fellow beings. In a sense, it is an apt theme for the \\"Occupy Movement\\" with its focus on the 1% who control most of the wealth of the world.There are an astounding number of moral lessons to be taken from this simple, but animated tale, by one of the world's greatest story-tellers.Favourite quotes: from Marley's ghost playing on the word \\"business\\" - \\"Mankind was my business.

The commandments, \\"Do not commit adultery,\\" \\"Do not murder,\\" \\"Do not steal,\\" \\"Do not covet,\\" and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this one rule: \\"Love your neighbor as yourself.\\"10. Love does no harm to its neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.11. And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.12. The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.Scrooge envisions his past, his present, and his future, and is given the choice between damnation and salvation. He reveals his choice by saying,\\"I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future.

It's light, fun, sad, and presents an important message about Christmas. During this time of rampant commercialism and long lists to Santa, it's easy to forget that the greatest joys of Christmas come from the giving. This book illustrates the euphoria that Scrooge feels when he finally is able to give gifts, either of time, money, food, or whatever, to other people. Christmas is not about what you can get...it's about what you can give. If you want a story that will remind you of the real meaning of Christmas, this is it! In terms of story-telling, this book has classic Dickensian characters and ample humor and drama, making it a classic in its own right.

We all know the tale of Scrooge and his visits by the Ghost of Christmas Present, the Ghost of Christmas Past and the Ghost of Christmas Future. Even for those who have never read the book, the story has been retold in many different forms and at least three versions make their appearance on our television screens each Christmas.So why has this little tale proved to be so popular? I think it's because Scrooge is such a memorable character and we all know someone we like to think of as a Scrooge. And, let's be honest, we would like them to change. A Christmas Carol touches the desires of all of us to show people what they are really like and have them change for the better. And Scrooge is also one of those characters that seem to be likeable even when they're easy to dislike.I think this book is still worth reading, even though we know the story. It is a very small book. I read it in its entirety on Christmas Eve. It is also very easy to read. Some classics, I feel, are difficult for the modern reader because our tastes and expectations are different from those of the past. But because A Christmas Carol was written quickly by Dickens, and kept short, it will pose no problems to readers of today.Besides being a great tale, A Christmas Carol also gives us an insight into the way Christmas was celebrated in Victorian society.

I really hope the boy I bought it for is enjoying it because I hated to give it away!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"One of the stories I really wanted to share with my children this season was A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens. The children I particularly wanted to read this with were my 7-year-old daughter, and 8 and 11-year-old sons. While I wanted them to know the story of Ebeneezer Scrooge and his change of heart, I knew that the unabridged original version would probably be a bit much for my daughter to take in, and require a lot of explanations regarding the archaic language for my sons. So for us, The Great Illustration version of A Christmas Carol was perfect.This version has illustrations on just about every page, which was particularly important for my very visual younger children. This version stayed true to the original as I remembered it and kept the personality of Scrooge, from bitter old man to renewed and invigorated redeemed soul intact!I also felt that the use of modern English was not a disservice to the original. While reading about the death of Tiny Tim, I felt the same amount of emotion and pain as reading the original. In fact as my voice cracked and the tears started to well my little son, who is just beginning to truly appreciate the subtle nuances that make for a good reading said, \\"Great expression, mom!\\"I have read some of the reviews of other books in this series as being too watered down, and that may be. But for this particular age group, I think this book in particular fills a special need. I think reading it as a family this season will leave a special impression on their young minds and hearts and make them want to pick this story up again when they are a bit older and able to handle more of a reading challenge."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This story is about an old man who passed for a sadness experience in his life wich turned his heart dark without feelings, he didn't want to have contact with any human been and only has interest in money, but one day three ghost make him look three events in his life, past, present and future and after that, he could understand the importance of sharing with everyone, his time, money (contributing with poor people), giving love and smile, helping people, all this things could fill your heart with happiness and the feelings that you are doing the best of you to make happy other people who need it.

The characters have so much depth. The made for t.v. or movie screen renditions do not truly depict what Ebenezer Scrooge witnesses with the three spirits that causes such a change in his outlook on life. Such as Scrooge's emotions being quickened by the past heartache in his childhood; seeing how his bad choices caused the hardening of his heart and how deeply it cost him in the end; seeing what could have been his to enjoy and then thinking it could still be his with the Spirit of Christmas Present only to find out the future does not hold any love or joy for him by the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come and instead his actions leave him robbed at death and no one left to grieve for him. Read the book to hear how this story was really written.

As Christmas nears, Scrooge is visited by spectors of Christmas past, present, and future, to show him the error of his ways, and teach him that Christmas spirit must be held in one's heart all the days of one's life. Will Scrooge learn this lesson in time to save himself?This is a story with which most of us are familiar. There are countless adaptations in the form of children's books, movies, and abridged texts, so I am quite familiar with the story. However, I have never actually read the complete original text. Imagine my surprise when I found such elegance and beauty in Dickens' original words. This coming from me, someone who does not always have the greatest appreciation of Dickens.I have always loved this story, and found the message so deeply touching. I have so much empathy for Scrooge as a character, have suffered a lonely childhood and gone without real happiness his whole adult life. It is nice to see the theme of redemption so clearly illustrated in this tale.

Each drawing is beautifully done and follows along with the story. This is the unabrdged edition which I personally prefer; however, be aware that there will be an occassional paragraph with old English words and references that will be difficult to understanad unless you are an English scholar. These are infrequent and do not detract from the story - in fact, it adds charm and authenticity. Better than having some editor arbitrarily determining what you should read and what should be cut out. I believe the Amazon price for this book was $12.00 - an amazing bargain.

I got a few hits, but nothing that really struck me as the \\"definite\\" copy I was looking for.If you are looking for an heirloom quality copy, this might not be it......at least not for a couple more decades......as I believe this book will wear nicely and be a great piece once the pages start to yellow.

I haven't played it yet, but I have had some of them before, and to be honest, I don't think I would have bothered within this edition of A Christmas Carol if I'd known, as the quality of recording and reading of these leave a lot to be desired.Having said that, if your not bothered about the audiobook, don't forget the illustrations as they ARE included and have been taken from the original book, which I think was published in 1843, but whether this particular book and it's illustrations are from that edition, I cannot tell.

If you haven't read it, do so, whether it is this version or not.As for this particular version, the index is not active, but there are only 5 chapters, or 'Staves', and the book is really very short, usually only around 100 pages in a traditional book. There are a few formatting issues throughout the story, but nothing, in my opinion, that takes away from the enjoyment of reading this heartwarming classic. I have read this book many times, and have found errors in paper versions as well. So take it for what it is; a free, slightly flawed, version of a wonderful story that has become a part of our collective consciousness.I should point out that my rating of three stars is for this version, due to some minor formatting issues. The book itself deserves five stars."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I just finished flipping through this in the bookshop, and it is absolutely gorgeous. What you would expect from Candlewick Press and more, practically every page has wonderful full-color paintings, each evocative and beautiful. Unabridged text, well-bound and typeset."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is it! These are the letters, words, sentences, paragraphs that made Christmas the celebration that it is today - the family parties, the feasts, the excitement, giving to the poor. Virtually every way we celebrate this magnificent Holiday (except the mall part!) comes from this book written by Charles Dickens.First off, this is the unabridged version. Nothing added - nothing taken away. That's as it should be. (Unfortunately, as great as they may be, the movie versions truly do not do the book justice - although I must say the George C. Scott and Alistair Sim versions do come fairly close).One thing that surprises me about this book is how few people I know that have have actually read it, but they've seen one version or another of the movie countless times! They don't seem to realize that when books are put to film, so much is taken out for length or for other reasons. A Christmas Carol is no different. In fact, if you watch all of the different movie versions available, you STILL would not get the complete book, even though each movie adds one thing or another from the original story that the others may not.There are countless copies of this story available in various book form, but this particular version is probably one of the best that I have seen. The illustrations attempt in some part to keep in the same spirit as in Dickens' original. But the best, most interesting part of this version (besides the story itself) is all of the little facts, explanations, and trivia put into the margins throughout this book. They give the modern 21st century reader more of an understanding of what 19th century English life was like. A couple of examples: when Dickens writes of the Cratchit family taking their goose to the bakers to be cooked, I wondered why would any one take their food OUT to be cooked and then picked up later. This book explains that few poor people in this time period had ovens large enough to roast a good family sized bird. They were big enough to cook a small bit of meat and that was about it. In order to have one of those rare Holiday meals, they had to take it to the large baker's oven at an appointed time for cooking.Another fact I did not know was that in the story, Scrooge's sister, Fan, was based on Dickens' actual sister in law, Mary Hogarth.There are also a multitude of paintings, drawings, and sketches from Dickens' time showing his time. Now you can see, as accurately as one can considering there were no cameras, life of the rich, middle class, and poor as it actually was. There's a picture of Queen Victoria and her family celebrating Christmas. There is also a beautiful painting of a poor labourer's family Christmas celebration. There are sketches from the first edition of 'A Christmas Carol.'If you plan on owning a copy of this most wonderful of all Christmas novels, this is the version to get."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I'll not insult you all by describing the action of this classic novella, nor belabor the lesson taught. I'm sure even Mowgli the Jungle Boy must have heard this story once a year growing up in the jungle. But with all the TV and movie and cartoon and Muppet iterations (the best of which remains the 1951 Alastair Sim movie version), when's the last time you went back and actually read the original book?Dickens is, of course, a wonderful author and earlier generations read everything that he wrote. Today, however, you read an obligatory novel or two in High School, breath a sigh of relief that's over and then blithely ignore him along with the rest of the ancients. But, as a reacquaintance with A Christmas Carol will remind you, he remains pretty accessible and his novels are often quite fun. What's more, there's even a Reading Version (available online) of the story that Dickens condensed himself for his numerous public readings of the tale. It's perfect for reading aloud to the family.Here's just a sample of the prose to entice you:On Scrooge before: Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge. a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.and Scrooge after: Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him.He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!We, all of us, have a tendency to let the classics become so encrusted that we take them for granted and forget how good they really are; if this has happened for you with A Christmas Carol, do yourself a favor and dig out a copy and reread it this Holiday Season. I bet it becomes an annual tradition.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Mr. Dale provides his usual vocal magic to bring Dickens' immortal holiday classic to life.

Scores of film adaptations have been made over the years, taking Dickens' story of one man's redemption to all the corners of the globe. The name Ebenezer Scrooge immediately brings to mind the miserly curmudgeon whose life and very nature were radically changed after the visitation of four ghosts one early Christmas morning. Jacob Marley, Scrooge's former partner, returns in spirit form to warn Scrooge of the ponderous chain he is forging in life by his penny-pinching, selfish, Christmas-hating ways. Then, of course, the ghosts of Christmas past, Christmas present, and Christmas future come to call for an increasingly troubled soul who comes to see the worthlessness of his purely materialistic life. A Christmas Carol offers a truly amazing character study. Scrooge, this seemingly incorrigible fellow, quickly becomes a sympathetic character as we view the circumstances of his life. From a lonely boy rejected by his father (who blames him for the death of his wife in childbirth), we see a sensitive soul, one quite capable of feeling and expressing both happiness and love, grow greedy and cold, shutting even the woman he loves out of his life. Completely broken down by the scenes revealed by the ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, Scrooge's transformation is remarkably real and powerful.Little need be said about this timeless classic, as it is a story virtually everyone knows in some detail. The message is clear to all of us, as well. Dickens, the social conscience of the 19th century, illustrates the humanity and worth of even the lowliest of society's members and casts the harsh light of truth on those with the means but not the desire to help their fellow man, giving new life to the clich&eacute; &quot;you can't take it with you.&quot; Dickens briefly alludes to the religious aspects of the holiday, but he vividly evokes the true and rightful spirit of Christmas in humanistic terms. This is a timeless story that will forever be a part of each Christmas season. Not only does it impart lessons of the highest order, it never fails to charm and delight you no matter how many times you have previously read the story (and watched the movie adaptations) over the years."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The vocabulary was exelent.

It didn't turn out to be the case. Admittedly I am a huge fan of Charles Dickens' books and consider David Copperfield one of my favorite books, I felt A Christmas Carol a drastic departure from author's usual style. What I noticed the most in the book is the usage of the many five dollar words (This might be the reason, I realize now, that there are alternate versions of the story and especially in abridged form). Not only those words made the book difficult to read, they helped to provide detachment for me from enjoying the story and being immersed in the tale. What is worse, I simply didn't like the story all that much because I felt my motivation to be lacking when Ebenezer Scrooge was hand-picked for the journey. Thinking of the kind of a person he is, why can't a worthier person be selected? That's why I prefer the tale of It's a Wonderful Life over A Christmas Carol, and it did happen to a better person than Scrooge. One worst part about A Christmas Carol is the force to love Christmas to death. I am not too keen about this approach because it feels too religious in the wrong way. Then again, the entire book was too religious for my taste with a lot of overtones in a spiritual sense. Charles Dickens also gives poverty a role in A Christmas Carol, but I didn't like the part where a character is judged by how he views money as he sees fit. All in all, I found A Christmas Carol a disappointing read, and all of the characters were unmemorable for me."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Before reading A Christmas Carol, I automatically gave the book the highest regard probably because I was influenced by the Disney's movie version, at least that's what I thought the book will be like.

The spirit visitors are drawn so vividly, they are quite enjoyable to read about as well. It is worth reading the original, even though there are movie and abridged versions everywhere.While to its benefit, the Kindle edition is unabridged and free, it lacks illustrations.

Trev from Trevsliteraryreview"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Christmas Carol, by Charles DickensTruth is a scourge. And like a scourge, it can leave one broken and bloody, stripped of all his or her defenses. No one knows this better than Mr. Scrooge, but I won't insult my readers by offering a summary of this well-known Christmas story (though I will chime in with my opinion that the old Disney version with Mickey Mouse and Scrooge McDuck is the best!).I know of no one who dislikes this story. That being said, the book is waaay better; by leaps and bounds! All of the movies tell the core of the story, but they leave out all of the nuance--if a picture is worth a thousand words and they have an hour and a half to tell this story (which was only 124 pages of somewhat large text), they should be adding nuance, not removing it!The only problem with it is that it's a book meant to appeal to everyone, including children. Therein lies the difficulty: it's somewhat like asking Beethoven to compose a jingle for an advertisement; sure, he could do it, and it would be good, but he could do so much better! And I know this is true, both because there are monstrous hints within the story (primarily when the narrator speaks), and because I've read some of his other works. But even if this is the worst that Dickens has to offer, then I would still rather read it than almost any other book written in the past 100 years.Memorable Quote:What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips, to have questioned her, that she might have opened them, to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush, to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price; in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest license of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.For more reviews like this, visit my profile."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I first read Charles Dickens' version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" in my 7th grade English class. The story remains as lyrical now as I first discovered then. I cannot imagine Christmas or literature without it.

Dickens makes it easy to hate Scrooge while invoking some compassion on this horrible soul. The mixture of both hatred and pity shows the genius of the author. With the visit of the long deceased partner of Scrooge, Scrooge sees the tormented ghost and faces what he may become if he does not change his ways. With the horror of the moment, Scrooge is informed of three ghosts who will visit Scrooge, in order that Scrooge may not suffer the same fait of his former business partner. The three ghosts visit showing Scrooge the joy of Christmas had been, the happiness and good some enjoy in the current Christmas despite their humble and afflicted estate and the terror of his future. Each ghost offers their own terror but all the while offering hope that a changed Scrooge could change an even scarier future. The story will grip you if you can overlook some of the tangents by Dickens and some of the old customs included in the book. If you have a tendency towards emotional reactions to a good book, you may want to prepare yourself before reading this book. Every reader should read this book at least once and then you will understand what is meant by a Dickens Christmas."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"\\"A Christmas Carol\\" is not just A Christmas story, but one of THE Christmas stories -- not only is it instantly recognizable by pretty much everybody, but it's relentlessly copied and spoofed in countless Christmas specials. But taken just by itself, Charles Dickens' yuletide novella is a pretty bleak and bittersweet affair, with brilliant imagery and lots of ghostly weirdness.Scrooge is... well, a scrooge -- a professional miser who hates Christmas, goodwill, charity, puppies, kittens, his relatives, his employees, and virtually everything else except money.And on Christmas Eve, his dead partner Jacob Marley comes back, wrapped with supernatural chains, and claims that Scrooge is doomed to the same fate. But he has a chance at redemption: three ghosts representing will visit him that night, taking him on a guided tour of Christmases past, present and yet to come.So Scrooge is transported on a trio of hourlong trips through time. The childlike Ghost of Christmas Past takes him to his bleak childhood, when he was less jaded and hard. The jolly Ghost of Christmas Present takes him to people's homes on the very next morning, specifically of of his nephew and the poor miner Bob Cratchit. And finally a Ringwraith-like spirit gives him a glimpse of Christmas years in the future... a bleak and terrible future, unless he changes his ways.You can read plenty of symbolism into a story like \\"A Christmas Carol\\"; I've heard speculation about Dickens' father, the Industrial Revolution, spiritualism, and all sorts of other stuff. But at its heart, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the most powerful when appreciated for its story alone -- a story about a greedy, miserable man who redeems himself by learning to love all humanity.Dickens' writing is utterly brilliant here. Most of the book is bleak, grimy and painted in shadows, with Dickens only rarely holding back from showing the dark situation of England's poor. A great example is the symbolic children Want and Ignorance (\\"a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds\\"). As for the Grim-Reaperlike third ghost, it's the stuff of nightmares.But all isn't dark here. Occasionally Dickens splashes it with moments of crystalline brilliance (\\"It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and... its dress trimmed with summer flowers\\"). And as dark as the book is, Dickens offers hope for the future.He also does a brilliant job with Scrooge, \\" a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire.\\" Having worked hard to make us hate Scrooge, Dickens then deftly displays his skill at slowly revealing how Scrooge became who and what he is, and slowly redeeming him.This particular edition is graced with Robert Innocenti's artwork, and it is gorgeous: detailed, atmospheric pictures that are alternately full of bright shining colors and dark dreary black-and-white images (such as the third spirit wafting Scrooge over a bleak, lifeless church and graveyard). Really wonderful accompaniment to the text.Charles Dickens created one of the greatest Christmas stories with \\"A Christmas Carol\\" -- bah humbugs, merry Christmases and all. God bless us, every one!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"SPOILERS FOLLOWCharles Dickens' 1843 classic \\"A Christmas Carol\\" tells quite possibly the most oft-told holiday story in the English-speaking world. Though there have been many movies made, plays performed, and even other books written about this little gem, the best way to experience \\"A Christmas Carol\\" remains reading Dickens' original text.Many people know it as the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a hardened, greedy man who undergoes a great emotional change one Christmas Eve through the assistance(and occasional hard prodding)of three ghosts. Each ghost represents some form of loss. For instance, the Ghost of Christmas Past represents the lost innocence and kindness Scrooge endures in a difficult childhood and young manhood. The Ghost of Christmas Present represents the love and fellowship Scrooge is losing in his current life, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come represents the finality of death and the lasting sting of a hateful life. Ironically, though the book is very powerfully about Ebenezer Scrooge, Dickens chooses to begin it with a discussion of his deceased business partner Jacob Marley.Ironic contrasts power the narrative, as the exceedingly wealthy Scrooge is miserable, while his poor employee Bob Cratchit is a contented man with a virtuous disposition and family. In a pared-down novel, by Dickens' amazing standards of length, Ebenezer Scrooge and Bob Cratchit are two of the richest character contrasts in world literature.\\"A Christmas Carol\\" is a richly satisfying read.

And the edition of the book that I borrowed from Austin Public Library was terrific. It's called The Whole Story edition and gives illustrations from the original volume with an annotated history of London at the time that Dickens was writing the story. This hardcover also explains the settings and characters that were similar to Dickens' own life.I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It's refreshing in this day and age to see a moralistic tale written without reference to religious symbolism. To me, the message under the story is so much more universally delivered this way because people with all different belief systems still get the transformation that Scrooge undergoes.I also love the concept embedded in the story about how rapidly a person can change. Unlike in Dickens' time, today we have the science to prove that if you want to change your life, all you have to do is change your mind. That's what Scrooge did and he underwent an instant and dramatic transition to a happier and more fulfilling life.If you're feeling humbug about the holidays, I suggest you read \\"A Christmas Carol\\"."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I absolutely loved this audiobook.

I particularly liked the way he interprets Scrooge all the way through his transformation, from the grumpy old miser to a jolly old man at the end. He did very well with the different characters voices and he held my attention throughout.

It's so great to be able to read it anywhere in a convenient format, even in the dark which makes the story spookier."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Realizing I had never read anything by Charles Dickens, I decided to take a crack at this novella after I found it being offered for free on Amazon. If you've seen any of the dozens of adaptations of this classic, you know the story: A cruel miser is visited by ghosts of past, present and future on Christmas Eve and given a glimpse of the misery he has and will continue to cause if he doesn't change his ways.As far as the Dickensian style goes, I can see the reasons why it is both loved and hated. At times the tone is conversational, like Dickens is standing in front of you telling the story, which is something you're either going to love or hate. At times I got a little lost in the text, but I just see that as a byproduct of reading a book that was written in a very different time and place.That said, the themes are very familiar, especially in today's political climate. Scrooge's dialogue in the opening scene could easily be adapted for one of the talking heads of Fox News. I'm not trying to get political here. Scrooge is a worst case scenario cartoon rendering of a heartless rich guy, but then again, I feel like he sees the error of his ways just a little too easily.At the end of the day, what you have in A Christmas Carol is a modern fable, and unlike many cultural myths, the original text is here for your enjoyment and analysis. This book is responsible in large part for how we experience and imagine Christmas today, so the cultural themes are vital. It's also a short read, so you won't lose a lot of time seeing if you like it."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Because this is a classic, I focused on the quality of the kindle edition.

Over the years there have been so many film adaptations of this story and it was nice to see it in its original form."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"165 years ago this week, Charles Dickens published what would become one of his most noteworthy and best-loved gifts to the world, \\"A Christmas Carol\\".The illustrations Arthur Rackham made for this classic in 1915, with mostly lithe figures and spare coloring do great justice to the tale of an elderly miser, who, on the anniversary of his business partner's death on Christmas Eve, is forced to review his life, and is offered a final chance for redemption.The tale of Ebenezer Scrooge could be viewed as an early novel of spiritual psychoanalysis.After readers learn of Scrooge's character flaws--his stinginess, his cold-hearted attitude towards people, including a nephew and his wife, who are his only family--he is confronted by the ghost of his business partner, Jacob Marley, who, despite Scrooge's reluctance, shows him his long chain, explains its significance, and warns him to amend his ways.Scrooge is visited by three spirits--the first being the child-like, white-haired Ghost of Christmas Past, who makes Scrooge retrace his steps in life, causing him to review a harsh and lonely childhood, which is tempered by consolation from his loving but ill-fated sister, Fan, his happier years as an apprentice to a man named Fezziwig, and finally, he recognizes how his singular pursuit of wealth at all costs resulted in the loss of his fiancee, Belle.The Ghost of Christmas Present is the most joyous and festive of the apparitions.Sitting in a well-lit room at a table with a glorious bounty when he first encounters Scrooge, he escorts his elderly charge through London, where he sees the spirit of the season among the people, and visits the houses of his employee, Bob Cratchit, and that of his nephew, Fred. He learns of the plight of Cratchit's son, Tiny Tim, discovers how he is viewed in both households, is shown the impact of poverty among those whom he has the potential to help, and lastly warned about the consequences of Want and Ignorance.The third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come, is the darkest, most foreboding of the phantoms. It is hooded, faceless, and silent as it shows the old man the possible future, pointing to significant details with a clammy hand as Scrooge realizes that he has reaped what he has sown.Back in his bed at the end of a chilling night's journey, Scrooge sees the potential to be a better man than before. He has come to terms with his past, learns to rejoice in the present, and to create a better future for those around him.Ebenezer...In Hebrew, the name means \\"Stone of Help\\", which may well be why Dickens chose it for one of his most famous characters.In the end, a formerly miserly old man does a fine job of becoming just that!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Jim Dale is a very fine oral interpreter, it is a skill to read some of the most beloved books and make people love them more and discover something new.This is a 3 disc set of A Christmas Carol, audio version and Jim Dale gives each character its own unique voice and he is pleasant to listen to and he adds charm, warmth and humor to this very well known story.Treat your self, treat your family.

They were the ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present, Christmas Future, and his dead friend Jacob Marley. Mr. Scrooge is the main character of the story. He is really mean! For example, when he was walking through town, people would avoid him as much as possible. Even dogs would avoid him.

We developed a tradition of reading it aloud each year in the days before Christmas and using Roberto Innocenti's gorgeously illustrated version of Dickens' classic tale of redemption, or rather, \\"reclamation,\\" as one Ghost puts it, made this tradition even more delightful. Dickens' wordsmithing sets a standard few authors reach and reveals a desire not only to make humanity better but make more faithful the practice of the religion (Christianity) which constantly underscores the words and actions of the characters. Innocenti's illustrations reveal many hours of research into the clothing and look of 1830s London, as well as many hours spent illustrating the author's words down to some of the briefest references. Each time one looks at an illustration one notices some new charming detail: the drops of blood from a goose's neck on the snow, the Marley-haunted tiles around Scrooge's fireplace, piles of bones in old Joe's shop. The copy I received--my second copy--was in even better condition than I anticipated; while not brand new, it obviously had never been opened. I recommend this edition of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" to everyone who loves the story. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"THis went really well.

As an English teacher, the no holds barred story penned by Dickens is essential to remember not only during the holidays, but each day before and after.

In my opinion it is bested only by the real story itself found within the Gospels. Dickens wasn't the greatest novelist of his time, perhaps not even the greatest of his friends and acquaintances. However, his characters will live with us forever for no one can introduce us to better ones. Old Ebenezer Scrooge is perhaps one of his best known and has become a symbol of anti-holiday merriment. Added to this is the plight of the poor which Dickens describes in painful detail drawn from his keen eye and actual experience.

A Christmas Carol should ideally be read. After you have read the book you should buy this audio rendition. Geoffrey Palmer is not only an excellent actor but has a terrific voice for narration. Dicken's has a way with words that makes it easy to the reader/listener to imagine the setting. Palmer builds on this with his rendition of the story, where you can truly experience the old fashioned dickensian christmas era. Unlike other narrators that summarize this classic, Palmer reads straight from the novel so if you have the book you can follow line by line. The story is told across two audio tapes.

Puts even the most hateful love one in the holiday spirit."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This slim volume is an example of Victorian literature at its finest. Dickens' literary voice croons with the tempo of the story, dark and foreboding as the ghosts escort Scrooge on his journey and upbeat and merry as he reforms his ways. It is a story of hope in the human spirit, urging you not to give up on people, not to count them out because they may surprise you. Although I doubt that many a moral eyesore can be transformed so easily and heartily as Scrooge, Dickens artfully exploited the marshmallowy feeling many experience during the Christmas season, which makes this a believable and much loved story.Dickens immersed Victorian themes in many ways and with great skill. The worship of children as innocent creatures was apparent in the way that Tiny Tim was glorified. His pitiful image and heart of gold appeal to our senses as well as it did to the Victorians.A thirst for the supernatural was quenched through the use of the three spirits. They are not exactly Christian in nature, yet they seek to do good. This secular flirtation could indicate that Victorians' faith was being shaken and in its place a value system based on choosing favorable Christian principles and disregarding the rest. As is human tendency, we do not usually care about anything until it is almost gone (such as endangered species), and when Christian faith was questioned, interest began to percolate in the Victorians. I believe we still like basic Christian ideals, but going to church is asking for a lot. We continue to have more of an interest in phantoms than angels.Also integrated was the belief that the middle class is more virtuous because they work for their money. Bob Cratchit did not need moral instruction; Scrooge, an old miser, did. It teaches that sacrifices made for money will be costly. Scrooge lost a woman who loved him by being greedy. She dismissed him regretfully; \\"You fear the world too much. All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond its sordid reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you\\" (Dickens 37). This theme is timeless as a recent movie, Family Man, heavily drew upon it as a successful businessman who had discarded the fancies of a wife and children, woke up one morning to having both and realized he had been in error. The Victorians and many contemporary Americans ache to believe that the pursuit of wealth is not as fulfilling as two hands with wedding bands clasped and changing dirty diapers. Whether or not this is accurate I cannot say because I have neither.Dickens was a Victorian mastermind and he knew what Christmas was all about. It is about looking for the best in people and the world. It is one time that it is okay to be cheesy, okay to be touched by stories of hope and love. So next Christmas, when the snow falls like sugar and the sentimental tears fall like rain, pick up A Christmas Carol and watch the Victorians come out of the woodwork. They look a lot like us and this is why Dickens' novel has survived."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This book was really good.

The book shows how a man such as Scrooge can change and so can everyone else. The story is not like the movie. Charles Dickens does a wonderful job in making the story more appealing to me. The story makes me understand how life was like back then. (...) I hope people can change like Scrooge. I think Charles Dickens does a great job in using the events from different sources to show different views from the movies. People should read this book so they can maybe stop being so mean to other people and races. (...)The book gets five stars because this is hardcore lessons that we should be teaching today in the youth of America.I think the ghost of the story should come and visit some of the people here in the United States and in different countries.MAybe it is not to late to save the lives of others, if you can not save yourself. This book should be read in schools all over the world.The book has meaning and we should use this meaning to live our lives. The book shows me that everyone can change, including the most devilish person can become an Angel."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I loved the book. Charles Dickens gets a five star mark in my book. The book is nothing like the movie. The way Charles Dickens showed or wrote how the Scrooge changed almost brought me into tears. The movie showed little events than what the book showed. The said part is that many people are just like the Scrooge here today in the United States. On September 11, 2001 showed how many people are just like Scrooge. Men, that are supposed to be &quot;created equal&quot; killed over thousands of men, women, children, and animals all because the United States is more econmic to other countries. The Scrooge being the mastermind of the whole ordeal. I still believe that this book should be given and read to all ages to show how someone as mean as Scrooge can always change when ready or when needed to. To Charles Dickens you should get an award for this piece of work. I think all ages will enjoy this book and maybe someday we will all change and not be so mean to others.

A must-read for everyone,regardless of age. Although Dicken wrote it back in December,1843,It still very much related to this very day. This book suits every era and even more now into the 21st century. It showed a great example what's is Christmas all about. Sharing,loving and giving...Charles Dicken's timeless classic about a miser,Ebenezer Scrooge whom couldn't understand the true spirit of Christmas. However with helps from 3 Spirits(ghosts) namely Ghost of Christmas Past,Ghost of Christmas Present and Ghost of Christmas Future,each showing him envisions of his past,present and what will happened if he continue being mean and a miser.He came to face up with his pasts, realised his mistakes and turned a new leaf and became grateful to life and learn to be loving and giving. He also learnt to be appreciate people around him and learnt to share his life with his nephew and helped less fortunate people like Tiny Tim. Eventually he honour Christmas in his heart.May Dicken's brilliant prose always be remembered. I quote: &quot;I have endeavoured in this Ghostly little book, to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.&quot; CD"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"ALmost everyone knows the story of the Christmas Carol, either through the muppets or Bill Murray, but few haave read the book.You should read this book, unlike many of Dickens other books it is simple and not over long. He simply tells the way it happened and no flowery writting, plus many scenes that are skipped in almost every version."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I think A Christmas Carol is the most detailed book I think I have ever read. It was filled with a lot of literary techniques. I could just picture the evnts happening in my mind.

This is distracting and slows the pace of the book.Everything runs together. The entire book from the preface to the end reads like one chapter without a break."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"\\"Every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips, should be boiled with hisown pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart!\\"Next to the birth of Jesus, this has to be the most popular Christmas story. It has been adapted into so many variations (my favorite is \\"Mickey's Christmas Carol.\\"). However, the story still remains fresh and a pleasure to read.A short novel, this is still classic Dickens. His characters have depth and even insignificant characters are given a human quality. Of course, the curmudgeon Scrooge and his transformation is the focus of the novel, and Dickens delivers an enthralling, somewhat eerie story as the wraiths (spirits) of Christmas attempt to instill a human warmth in Scrooge's cold heart.There is nothing new or earth-shattering in the novel. Almost all the adaptations have more or less adapted the text of Dickens novel. There are a few extra places and people that are visited that don't appear the movie adaptations. However, overall it is the same story that you know and love, and a great way to get into the Christmas spirit."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Christmas Carol, written by Charles Dickens is a book of being given a second chance. Ebenezer Scrooge, the main character of the book, is a grumpy old man who feels he has no time for anyone. As an owner of a firm called Scrooge and Marley's, Scrooge runs the business while Marley has been dead. On Christmas Eve, exactly seven years from Marley's death, his ghost visits Scrooge. He tells him that soon three different ghost will visit him during the night.As promised, the ghosts of the past, present, and the future visit Scrooge. He is visited by the ghosts because of his rude attitude and his disregard for anyone's attempt to be nice, which we all find ourselves doing now and then. The past shows Scrooge how he used to be, which was somewhat pleasant but still lonely for Scrooge. The present shows Scrooge his actions in a way Scrooge has never realized, most of which are to his dislike. The future shows the time when Scrooge is dead and no one cares for him, actually they are happy that he is gone. All of these visions has Scrooge sobbing in tears and ready to make changes in his life.The book is cleverly written and fun to read. It often makes you put yourself into Scrooge's situations. My favorite part of the book is when Scrooge visited the past. I think it would be great to revisit all of the things you used to have in life. My least favorite part of the book is when Scrooge is dead in the future, instead of mourning, everyone is interested in his death will. It would be horrible to leave earth in such a way that all anyone wants is your money.As far as recommending the book for others, I believe its a great story especially for the holidays. If you are into the Christmas glee spirit then you would like the book, especially the ending. A Christmas Carol can make you angry, cry and laugh all throughout the book. Its a story of one man whos favorite words, \\"Bah Humbug\\" becomes sincere and realizes all that he can accomplish in life."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I've always liked the story of \\"A Christmas Carol\\", whether it was a live action film version, the Muppet version, the Disney animated version, even one of the dozens of sitcom parodies. I finally got round to reading the original, and I quite enjoyed it. Even though I'd seen and heard so many versions of the story, reading it was still very special.It's a tale about a man called Ebenezer Scrooge, who runs a business successfully and tightly. A little too tightly, most would say. Though he has a lot of money, he has none to spare for charity. Though he has a lot of time to himself, he has none to spare for his cheerful nephew. Christmas is coming, and Scrooge wishes it was over. What reason does everyone have to be so cheery? What reason do they have to stop work and get in the way of his business? He's pretty cemented in his views, though he and his worldview begins to crack the night he is visited by four ghosts. The first is the chained ghost of his dead business partner, Jacob Marley, and the other three the Ghosts of Christmas: The Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come. He is shown the beauty in all that he has criticized, the joy in things he has forgotten, and the grief his crabby ways have caused himself and others.The book is a little different from all the interpretations I have seen, but not by too much. The Ghost of Christmas Present takes Scrooge to a lot more places, like over the sea to a Christmas party on a ship, for instance. Dickens is warm and wordy here, and captures the bustle, the sights, the sounds and the tastes of Christmas very well. This is not the tacky, forced Christmas cheer you see on some television specials. Not at all.Even though it's a lot shorter than many of his other books, Dickens still pays attention to his characters. Even the minor ones have a personality in the few words Dickens uses to describe them. Being short, it doesn't take too long to read. It's divided into five \\"Staves\\", one for each of the four ghostly encounters and the ending, which helps build the anticipation up as you read, and makes it easy to find your favorite part later. There are also a few illustrations by John Leech, which are nice.It's definitely worth reading, if you're interested. It's pretty cheap here on amazon, so even if you're Scrooge you'll be getting a good deal!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"the author is Charles dickens. there are 112 pges. the story begins w/ scrooge in his counting-house on a frigid, foggy christmas eve in london. the characters are: scrooge, bob cratchit, tiny tim, jacob marely, the ghosts of christmas past, present, and future, fred, fezziwig, belle, peter cratchit, martha cratchit, the portly gentlemen, and mrs. cratchit. the setting is one frigid, foggy christmas eve in london to a happy but still cold christmas day. the beginning of the plot starts by an old man named scrooge, a very greedy person who hates christmas and loves money, counting his money in a counitng house. the rising action is: the mean old man is haunted by four ghost, including Bob marely. this book is very inspiring book to those who are mean greedy of money and those especially that hate christmas.i like this book because i used to take christmas as a day of juss getting presents and it taught me that christmas is really about love and family. this book showed me that even though they give me a cheap gift but to thank the person fer giving it to me. like the saying goes,: \\"its the thoght that counts.\\" if you are a hater or that u dont really care about christmas, read this book. it will changhe ur thought aboput christmas. this book is very interesting. readers all over the world should read it. this book teaches people that take Christmas fer granted a lesson. this book inspires, teches, and somewhat entertains. read dis book! and you'll think so 2."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Written in the mere span of two weeks by the author, this novella has become an instant immortal classic in western literature, pratically on the shelf with Shakespeare's opuses. It is a great moral coral, without banal preaching, it shows brilliantly by example and ghostly characters, not by bulky prose, for this reason, this carol will never loose its appeal or be slammed with a door in the noise...you'll find no corny holiday reciting here, only a powerful masterwork that will endure so as long as there is an English language or books to read."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"With the myriad excellent film and stage versions of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" out there, the enduring power of Dickens' prose is often overlooked. If you've never read the original (or haven't since junior high), do yourself a favor and pick it up. You'll be amazed how relevant some of the social criticism from over 150 years ago seems, not to mention how funny Dickens' wry wit can be.There's a reason this story has stuck around for a century and a half, and it's not the admirable efforts of the like of Alistair Sim, George C. Scott, or Patrick Stewart. It's Mr. Dickens, The Imitable Boz, himself. Get to know him."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Dickens, it's said, created the British image of Christmas.It would be a ridiculous but interesting challenge to name the world's most successful or influential work of fiction, but if it were attempted, this novella would be a strong contender. Crafted with all the brilliant wit and imagery of which Dickens was capable, it chronicles the redemption of an aging skinflint, rendered bitter and cruel by his passion for money, to whom life has become a trudge towards the grave.Joy and love Ebenezer Scrooge has barred from his life, and for this, as his dead partner's ghost warns him, he is doomed to wander the Earth after death, chained by his hoarded loot. Yet he is to be rescued by the spirit - spirits actually: three of them - that burn hot and bright with forgiveness and hope amid the snow and of this darkest, final month.Dickens wrote this tale as a protest in 1843, against the even then growing obsession with material wealth, and neglect of life's freely given riches. Tnd today its message is as strong and apt as ever. To me, Christmas has not arrived until I've seen it told yet again in one of its many film adaptations, be it the black & white 1951 version starring Alastair Sim, or one of the later versions in which George C. Scott, Albert Finney, Patrick Stewart and many others have portrayed the old miser.

I did that already (see my other reviews to read that), and, of course, I gave it 5 stars.What I'd like to comment on is the extra's this version brings. For instance, the original art work from the first edition by artist John Leech are here, placed where they were originally. There are also the actual 1843 and 1844 critics reviews in this book so one can see what was originally thought about this classic at the time of its release.Author Richard Kelly gives his perspective on the reasoning behind Dickens writing this ghostly Christmas story - the why's and wherefore's of the characters and scenes, which, for me, gave a little more of an understanding of what may have been going through Mr. Dickens mind at the time.Mr. Kelly also writes a bit on child labor, education, and the workhouse, which, again, opens the mind a bit more in reading this story.There is also a chapter that has many writings by Dickens contemporaries, such as Washington Irving, and their own descriptions of Christmas in their time.Believe it or not, there is quite a bit more in this book than what I've told you, including, of course, &quot;Carol&quot; itself. It makes a very interesting read and can help one to understand the purpose behind Dickens original classic, as well as of the times in which he wrote.A lot to read at a very good price.

Mesmerized by the three ghosts, the stinginess of Ebenezer Scrooge, and the frailty of Tiny Tim, I kept the book beside my bed, tucked under the lamp on the night stand close at hand in the family home in Iowa. When the situation seemed unbearable within the walls where the family quarreled daily, I would read it, and imagine myself freed from the hatred around me.When I began teaching at a small rural Iowa college. I risked everything to introduce A Christmas Carol to my students as representative of 19th century England: the work houses, the potato famine and hunger, the miserliness of those with financial means to stay aloof from the ever-increasing poor. Reading Dickens' Christmas Carol enabled many to discover that life had not changed that much. At night, when I would return to my small apartment on the second floor of an old wooden house, buffeted by harsh winds and empty space, prepared a cup of potato soup or wheat gruel for supper, I began to feel myself to be an ever increasing part of Dickens' tale.Later when I taught at major universities in the USA and abroad, the Dickens classic was my constant companion. When I taught English history or English literature it was required reading. Discussions turned to interpretation and the book's relationship to the present clime and time: we went through the counting houses of banks, the dark alleys where the gin-soaked poor brought stolen goods to those who would resell, and the holes where prostitutes earned a scant living, much as occurs today. Of course I encouraged my students to also read Hard Times, Oliver Twist and other Dickens classics to discover the misery of the Industrial Age and the scorn the rich had for the poor, outsourcing jobs, lending money at usurious rates, and the calloused treatment of employees. Things had not changed much, and personal choice was only for the wealthy who counted for about 1% of the people.At sixty I moved to one of the poorest, most heavily impoverished nations where crime is a daily routine, education at best a joke, and plagiarism expected and condoned by teachers at all levels. In 2007, after Antonio Chang enforced the law to test all teachers in Peru, when I learned that only 151 out of more than 185,000 teachers who were tested for basic compentency had passed, I offered to teach the teachers. My first book of choice was A Christmas Carol as it covers every art and literary aspect of dialogue and education. I am still teaching the teachers--the few who allow me the honor, while most prefer to stay at home or travel to a second and/or third school to teach for additional income. I am still using Charles Dickens' stellar work. I pull out my weathered copy of A Christmas Carol and read it to my students and collegues, and then show the George C. Scott rendition of the classic that is now on DVD and fortunately is available at Amazon.com. Several students swiftly see the similarity between 19th century London and contemporary Peru where survival remains the primary goal and the only source of hope was within the walls of churches. Unfortunately the 1% of Peru who own the means of production and wealth have not yet met the Ghost of Christmas Past and the clergy they sit in front of like marble statues are more like Dostoyovsky's Grand Inquistor in his classic The Brothers Karamazov than the pastor in Dickens' Christmas Carol.A Christmas Carol is mandatory reading in my English classes. Passing any course I teach requires a demonstrative ability to show the relevance of the Dickens' classic about Ebeneezer Scrooge to the twenty-first century elites who still rule over lives and destinies.Today the students at my university in the north of Peru, are working to help the very poor nestled on a small hill in front of the great gates to this privately-owned center of learning to plan for running water and a sewer, to go to school, to look for better jobs, and improve their lot in life. The wasteland that many have moved to in order to escape the depression in the mountains is but a mirror of the rampant poverty of the shanties surrounding Lima, but in each case A Christmas Carol's presentation of the poor districtions of London are easily understood by the poor of Peru, and Ebeneezer's epiphany is readily known and hoped for as a better future for all. Peru has a long way to go before it will climb out of the abyss it is in because of a too-long history of rule by dictators and teachers who occupied classrooms for the limited money but without any skills to impart knowledge, A Christmas Carol gives hope to those who seek a better life, and the Ghost of Christmas past still has its finger pointing at marked graves at those who have no charity, no compassion,no sense of feeling. Dickens' tale will help change that and I will teach it as long as there is breath in this old body."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"One of the classics, a must read.It's a nice warming Christmas story about old uncle Scrooge.

The Eyewitness Classics edition (ISBN 0789420708) of this popular Christmas story by Dickens has been \\"translated\\" for a younger audience, offering much historical background and outstanding illustrations while sticking closely to the original dialogue and format. With modern illustrations by Andrew Wheatcroft, this edition also features some of the engravings from the period in explanatory sections which are interleaved with the Dickens story.As the chapters of Dickens's classic unfold, the child reader also learns about Dickens's London, with paragraphs about the city and its smells and the emphasis on work for all, including children. Subsequent sections contrast the working poor with the rich, delving into the subjects of workhouses and prisons, the 7-day workweek for servants, and the lives of businessmen. When Marley's ghost appears, the reader learns about the recording of deaths in a registry--along with the meaning of \\"grindstone,\\" the importance of Christmas charity, and the custom of servants taking the master's clothes, with the remainder going to \\"rag and bone shops.\\"As the three spirits appear, additional information is provided about clothing, dances and games, foods (roast goose, Christmas pudding, and chestnuts), Christmas gifts and trees, and even about the \\"crutches and frames\\" used by Tiny Tim. Dickens's biography is mentioned briefly, with a stress on his childhood and work history, along with notes about various film versions of this and other Dickens stories, including photos of some of the stars who have played Scrooge.Graphically, this edition is a winner, with beautifully reproduced illustrations, a newspaper-style paste-up (with boxes, sidebars, and text and pictures set at angles to attract attention), and excellent clarity and color. Parents, grandparents, and friends looking for an edition which will prepare children to love a stage or film version of this classic will be richly rewarded by this edition. And I can attest that one active, nine-year-old boy named Bailey sat spellbound (and silent) for a recent stage production which lasted over two hours because he read this first and knew what the action meant. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"my class had to read this book for lit. class this year. although many thought this book boring and stupid, i loved it. i loved all the characters like fezziwig and scrooge. it amazed me when out teacher told us dickens never went to school. i think everyone should read this classic, because it changed my way of thinking and helped open many ideas to me. read this! itz not only a christmas story, but a story of repentance that should be enjoyed all year round."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Master storyteller and social critic, Charles Dickens, turns this social treatise on shortcomings of Victorian society into an entertaining and heartwarming Christmas ghost story which has charmed generations and become an icon of Christmas traditions. Who, in the Western world has not heard, &quot;Bah, Humbug!&quot; And who can forget the now almost hackneyed line of Tiny Tim, &quot;God bless us, every one!&quot; or his cheerfully poignant observation, that he did not mind the stares of strangers in church, for he might thus serve as a reminder of He who made the lame, walk and the blind, see. Several movie versions: musical, animated, updated, or standard; as well as stage productions (I recall the Cleveland Playhouse and McCarter Theatre\`s with fondess.) have brought the wonderful characterizations to the screen, as well as to life. This story of the redemption of the bitter and spiritually poor miser, and the book itself; however, is a timeless treasure whose richness, like Mrs Cratchit\`s Christmas pudding, is one that no production can hope to fully capture."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Charles Dicken's A Christmas Carol is by far one of the greatest holiday novels ever. It was first printed in the winter of 1843 and it is still in printing to this day. This classic story of Christmas joy and Christmas hate has been one of my favorite books of all time. The interaction between Ebenezer Scrooge and the supernatural is humorous and touching. When Scrooge sees the troubles the Crachits are having with money, tiny tim, etc., it is moving to see Scrooge change his way of treating bob and a number of other people. I hope that this novel will hold its ground as one of the greatest holiday novels man has known."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I chose this rating because it I was a great book.

Dickens' wonderful story about the meaning of the Christmas Spirit is a story that we all know, but if you haven't enjoyed the original version (or haven't for a long time) I strongly recommend you do so, and soon. While the cartoons and children's books get the general gist of the story across, they lack the subtle qualities that make it so beautiful and compelling in its original form. Heart-wrenchingly emotional scenes of Family and chuckle-inducing moments of humor propel you through this story that provides a powerful lesson for us all.Also, this short book provides an excellent example of the writing style of Dickens without getting into an 800+ page monstrosity that most of his other works are. You'll almost certainly find you love his subtle wit and dry sense of humor while reading this one, and I then encourage you to seek out those other monstrous and magnificent novels.Whether you buy it in this version, or another, get your hands on Dickens' original tale.

I also thought this would be an accessible way for them to get oriented to English literature and prepare them for further reading.The requirements of the Christmas Carol book to be purchased were that a) it be new as opposed to a ragged used copy, b) it be unabridged, c) it have good drawings; and d) if possible it be inexpensive. I first looked in the library, but their book was checked out, and anyway I was looking to start a family tradition of reading the story every year with our own copy if possible. The Candlewick Press edition with illustrations by P.J. Lynch appeared to fill the bill; I bought it; and it delivered the goods. The book is nice and readable-sized, the illustrations good, the type pleasing. Thirteen bucks. I was immensely satisfied with the purchase.As to the fate of the reading, we handled one chapter per evening, there being five chapters; each took an hour or so to read. I found Dickens to be sometimes heavy going for the younger TV and video-generation kids to get a sense of what is going on. I did not recollect Dickens to be so when I read some of his works as a younger person, but apparently it's something you have to be exposed to and get to understand. Anyway I was happy to provide my children with the chance to get started. It gave me a measure of the gap between the reading preparation of today's youth versus my pre-Cambrian elementary and middle school days. On Christmas Day I showed them the George C. Scott version of the movie, and they all liked it. But all knew the basics from the book, which was my goal, even if the mid-1800s prose obscured many of the action points to the younger ones in their Sponge Bob and Hannah Montana mindsets.So the effort was a success, and this edition of the book did what I had hoped by delivering up an excellent presentation at a very low cost.Dan of Arlington"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This e published version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is beautifully illustrated and an absolute joy to read. This is the first time I read this book. I expected a revision of Hollywood's version of this story. Obviously, no movie can do justice to any book or novel; this book is no exception. What is excellent about this version is that it gives a brief history of the historical background that Dickens' wrote his work in and the history of this timeless classic. There may be a minor ( and I mean minor issue) on two of the illustrations: Bob Cratchit carrying Tiny Tim on his shoulders and Scrooge raising his salary. The Kindle Fire version of all the illustrations are recreated perfectly. They are partially duplicated on the top third portion and look like the top third of the illustration is above the the whole of the image in the Kindle 3G Keyboard version. I think that the publisher should look into this. This is no reason to avoid purchasing this version. Again, this version is excellent!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"There is not exta narration through out which I LOVE! It gives you extras in the front of the book with a lil history, but they left the story untouched which is great. There is just enough illustration to give you a start, but otherwise it leaves the rest to your imagination"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I shopped around quite a bit for the \\"perfect\\" edition of Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\". I settled on this edition, and I couldn't be more pleased and satisfied. Quite simply, Candlewick produced a beautiful edition of this COMPLETE work. I stress complete, because as I was searching for a good edition, I discovered several others which were abridged. As best as I can tell, this edition has preserved the original work. The rest of my review will focus on the cosmetic aspects of this edition, and why it's perfect for me.The dust jacket is thick and gorgeous with detailed artwork. The title \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is raised and glossed (tho the rest of the cover is matte). Under the dust jacket I was surprised to see that the publisher made the hardcover appear like scrooges door with the marley knocker. The back cover is also made to look like the back of a door. You cannot turn a page of text in this book without seeing color artwork, of which the vast majority are highly detailed. There are also several pages dedicated only to artwork which is fun to admire.The page stock is very thick, and the typography fits very well by giving you an old world feel. The size of the words and spacing is typical of what you'd see in a young adult or early teen book. That's not to say there aren't plenty of reasons for an adult to love this edition. I have no regrets in regards to my purchase of this edition, and I trust that you will cherish it too."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A few years ago, I was in a production of A CHRISTMAS CAROL at my community's playhouse. One Sunday evening after the matinee and before the evening performance, I stopped in a Barnes&Noble; and decided to pick this book up. It looked like a beautiful adaptation of a classic holiday story that had made my Christmases special for years.I was not disappointed.Just take a second now to look at the cover of this book. Whether you have it in your hand, or you look at it on Amazon, just glance at it for a few seconds. Do you see the intricate detail artist Dean Morrissey puts in his illustration? The bricks on the wall, and shadow on Scrooge's face. The snow on the pavement on the ground. This intricate attention to detail is present throughout all of the illustrations. They are gorgeous, and they bring vibrant life to Dickens' classic.Now, for the treatment of Dickens' writing. This book is abridged, but is marvelously done. Many of the lines are Dickens' own, and all of the cuts come from lengthy descriptions that aren't essential to the story. Dickens' overall tone and beautiful use of language are present in this book, and they make the tale of Scrooge and his redemption as inspiring as it's ever been.This is a nice introduction if you've never read the Dickens original (though I can't imagine anyone hasn't). However, if you have read it, this is a must-own if you value Scrooge and his ghosts as an essential part of the holiday season, as I do."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Just as Clement Moore gave us the definitive Santa Claus in &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot;), Charles Dickens gave us the definitive Christmas spirit in his simple but charming novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. First published in 1843, this supernatural story of an elderly man's redemption from his mean-spirited, miserly ways takes place in Victorian London, but its universal theme of charity towards our fellow man has endeared this classic to many a generation around the globe. In addition to its priceless role as a morality tale, the book colorfully describes the Yuletide customs practiced in England during the early nineteenth century. This Washington Square Press edition of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; is unabridged, yet you can understand why so short a book is yet published in abridged versions, especially for schoolchildren. Not infrequently, Dickens veers from the main story line and goes into tangents of a philosophical or descriptive nature, much like the converser who abruptly changes the subject only to return to it with the familiar &quot;Anyway, ... &quot;. I assume children (and some adults) may find these tangents cumbersome and distracting, but they are still useful in that they reflect Dickens' thoughts while writing the book. It may still be difficult for some of us to think that cold-hearted Christmas-bashers like Ebenezer Scrooge exist, but look at human nature around you, and it will be difficult no more. At a time when &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; is being supplanted by a more vague &quot;Happy Holidays&quot;, and the season gives way to coarse behavior and unchecked materialism, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; is the perfect guidebook to put things into perspective."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Has any story been copied more times than A Christmas Carol? It seems almost every year there is a new movie version. And how many sitcom characters have been visited by the ghosts of Christmas? It all starts to get a little tiring at times, but the original never does. This story is beautiful. No matter how many clumsy knockoffs try to capitalize on the idea and no matter how many dance numbers it inspires, the integrity of this classic will endure. Read it again, and introduce it to your children, too."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The combination of the unabridged (un-sanitised) version of Dickens' work, thorough background material, and quite delightful illustrations makes this volume a perfect Christmas gift or addition to one's own collection."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I never read the book and wanted a Kindle version that nicely presented with a few illustrations. This one was it. Great storyline. No wonder this a classic."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I imagine that almost every English speaking reader has seen one of the many, many versions of this classic put on film. It is one of my favorite stories and I have an old edition of it on my library shelf. But even with a copy in my collection, I was quite glad to add this one to my Kindle. The ability to rapidly look up some of the older Victorian English words and phrases with the built-in Kindle dictionary made reading it even more enjoyable. Plus, who can argue with the price (free)!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"\\"A Christmas Carol\\" represents not only Charles Dickens' most memorable work. but perhaps the most perfectly plotted story in the history of literature. What other tale has been retold so often, in movies, cartoons, etc.? The heart warming ending never loses its charm, and even for a jaded public that now largely shuns morality plays, the timeless message always finds a receptive audience.Because of the brevity of this story, which is not one of Dickens' colossal novels, the deep complexity of the characters is slightly lacking, as is the terrific humor found in his longer works. Still, the master managed to create a man that everyone can understand, and give him a believable history in comparably few pages. He also bestowed an unforgettable name upon him, that melded seamlessly with his personality.This story can still inspire, and lift the spirits of any reader. What more could we possibly ask of any writer?"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Its amazing to get many classic stories for free and getting them through amazon and reading them on your kindle is not only easy, its easy to read and the way things are going to go. The story was classic and I highly suggest downloading as many of the free classics as possible."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"First of all I have to observe that Charles Dickens was born almost two hundred years ago, minus one year. That is just amazing! The man was taken out of school before he was eleven and yet managed to begin publishing his work at twenty-one, and finally being able to turn around the course of his family's debt at the age of thirty when he published this book. There's something to be learned from his life as well as from this book.For those of you not familiar with the book, it is a story about a man named Ebenezer Scrooge, who is a miserly individual who, one Christmas-Eve Night is visited by the ghost of his long dead partner Jacob Marley. His partner is there to tell him that he will be visited by three ghosts, (the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Christmases Yet to Come) in order to show him the error of his stingy and cold ways.The images Mr. Dickens produces with his words are astounding. I could see the night sky swimming with forlorn spirits bemoaning the good they never did in life! My heart ached for the girl realizing the man she loved was no longer the man before her. I laughed at the Christmas antics of Fred's guests, and felt the pain of a parent loosing their child when the ghost showed it to Scrooge. It moved me as only a truly talented author can move a reader, despite the century and decades separating our lives. Though it is writen in the third person, the author engages the reader personally, speaking to you and giving his own personal opinion on a subject. It was the first time I've observed that kind of writing to be honest. For example when discribing Scrooge's nephew at Christmas the author writes that if you should know someone more blessed in a laugh than Fred, to introduce them and the narrator would cultivate the friendship.I have to say that all the Christmas Specials on T.V. can not compare to reading the original work. The adaptations do well, but so much has to be left out or changed!Admittedly, his way of spinning a sentence is much different from today. There are times I had to re-read a sentence or two to understand it better, not because it was written badly, but because the speech of the day has changed. I found it a pleasant challenge though, and not too daunting in the long run cause he makes his world so vivid with life and action, you can see it all and even if the words said aren't exactly clear, the overall idea of what is going on is clear.Not surprising, I would give this a five-star review! It is well written, has vivid images, believable characters, and flows well. I would highly recommend it, but maybe caution the reader to have a dictionary on hand for any words that might be unclear. Without one, I'm afraid the reader might find it more of a challenge than they thought. I look forward to reading it again when Christmas time rolls around again, and maybe even before if I have the time!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Each Christmas I enjoy seeing again the several versions of this Dickens short novel. I read the work along with all of Dickens' other fiction, in a 10 volume gift set received 40 years ago, but long since lost in house movings. When I noticed A Christmas Carol in among the Kindle free book offerings, it was time to revisit this lovely classic.

And inspirational.It's a cool way to end the year with reflection on how we lived up to that point and also to begin the new year as we ponder how we want to live going forward.Get this book. It's free. And it's good, moving, Christmas literature."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"For many years, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, has been considered a classic Christmas novel. In America, people are becoming increasingly busy and more concerned with themselves around Christmas time. The spirit of Christmas is making its way out of the American culture and becoming a distant memory. A central theme in \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the renewal of this spirit as depicted in the life of the main character Ebeneezer Scrooge.The setting for A Christmas Carol is in London, England during the 19th century. At the time, England was undergoing an industrial revolution. Money was to be made! I feel such is the case today as technology is revolutionizing the way business is run in today's society. The main character, Ebeneezer Scrooge, is a money dealer who, along with his business partner Jacob Marley, gave loans to various people and institutions needing financial assistance. Over the years and after the death of his business partner, the love of money hardened the heart of this once cheerful man. I was reminded, while reading, how money hardens people's heart is found in the world today. Scams are becoming an increasingly popular topic in the news. Truly, money is the root of all evil (1 Timothy 6:10). Throughout the course of this book, Scrooge experiences a change of heart while he reviews Christmas memories and once again discovers what it is like to feel and live the Christmas spirit. As I read this book, I felt that desire--the desire to rediscover what it feels like to live the Christmas spirit. While reading this book, I felt the emptiness that comes when one is focused solely inward during the Christmas season and the joy comes when the spirit of Christmas motivates one to lift and serve others.I am a lover of good literature. Recently, I have noticed myself becoming busier during the Christmas season than in past years. While reading of Scrooges' Christmas memories, I couldn't help but put myself in his shoes. By so doing, the spirit of Christmas returned to my life. What a difference that made in my enjoyment of the Christmas season! I recognized what was truly important--remembering Christ by serving others. This book is a great read for anyone; especially those who feel they have lost the Christmas spirit and have the desire to rekindle it again."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Reading Dickens was hard at first, but he is a wonderful story teller.

I did enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"never read. enjoyed readig on of the classics at christmas time. i like to read on my kindle now o"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I've seen it so many times, as musical, drama, TV and in film, parody and straight interpretation.

Very much. It preserves the poignancy of lost time and redemption that is at the heart of Scrooge's story - even more than a religious message. Dickens addresses the reader directly, and there is more humor than most adaptations show.This edition has an interesting account of the first time Dickens read the story to a general audience - the beginning of Dickens' career in performing his work which proved almost as lucrative as the mere writing of it."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I was impressed with the quality of the book for the money. Looks great on the end table during Christmas."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I give this five stars as much for its compact form as its literary value. To write a compelling story in 300 pages is difficult, but certainly possible; to weave a complex tale in under 100 requires much greater skill. Dickens does just that, drawing you in with a sparseness of prose that is wonderful. Over-explanation has been excised, and we the reader benefit.Having seen at least five variations on this story, I was surprised at just how simple the source material was. Clean, clear, subtle, and leaving far more to imagination than description, this was a wonderful Christmas read. What else is there to say? It's Dickens in under 100 pages; this is not to be missed."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This story has become an icon for Christmas. The story is well known, but I realized sitting in the new movie with Jim Carrie, I had never read the story itself. How could I judge a movie or play without knowing the written original? There is no way a true critique of a movie or play could be done without having a passing knowledge of the original, especially, since the orginal was presented as a written story.The new movie does follow the written word closely. The plays do not, but they try and do a good job of getting the jist of the story.As for the story, I find it a bit to goody, goody. Scrooge would not turn his life around so thoroughly from such a night of dreams. He is who he is and has been for a very long time. 'Old habits die hard' is not just an old saying. Scrooge has been thinking his frugal thoughts for most of his life and I just do not think he would be able to change so radically so fast. Another problem is Tiny Tim. He may be lovable, but what would move Scrooge to feel so sorry for him? He sees him for only a moment, would it be enough in reality?These questions are irrelevant, but I had them, so I thought I would voice them."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Christmas Carol, in my opinion, is one of the most perfect stories of all time. I first read it so long ago, and I am devoted to watching every convoluted Christmas movie ever made based on it!This Enriched Classics version is perfect for me. It provides an excellent refresher on the life and times of Charles Dickens, without hitting the reader over the head with an outrageous data-dump of factoids that contribute nothing to your enjoyment of the author and his story.This book would be a well-appreciated gift for any fan of Dickens. Even if you own another version of A Christmas Carol, this affordable and portable history belongs in your collection."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"We have long loved this book. I was charged by my family to find a good copy, beautiful and legendary, to replace the hardback collection we picked up used somewhere many years ago. The old copy was falling apart, kind of sterile. This new book is beautiful. The pictures are great. The text easy on the eyes. Everything working together to make a special edition to our family and one we hope to continue to read annually. I succeeded in satisfying the charge given to me. Great for a gift."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The book was delivered on time as promised and arrived in great shape.

So when I finally did read it (now in my 40s!), I found it very familiar. It was enjoyable to read in the original 1840s language. I marveled at how innovative Dickens was more than 150 years ago with this very original ghost story.[...]"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Jonathan Winters is a tremendously talented comedian, but he also makes an excellent well-rounded actor as this recordings demonstrates. His Scrooge is mean, troubled and seemingly irredeemable but as Mr. Winters makes his way through the story he shows us a quite complex and interesting portrait of the infamous miser. Just so you know there is a female actress to do the female parts and there is music and sound effects throughout the story to make it well paced and impossible to take your ears off of it. Although I don't want to give too much away Mr. Winters gives a Ghost Of Christmas Present with a Scottish accent! This is a wonderful way to help celebrate Christmas!I never thought I'd find something to rival Patrick Stewart's one man show, but this is a thoroughly entertaining production especially considering the \\"reader\\" is American!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A holiday staple in my home, I re-read it every year.

Good read for sitting around the Christmas Tree."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I can't believe that I hadn't read this classic. Although I knew all about the story from the various films on the subject, I couldn't put it down and actually shed a few tears.

Scott, and the Muppets are my favorites, in that order), but I always meant to read the story myself. And now I have. I will probably never read it again, but that doesn't mean I don't think you shouldn't read it. If only to see what liberties the filmmakers took.Truth be told, these free classics for Kindle are a wonderful resource we should take advantage of while they're available. I've downloaded about 20 books on my reading list. I read A Christmas Carol first because it's seasonal, plus I can't seem to find the Alistair Sim version of the film anywhere."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Great seasonal read about the joy of giving and a life well spent in spite of past regrets.

Of course it is well written, it would not have risen to it high status without being so. If you've seen any version of the movie, take the time to read the book.

We're in the middle of a heat wave and I decided to reread it just to cool off, and was as charmed by this classic tale as ever. What I noticed more in this reading, though, was the gentle humor. In the past, I focused more on the negativity of Scrooge and his redemption. This time, I focused on the humor, from almost slapstick to sarcastic, that Dickens infused throughout. For such a short story, it's really packed, and the language is a wonderful refreshment after today's crisp writing style. I know that Dickens was paid by the word, but he didn't waste a single one. If you have a child who can read at 6th grade level, who is stuck on low-level series, try them out on this. If you're a child at heart, try yourself!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This was a Christmas gift that hit the mark. The pictures were very good and augmented the story.

I did enjoy the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, it is a very famous and well known story, so i didn't really have to focus on what was happening and instead I focused on the beauty of the writing. I see why Dickens was so famous and I will be reading some more of his work in the future."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"After many years of watching the different versions of a Christmas Carol, I came across this version. It was free, and I thought it would be a novel idea to READ the book this past year and not just watch a movie. What a thrill it was! It is often said, \\"the book is better than the movie.\\", and likewise this is so true! This book captures the essences so much more than any version I have ever seen. Though, in my opinon, the Christmas Carol starring George C Scott is the closest to this orginal writing. The book was so enjoyable, it has me downloading other classics that we tend to default to movie versions. Little Women, here I come!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Charles Dickens's classic novel, A Christmas Carol, is his most famous and beloved story. Millions around the globe have read this touching book, about brotherly love and charity, since it was first published. Countless people have seen Ebenezer Scrooge, the selfish and unkind man, transform in to a kind and generous person by the visits of four mysterious ghosts.The story begins in the afternoon of a frigid Christmas Eve, as a mean-spirited man named Ebenezer Scrooge sits in his office. Scrooge is a cold-hearted and selfish miser, who isn't in the spirit of Christmas. Every so often, he shouts, \\"Bah!\\" or \\"Humbug!\\" He doesn't even buy coal for the fireplace, so he and his clerk freeze away. No one likes him, and no one stands up to him. Dickens describes him thus: \\"No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge.\\" However, this is exactly what Scrooge wants - to be in his own world.Dickens starts out the story by stating that Scrooge's former partner, Jacob Marley, is dead. Then, he reverts back to what Scrooge is up to. As it is Christmas Eve, Scrooge isn't happy. He scares all the carolers away, and refuses to donate money to the poor. When the day is finally over, he goes back to his house, and tries to go to sleep. As he locks the door, he sees an apparition. There is Jacob Marley's ghost - looking right at him! Scrooge is shocked at first, and still is shocked when Marley's phantom tells him some surprising news. The ghost explains that there will be three other ghosts yet to come: the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Future. Then, he leaves.As promised, the ghosts of the past, present, and the future visit Scrooge. The ghost of the past shows Scrooge how he used to be. Scrooge discovers that his life was somewhat pleasant, but still lonely. The ghost of the present reveals to Scrooge his more recent attitude toward Christmas. It shows Scrooge the consequences of his actions, most of which are to Scrooge's dislike. The ghost also informs Scrooge how other people are celebrating. Dancing, playing blind man's buff, and caroling aren't part of Scrooge's world for certain. The ghost of the future shows the time when Scrooge is dead and no one cares for him; actually everyone is happy that he is gone. Meanwhile, all of these visions have Scrooge sobbing in tears and he is finally ready to make changes in his life. After the final ghost leaves, Scrooge runs about his little town donating money, greeting people, and visiting his nephew and clerk's family. It turns out to be a very happy Christmas after all.I liked A Christmas Carol very much. Charles Dickens's style is very descriptive. I especially liked the vivid verbs and adjectives Dickens used when he described Scrooge as a \\"squeezing, wrenching, gasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner!\\" As for Scrooge, I liked him a lot. The book was funny when he said something completely nonsensical like \\"Bah!\\" or \\"Humbug!\\" On a scale of one through ten, I would give A Christmas Carol a ten. It was enjoyable and interesting to read, especially over winter break, as it heartens the spirit of Christmas itself."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is the book to read if you ever need to get in the Christmas spirit. Everybody goes through the holidays and becomes a &quot;scrooge&quot; at least once during the season. Though we aren't as bad as Ebenezer, we still need the realization of the Christmas spirit to set us right again. Reading the classic story of Ebenezer's adventures with the three Christmas spirits will bring warmth and happiness back into our hearts. It will be easier to give and be gracious, we will be grateful for everything we have, and we will remember what Christmas is all about. Thanks to Dickens for writing a masterpiece especially for this time of year."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is a truly remarkable story. Though this is a Christmasstory, there is no religious thing and it reminds us what trulyimportant is. You can find out your own heart warmingChristmas memory with Scrooge.

This is a trulyuniversal story regardless of nations, cultures, and religions,I believe.It just happened on Chirstmas."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is a great book by Charles DIckens.

Just kidding on that last sentance, but being a mean person will come back to get you in various ways."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The one question I continually asked myself while reading this was 'why didn't I read this any sooner?!?!'. I won't go into the plot, because I'm sure everybody knows the concept of this book. I've seen so many television and movie versions of A Christmas Carol, that I decided to sit down and read the original, and I'm sure glad I did. Not only does this book have a great lesson to it, but it is also beautifully written. I think everyone should read this book - and not just at Christmas time. Sure, the story takes place at Christmas, but it's a great book to read any time. I highly recommend it!!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is Charles Dickens' best christmas story. Only David Copperfield tops this story. Mr. Dickens teaches the reader that no matter how much money or position we have, no matter how important we feel, no matter how much cynicism we have, life will come right out in front of us with a big wham!! Tiny Tim is compassion, Mr. Cratchit is hope, Fizziwigg is happiness. And all these things are life at its best. A Christmas Carol is the true feeling and hope and love. Make this short story your hope."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Christmas Carol is about an old bitter man named Scrooge, who in decades has not showed any compassion to any living creature for uncountable years. Ebenezer Scrooge owns a firm called Scrooge and Marley - Jacob Marley being his business partner and sole confidant who passed away years ago. On the night of Christmas Eve, while preparing to retire from his busy workday, he hears boisterous noises and frustrated and frightened answers simply by Bah! Humbug's! Marley's ghost, tied to heavy chains, appears in front of the stupefied Scrooge and alerts him that three ghosts will be visiting him that night and he must follow and obey them in order for him not to suffer the same consequence as his partner Marly. That night all of the three visit and show him his past, present, and future. Scrooge, alarmed from his future outcome changes to become the caring, charitable, and socially conscious man he was years before. Christmas morning he shocks everyone around with his Christmas spirit. Later that morning he gives Bob Cratchit - worker of Scrooge - the honor of being his equal partner in the firm and gives Cratchit's children the best Christmas they'd ever been the witness to.I enjoyed A Christmas Carol very much, I give this piece of Charles Dickens work five stars because it is a heart warming, extremely well written novel that anyone and everyone should read in their lifetime."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The story A Christmas Carol written by Charles Dickens was a great story to read. My favorite part was at the end when the ghost of Christmas yet to come scared Scrooge. That ghost was also my favorite character. It took place in England. In the beginning of the story, Scrooge was being mean to all the people at his job. He went home and was having a bowl of soup when he heard chains rattling. He looked at the door and it flung open and Marly's ghost came through the door. The ghost explained he was going to be visited by three spirits. In the middle of the night the first ghost came the ghost of Christmas past. He showed him all the things he did wrong to other people. All of a sudden he awoke in bed and thought it was all a dream until the second ghost came. It was the ghost of Christmas present he showed Scrooge how poor all the other families were because of him and all of a sudden he woke up in bed again. The clock struck and another ghost appeared. He was the ghost that Scrooge was scared of the most. He showed Scrooge all the horrible things that happen and he shows Scrooge's employee. He goes to Cratchit's house and has a party. To conclude the story A Christmas Carol was an exciting story to read and you should read this book."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"\\"You will be haunted by Three Spirits.&quot; So forewarns Jacob Marley's ghost to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge, a miser of stingy, unfavorable traits. And so begins the enduring Christmas classic distinguished by almost everyone. Come along on an erratic journey with the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future, all of whom attempt to point Scrooge onto a virtuous path. Meet the most notable characters ever introduced in literature: Bob Cratchit, angelic Tiny Tim, and good-natured Fred. With vivid descriptions of Victorian England and enlightening dialogue, 'A Christmas Carol' will enrapture both the young and old throughout the year with a vital lesson on hope and benevolence for humanity. This, I find, is treasured most of all in this brief story marvelously crafted by the creative Charles Dickens. No matter how many adaptations of the book one has seen on television or as films, the real source is highly recommended and should not be missed. For if you do pass the book up, you are being just a Scrooge (metamorphically speaking, of course!).--P.J.

We enjoyed the story and enjoyed the narrator's classic telling of this classic story."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"In my life I'd heard about \\"A Christmas Carol\\" so many times I thought I'd actually read the story. Who has not heard the words: \\"Bah! Humbug\\" or known that Scrooge was one of the most disagreeable characters in literature? This story is fairly short and only takes a few hours to read but it will leave you with the hope that if Scrooge could change there is hope for everyone. The plot is simple. Scrooge is visited by his dead friend Marley who informs him that he will be visited by three spirits. These three spirits take him on different journey's to show him memories from his past, what is happening in the present and then what will happen in the future if he continues to live his life in a selfish way. During these journey's we get some insight into why Scrooge became such a horrid man. This story is great to read at Christmas time and it has a very happy ending.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Dickens' A Christmas Carol is a treasure, worth reading and rereading. The free electronic version has formatting issues, particularly with the placement of paragraph breaks and with indentation but it is still very readable. It has no illustrations."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Peculiar as it seems there is surprising and substantial spiritual consolation to be found in finally contriving to live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. Just look at old Scrooge, he whom foul weather didn't know where to have him. Every December I dig this miraculous story afresh and every December timeless new sentences ring out. I think this time through I especially love the way Dickens resoundingly hammers home the death of Jacob Marley right from the get go:\\"There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot--say Saint Paul's Chruchyard for instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.\\"Amen to that, Charley. With knobs on."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Released on December 17, 1843, A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens was a runaway success that changed the way England viewed and celebrated Christmas. In fact, the first Christmas Card appeared in 1843, illustrating a family drinking wine together, with a depiction of a charitable scene. It was precisely the vision of Christmas as a family occasion steeped in a spirit of goodwill to all men that Dickens espoused in the novel. To be fair to Sir Henry Cole and John Callcott Horsley, the creator and designer of the cards, their idea was in the works many years before Dickens was a writer.The story is a familiar one that you may know already. There have been many adaptations of the book produced, with my favorite being the 1951 version of the movie starring Alastair Sim. The essential story has also been intertwined into many tv series, soap operas, and sit-coms. Yet there is something compelling about reading the story as Dickens first told it - not just because he's a masterful storyteller, but symbolism and subtleties can't always be translated to the silver screen.All of the Ghosts who visited Scrooge on Christmas evening have symbolic appearances. Jacob Marley is chained down in his afterlife by all the financial appurtenances of his time. The Ghost of Christmas Past reflects a changing vision, depending on how you look at it. This spirit gives Scrooge a tour through his Christmas Pasts that he never quite considered before. The Ghost of Christmas Present is probably the most remarkable image of the spirits. His bounty represents that of Scrooge, whose wealth is only matched by his penuriousness. Meanwhile, the stark and sparse image of the Ghost of Christmas Future is that of death. As we suspect, and as Scrooge discovers later on, it is the aftermath of his own death that is being portrayed.There are some references that aren't well understood 170 years later, which makes a version of \`A Christmas Carol\\" with a Dickensian Glossary, like this book, a helpful post-mortem. There's even a reference to American History - in particular, the decision of Andrew Jackson to revoke the Charter of the Second National Bank and deposit gold bullion into local state banks. He put credit into the hands of local banks, some of whom abused the privilege by issuing the practically worthless securities mentioned by the novel.The story is only 126 pages long, which you can read slowly, and easily, in a week of commuting on the subway. You don't have much to lose - and possibly the spirit of Christmas to regain - by revisiting this all-time classic close to the form that it was first presented."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol has to be one of his most loved works and also one of the most widely known Christmas stories. Published in 1843, the novella tells the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a miser who is visited one Christmas Eve by four \\"spirits\\" whose mission is to save him from himself.In Mission Audio's audiobook edition of the story, narrator Simon Vance gives a phenomenal reading of the classic tale, complete with exceptional voices. The narration grabbed my attention right off and kept it through the very end. I gained new insight into the story because of the beautiful narration and was reminded of the importance of its message.Whether you've read the story before or not, I highly recommend this audiobook. You'll be inspired and uplifted.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this audiobook free from the christianaudio Reviewers Program. I was not required to write a positive review.

Through the visions of his dead partner, Jacob Marley, and three Ghosts, Scrooge is sent on the learning experience of a life.There is a reason why this book is so prevalent in our (Western) culture, how everyone, even those who've never read the novella/book, know the story so well (which is why this review will not have any spoiler notices). This story is a story that hits us to the core, that forces us to look outside our selfish lives and to think of others. And while the characters aren't the most nuanced, it is the story, it is the heart of the book that is most important and most inspiring.The characters are rather one-note, if you think about it. Scrooge is the only one that undergoes any change (somewhat expected, as it is a novel about his growth), but he starts out as the hideously over-done selfish man and ends up as the happiest, most joyful man in the world. Seeing his drastic change, however, does make the story more compelling, which is probably why Scrooge was painted so over-the-top in the beginning. From his little sister to Belle to Bob Crachit and his family, the characters tend to be blindly cheerful and happy despite their conditions. About the only one I can think of off the top of my head that isn't is Mrs. Crachit, who definitely harbors some resentment to Mr. Scrooge.But the remarkable thing about \\"A Christmas Carol\\" isn't the nuanced, varied characters, but the story, the journey, Scrooge's miraculous change. Reading it for the second time (I read it once in high school on my own), I was still touched and intrigued. I discovered more of the humor (the bit about Marley being more of \\"gravy than of grave\\"), the deeper meaning of the story. A lot of times, it seems that movies take the bits about Scrooge celebrating and honoring Christmas, and while that is an important theme, I thought the more important theme was to look out for your neighbor and open your heart.Scrooge was miserly, giving his employee a crappy wage (something like 15 shillings a week!). He refused to have anything to do with his nephew, he wouldn't give to the poor, and he had no compassion for beggars. While he lived in a huge home, he only lit a single candle and lived in a single room. And as the Ghosts reveal his past, present, and future, he slowly realizes, \\"Hey, I should have been nice to that kid on the street\\", \\"Hey, I wish I had agreed to visit my nephew\\", and \\"Hey, I should do something about my employee's work conditions\\".And that is why this book is so great, in my opinion. Christmas is one day and not everyone celebrates it the same way (or at all!); but kindness and generosity can be expressed ALL YEAR LONG and EVERYONE can share it. That is how I interpret it when Scrooge says, near the end: \\"I will honor Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year\\". Christmas isn't the Christian holiday, or the commercialized version that we see all around us; Christmas is the compassion we have to those around us.Brought to you by:*C.S.

At that point, I know I never really appreciated the beauty of his work and words. I recently listened to christianaudio's version of A Christmas Carol, which is one of their best audiobooks yet. Simon Vance's narration was excellent, with an engaging dramatization.At a recent Bible study, someone brought up how A Christmas Carol was particularly a message about caring for our neighbors. While most of us have heard the story many times, hearing Dickens' original words really sent the message about the power and importance of loving our neighbor. While God was never explicitly mentioned, the Gospel is written all over this classic.While it is a short book that can be easily found for free, christian audio is also offering it for free for this month!Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher.

It's too bad no one notices that the curmudgeon had a point-quite a few points, in fact. There can be no arguing with Dickens's wish to show the spiritual advantages of love. But there was no need to make the object of his lesson an entrepreneur whose ideas and practices benefit his employees, society at large, and himself. Must such a man expect no fairer a fate than to die scorned and alone? Bah, I say.

And what a delightful read it was! I laughed a lot through the opening (so clever and funny), I truly shuddered as the ghost of Jacob Marley was walking slowly up the stairs and dragging the chains behind him (really scary!), and I beamed my way through the last act-so thrilled for the outcome (that, by the way, we all already knew was coming...but the way it's written here makes it an even more joyous chapter than I expected). All in all, it's a grand Christmas book and timeless piece of literature that I would recommend to anyone.Just as a side note about the Bantam Classic edition also-this is a wonderful, small book with an enchanting cover (as you can see from the Amazon picture). The binding held up wonderfully for me through my first read (it still looks brand new). As a bonus, this version also contains a small biographical sketch on Dickens and a story about him reading this book aloud at a public reading.

(pun intended) It's a timeless tale that will last forever."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"If I could have only one book of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" this is the one that I would want. The illustrations are beautiful. The price was terrific. I liked mine so much that I ordered one for a friend. Love it."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"When starting this book I'd have never thought Scrooge would come up with a quotable line, but through the power of Dickens and the three Spirits, even Scrooge was a changed man!Of course just about anybody who celebrates Christmas and has paid attention to the world around them as they've grown up is familiar with the story of Ebenezer Scrooge as written by the genius Dickens. And most of us have been exposed to at least a few different versions of some animated or Hollywood version of the story. But anyone interested in a simple and short read at Christmas time would do well to treat themselves to the Dickens classic in its original written form. You'll likely not be disappointed as long as you're willing to understand that it's Dickens and it's written in his classic Victorian style, i.e., not a simplified Hollywood script. This was great fun to read and there are some very good points presented by the three Spirits that just about any of us - not just Scrooge - might be able to infuse into our lives at the Christmas time of year."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I needed this book for my book club, and decided to purchase one to keep long term. I read reviews about several different versions of \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" and finally settled on this one. Great price from Amazon ($12), and a beautiful book. Most of the other versions have a similar price tag, but are not hard bound with artwork. The artwork is amazing. There are pictures on almost every other page. This is a COMPLETE not abridged version of the story. It is still a very fast and enjoyable read. I would highly recommend this version. It is beautiful."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A beautifully written story much like the many movie and theatre versions you may have seen over the years.

I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Beautiful edition, excellent quality.The paper is high-quality and semi-gloss, the illustrations are particularly suggestive.

I was guilty of this myself and wanted to original story. I had seen some earlier versions in film, in black and white, that followed this original nearly word by word so that was refreshing to see that someone got it right. Of course, the premise of Scrooge has been done and overdone to the point of silliness these days, but now I know the version as it was orignally designed and perhaps can watch these film versions with that knowledge."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A true Christmas classic by Charles Dickens that can be read anytime of the year.

I looked at the book again today. The story itself is old and wonderful. I am truly astounded at the artist who painted the illustrations. I want to chop this book up too and frame the art. Incredible. This book is one that you won't want to bury on a shelf someplace but have it close at hand so you can revisit England in the 1800s with so much detail that you are practically in the picture. I also bought a copy for my cousin and her reverence for this book almost exceeds mine! If you are in the market for a copy, this is the one to buy. It will be passed down through the generations and won't end up in the church rummage sale. Gorgeous in every way."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This classic story has been around through several generations and it continues to captivate a new audience. Even non-christians find interest in this story because it causes us to look at ourselves and reevaluate how we want to be perceived after death.

It has encouraged my children to read more novels by the author."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The Christmas Carol was a book that I throughly enjoyed. This book tells about the hardships and trials of life. This book show how your character depends alot on the way you are received. The three ghost show how Scrooges behavior is traced back to his childhood. It shows that your childhood tends to effect your adult hood."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Christmas Carol is wonderful book that I would want all ages to read. The book shows how a man such as Scrooge can change and so can everyone else. The story is not like the movie. Charles Dickens does a wonderful job in making the story more appealing to me. The story makes me understand how life was like back then. An example is when we had the September 11 attack. I hope people can change like Scrooge. I think Charles Dickens does a great job in using the events from different sources to show different views from the movies. People should read this book so they can maybe stop being so mean to other people and races. (...) The book gets five stars because this is hardcore lessons that we should be teaching today in the youth of America.I think the ghost of the story should come and visit some of the people here in the United States and in different countries.Maybe it is not to late to save the lives of others, if you can not save yourself. This book should be read in schools all over the world.The book has meaning and we should use this meaning to live our lives. The book shows me that everyone can change, including the most devilish person can become an Angel."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I loved the book. Charles Dickens gets a five star mark in my book. The book is nothing like the movie. The way Charles Dickens showed or wrote how the Scrooge changed almost brought me into tears. The movie showed little events than what the book showed. The said part is that many people are just like the Scrooge here today in the United States. On September 11, 2001 showed how many people are just like Scrooge. Men, that are supposed to be &quot;created equal&quot; killed over thousands of men, women, children, and animals all because the United States is more econmic to other countries. The Scrooge being the mastermind of the whole ordeal. I still believe that this book should be given and read to all ages to show how someone as mean as Scrooge can always change when ready or when needed to. To Charles Dickens you should get an award for this piece of work. I think all ages will enjoy this book and maybe someday we will all change and not be so mean to others. Freedom should come to all since we are all God's children"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Large print.

These books are very colorful, with lots of illustrations and photos of genuine artifacts, maps, and people from the era in which the story is set. Side panel text gives background information about the author, pictures and story. These &quot;additions&quot; (which do not detract from, but only enhance the story) help the young reader (and the adult too!) put the story into context. It is like getting both a classic and a pictorial history book rolled into one! The text is easy to read. My daughter is now 9, and reading the books on her own. Not only has she developed an appreciation for classic literature, but for history as well. These are great books for parents to read with their children. I highly recommend them!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Patrick Stewart makes this story come alive in a way few people could. The humor, warmth, and excitement of Dickens' holiday story, read with such skill, kept us spellbound. This is an abridged version, but you don't feel like you've missed anything. Stewart reads the characters' voices with great humor and variety, and even makes great vocal sound effects.Highly recommended for those long car-trips to see family during the holidays. It will make the miles fly by!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I once read that some scholars consider &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854) an unimportant division of Dickens because it is less than half the length of his normal books. I don't understand how they would explain that this is by far his most popular work and yet it is only 1/8 the length of his normal books. This is a masterpiece in that it shows us the harsh reality that some people are so hardened that not even Christmas moves them. I also feel Dickens displays his best skills when he shows us that Scrooge was not always this way. Also, Scrooge starts to change when he is exposed to his present. Seeing upclose what his greedieness has done to Cratchit catches his conscience. Furthermore he realizes that many people will be delighted at his eventual death if he does not change. The messages are very profound. In addition, we are presented with striking images. Also, characters such as Jacob Marley, Fanny, Fred, and Mr. Fezziwig, and the ghosts are very convincing. Again, Dickens shows us the harsh conditions of Victorian England. Also, Dickens emphasizes that even a hardened miser CAN change. If you like this book, Dickens Christmas Book &quot;The Cricket on the Hearth&quot; may also interest you."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"What a timeless and inspired story!

I, like most people I know, grew up with Scrooge (although the form has changed). From Donald Duck to Jim Carrey, I've listened to the story of the grumpy, old, miserly man and his miraculous change of heart on one fateful Christmas Eve.My aunt actually ordered A Christmas Carol for her kindle and I saw the email and thought - oh, that would make a great read-along book for December. Perfect season, I've never read it.. but oh.. it's DICKENS. I don't know about you, but just the name Dickens is enough to strike fear deep into my heart. I struggled so much with A Tale of Two Cities and David Copperfield back in the day that, although interested to see how the book was, I approached this story with not a little bit of trepidation.It also helped to know it was short. I'll admit it.For those of you who haven't read the book, let me just say - put aside everything you know about Dickens from his other works and give this one a shot. It's remarkably easy to understand and, although he can go on, due to the shortness of the book as a whole, the descriptions don't get too much out of hand.There were quite a few things in the book that surprised me - details that really rounded out the story much more than the movies ever have. I regret that I've let all these years go by without establishing the reading of this story as atradition for myself, but it is something I intend to change in the upcoming years."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Great Christmas novel about a man that was stingy and grumpy. The Christmas spirit got a hold of him and turned him into a very giving and happy man."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is a review of the September 2010 paperback edition from ACTA Publications with an introduction by John Shea.Though few have read the book, most people are familiar with A Christmas Carol, the Charles Dickens classic about Ebenezer Scrooge and the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future. Author and Publisher Gregory Augustine Pierce numbers it among his favorites. Thus, when he was visiting a bed and breakfast, he was delighted to find a beautifully rendered edition that was in the public domain. That meant he didn't need permission to reproduce the version he had discovered. He called on friends and favorite artists to work on the book design, illustrations, and cover. Theologian John Shea agreed to write the introduction. The final touch was applied by the publisher's office manager who, Pierce says, \\"found a red ribbon, put it on A Christmas Carol, and it was complete,\\" a beautiful Christmas gift.Shea suggests that those approaching the book as a \\"must-read yawn,\\" will be surprised at the connections to be drawn between Scrooge and ourselves, and the pull to consider our own past, present, and future. He characterizes the unconverted Scrooge as smoldering with anger, rationalizing against helping the needy, and choosing isolation over communion. Scrooge's conversion, Shea explains, is a result of \\"the unyielding work of grace, the theological atmosphere that envelopes the Christmas season.\\"The ghosts show Scrooge the opportunities he has missed, the isolation of his current life, and the promise of an un-mourned death. But conversion is still possible for Scrooge and for us, Shea writes, citing the end of A Christmas Carol. In the final paragraph, Dickens reveals that Scrooge had learned how to keep Christmas well and expresses the following hope: \\"May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!\\""},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I have always loved this story and enjoy the old english language which some reviewers did not like.

I fell that A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens is a very good book, by the way that he foreshadows the chapters in the story and to give you and image of what's to come. I like the story because, Charles Dickens, makes images at the beginning of the story and he describes the ghost to be a very creative way within the story; and he knows how to make things very interesting. Charles Dickens made his characters very creative and neat looking with in your brain. I also think that Scrooges attitude in the beginning of the story is very negative, and I feel that he will never change or do anything for anybody. Scrooge, towards the end is really nice and he is giving to people who don't have anything for the most part. But towards the end Scrooge comes back to life and is nice once again. I also saw Scrooge change through out the book when the present ghost came and he sees the way that he acts toward to the people and he sees that Tiny Tim will die but he does not really care. The future ghost comes and shows him self dead, and he realized that he died greedy .Past ghost comes and changes him for good, because he saw himself sitting alone and he had no one to talk to or anything. I feel that when Scrooge came out of his greedy stage and bought a huge turkey for the Crattich family and he acted like anther father to Tiny Tim and how Tiny Tim did not die and I thought that was very sweet for what he did for them and he garishly gave everybody in the family money. I though that a Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens was a very good book and everybody should read it."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is Dickens at his best.

Yes it is abridged, but the story does not suffer from this.

And so begins the enduring Christmas classic distinguished by almost everyone. Come along on an erratic journey with the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future, all of whom attempt to point Scrooge onto a virtuous path. Meet the most notable characters ever introduced in literature: Bob Cratchit, angelic Tiny Tim, and good-natured Fred. With vivid descriptions of Victorian England and enlightening dialogue, 'A Christmas Carol' will enrapture both the young and old throughout the year with a vital lesson on hope and benevolence for humanity. This, I find, is treasured most of all in this brief story marvelously crafted by the creative Charles Dickens. No matter how many adaptations of the book one has seen on television or as films, the real source is highly recommended and should not be missed.

Like King Lear, every actor reaches a point in his career where he wants to stamp his mark on this classic, so you have to be really quite special to compete with the crowd. Fortunately, this reading by Tom Baker IS really quite special!I approached this with some trepidation because, much though I like Baker, for me the definitive version is Patrick Stewart's and I doubted Baker could match him. I was wrong - Baker brings drama, fear, sorrow and ultimately joy to the story just as much as Stewart does. As with all of the best of the Dickens' narrators/performers, (Callow and Margolyes, as well as Stewart, spring to mind), Baker has a huge personality and a powerful voice - necessary to fill the shoes of Dickens' larger-than-life creations. Although this is a straight reading, Baker uses his fine acting skills to give each character an individual identity. I enjoyed the occasional background music and other sound effects at the more dramatic points and felt that they added to the overall performance.I intended to listen in instalments but by the time the first disc ended, I was so hooked I ended up listening to the whole thing in one session. Not better than Stewart (not possible!) but as good, and of course this is the unabridged version. Three hours of pure listening pleasure - this set will now join my select collection of Christmas Carols, to be brought out and savoured time and again over many Christmases to come. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Though it is clearly stated in the product description, I didn't notice that the beautiful Rackham illustrations have been rendered into black and white until I got the book.

It is a wonderful edition and one that will be an heirloom, remembered by little ones when they are grown up and reading it to their little ones.I looked far and wide for an edition that was unabridged and lovely enough to come out every Christmas and this is absolutely the one and I'm so happy to have it!!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Christmas Carol is one of my all time favorite books and I read it every Christmas. This year I thought it was time that I upgraded from the old paperbacks I had and got a really nice version of the story. I bought this one based off the reviews on here and I must say it exceeded all my expectations.Everyone knows the story so I'll just talk a little about the book itself. The first thing you'll notice is the size and weight of the book. This thing is heavy. Always the sign of a quality book, the pages are thick and of the highest quality and the covers are thick and sturdy. Its a rare thing in this day and age to come across such a well made book. Its the sort of book that looks great on a book shelf or coffee table but will also hold up to many years of reading.The second thing I need to mention is the illustrations. Sprinkled throughout the book are many illustrations by Robert Ingpen recreating key moments and they are, quite simply, beautiful. Robert Ingpen has captured Charles Dickens' Victorian England and the characters and mood of a Christmas Carol perfectly.I cant recommend this book highly enough (and I'm picky when it comes to these things), its the sort of book that could become a treasured family heirloom and be read for many years to come. If you've come across this review looking for a high quality version of this beloved story, you can stop looking. I highly doubt that theres a better version available.

This is my feeling on A Christmas Carol. This was my first experience with Dickens and after reading this-- sure won't be my last. I was expecting a stuffy old novel and got blind-sided by a brilliant work of fiction. I have to thank Amazon for these freebies on kindle, probably would have never got around to reading it. To all you out there who are familiar with the classic tale from movies will be pleasantly surprised to find it WAY better to read. I look forward to more Dickens in the future!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The story is a classic which has been re-interpreted so many times in film, both drama and musical, and even A Mickey Mouse version. But nothing beats the original and it's a great one to read aloud at Christmas, and you can select parts of it as each chapter is self-contained. That's how Dickens was used to writing and publishing, so his books are almost better read serial style.I purchased this particular copy for someone who was in jail and the redemption theme of the story is perfect for this purpose, I think, without being preachy. Scrooge himself was in a self-imposed prison."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Jonathan Winters reads from Dicken's own version written for public readings, so it moves along nicely, never dragging or labored.You'll want to pick up several copies of this CD for friends as a welcomed Christmas surprise."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Many versions of Dickens' classic \\"A Christmas Carol\\" are actually abridgements (done more or less smoothly) but this version is complete and unabridged. Even if you think you are familiar with the book you may find upon reading this one that you previously had read a shortened version! The completeness of this volume would be reason enough to add it to your library, but the quality of the pages, typeface, and above all the lovely illustrations scattered throughout further commend it. I have bought copies for all 3 of my grown children--because every family deserves to own a complete version of this classic story and this one is the best I have ever seen."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Christmas Carol Audiobookread by Jim DaleI once heard it said that to appreciate Dickens best, one should read his stories aloud. I have never had the time to try to do this, but having just listened to a new unabridged reading of A Christmas Carol from Random House, I can see the validity of the statement. Playing the CD's I felt as if the narrator was, in the words of Dickens himself, &quot;standing in the spirit at your elbow.&quot;And what a narrator! The multi-talented Jim Dale reads the story...no, that is not correct...Jim Dale PERFORMS the story. I counted 42 voices in the three-hour recording. Jim Dale is well known for his over 200 voices (and counting) bringing to life all of the characters in the Harry Potter books, which he also records for Random House's Listening Library.I first saw Jim Dale in the 1977 Disney movie Pete's Dragon where he played the bumbling villain. The next year he played three hilarious characters in another Disney film, Hot Lead and Cold Feet. I was lucky to see him in two musicals on Broadway, in Barnum, and Me and My Girl. Both very memorable performances. I plan to see him next month as he sings and dances Scrooge in Madison Square Garden's Christmas Carol - The Musical. I figure if he is great in the audiobook, he will be even better on stage. An actor has only two tools...his voice and his body. In the audiobooks, of course, only the voice can be used.And Dale's voice talents are well showcased here. I often found myself laughing out loud, thanks to the combined genius of Dickens and Dale. In a couple of cases, the genius is pure Dale. At one point he adds a bit of a dog's panting that really cracked me up.I have seen and/or heard other wonderful actors do one-man renditions of A Christmas Carol. A number of years ago a friend played a tape for me of John Gielgud doing an abridged version. I saw Patrick Stewart do his acclaimed one man show on Broadway; from the first row! And I have seen the author's great-great grandson, Gerald Dickens do his skilled and energetic version several times. They are all memorable and it would be impossible to say which was the best. But I can heartily recommend that Jim Dale's version be added to the family library. It is complete, it is accurate and it is a virtuoso performance.Although I certainly know the story well, I found by listening to the audiobook I was paying closer attention to the lesser known parts...the parts that, to be honest, I usually would skim over when rereading the book. In fact, there were several sections where I felt as if I were hearing them for the first time. Marvelous sections. I couldn't believe I had missed them in the past. Maybe Jim Dale's voice just made them more vibrant than my own inner voice.I suppose that asking me to review Jim Dale reading A Christmas Carol really isn't fair. One of my favorite performers reading my favorite story by my favorite author! But surely I am not alone. Dickens is universally known as England's greatest novelist. I wouldn't be surprised if Jim Dale was gaining a reputation as one of the world's greatest readers of audiobooks. They are both master storytellers. And to quote the Dickens himself, &quot;If that's not high praise, tell me higher, and I'll use it.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I hope all readers take time to read A CHRISTMAS CAROL in the original language Dickens used in the 1840's. Dickens' language remains humorous, descriptive and insightful and not inaccessible to most modern readers especially with the use of a good glossary. This is a great read aloud for families at Christmas time and also a great introduction to Dickens and other Victorian writers. Don't settle for an abridged version. Read this masterpiece the way it was intended"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I collect \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and this is a particularly lovely volume.

This is definitely in my top three favorites of all the different versions I own."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Although the artwork in this book is great, readers should be warned that the text is a heavy-handed abridgement of Charles Dickens's wonderful little novel. It omits far too much of the rich and colorful language of this stirring novelette."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I bought this book to replace my old copy that was lost during a recent move. The book is finely illustrated but the narrative is so full of gaping wounds that the entire charm of the story is lost. I should have searched a little harder for a COMPLETE version."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"As to this kindle edition: it's reasonably well-formatted on the k2, but still has a few typos; the spacing is generally clear. There wasn't a clickable table of contents -- like a lot of other free Kindle books, this is pure text only -- but since this is really more a single short story than it is a book (1065 kindle \\"locations\\"), that's not a major fault, and the price makes up for it.As to the story itself: I doubt there's an english-speaking child who doesn't have at least some familiarity with some version of it; I think every saturday morning cartoon series ever did some version, and every other sitcom. This is the original novella that inspired all those adaptations.That's the biggest hurdle when reading this: it may be hard for some readers to get past having heard some version or other of Tiny Tim shouting out \\"God Bless Us, Every One\\" in five hundred different ways every year of their lives, and some readers might find parts of the story hackneyed in the same way that other Christmas classics have become overplayed (anyone who's worked in a mall during the Christmas seasons will know what I'm talking about).Despite that, though, this is still a classic story, and readers who can get themselves past that hurdle will be richly rewarded. There's a powerfully archetypal story here, and one that still managed to tug at even my cynical heartstrings, even as overexposed as I've been to endless re-adaptations; I suspect it will do the same for most other readers as well, as long as they're willing to let it.Even if you don't feel like getting into the Christmas Spirit, though, it's a great introduction to reading Dickens -- probably his shortest major work, and illustrates several of his major themes (urban poverty, workhouses, the Poor Laws, the inadequacy of contemporary aid to the poor, and, generally speaking, man's inhumanity to man). The language is fairly accessible even to a modern reader (Dickens frequently gave public readings of it).Perhaps most interesting is how much influence this single story has had on our entire modern conception of the Christmas holiday -- it's this one tale that in many ways created, idealized, and shaped the modern notion of Christmas, almost singlehandedly transforming Christmas from the celebration of a sacred holiday to the celebration of a family feast. In the century or two prior to this, the holiday had primarily been seen as a twelve-day rural celebration by a whole village or manorial community -- a celebration that had largely fallen on hard times, due both to Cromwell's Puritan abolishment of Christmas celebrations during the 1640's and 50's and (more crushingly) the increasing urbanization and industrialization of British life, which made such celebrations impractical or impossible. This single story took what had been a dying tradition and revitalized it for the industrial era, refocusing it on the (relatively) secular themes of charity, love, friendship, and the nuclear family -- the same ideas, essentially, that are commonly held at the heart of our Christmas holidays today -- and showing urban families a way to celebrate the holiday and make it meaningful. In a very real way, this story saved Christmas.So, if you haven't already read it, do so. It's the original -- often imitated, never duplicated. It might tug your heartstrings, and there's something to learn, too, both about the history of the Christmas holiday and its modern meaning.If you decide after this that you want to read more Dickens, he wrote a number of other \\"Christmas Tales\\" -- \\"The Cricket on the Hearth\\" and a few others. For the most part they're skippable, not up to the archetypal heights Dickens struck with _Carol_. Instead, I'd recommendDavid Copperfield; it was Dickens' favorite of his own books, probably the best of his longer works, and it both compares well with \\"Carol\\" and strikes on many of the same themes (charity, social injustice, cruelty)."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I've been shopping on Amazon for years and this is the first review I've ever left for a purchase I made; that's how impressed I was with this book. I also collect versions of the classic story and I agree with the other reviewer that this is positively one of the best, ever. A majority of the pages have beautiful illustrations that wrap into the text or take the entire page, the binding and cover is understated yet perfect for this book. This is the unabridged version, the original text of the author. If you were to own just one copy of A Christmas Carol, this would be it."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Charles Dickens is a legend, and Jim Dale should be. I was thrilled to find out that Mr. Dale had recorded \\"A Christmas Carol\\" because I've listened to many many hours (and more voices than hours!) of Mr. Dale.One of the great strengths of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is that it can be presented in many different ways and appeal to a variety of people at many ages. I've seen and listened to, live or recorded, Owens, Sims, Barrymore, Stewart and even Mr. Magoo perform this story but I knew Mr. Dale could bring something new to it.I'd forgotten that Crachit had no topcoat and Scrooge's niece had kissable lips. I'd lost the memory of Scrooge trying to put out the light of the Ghost of Christmas Past and was glad to be reminded of all of the descriptions of food that Dickens layers throughout the book. I love listening to the English phrases and words that had slipped from our common usage. When I was young I thought the Ghost of Christmas Future was not much of a threat, but now, deep into middle age and a cancer survivor, I see that hooded figure quite differently.It's a wonderful story, told with a fresh view from a beloved voice. What a great Christmas present!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Some songs, customs, and stories are so beloved, so familiar that they have become an integral part of our holiday celebrations. It wouldn't be the 4th of July without a parade; it wouldn't be Valentine's Day without a heart shaped box; and it wouldn't be Christmas without hearing \\"Silent Night\\" and a reading of \\"A Christmas Carol.\\"Every once in a while another version or recording comes along that makes the familiar seem new, we hear it as though for the first time. That is certainly the case with this performance of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" by the irrepressible Jonathan Winters. He inhabits every character from Scrooge to his housekeeper to Tiny Tim, offering in his own incomparable manner the way he thinks each character would sound.Never has a Scrooge been meaner, a ghost more menacing or Tiny Tim more winning. Mr. Winters has been called \\"a one-man theatrical troupe\\" - indeed, he is as he not only presents amazingly different voices but sound effects as well. This is a one-of-a-kind version of \\"A Christmas Carol.\\"Enjoy!- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A few days back, I read in an article on Leo Tolstoy's \\"What is art?\\" that he quoted, as examples of the highest works of art, Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\" along with other works such as Friedrich Schiller's \\"The Robbers\\" , Victor Hugo's \\"Les Miserables\\" and Dickens' \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\". Since I've read these three - and since all of them are my favorites, I decided to hunt out all the books recommended by Tolstoy, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" being the first of those recommended, which I hadn't read before.Believe me this short novel didn't let me down. I wouldn't call it as great as \\"Les Miserables\\" or \\"The Robbers\\", but it perfectly fits into Tolstoy's main criteria of a great work of art - that which :1.Flows from man's love for God and for man.2.Unites people in the common, universal feelings of mankind and in such a manner as to lead to the betterment of human society.Tolstoy stressed on the moral content of a work of art - and on the emotional impact it makes on the reader - on its relevance and effectiveness in leading to a better world.Considering these points, \\"A Christmas carol\\" is certainly an excellent novel.The theme of this novel, I'd put as: \\"A man's discovery of the joy in giving.\\"Dickens', it seems, meant the novel to have a \\"social conscience\\" - exhorting the rich and amply endowed to look after the poor and wretched - to fight ignorance and want.But he achieves much more than this -1. This is a novel about the regeneration and rebirth of a man's soul - a man's return to innocence.2. This novel clearly shows that man is never beyond redemption -that it is never too late to make atonements for one's past misdeeds. As long as there is a will and a future - man can always strive for the achievement of higher values.3. Above all, this is (almost)the ONLY novel which radiates a sense of joy, benevolence and goodwill towards mankind which would endear it to any reader.The way Dickens has poked fun at the wrong and the erroneous, blending this critical attitude with a cheerful, benign humor is an exceptional achievement in itself, for it avoids bitterness & unhealthy sarcasm - and, while the seriousness of the subject is maintained, makes the reader smile all the way from the begining to the end of the story.The way in which he has captured the SPIRIT of Christmas is wonderful - I never knew that Dickens could write like this. Moreover, Dickens is not concerned with religious dogma or the scriptures or Christmas day as such - but has gone straight to the essence of the Christian philosophy and has attempted to show its beneficent consequences on men's lives. He has used this day as a medium for understanding and appreciating all that it stands for ; the wider moral and social principles are his concern - as should be, for any writer of stature.I'd conclude this review by saying that it is my heartiest and most earnest wish and request to not just the readers of this review but to every person in this world - be a child, be full of benevolence, mutual respect and compassion that you may be joyful and radiate joy and laughter too, to all of you out there - make EVERY day of yours a merry Christmas - and may your life be full of the bliss and goodwill this day brings to men - as has been so beautifully brought out by this delightful novel.MERRY CHRISTMAS!!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Although I have never heard of the reader on this cd, he's great!

If not you must read this classic. Charles Dickens timeless classic, A Christmas Carol , will be read by many generations yet to come. One reason this book is read by millions, is its universal plot. The first reason that the plot is so good because of the wonderful setting. This book is in London during Christmas time during the Victorian Erie. It's about an old grumpy , cranky, great business, man named Ebenezer Scrooge; who hates all and is hated by all. When he is later visited by the ghost of his old business partner, Jacob Marley, who tells Scrooge he will be visited by three different spirits. This novel is great to read to kids and for kids to read. This book will teach good values such as the importance of being generous. This book has many good examples of kindness like when Scrooges nephew, Fred, says Christmas is a \\"' kind forgiving charitable pleasant time'\\". It will also be a very enjoyable book to read during the holiday time of year. This book has a great English setting during Christmas in the 1800's, which will really boost your holiday spirit. This book often reminds us of our often forgotten past, which shocks the reader and keeps them hooked. This book explains many aspects of the Victorian Erie . For example when the author tells the reader of the greediness of some; Like when Scrooge says,\\"' If they rather die' said Scrooge,'then they better do it and decrease the surplus population.'\\" (11) referring to the poor. You can link many aspects of the book to the time period in which Charles Dickens lived and wrote. Like in 1838 the poor tried to get the write to vote but failed because of objection by the middle class . So you can see some of Dickens inspiration for the book. A Christmas Carol is a classic that has been read and enjoyed by many, and millions yet to come. This book has a great history and plot, combined it is great for kids as well as adults. So if you have not read this classic to your family you had better check your! pulse and start reading."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"There's nothing like reading an unabridged classic.

Cratchit maintains that it is only once a year, and Scrooge's retort is that it is \\"a poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of December!\\" Although Scrooge reluctantly agrees, he demands that Bob come in the following day extra early to make up for it!When Scrooge returns home on Christmas Eve, he is startled to see that the brass knocker on his door has turned into a likeness of Jacob Marley. Later that evening, he is visited by Marley's ghost. At first, he refused to believe that Marley was real. Marley's ghost is covered in chains attached to cash-boxes, padlocks, and ledgers. Marley warns Scrooge that he is destined to the same fate if he does not change his ways, telling him: \\"I wear the chain I forged in life...I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and my own free will I wore it.\\" Marley foretells of the three ghosts that will visit Scrooge.I read A Christmas Carol way back in high school, so this is a re-read for me. This classic still hasn't lost its charm. It is a heart-warming story of second chances and redemption, which makes it a perfect holiday read! One of my favourite parts of the story is during Stave Three, when Scrooge sees Tiny Tim's crutch and asks the Ghost of Christmas Present whether the boy will die. It is already apparent that the events of the evening have begun to thaw Scrooge's hardened heart.When I saw that Tim Curry narrated this version, I was immediately intrigued because Curry has such a big personality with a booming voice to match. He didn't let me down! Tim Curry's narration was fantastic! He does an amazing job of bringing Scrooge's personality across in his narration, and I highly recommend this rendition!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"As a kindle owner, I've learned to be a bit wary of free editions of classic works as well as various &#34;illustrated&#34; editions.

Almost everyone, from young children to senior citizens, has at least seen it in a screen adaptation. It has become an integral part of the Christmas season, an immortal classic, beloved by both young and old. That said, if you have never read the original text, you owe it to yourself to do so. This story, though short and simple, is a timeless classic for a reason: it is immaculately written, has a great theme, and is undeniably heartwarming. Dickens is at his brief best here, deftly and skillfully weaving this immortal story in a spellbinding manner, making great and timeless art out of what would have been an overly-sugary-sweet mess in the hands of a lesser writer. This story is good enough, and well-written enough, to melt the cold hard of any cynic. The prose style he uses in this book is just about perfect: it makes for a fast-paced read which can easily be read in one setting, while also managing to be entertaining, and even suspenseful -- with a fine moral to boot. The story is also more than it seems: in addition to the simple morality tale, Dickens manages to weave in some social criticism, while also intermixing elements of horror and not a slight bit of humor. This is one of the few books that I truly recommend to everyone. Everyone can read it, and everyone can enjoy it. An essential classic."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"What impresses me about this edition is that it is affordable without being trashy. It is one of the \\"Dover Thrift Editions,\\" which reprints classics for between $1.00-$1.50, so we have no excuse for not being literate and culture. This book, however, has the feel of a pricier classic. The cover is tasteful and evocative of yuletide. The typesetting and printing is high quality. I have never seen any faint ink, or skipped words, or typos in any of Dover's publications.But any book is about the story, and not the format. This story of human redemption is deservedly a classic. People can change, and anyone can improve, and that is the message of the season.Dickens' genius is not only his vivid description, but also his thought compression. It is only 68 pages long, so it can be read in one setting. I try to do thins, since the story has greater force if it is swallowed whole, without any commercial breaks. It is the pinnacle of Christian Fantasy."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"In his 'A Christmas Carol', Dickens seems to be sending a message of gratefulness for us having to celebrate Christmas Day once a year inspite of the bitterness, sadness and hatred we sometimes feel the whole year round. Just the thought of having Christmas itself is enough reason for us to be thankful and to forgive and forget, Dickens seems to be saying.Also in this book, Dickens seems to be telling grown-ups to take care of the children. Ebenezer Scrooge has an axe to grind with the world with all he had experienced in his childhood and early adulthood. Who would not feel the same way as Scrooge after all what his early life had offered him? As when the Ghost of Christmas Past is showing to Scrooge the school scene when all young Scrooge's classmates have left for the Holidays and Scrooge's younger sister is trying to make him come home, too, but he is not inclined to do so. Dickens was constantly haunted by his traumatic experiences as a little lonely boy working in a blacking factory in industrial-age London. Dickens knew he lost a significant part of his life -- his childhood -- that he seemed to have brezzed by it straight into adulthood. He knew how important childhood experiences were as foundation of everybody's personalities that he seemed he wouldn't want other children to experience the hardships he went through as a child. And, through his 'Carol', Dickens has forever reminded adults about this particular sentiment of his.Dickens shows us how the love of money, the root of all evil, transformed a bitter, vengeful Scrooge to an old, cold man. One very poignant, heart-breaking scene of the story is when Arabella, young man Scrooge's object of affection, explains how, because of Scrooge's yearning to become financially successful in her eyes, she feels like somebody has replaced her in Scrooge's heart.Embedded in the story is the Biblical promise of redemption and salvation once a man has been born again like a child. Indeed, Scrooge, at the end of the story, on Christmas Day, feels like he's little again when he realized that there is still a chance for him to change his ways after the visit of the last specter, the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come.If there is one book that should be read during Christmastime by both grown-ups and children, it is this book , 'A Christmas Carol'. Charles Dickens has, indeed, given us an eternal Christmas gift."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol is read annually along with any and all movie versions. The tale is so simple yet so full of detail. Scrooge is every man who lets life get him down until something changes the status quo. The use of spirits to guide a person to a better path in life is so in tune with the 1990s where everyone is searching for miracles whether they involve spirits or angels or whatever. A true classic that has withstood the test of time and will continue to delight for generations to come."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I think this book should be made compulsory reading in schools.

Scrooge then travels to the past, present, and future with three ghosts. The Ghost of Christmas Future shows Schrooge what his funeral will be like and what the future holds if he doesn't mend his ways. This is a story that lifts up one's spirits, not only at Christmas time, but throughout the year. I recommend it highly to everyone. I usually reread it every Christmas. Several individuals have also pointed out that not only is this an early time-traveling story (perhaps the earliest), it is also probably the earliest story about alternative futures, later popular among science fiction writers as well as historians."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"If you have to choose the story among the Christmas stories I think you should have Ch.Dickens' &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; among your finalists and many of us might find it as the final choice. Some characters of the story even expand the spheres of Christmas; in the first place we will probably mention Ebenezer Scrooge, who has inspired e.g. Walt Disney quite a lot. It might be that his feathered equivalent, even more prosperous than the (finally) good Ebenezer,is today better known than Dickens' original. One more reason to read the book! Among the rest I'll only mention &quot;Tiny Tim&quot;, who has lent his name at least to a tasty species of minitomatoes. The author mixes cunningly facts concerning the social contrasts in 19th century England, rich owners and poor workers, with fictitious ghosts. The latter allow him to move in time, these moves are more related to personal and moral matters than to possible changes in the social frames. The social frames of the story are as well international as English, and they cover - mostly and luckily in a more lenient form - all the ages. The darkest time of the year might make it easier to believe in ghosts or at least accept easier the ones who do so? We can follow how Mr Scrooge's opinions about the members of his staff change, he realizes that he has got some duties towards the people working for him, not just rights to use their skills and time. A kind person is easy to deal with all the year around, one of the wonders of the Yule Tide is that quite a lot of the naughty ones start to behave themselves rather humanly, too.

It is filled with the stuff that modern America needs: A decent respect for humanity, a will to help the sick, the tired, the poor, the hungry, the weak, the crippled. Scrooge changed and so can the current tendency to disrepect and discourtesy anyone and everything. The plot of the story is well known: Jacob Marley returns from the grave to warn Scrooge that the chance to help people and the chance to get great joy by helping people will vanish after death. Alas, it's too late for poor Marley who must prowl about the globe seeing terrible things that he could have helped while alive but now cannot help at all. The moral reality of the idea of the strengthless dead needs greater emphasis than it usually gets: The time to do good is now, now, now. Fortunately, Scrooge sees the warning clearly, the three ghosts of Christmas having done their job well, and Scrooge wakes up on Christmas day to do the good deeds he should have been doing all along.

This is the original novella that inspired all those adaptations.That's the biggest hurdle when reading this: it may be hard for some readers to get past having heard some version or other of Tiny Tim shouting out \\"God Bless Us, Every One\\" in five hundred different ways every year of their lives, and some readers might find parts of the story hackneyed in the same way that other Christmas classics have become overplayed (anyone who's worked in a mall during the Christmas seasons will know what I'm talking about).Despite that, though, this is still a classic story, and readers who can get themselves past that hurdle will be richly rewarded. There's a powerfully archetypal story here, and one that still managed to tug at even my cynical heartstrings, even as overexposed as I've been to endless re-adaptations; I suspect it will do the same for most other readers as well, as long as they're willing to let it.Even if you don't feel like getting into the Christmas Spirit, though, it's a great introduction to reading Dickens -- probably his shortest major work (1203 kindle \\"locations\\"), and illustrates several of his major themes (urban poverty, workhouses, the Poor Laws, the inadequacy of contemporary aid to the poor, and, generally speaking, man's inhumanity to man). The language is fairly accessible even to a modern reader (Dickens frequently gave public readings of it).Perhaps most interesting is how much influence this single story has had on our entire modern conception of the Christmas holiday -- it's this one tale that in many ways created, idealized, and shaped the modern notion of Christmas, almost singlehandedly transforming Christmas from the celebration of a sacred holiday to the celebration of a family feast. In the century or two prior to this, the holiday had primarily been seen as a twelve-day rural celebration by a whole village or manorial community -- a celebration that had largely fallen on hard times, due both to Cromwell's Puritan abolishment of Christmas celebrations during the 1640's and 50's and (more crushingly) the increasing urbanization and industrialization of British life, which made such celebrations impractical or impossible. This single story took what had been a dying tradition and revitalized it for the industrial era, refocusing it on the (relatively) secular themes of charity, love, friendship, and the nuclear family -- the same ideas, essentially, that are commonly held at the heart of our Christmas holidays today -- and showing urban families a way to celebrate the holiday and make it meaningful. In a very real way, this story saved Christmas.So, if you haven't already read it, do so. It's the original -- often imitated, never duplicated. It might tug your heartstrings, and there's something to learn, too, both about the history of the Christmas holiday and its modern meaning.If you decide after this that you want to read more Dickens, he wrote a number of other \\"Christmas Tales\\" -- \\"The Cricket on the Hearth\\" and a few others. For the most part they're skippable, not up to the archetypal heights Dickens struck with _Carol_. Instead, I'd recommend _David Copperfield_; it was Dickens' favorite of his own books, probably the best of his longer works, and it both compares well with \\"Carol\\" and strikes on many of the same themes (charity, social injustice, cruelty).One note on this kindle edition: it's a bit awkwardly formatted, with the page numbers of the original marked in brackets, a \\"list of illustrations\\" that are not included, and odd chunks of capitalized text (presumably captions to the nonexistent illustrations). Still, perfectly readable despite that, and it's free."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I collect \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and this is a particularly lovely volume. The illustrations are wonderful and the overall quality, printing, binding and paper, is terrific. This is definitely in my top three favorites of all the different versions I own."},{"Title":"Confessions of St.Augustine (Sacred Wisdom S.)","review":"Augustine's 'Confessions' is among the most important books ever written. One of the first autobiographical works in the modern sense, it also represents the first time a psychological and theological enterprise were combined. It also helps to bridge the gap between the Classical world and the Medieval world, exhibiting strong elements identifying with each of those major historical periods.Most undergraduates in the liberal arts encounter the book at some point; all seminarians do (or should!). Many adults find (or rediscover) the book later, after school. For many in these categories, there are concepts, narrative strands and historical data new and unusual for them. However, Augustine's 'Confessions' is still generally more accessible in many ways that truly classical pieces; it has interior description as well as external reporting that we are familiar with in modern writing.The 'Confessions' shows Augustine's personality well - he was a passionate person, but his focus wavered for much of his life until finally settling upon Christianity and the Neoplatonic synthesis with this faith. Even while remaining a passionate Christian and rejecting the sort of dualism present in the Manichee teachings, he varied between various positions within these systems. Augustine's varied thought reaches through many denominational and scholarly paradigms.The 'Confessions' are divided into thirteen chapters, termed 'Books' - the first ten of the books are autobiographical, with Augustine describing both events in his life as well as his philosophical and religious wanderings during the course of his life. The text is somewhat difficult to take at times, as this is writing with a purpose, as indeed most autobiographies are. The purpose here at times seems to be to paint Augustine in the worst possible light (the worse his condition, the better his conversion/salvation ends up being); at other times, one gets a sense (as one might get when reading the Pauline epistles) that there is some significant degree of ego at work here (Paul boasts of being among the better students, and so does Augustine, etc.).Augustine also uses his Confessions as a tract against the Manichean system - once a faithful adherent, Augustine later rejects the Manichean beliefs as heretical; however, one cannot get past the idea that Augustine retained certain of their intellectual aspects in his own constructions even while denouncing them in his official life story.The whole of the conversion turns on two primary books - Book Seven, his conversion to the Neoplatonic view of the world, including the metaphysics and the ethics that come along with this system; and Book 8, which describes his conversion to Christianity proper. This is where perhaps the most famous directive, 'Tolle! Lege!' ('Take and read!') comes from - Augustine heard a voice, and he picked up the nearest book, which happened to be a portion of the Pauline epistles, arguing against the undisciplined lifestyle Augustine lived. Scholars continue to debate whether Augustine's conversion to Christianity was more profound or more important than his conversion to Neoplatonism; in any event, Christianity interpreted through a Platonic framework became the norm for centuries, and remains a strong current within the Christian world view; Protestant reformers as they went back to the 'original bible' in distinction from the Catholic interpretations of the day also went back to the 'original Augustine' for much of their theology.The final three books are Augustine's dealing with the creation of the world via narrative stories in Genesis 1 exegetically and hermeneutically. This is very different from what is done in modern biblical scholarship, but is significant in many respects, not the least of which as it gives a model of the way Augustine dealt with biblical texts; given Augustine's towering presence over the development of Western Christianity in both Catholic and Protestant strands, understanding his methods and interpretative framework can lead to significant insights into the ideas of medieval and later church figures.This is a book that will be of interest to novice readers of Augustine as well as scholars, to students, clergy and laypersons, and anyone else who might have an historical, literary, philosophical, theological or other interest in Augustine - something for everyone, perhaps?This particular edition is an abridgement, drawing in crucial elements in a new translation of the text. It probably consists of only about one-tenth of the overall text of the Confessions, pulling out significant stories and passages rather than preserving the entirety of the narrative strand. It is a good primer, but be advised that it is not the complete text. It does have a nice feel and design to it, and makes a good gift book."},{"Title":"Confessions of St.Augustine (Sacred Wisdom S.)","review":"I first came across St. Augustine's \\"Confessions\\" when I was a freshman in college. It was a monumental experience in terms of both the content of his writing and the freshness and relevance of his writing style. After re-reading them again recently, I am still struck with how contemporary the book feels. Aside from many of its 4th century particularities, the concerns that St. Augustine had and the way he frankly and honestly dealt with them could be lifted from almost any contemporary tell-all autobiography. The biggest exception is the fact that \\"Confessions\\" is a quintessentially and irreducibly a religious text, and in an age when religious considerations are largely pushed towards the margins of their life stories, it is refreshing and uplifting to see what would a life look like for someone who took them very seriously and committed himself to reorganizing one's whole life around the idea of serving God wholly and uncompromisingly. \\"Confessions\\" is a very accessible text, and for the most part it does not deal with theological and philosophical issues. The exception is the latter part of the book, which are almost exclusively dedicated to those topics. You may want to skip those at the first reading, but I would encourage you to read them nevertheless. Maybe the very inspiring and uplifting story of St. Augustine's conversion to Christianity can lead you into deeper considerations about your faith or the meaning of life in general.

She ventures around the rocks on the nearby beach only to not be seen alive again even after a thorough two-week search. The people she left behind mourned her and were never quite the same afterward.In the present, Lindsay's cousin Annie desperately wants to conceive, but after years of failure her husband Graham gives up trying. Alistair's son stays with Graham and Annie indefinitely. When the wife to Lindsay's brother Jaime becomes pregnant, she wants an abortion while he wants the child. The survivors of Lindsay's disappearance return to High House seeking solace and wanting to make some sense out of their lives.The irony of this tale is that while Lindsay's family receives reader empathy, their spouses and parents earn hisses and boos as villains normally do. Waiting for LINDSAY is a complex drama that studies how people cope with a sudden tragedy. The story line moves deliberately slowly to enable the audience to catch the essence of the survivors in a way not often found in a novel but Moira Forsyth beautifully delivers a complex character study.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"PHOTOGRAPHY: THE GUIDE TO TECHNIQUE.","review":"There are so many different aspects to photography that any book claiming to be all things to all photographers is simply asking too much - especially of those who buy the book. Unfortunately, there are far too many books claiming to be an \\"encyclopaedia\\" to this form of creating original pictures that one wonders why such authors (and their publishers!) don't look up that particular word in a dictionary before they settle on such inappropriate titles.How refreshing, therefore, to find a book which discusses in great detail one single aspect of photography - Technique. It doesn't matter whether you take pictures of nature - in all it's varied forms, nudes, buildings, glamour, still life, animals or even take your cameras underwater in search of Sharks, the one thing you will have to develop is your own style. It is an original style which makes the great, great and, in order to nurture, define and finally tone your own style into an original shape and form, you will need to study technique. By studying this book you will learn of the techniques defined by two accomplished photographers and by taking on board the lessons they seek to teach, you will soon find yourself developing certain themes and taking them off in completely different directions.This book will set you thinking by showing, in great detail, the ideas and techniques of other photographers. Look, read and learn - and the rest is up to you.NM"},{"Title":"Polish Fables","review":"Over 60 fables are presented in this book. Everyparable is first written in the original Polish formand then the English translation is given. I likedthe fact that I could go back and forth between thetwo translations and learn a few words in Polish.I also enjoyed the many illustrations that were doneby Barbara Swidzinska, but I wish that all of thefables had been illustrated.The subject matter is much more complicated than thetitles imply. Here's a sampling of the fables: In thetale of THE HUMBLE LION, when a king asks his subjectsto speak the truth, it could be a deadly mistake. Or inFRIENDS, the story of a hare who was a kind and goodfriend to all. When the hare needs help, he's given alesson in his choice of friends. Finally, with the fableof THE HERON, THE FISH, AND THE CRAB we all learnthat a traitor eventually gets caught.As a group, these fables were published after the deathof Ignacy Krasicki in the year 1803. Although, we'retold that many of these pieces were individuallypublished at an earlier date. Krasicki (1735-1801) wasreferred to as &quot;the Prince of Poets&quot; by his contemporaries.Most of these pieces have political connotations and werewritten after the first partition of Poland when thesurrounding countries of Russia, Austria and Prussiaconquered and divided Poland among themselves.I'ts a pleasure to have this literary work translated forus by Gerard T. Kapolka. My thanks to him."},{"Title":"Polish Fables","review":"This is a great book. Even if you can't read the original language, it has a very good English translation. They are fables with a message that are entertaining to read and think about for today's time. But there is another meaning behind these fables (commentary and criticism of the author's period of history). These fables address the political and social issues facing the people in partitioned Poland."},{"Title":"Polish Fables","review":"&quot;Polish Fables&quot; is a collection of fables by Ignacy Krasicki (1735-1801). As this book is a bilingual edition, it has first the Polish version, then the English version translated by Gerard T. Kapolka. The fables read like short poems, almost always rhyming (even the English version). Some of the fables have accompanying illustrations. This hardcover book is just over 100 pages.These fables are not necessarily the best stories for children as many are sad and end with the death of the character (i.e., the wolf kills the sheep). As the introduction stated, this may be a political message in response to Poland being partitioned at the time by its stronger neighbors, Russia, Austria and Prussia."},{"Title":"Polish Fables","review":"&quot;Polish Fables&quot; is a wonderful book with creative stories.

And the added bonus is that is wasn't a lot of pop-pysch mumbo-jumbo! It made so much sense!"},{"Title":"The Politician","review":"This book was considered one of the most controversialnon-religious manuscripts of its day. The author felt itwas too &quot;hot&quot; for publication in 1956, when Eisenhower wasa very popular president. A few copies circulated amongsome of Robert Welch's friends, and some updates were madein the next few years. The national press &quot;uncovered&quot; acopy after Welch's new organization, The John Birch Society,proved to be a growing threat to the status quo. Hostilereviews began appearing across the country of an unpublishedmanuscript!People began asking for the book.Mr. Welch decided in 1963 to publish The Politician in selfdefense. Once the book was printed, demand by bookstoressuddenly dried up, and reviewers quit mentioning it.Hundreds of thousands of copies were eventually sold, butthat is another story...The chapter on Operation Keelhaul is worth the price of thebook. Eisenhower's role in the forced repatriation ofrefugees and anti-communists to the Soviet Union at the endof WWII is well documented. It is a nauseating account oftreachery and politics in the twentieth century.The maneuverings leading up to the 1952 GOP presidentialnomination are also revealed in the book, along with manyother historical details of the Eisenhower years notcommonly known. Hundreds of footnotes list primary sources,mostly major newspaper stories, to verify the narrative.The value of the book is not limited to students of the1950's. Great insight into present day U.S. foreign policyis hidden within the story of Ike. The uncanny similarityof Clinton's globalism to Bush's &quot;New World Order&quot; makesmore sense after reading this groundbreaking book."},{"Title":"The Politician","review":"In the years before the American Right ceased to function as a true counter establishment force the John Birch Society sent shivers down the spine of left wing politicians and their pawns. Our author Robert Welch, the Society's founder and leader, was not shy in pointing out the role played by Establishment types, Republicans as well as Democrats, in America's decline. This book centers on the Eisenhower Administration and the advance of Communism and leftism that it collaborated with. It is not for the feint of heart but when one surveys the wreckage which Ike left behind (all herein documented) anti-Communist Russians, German prisoners of war, the political destruction of McCarthey, Taft and the South it seems in retrospect that the old Belmont candy manufacturer might have been on to something. This is an important political document of the Amrican Right (old school) and deserves a reading or a re-reading today."},{"Title":"The Politician","review":"It has been nearly twenty years since I first read this book written by the founder of the John Birch Society. This brilliant man had at the age of five had read the world encyclopedia. At 13 he was a college teacher. He will be remembered for exposing the communist conspiracy and its fellow travellers. This book reveals facts concerning President Eisenhower such as his lack of qualification when appointed to Command the European theatre of War and his administration of Operation Keelhall. Recently a video clip of an Eisenhower speech which contains a warning concerning the military industrial complex has been widely disseminated online. This video of Robert Welch's speech, \\"The Truth in Time\\" ,found on YouTube, is far more illuminating than a mere reference by Eisenhower."},{"Title":"The Politician","review":"Robert Welch published this book in 1963. Now, almost 50 years later, Welch was \\"dead on\\" in his predictions for the U.S. if we continued the policy of appeasement with the Communists. And for those who think Reagan defeated the Communists, think again. Something much worse is coming...and it's called the New World Order.In this book the author explains in great detail why he believes Pres. Eisenhower was a pro-communist or at minimum a communist dupe. There is no denying the evidence the author lays out, but it is still hard for me to see IKE that way. Maybe my heart doesn't want to believe it. As of this moment my belief is Pres. Eisenhower felt we had to find some common ground with the Soviet Union, and find a way to live in peace in this nuclear age. Nevertheless it's hard to dispute the author's thesis.The book unfortunately is not an interesting read. It is a continual diatribe against IKE. After the first 50 pages it starts to get real old. This would have been a great book if the author's thesis was denouncing communism and not just Eisenhower alone. Robert Welch's insight into Communism and his predictions for the future of the U.S. was absolutely correct. He predicted the huge trade imbalance, and foreign nations dumping dollars for gold which as we all know forced Nixon to close the gold window. Also, the cheap goods that we receive in exchange for dollars, those dollars are then used by Communist nations to buy American companies and also buy influence in our foreign policy. We were sold out by our own politicians.This book is a must read to understand the past and where we are headed!"},{"Title":"The Politician","review":"As one previous reviewer stated, this work is very much a 'gem'.The view given to us, the people, of Dwight David Eisenhower, both as Supreme Allied Commander and ultimately as President of the United States, is so far from the truth as to astound the reader.A champion of freedom he was not, a staunch anti-communist, even less so. What the History Channel, our faux conservative friends and sadly, most veterans of the WWII era would have us believe of this man is the stuff of fantasy. In plain english Mr. Welch lays out Ike's adult life in service to the international bankers and collectivists from his faithful meeting with the daughter of fellow-traveler FDR to his numerous attempts to transfer our national sovereignty into the clutches of international bodies while he himself occupied the Oval Office.His conduct regarding Operation Keelhaul, the Austrian Peace Treaty, Radio Free Europe (\\"Free\\" being in the Orwellian sense of the word) , etc., etc., betrays his having a conscience. He filled the halls of government with known communists and acted accordingly to protect them and by force of law blocked those who had the nerve to ask questions. The evidence is overwhelming; no man worked less stop deliverance of Free Europe in to the hands of the Soviets, nor worked harder to stymie revolutions led by those brave souls who wished to be free of their condition. Ike was a Socialist in the elistist fashion, knowing it to be a system corporate management and control, not the Starbucks hippie liberal apathetical or lower/welfare class \\"Obama is going to pay my bills!\\" complete misunderstanding of the system.Exempli Gratia:Aired at 12:15 PM on May 3, 1953 in the \\"Sunday Comments of Ferdinand Peroutka\\" on the Czechoslovak station of RFE, were these words:\\"Eisenhower's Program, on the other hand , even though America's factories have not been nationalized, stands for the concept of world socialism. There is no better way to describe it. This is socialism...The aim of the program outlined by the President of the United States is to socialize life.\\"To my mind Ike was the progenitor of the 'controlled-right', being as it was a construct for and by the left, manned by faux conservatives. Even when they 'win' it is loss for their constituents in some fashion if one looks closely. The false right gives concession after concession to the leftists in action while pretending to shout them down using carefully crafted rhetoric with design to portray conservatives and their arguments as \\"racist\\", \\"parochial\\", \\"worn-out\\", or \\"fascist\\", duly disarming the constituent's ability to confront the leftist with the proper argument but instead with the compromised one cooked up in some Establishment think tank.Read the book, it will change your mind. Unless, of course, you fancy yourself a Republican schooled in the art of genuflecting before men in uniform, for whom nothing can be done."},{"Title":"The Politician","review":"Controversial anti-Eisenhower biography dared attack Allen Dulles and the Central Intelligence Agency -- prompting CIA \\"Conservatives\\" William F.

By 1958, it ballooned to 80,000 words (287 pages). Ultimately, this version was \\"loaned\\" to \\"hundreds\\" of people before the published edition came out in 1963 with major editing.Army Intelligence in New York acquired a copy of the \\"private letter\\" in January 1959 and described it as favoring \\"only those elements of society who oppose the democratic processes by which we elect Presidents, and as such, aids the cause of international Communism...\\"The FBI's Boston Field Office obtained a copy and forwarded it to FBI HQ. The Bureau described Welch's book as \\"a vicious attack\\" upon President Eisenhower and his Administration.J. Edgar Hoover and top officials of the FBI subsequently concluded that the John Birch Society (founded and headed by Robert Welch) was \\"irrational\\", \\"extremist\\", \\"irresponsible\\" and part of the \\"lunatic fringe\\" in our country due to material that the JBS disseminated which contained the same premises and conclusions as offered in The Politician regarding the purported treason and disloyalty of American leadership since World War II.In testimony before the Warren Commission, J. Edgar Hoover stated:\\"I think the extreme right is just as much a danger to the freedom of this country as the extreme left. There are groups, organizations, and individuals on the extreme right who make these very violent statements, allegations that General Eisenhower was a Communist, disparaging references to the Chief Justice and at the other end of the spectrum you have these leftists who make wild statements charging almost anybody with being a Fascist or belonging to some of these so-called extreme right societies. Now, I have felt, and I have said publicly in speeches, that they are just as much a danger, at either end of the spectrum. They don't deal with facts. Anybody who will allege that General Eisenhower was a Communist agent, has something wrong with him. A lot of people read such allegations because I get some of the weirdest letters wanting to know whether we have inquired to find out whether that is true. I have known General Eisenhower quite well myself and I have found him to be a sound, level-headed man.\\"For the benefit of readers who are unfamiliar with The Politician, below are two sections from the original \\"private letter\\" that were later deleted from the published version:Page 266: According to Welch, President Eisenhower was \\"knowingly accepting and abiding by Communist orders, and consciously serving the Communist conspiracy, for all his adult life.\\"Page 267: \\"But my firm belief that Dwight Eisenhower is a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy is based on an accumulation of detailed evidence so extensive and so palpable that it seems to me to put this conviction beyond any reasonable doubt.\\""},{"Title":"Emerging concepts in urban space design","review":"I have just received my copy of this book.

You start where you are at, rather than from a peace joy perspective. How can you feel joyful when you have mud all over you? This technique gradually raises your vibration from depressed, to pissed off and angry, to vengeful, to upset, to disgruntled, to disappointed, to merely blah and bored, to finding something nice about where you are (e.g. \\"Its nice and cool down here\\"} and so on up the scale to gratefulness and then peacefulness.....Highly recommended, especially if you think that a lot of the new age stuff just isn't addressing your needs.Laurette Looney"},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"This book gives so much detail and some wonderful examples.

I find that there is a greater honesty with authors like Wayne Dyer and Eckhart Tolle."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"One of the most important questions asked in this book is, \\"Are you allowing or resisting wellness, thriving, clarity, and abundance?\\"Most might say, \\"Of course I want to feel great, thrive, be really clear and prosperous.\\"And then, if we are to monitor our emotions, in the present tense, noticing when we feel pain, and when we feel pleasure, we would find that what we feel about what we think is guiding us to either resist or allow our desires.Our emotions tell us, much as a GPS system does, if we are moving towards or away from our life's journey.And, even though this information was not new to me, I had the opportunity to track my GPS system by writing a 20-page emotional map letter, identifying the worst to the best feelings, in a relationship.The outcome of my emotional map letter (that is tracking what I felt about what I thought and experienced) supported \\"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent,\\" because what mattered most, with clarity, created the best outcome for me.Two points, however, that did surprise me about \\"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent,\\" are: Although the author asserts that this book is a follow up of her first book, and that the reader doesn't need to read the first book without receiving full appreciation of this book, I noticed that terms in this book were not clearly defined, early on, as they were in \\"Ask and it is Given.\\"Also, while I appreciate what I learned from this book, the second half of this book really seemed to be a recreation of the first book.A great quote from \\"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent,\\" is, \\"Life is really about beginning to feel the slight tugging of dissatisfaction with your current vehicle ... and then feeling the gentle process of clarifying personal preferences regarding details of the desired vehicle ... and then consciously witnessing the movement of forces and situations to accomodate the acquisition.\\"Another powerful message from this book is, \\"If you feel as if things are not changing, or changing very slowly, this is the reason: You are giving most of your attention to the what-is you are living, and little of your attention to the what-you-would-like-to-be-living.\\""},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"Abraham has done it again in this wise and very helpful guide. It gives the reader a helpful perspective and program for how to go from how things are, to how one wants them to be.According to Abraham, we have two different aspects, you, and You. We proceed in life usually focused on the outward directed part, reacting to what-is, and making choices based on that. What we need to do is to get to a sense of envisioning how we would like things to be, and attuning our inner life and vibrations to manifest that.The book gives a series of exercises to help \\"reframe\\" thoughts about one's plights or worries, that lead to healthier emotional states. Working from healthier emotional states leads inexorably to better outcomes, and a joyful life. I found these exercises to be helpful and practical.The last part of the book is dialogues between Abraham (channeled through Esther Hicks) and guests/participants at Abraham-Hicks seminars. These dialogues are very good in showing the practical application of the teachings.I definitely recommend this book for anyone who is willing to approach the teachings with an open mind and a sincere desire to make healthy changes. It can be challenging, but that's the whole point, isn't it? I would also recommend that the reader be prepared to go over this material at least twice to grasp the concepts and begin to apply them to their own lives.It's the kind of work that goes well beyond the chatty self-help books that tell you how wonderful it is to achieve a blissful state, and how the author got there, but don't really give solid, practical help for the reader to do the same.This book is definitely empowering. Buy it!"},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"I was very disappointed. It was extremely repetitive, and probably could have been cut to 1 CD instead of 4.

By the time I read \\"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent\\" I was REALLY fired up about the Law of Attraction and am now very excited about working with it and applying it to my life. I'm glad the second book was there for me when it was perfect for me to hear it again. Isn't it nice how things work out?I also really enjoyed the question and answer section at the end of the book.

IAnyone who says that this offers nothing new hasn't read the book. A quick and easy read that will put you on the path to a better life. I can't recommend this book highly enough.

What I liked about it was that it expands on the 22 processes in the first book \\"Ask and It IS Given\\" Abraham gives even more examples of the processes and it is very helpful to new student/ teachers of Abraham and those of us who have been studying for years. I give this book and any program by Abraham my highest reccomendation."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"I agree this is a self-supporting book. The most important message from Abraham's materials is trusting ourselves can be well. We all are our own teachers, yet it will be beneficial to digest the wisdom from self-help books to find our own paths at certain stages of our personal developments. Trust yourself. Be your own teachers. Choose what works for you. Believe in your intuition. Use you feelings to sift what is valuable to you. Always ask and allow. Always."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"I beieve one of the key points about Abraham's teachings is that they are incredibly straightforward. The collective nonphysical entity known as Abraham explains clearly exactly what we need to do to achieve happiness and joy. Abraham's speaks of \\"alignment\\" and explains in clear and detailed terms what that means.As a long-time student, with my wife, of the Abraham material, I know that it is simple. I also know that it is not always easy. Particularly for someone like me, who has struggled with depression most of my adult life, the teachings of Abraham are not easy. But who ever said (or thought) enlightenment would be free and easy.Definitely buy the book. Or listen to tapes. Or both. Do the exercises. And if you get to a point where you feel overwhelmed or down, take a break. Just don't stop. \\"Keep on keepin' on,\\" as the saying goes. And, as Abraham continually reminds us: Enjoy the journey."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"All the law of attraction books are trying to teach us the same thing. This book goes a step further and gives meat and potatoes steps to help you understand what you are really trying to do and how to do it. At first you feel it is a bit redundant in its examples until you realize that you actually see exactly what you are to do to change your thinking (if it needs it).I was fortunate to see these people a couple of years ago after having heard some tapes. Their style is very loving and inviting. This book has their personality. It is the second book of theirs I have read & remember the first one to be equally descriptive so that you actually understand.No pie in the sky here - just clear instruction with the intent of producing understanding, not rote actions.Rita"},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"This book is ok, but the reason I give it two stars is because it is contains the exact same material as Ask and it is Given (which I would give five stars).

Most people do not believe in this way. \\"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent\\" is the entire CD. Part 1 is \\"Living the Art of Allowing\\" and is a collection of 4 CDs, narrated mainly by Jerry Hicks. Part 2 is \\"Living the Path to Joy Through Energy Balance\\" and is a second collection of 4 CDs. You really want to buy both packages to get the entire book.Abraham is a collective consciousness who speaks to Esther. She then relays the material. The material speaks primarily of metaphysical energy and its relationship to all that there is. It goes in-depth into manifestation by aligning your personal vibrational energies to match what you really want. Again, I know that's a hard concept to swallow, but that is the Law of Attraction. You really DO get what you think about. I have been studying metaphysical energy for about the last 7 or 8 years and I have seen the evidence soooo many times. Unfortunately, because of fear and control and many other negative personal vibrations, people usually think about what they DON'T want and that is what they manifest. Put simply, instead of seeing their car running smoothly on a log trip, they worry \\"What if it breaks down?\\". Instead of thinking about money in a positive way, they usually think of a LACK of money, and generally worry about it. So, they usually get what they do NOT want.Anyway, this set of CDs not only explains the concept very well, but gives real-life examples and examples of the proper (aligned) thinking versus the non-aligned (improper) thinking, so you can begin to change your vibration to attract what you DO want. Like I said though, you need both CDs and an open mind, a VERY open mind. You also need to really work at this vibrational change to achieve successes with it. Even when you do achieve successes, it's hard to believe because we were just not conditioned to believe this way.All that said, it's a great product and these are not the only authors talking about vibrational energy matching to manifest. What they say is right on target.CD1, this set is slightly less than 2 and a half hours. CD set 2 is slightly more than 2 and a half hours. Both sets together total over 5 hours of audio book material which you can easily listen to in the car on your way to work. These 8 CDs have the potential to change your life."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"I find it difficult to place into words without using the title of the book... It is Amazing... I am reading Ask and it is Given again... for the 2nd time and will probably use it as a guide always... the Amazing Power of Delibert Intent is just a continuation of enlightening material from Abraham. When you purchase either or both of the books you can't go wrong... if you never read another book you would want to have these two books with you always. Very easy to read but watch out... the information is so simple but yet so intense. Neither are books to rush through but to ponder in thought and apply in your own life. The book Amazing Power of Intent is equally Exceptional as Ask and it is Given. You will not be sorry for the purchase."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"I ordered this book while still reading the previous one, Ask and It Is Given, for the first time. You might call it a honeymoon purchase. Absolutely loved the first one.Amazing Power lives up to its subtitle, Living the Art of Allowing. It goes a little deeper into the \\"how\\" of many of the processes introduced in Ask and It Is Given. It gave me a deeper understanding of the whole concept of the Law of Attraction, as a new student.I give it 4 stars rather than 5 because it becomes repetitive. Each process takes a belief and breaks down how to change it using the particular process. Unfortunately, you are taken through the same belief with each process. By the time you have explored 5 or 6 processes, you are sick of the story that presents the belief.Like the previous book, this one is written in very accessible language and overall is very upbeat and enjoyable. I particularly liked the areas where the questions the first book raised in my mind were laid to rest."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"Jerry and Esther Hicks books and materials with Abraham are magnificent.

And that you are creating it.As I read THE AMAZING POWER OF DELIBERATE INTENT, I realized that this is the best book yet. Because these tools in the newest book are so specific, so customized to the nature of personal self-help. It is step-by-step and from many perspectives. Afterall, we all have many perspectives, meaning we have a lot of ways we \\"distract\\" or train oursleves into once-useful, now-useless habits.

Why are so many people struggling with sickness every day? Why are there so many women looking for years for a mate? Is that because they don't desire them or they are not clear on their goals and desires? These books are there to make you feel empowered, but will your reality change?

Too many childish quick ways to get IT!. Not a quick thing the art of allowing. Takes scholars years to learn the art of allowing. The great School Ramtha, \\" The School of Enlightment) all the students, from all over the globe spend months and some years to get to the ART of Allowing. This book does not have much to say in reality what allowing spiritually means to individuals, how to access that. On occasion within the pages a great glimmer of it seeps through however so rarely not worth thelong read to get it. yes Wayne Dyer gives it a compliment.

I found my way to the Abraham-Hicks website where I was able to download a long recording of Abraham actually speaking. Wow.I then noticed another book available, \\"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent\\", and its table of contents preview seemed to suggest that there was lots of new material inside.UPSIDE: \\"Deliberate Intent\\" contains some vibration-raising exercises for relationship problems, work-related problems, etc. that go further than the first book.It also includes transcripts of sessions where people actually asked Abraham for help with their own personal problems (Abraham Live-Questions and Answers). A lot of it was surprising. I wish there had been more of that, because it was so educational.DOWNSIDE: A lot of the book covers exactly the same material as does \\"Ask and It Is Given\\", only it is worded and organized differently.I don't think it's so much a problem of the authors \\"padding\\", as it is this: the process of manifesting as laid out by Abraham is deceptively simple; so simple in fact, that one can only elaborate on it so much and that's it.\\"Ask and It Is Given\\" is still my all-time favorite book of this genre, and I rate it one star higher than \\"Deliberate Intent\\". They are both good books, but the former will always be the magical key of manifesting for my money."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"I have been a student of Abraham and have loved their work for almost 20 years. I must say that I was fairly disappointed in this product, a 4 cd set on the The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent. It is unfortunately read by Jerry Hicks, who I am sure is a very dear person, but NOT a narrator. His recitation of the material is robotic, innocuous, fast, monotonous and in that - on the verge of irritating. I know the work and Esther's expression of Abraham is indelibly in my head, so I was able to grasp some of the heart and sincerity of the work. But, I fast-forwarded through much of the material and was glad to give it away. If I could have known the quality and lack of emotion that this product contained, I would NOT have purchased.

It's entertaining, and at the very least the message is positive.This Abraham character, that Esther \\"channels,\\" sounds more like Zsa Zsa Gabor than what I'd expect a highly evolved transdemensional being to sound like, but hey, it makes the message more fun. I won't get hung up on my feelings about channeling; because a wise man once taught me that it's not so much the messenger, but the message that counts.The message that I got from Esther's entity is basically this: Going about trying to change your world by running amok fixing everything outside of you is bass ackwards. Instead, fix your inner world with feelings like joy and that's what you'll create.I think Jesus said it this way in Mark 11:22-24. \\"Have faith in God. For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, \`Be removed and be cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says. Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.\\"Hey, if the Red Sox could use the power of belief to win the World Series after 80 years of disappointment, then this stuff must work.You may also want to check out \\"The DaVinci Method\\" for the secrets to overcoming your inner barriers to positive creating.Believe!"},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"While it could be argued that the basic premise of this second book is identical to that of its predecessor, it is also true that for every person who reads an idea presented one way, there are three others who won't quite absorb it at the aha! level until it's presented somewhat differently. There is no backpedaling in this from the revelations in Ask And It Is Given; however, the \\"processes\\" and different circumstances under which they may be utilized to get out of negative-thinking ruts and into a more conscious choice about what we allow to bang around in our heads, is presented with some fresh perspectives as Abraham's answering grows as a natural extension of people's asking."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"I've been listening to these CD recordings for three weeks now, going over and over this magnificently empowering message from Abraham and delivered through Esther & Jerry Hicks. I was so impressed with their first book -Ask and It is Given- that I just had to listen/read this one as well. For me, I've found that the message is better felt and understood when it reaches inside through hearing and sight simultaneously, let's say in a sort of \\"stereo\\" kind of way, so I read the book and listen the CDs at the same time. For anyone who has been looking for a sensible, charismatic, loving and understanable perspective of self, purpose and access to Joy, try this (read, listen or both), there will be no regrets. My own ability to \\"listen\\" (as opposed to hear) is limited by -point of view-, that is, it's filtered through belief; only something more powerful than that belief can shake and crumble it allowing acceptance of another that will further growth, understanding and joy.

I have been reading and listening for the past 10+ years. If you did not have parents or mentors around who assisted in building your confidence and who gave you empowering and enlightening knowledge about how things work in the world then I suggest you buy both books.The simplest message is that lot's of things are true, even the negative stuff, but it's up to you whether or not you activate these negative things or just ignore them and move on.

Much to may dissapointment I found out the the book \\"The amazing Power of deliberate intent\\" is almost a total copy of the first book, with the same storys and even the same excercises."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"Esther and Jerry Hicks' new book is all about vibrational alignment: getting our desires and beliefs in sync and on the positive, growing edge so we can create our life experiences with \\"deliberate intent.\\" The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent is based on the teachings of Abraham, a group of spiritual beings channeled by Esther and the foundation of the Hicks' publications, workshops and media offerings (see their terrific web site, www.abraham-hicks.com).This latest book builds on the concepts developed in the Hicks' seminal work, Ask and It is Given. It provides practical exercises and tools to: 1) help us recognize, through emotions and feelings, what our desires and beliefs about specific life experiences are; and 2) help us reframe beliefs to become more positive and better align them with what we desire or want. Through these processes we can open to allow more positive energy in our lives-and create the future as we'd like it to be, with \\"deliberate intent.\\"I'm a fan of the Hicks' work, and like other reviewers I applaud their positive advice for daily living. Their approach makes sense, similar in content to Lynn Grabhorn's Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting (Grabhorn notes that she, too, studied the Abraham teachings), and other manifestation classics, including work by David Spangler and Wayne Dyer, whose endorsement is on the cover jacket. I have personally experienced improvement in awareness and results using Abraham's approach, as others have also noted, and can attest to its benefits.The strength of this text is its focus on practical exercises and illustrations of how to put the \\"Art of Allowing\\" into action. Many examples are given of how we create--and how we can manage our life energies. But I felt this emphasis was also a weakness, and became rather repetitive...too much! On the positive side, the book did help deepen my appreciation of the core concept of \\"ask and you shall receive\\"-that is, we receive just what we vibrate, according to our beliefs, whether we are aware of it or not. For this understanding alone, the book is well worth reading!"},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"I have so much going on in my life right now - I feel like right now is crunch-time! So I decided to order some more help last week, via Amazon.I just read 2 books that I am calling \\"must reads\\". The first is this one - The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent. This book will really make you think. It will cause you to take a good look at yourself, and will convince you that there really is no reason that you can't have more, that you can't be happier, and more successful, and..... etc. etc. etc. It's the first one I've read from these authors (Hicks), and it has me fired up. Can you tell?The other one I bought is called Passengers Side, by Forosisky. In addition to what I learned from reading the Hicks' book, I now feel like my plans and goals, are backed by God himself. I know this is true, because as Forosisky says, (give or take a few words) As long as my plans are consistent with God's laws, then I can expect to receive the much needed help from above. He also backs up much of what he says with scripture, but not too much to make it dry.I would say that both these books are down right exciting! I mean as I was reading them, I was always curious to see what would follow on the next page, or in the next chapter.I will add that these two books are different, so they compliment each other. Personally, I feel like it must have been meant to be, for me to have chosen both of these.Look out satan! I am ready to reach out and grab the happiness that I know I am entitled to... the happiness that I know God has had in store for me, all along! I think with these two books in your arsenal, you can get ready to give your obstacles a knock-out punch! Hey, I Liked that way that sounded. Maybe I should right my own book. (just kidding)Seriously, as I said, these are 2 must reads. Good luck, and what ever you want to do, go for it!-Dave"},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"While I am a HUGE fan of Abraham, Jerry and Esther, and live my life as Abraham has taught, I am a little disappointed in this second book. It contains no more information than was provided in the first book. I don't suppose there was any new information that could have been given to us readers, but that was somewhat my expectation with the release of a second book. While I appreciate Jerry and Esther very much for what they have imparted to us through Abraham, and for the role they have played in my life, it now comes across as just trying to make a buck by reorganizing the same words as the first book and calling it \\"new\\"."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"Someone gave me this book. However, the authors lost me when they started talking about \\"Abraham,\\" an entity of \\"pure consciousness\\" whom they channeled while meditating together. The wife apparently started to move her head uncontrollably and the couple figured out that she was spelling out with her nose, \\"I AM ABRAHAM.\\" This was followed my more nose writing in the air that contained important messages from \\"Abraham.\\" This was just so ridiculous to me that I had to put the book down. It just isn't necessary and seems like they are using this as a ploy to make extensively and already written about ideas by other authors, seem like something spectacular based on their channeling. I did pick the book back up later and skimmed some of the chapters. There are just so many other authors saying about the same thing, and with a little more intellectual depth for my tastes. Sorry this is not a more complete review, but I just couldn't give it a more serious read."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"The Abrahams pull together a nice one here in The Amazing Power of Intent. This book is chock full of powerful exercises to help you align yourself with that which you seek.This book is an exceptionally fast read because the majority of each lesson/exercise deals with specific issues which you don't need to read if you already know what it is you are looking for from the book. If you are new to these ideas, I suggest reading the whole thing because there are helpful ideas and explanations in the exercises even if they do not address your issues directly.I dove head first into metaphysics decades ago. I had 20 years of study under my belt before I was introduced to the Abrahams, Esther and Jerry. Their approach is unique, simple and poignant. These are some of the most important factors you should be looking for in a metaphysical teaching; ESPECIALLY if you are new to this way of being. Fear not, it's all good.To quote Raekwon the Chef:\\"It's just a new way of thinkin' kid. Light up the broccoli.\\" -- from Only Built for Cuban LinxGet your groove on with the Abrahams and set your thinking straight. This book has much to offer.

Yes, I have read it. And yes, I stand by what I just said.This book is an amalgam of every best-seller formula that has appeared in publishing's self-help wing over the past decade, consolidating the likes of Osteen, Warren, Williamson, Browne, etc. The catch-22 here is that if you're mentally and emotionally set up to believe what this book tells you, then you don't need the book in the first place (if anyone truly \\"needs\\" it, that is). And if you are not of a mind--I use that word advisedly--where you can handle the metaphysical/parapsychological preachments of a book like this, then the book will leave you cold. I vote for having it leave you cold, since so much of what Hicks says, really, is silly bordering on insipid.I give it two stars only because its demographic probably will, indeed, find it \\"enriching.\\" And it's not horribly written, as these things go.

Probably not, because of the catch-22 noted above."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"As a university professor of human resource development and an Anglican brother, The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent is pure drivel and has no redeeming value whatsoever.

That is what is needed in all the Abraham materials....the how to get from A to B to C."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"This is the third Abraham-Hicks book I have bought and it will be the last. The message in all of them is really simple: 1) We create our own lives from cradle to the grave, 2)We are born to have a fun and have an enjoyable time and 3)when things get bumpy, all we need to do is be aware that our emotions are telling us that we aren't connecting with Source as we should, and that all we need to do is find some relief by finding thoughts that make us feel a little better. I kept getting the feeling that the creation of intent in this book may have had more to do with creating dollars for its authors, than helping readers with methods to create solutions to problems. And that's where my problem lies with this book and all the gazillions of self-help books feeding an insatiable Western market. Can we really take control of our lives from A-Z? We would like to think so and we keep paying dollar after to dollar to those who want us to believe that. But Abraham doesn't address the whole picture. And certainly doesn't address the picture that includes all of the world's population and disasters that occur so frequently destroying the lives of thousands at a time. What about 9/11? What about the Katrina victims? What about 6 million Jews killed during the holocaust including a million children. What would Abraham say to a mother who has just had her 5 children out of her arms on the way to the gas chamber? That she created this? That her children created this? What about the on-going Darfur misery? Are these suffering people \\"creating\\" these circumstances for themselves. If you sent them this book and said to them that they just needed to find \\"relief\\" and listen to their emotional guidence systems they could then live this joyous life they were supposedly born into, would they buy into Abraham's message? This book is a fine example of the economic principles of supply and demand. As long as we keep demanding quick fixes to life's problems, those skilled enough are going to keep feeding us \\"feel-good-for-a-while\\" self-help books. I give it two stars because it has a few interesting points in it but not worth spending money on if you have other books like it."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"If you find life difficult and in your way this book or CD package will educate you in noticing your behaivor, how to relax and change your current thinking to accomodate what you are seeking out of life.

There was no Esther Hicks or Abraham, only a rote recitation by Jerry Hicks. He reads a series of \\"games\\" to practice improving personal intent and vibrations, and adds some brief lectures. He has a fine voice, but it lacks the expression, energy, and sense of attraction to draw listeners into a space of creativity, response, and commitment. He wants his share of the spotlight, but frankly, he's tedious."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"I like this book because the focus is not merely on achieving a goal instead its on creating the right energy so that you enjoy the process without unduly focusing on achievement.

It's a good book for anyone seeking to make progress in their spiritual life."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"I bought this book a year ago and had a lot of trouble reading and understanding it for some reason. I'm not new to metaphysics so it was surprising to me that I found the book so confusing and difficult to read. I became discouraged and wondered if I wasn't \\"deep\\" enough to get it, and I stuck the book in my bookshelf and forgot about it. Then I happened to see a video of Abraham on the Abraham-Hicks website(and I also saw Esther's interview in the movie \\"The Secret\\") and once I heard the cadence of Abraham/Esther's speech it suddenly all clicked. It made a world of difference to hear Esther's wonderful voice, her use of words, her humor, and the way she delivers a sentence. Right away I decided to give the book a second chance and had absolutely no problem with the reading or comprehension. It was kind of miraculous if you knew how I'd struggled with it prior to that. Hearing her voice was the key to unlocking this book for me.Since then I've purchased two more books by Esther and Jerry and each one is a joy. I read and re-read all three of them to keep myself focused; they've opened up a whole new world for me and for that I'm grateful. I'd like to add that, for me, Louise Hay's books and CDs are a perfect compliment to this and all literature about the Law of Attraction."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"This is really really great follow up to Ask and it is Given.

The information provided by Abraham is clear and precise and easy to apply in one's life. For some it is hard to comprehend that it is channeled work, but if you apply the teachings you will find it very transformational and healing.The trick of course as with everything is to apply the teachings daily and make the teachings a habit.

What you think about today will manifest in your experiences tomorrow and the choice is yours as to whether you want those experiences to be good ones or bad ones.This book will guide you into focusing on what it is that you do want in life rather than what you do not want. Directing energy toward what you do not want will make it manifest in you experience every bit as much as if you focused on what you do want so you might as well focus on the good things.Overall I am enjoying this book more than the first one but at the same time I don't think that would have been possible if I had not first read \\"Ask and It Is Given.\\" Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"If you can avoid being scared off by the initial 20 minutes of explanation of \\"the how\\" of where the information comes from, the Abraham-Hicks material will change your life. I was a skeptic and was initially turned off by the intro, but luckily I was in my car and kept listening. Once I got to \\"the what\\" I knew I had found something spectacular. It's truth that your soul will recognize because you already know it to be true, you just didn't have much of an explanation as to how the ideas work. Why some things you like you bring to you, why some things you like you drive away. Desire seemed to not be neutral for me and I didn't know why until I read this book.The audiobook versions tend to be the best to start with and then you'll need to get a book to sift through later for reference. I personally like Ask and it is Given better, but it seems to be so similar that it's one or the other, not both. If after loving this you need more material, I suggest getting the recordings of talks. I also like to alternate between material read by Jerry, which is energetic and odd but gives something unique, and talks given by Esther, who's soft, easy to listen to and funny. Each approach is different, and each is valid. I initially had a preference, but now I like them both and listen to either according to my mood and needs. Jerry's more practical and didactic, Esther's more feeling-tones.Have fun on this journey. This stuff is SO much more powerful than the Secret or even the Wayne Dyer stuff I started out with. Those aren't meant as knocks, it's just an indication of where on the metaphysical food chain this lies.

The teaching's of Abraham may not be everyones cup of tea however anyone can take what is intended from this book and their others, which is what we think we attract, then receive, then we must allow. This all occurs whether we are wanting it to happen or not. We are all vibrational beings living in a vibrational world.

This awarness tool is referred to as a 'Leading-Edge vantage point' in intending our creativity to 'the most significant wave of expansion that has ever occurred'. The focusing of desire by us can call forth the Creative Energy of the Universe, which is the source of all life's evolution.A key to our understanding of the power of intention comes to us through the vibrational interpreters within ourselves, that we call emotions. They provide us in every moment an indication of the vibrational relationship between the Non-Physical You and the physical you. Abraham states that 'nothing can enhance your physical experience more than an understanding of our emotions'. As we pay attention to our emotions, we can literally feel our way to our vibrational alignment with our Source.The popular question 'Who am I?' and 'Why am I here?'is mapped and answered within us, and understood as we achieve and maintain the continuum between you and You. Each of the moments in this life is impacted by our connection and alignment, or lack of connection and alignment, to our Inner Being. As this connection is developed and matures you begin to become the You that you were before you were born into this physical body."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"I've loved Abraham's work for years.

Why, after reading my positive comments and reviews of their previous books, you ask? Maybe it's me, but I could not get into this book at all. As I continued reading a loud question kept popping into my head, \\"What the heck are these people talking about? I just don't get this book!\\"By reaching chapter 25, the chapters are very short, I gave up and switched to another book. I had bought this book for my vacation reading and wasn't having any fun doing so. What happened? The last book, \\"Ask and It Is Given,\\" was awesome in all respects. Could I \\"not be ready\\" for the material presented in this book thus, could not comprehend the message?..................Ahhhh!......NO! I don't thinks it's me.I can appreciate you may not agree with me, and that's okay. We are all on our own path in our journey of personal development. This book was just too far out there for me.

I really got a lot out of it.I must say I was a bit leary at first about Abraham and the authors. I still can't quite buy into the idea that everything I ask for is given to me, or that the authors are so confident in their healthy emotions they cancelled their medical insurance or that every disastor victim attracted their misfortunes with \\"bad vibs.\\"Having said that, it is truly a wonderful study in positive thinking and really simple, but effective techniques to improve your emotions and outlook on life.

How can you go wrong by being positive and grateful, thus bringing more abundance into your life? BUT...I have to say I already had read \\"Ask and it is Given\\" and found this book to be not much more than the same information shaken up and re-packaged. I also liked the way the information was presented better in that book than this one...perhaps because I read the other one first. If you are not familiar with Abraham-Hicks I would recommend \\"Ask and it is Given\\" rather than this book."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"It took a closer reading of this book to fully appreciate it, having read 'Ask And It Is Given' and 'The Law of Attraction.' If you are new to these teachings, I recommend, you read one of those first in order to fully appreciate what is presented here. This book focuses on the NOW, in making sure you stay aligned with your higher non-physical self(and thus source energy/God/universe), moment by moment. Exercises and examples are offered to help you get back on track towards alignment no matter what your emotional state. Yes, there is some repetition from other books, but that is what it takes to \\"get it\\". And while I was initially disappointed that some of the same processes discussed in 'Ask..' were repeated here, I realized that these were specifically chosen given the theme of this book, and the fresh examples offered, provided another incentive to use them! For those who have understood the basics, and then get stuck occasionally, or want to ratchet up their alignment with source, this book is a must. For me, it reinforced some fundamental points:i) that more important than want you desire, is how you FEEL about that desire, and the vibration you offer.ii) feeling good about something or a situation is more important than being right or justified in your negative emotion/judgment of it.iii) nothing is more important than feeling good.(For those who are critical of 'feeling good' or see it as selfish while African children are starving, recognize that unless we feel good, we are unable to be of benefit to others or focus beyond our immediate needs, let alone anyone else's. Also, as we move up the emotional scale toward peace/love/joy, our perceptions of 'self' is also more likely to change to embrace all beings as part of the interconnectedness that is the Universe, and one with Source. This is more likely to result in creating more compassionate deliberate intentions and manifestations to benefit all beings!Ultimately though, this book is about making the most of our time in this physical plane, using our consciousness and thoughts to keep us in alignment with source energy in order to experience joy and abundance."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"I loved the book.

This book is the fruition of years worth of work. The many questions asked by those who wanted answers to \\"how to create or re-create your reality\\", was the drive behind the creation of this book. It has been fine tuned to assist you in becoming aware and responsible for the creations that you are experiencing now (and understanding how you created it)that have been created in the past and becoming aware of your thoughts today, for the creations you will manifest in your future. I have read many books on manifesting, and they do not compare to the clarity and compassion that Abraham offers us. They are very precise on the Law of Attraction. It is explained thoroughly and is easy to understand. I've read their previous book, yet I feel that this book is more precise in explanation and they offer several ways in which you can work with their suggestions. It's up to you. You need to find your way, and what you are comfortable doing. If there is only one book to buy, this is it. The others can collect dust on the shelf.Don't fall for those programs, paying someone to teach you how to manifest. It is not necessary. Speak to anyone who has done it and they will tell you for free. Don't throw your money into someone else's pocket.

Maybe not \\"Dead\\" on because according to Abraham there is no death.

The Law of Attraction can get deep with the theory that \\"Thought becomes Things\\" but I think this book clears up a missing piece or even two pieces of getting it to work for you.Easter and Jerry Hicks do not say they received these teaching from the Bible but if you have read and tried to understand it's (Bible) teachings, this book (The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent) may clear things up a bit and seem like extended teachings of our God and His creation of this planet.

This book is read by Jerry Hicks in a very flat, speed reading style. Many of these recordings are from other A-H recordings so be prepared for unoriginal material. Additionally, the same endless list of examples is used multiple times with very little variation which I found annoying and hard to listen to. This is from a person who listens to talk radio and recorded self-help type books on a daily basis. The recordings which feature Esther speaking for Abraham are very engaging. This one was a real disappointment to me. I wish they would stick to the format of Esther speaking directly."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"The second of the Hicks books that I've read - and this one largely mirrored the first. There is a component where Esther and Jerry discuss their relationship with \\"Abraham\\", their name for Collective Consciousness. Then they take the reader through elements to discuss the power of positive thought, the impact of vibration on the manifestation of desires, and the interrelationship between the mind and physical creation.The middle of the book contains affirmations and analysis of several example issues (like the overbearing parent or the bad job), as well as a description of the 22 levels of the Emotional Guidance Scale. They then walk the reader through example exercises and techniques to raise the vibrations from dismal to hopeful and beyond.Whether you buy into the Collective Consciousness, the mediumship of Esther, the concept of vibratory resonance, or the New Age thinking, the principles of positive thought, impacting the subconscious, and viewing things in a positive light - or glass half full - espoused in the book is useful for anyone. The book is a quick and easy read, and the techniques it contains should be effective in promoting positive thought and positive results."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"This book is about guiding ones emotions to a higher vibrational rate, one baby step at a time. The idea is to simply take on different perspectives and notice how they make you feel. Taking on new perspectives, engaging in thought experiments is a great habit for anyone. I gave it four stars only, because I love their hand held cards. The book has the advantage of helping those who are 'really stuck' by demonstrating the types of new angles one may take on a handful of specific life situations. That said, there are a few experiments I haven't yet explored fully. I will revise when I have."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"Of all the Abraham books I have read, so far this one is my favorite. I should add that I have not read their vortex book yet, and I am looking forward to doing so.The first half of this book is an expansion upon the ideas presented in Ask and It is Given. I think the information presented here was even more stimulating than the previous book. The chapters on Vibrational Relativity and Finding Alignment are particularly helpful. Also helpful are the chapters on Improved Vibrational Relativity and The Action Journey and the Emotional Journey.This book also contains some of the best processes Abraham has offered. Most notable is the Focus-Wheel, often mentioned by Abraham elsewhere. This is where Abraham first explained the process and gave examples applied to various situations.The biggest problem I found in this book was wading through the several chapters on Vibrational Relativity regarding.... Also the several chapters regarding balancing desires and beliefs. These chapters become very redundant. I think they would have worked much better formatted into tables. That would have made the information much easier to scan and reference.That complaint aside, any Abraham book is worth reading.

In a universe that is composed entirely of God's (or Source Energy's) love for us, all that we ever ask for is unconditionally and instantaneously given to us... and the very purpose of our life is to live in the joy of creating our own desires and finding perfect harmony with them!This material refines the same material of \\"Ask and It Is Given\\" into more specific, detailed examples of how to balance our own energy -- which is to say, to align our energy with the energy of the fulfillment of our desires, all of which have already been granted by God, or Source, so that we may live as we wish to live. The book helps us to approach the task of energy balancing in a step-by-step fashion for those of us who haven't quite gotten it down specifically and successfully yet!As always, the words are filled with love for us and our foibles, our hopes and dreams, and our willingness to expose ourselves to the \\"contrast,\\" or diversity of life, in the human race here on Earth. And they tell us how our living here in joy adds to the joy of the entire universe.All of the Abraham material is as uplifting as anything I've ever found anywhere. It may serve as an adjunct to more traditional spiritual pursuits or may stand on its own as your guide to the Universe, and how to get to wherever you want to be in your own life. It's always uplifting, and always a welcome message in my home!I, as many, can't thank Esther and Jerry enough for their enormous contribution to our well-being as we find answers to personal questions in this ongoing, evolving, and always-available dialogue!I also highly recommend their website, www.abraham-hicks.com, and their seminars and seminar CD's, on which you can find answers to questions on specific topics."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"Breaks down the law of attraction in such away that it is actually understandable.

And like so many of the resources I've used during this time, \\"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent\\" (TAPoDI)focuses on tapping into the unrealized potential that lives within all of us, but simply isn't used because we a) don't know about it and b) don't understand how to use it.As someone who's studied a large volume of material on this general topic, I tend to look at such works from the viewpoint of \\"how is this material similar to other works I've studied\\" and \\"what does it have to offer that's new, original and, especially, useful. Here's my take on TAPoDI:Like many other \\"New Age\\" authors, Esther and Jerry Hicks present to us a view of life in which WE, ourselves, are both the biggest limiting factor in our lives and the key to unleashing the utterly unlimited potential that is the human \\"spirit\\". WE create our own life experience. Period. If our lives aren't what we want them to be, aren't enjoyable and don't consist of the things we love most, we have only ourselves to look to for change. If we are living limited and unsatisfying lives, it is we who have (often unwittingly) CHOSEN to do so ... nothing or no one else is to \\"blame\\" ... it is we who create our own eperience of life.But, never fear. As beings whose true nature is that of unlimited spirit with the power to create all that we dream of, it is only our lack of understanding of our true potential and our unwillingness to explore that potential and use it that has kept us locked in lives we don't enjoy completely. Esther and Jerry clearly believe, as do many authors I've studied, that the practical potential of humanity is truly unlimited. In this sense they seem to be adding their voices to the growing number of people whose experience of life is teaching them that we have within us ALREADY the power to create whatever life we want for ourselves.For me, what differentiated the Hicks' book from others I've read on this general topic was their understanding of the role of human emotions and our response to them in navigating the \\"HOW\\" of unleashing our unlimited potential for joy and satisfaction. I mean, it's one thing to declare that human beings have truly unlimited potential ... it's quite another to figure out how to EXPERIENCE that unlimited potential in our day to day lives. What Esther and Jerry have to show us in this book is incredibly useful. What they seem to understand in a way I've not seen presented elsewhere is nothing less than \\"what human emotions are for and how we can use them to help us navigate our way to a better and better life\\". What's the scoop?As unlimited beings of spirit, energy, vibration ... call it what you will ... we are constantly creating our own experience of life. The question is ... are we creating the the experiences we WANT ... or the experiences we DON'T WANT? And how can we tell? Along these lines, I've often heard people jokingly say \\"wouldn't it be nice if our lives came with a little dash board full of dials and idiot lights that told us when we were doing something stupid and when we were doing something smart\\" ... well, according to Esther and Jerry ... that's precisely what our emotions are!From their point of view, negative emotions like frustration, anger, resentment, fear, doubt and the rest are indications that we're looking at life from a point of view which is NOT in harmony with our truly unlimited potential. In short, if you feel bad, you're looking at life from a direction that is NOT an accurate reflection of who and what you really are or what you're capable of creating. IN that moment, you're creating precisely what you DON'T WANT. Your negative feelings are trying to tell you \\"stop looking at life this way ... if you keep it up, you're not going to create the kind of experiences you want for yourself.\\"On the other hand, when you're feeling happy, peaceful, kind, cheerful, relaxed, satisfied, joyful and free ... it's an indication that the way you're looking at life is in harmony with the \\"real you\\", who is fully capable of creating exactly what you want in life. In those moments, you're creating the life you DO want for yourself.According to the Hicks, our emotions are the most useful, immediate and relevant indicators of whether or not we're creating the life we want for ourselves or creating it's opposite. So ... when you feel bad ... learn to understand this as a warning to change your outlook and move it in the direction of \\"I am the unlimited creator of my own experience ... what do I want to create here? What do I really want?\\". And keep moving your thoughts in this direction until you start to feel good ... the indicator that you're now creating what you DO want.Much of the New Age message is \\"stop looking to the world around you to tell you whether or not you're living your life as you should ... rather ... look inside yourself and pay attention to what you find there ... follow it ... trust it ... and find yourself living a life that works better, feels better and IS better.\\" What the Hicks do in TAPoDI is give us an INCREDIBLY useful tool for figuring out HOW to do that. Let your emotions be your guide as to whether or not your living in harmony with your \\"best self\\" ... that's what they're FOR.READING NOTE - The Hicks use the words vibration and vibrational a lot in their book, and to those who aren't used to this language, it can be a bit like reading a foreign language ... you see the word, but you're not sure what it means. The first time I read this book, I found their use of these words very challenging, as I was never quite sure what they were trying to say with them. But something drew me back to this book recently, and I had an insight. I started reading the book and jotting down on the page the word I would use in place of vibration or vibrational, depending on the context of the sentence. I re-read the entire book this way, and it made a huge difference.In my common language, I found that \\"vibration\\" or \\"vibrational\\" could mean a wide range of things like spirit, spiritual, desire, the combination of a desire and my attitude about that desire, etc. The way it felt to me ... when I wasn't quite ready to hear what the Hicks had to say, their use of these words was very challenging to me. When I finally felt ready to listen, what they meant became perfectly clear to me. What do I mean?What the Hicks are really saying in their book is quite simple. Human beings create their own experience of life ... we come equipped with emotions that tell us when we're creating experiences we'll enjoy and when we're not. If we take full responsibility for listening to the guidance of our emotions and using our unlimited spiritual power to create what we want ... we'll be unbelievably happy and fulfilled ... if we don't, we'll continue to live lives of mediocrity and frustration. The up side of this message is ... you can be as happy as you decide you want to be. The down side ... ONLY you can make you happy. My experience of life has taught me that MOST of us are NOT quite ready to take full personal responsibility for our happiness. MOST of us would rather belive it's someone or something else's fault that we're not completely happy. Someone or something else is keeping us from living the life we want to live. What the Hicks are saying is \\"it's all us, baby\\" ... \\"if you're happy ... you did it. If you're not happy ... you did it.\\"When I first read this book ... or tried to read it ... I wasn't ready to take that level of responsibility for my happiness. I still wanted to believe, at least in part, that someone else should fix my broken life. When I finally got past that ... suddenly understanding their words was not just easy ... it was joyful.FOLLOW UP - MAY 2008To get an even more \\"effective\\" presentation of the ideas the Hicks and Abraham are offering, try their audio CD's (recordings of their workshops). I find them REALLY helpful. In the workshops, the ideas presented in this book are explored from more different angles, with a broader and more flexible vocabulary, and with a wider variety of examples of using these ideas to address real life, every day \\"problems\\" of people from the audience. The CD's really helped me form a much more gut level, intuitive understanding of how we truly create our own experiences, how we get in the way of experiencing many of the things we want most and how we can practically and effectively change that, so that what we want becomes what we experience MUCH more quickly. The CD's helped me really understand that the biggest challenge to utilizing the material presented by the Hicks is that it's SO easy, it takes most of us a long time to get to the point where we believe that life really can be this good. But it can. My fiance and I have seen what seemed to be hurdle after hurdle just fall away as we've learned to truly and practically ALLOW our lives to be enjoyable and effortless. Things that used to feel like dreams to us are happening at a much more rapid pace and we have a very strong sense of the connection between the choices we're making with our emotional state and the results we're achieving in the \\"real world\\". Check out the CD's if you enjoyed the books. I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"Perhaps in contrast to some other reviewers, I really find \\"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent\\" to be more impressive than \\"Ask and It Is Given\\". This book feels richer in some way, particularly in the first half where Abraham expands on the principles of manifestation in a way I've never read anywhere before.I feel Abraham's real emphasis in this book is on the necessity of a person finding vibrational alignment with their inner being (higher self, etc) in order for our beautiful desires and thoughts to flow through into our lives as actual manifestations. While \\"Ask and It Is Given\\" is truly wonderful (and I think the more important book to read first for those just discovering this information), this book represents a real evolution of some of the key concepts. It feels like a deeper work to me somehow, and I find myself returning to its pages frequently throughout the day.I agree that some of the exercises may seem repetitious, but I believe this is intentional; by exposing us to real-world situations (and ones that nearly all of us have experienced at some time), it makes the entire process of deliberate creation a more understandable one. It's as though the first book is the basic reference text, and this one is a kind of \\"Advanced Applications of...\\" sequel. Read it and you'll see what I mean.So in essence, the first book has all one needs to create the life of their dreams -- but this book makes the process so much deeper, supportive and illuminating.

This book can truly be a great resource if you are ready to allow yourself what you really truly want.If you don't own previous works of abraham-hicks, this book is great. Yet if you own books or recordings, or frequent their website, this book propably will not offer you anything new. The same processes that we got to know in \\"Ask and It Is Given\\" are again presented here, with new examples.Personally I find the two first books of Abraham and Hicks the best A New Beginning I and II, their material comes alive when in dialogue with people and their problems or wishes.This is a how-to book.

Truth will always be the same; yesterday, today, and tomorrow. Of course, people will always find different ways to say the same thing, but the bottom line is that it will still be the same thing. The question is not whether or not you want to buy the book, the question should be, \\"Am I really going to embody the messages that I am reading\\"? I have over 1,000 books in my personal library and yeah, a lot of them are incredibly similar, but I find that even with the slightest bit of a slant on something, I can understand it and apply it in a whole new way.The real truth is that we don't really need any of the books we have read or will read. We don't need to go to lectures or seminars or even to church or the temple; all we really need to ever really do is go within. Past our personal b.s. (belief systems) and straight to our own personal fount of wisdom and truth. The reason we don't go there more is because we are scared that we might run into a monster or two but hey, I created the monsters in my life, as well. I might as well embrace them. Besides, monsters are so misunderstood and they need love too.But get this book and start consciously and deliberately applying the information. No, you probably won't bump into anything new, but embrace what you are willing to now know fully and completely.I bless you on your journey."},{"Title":"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent 4-CD: Part I: Living the Art of Allowing (Pt. 1)","review":"This is undeniably an incredible book where the message of taking personal responsibility to reach WITHIN and move into your center, your essence, and from that point, allowing your intentions to flow into manifestation, instead of racking your brain trying to control everything outside of you is the Divine gift of this book.I would have to also say that as you read, you will become much more aware of the process by which true manifestation occurs, and as you learn to get out of your own way, by bringing yourself back to center, you will undoubtedly be living the process of pure and effortless manifestation - because it is the natural state of your BEING, and this is hence made clear in your expression and manifestation combined.A superior classic right from start to finish!

So, I read this material as if it was written by Esther and Jerry Hicks based on tapping the all-knowing power within them. That being said, I do appreciate those techniques and explanations why it is important to master one's own feelings while creating a life that is enjoyable.Based on my own spiritual expeditions, I know there is nothing more important than learning to be the commander of your own feelings, mental as well as self-images. Toward this purpose, Abraham-Hicks offers great tools, easy-to-understand and implement techniques.This is my first Abraham-Hicks book that I have read, and I must say it explains things so that even someone not too familiar with their teachings can grasp it, understand what they mean -- and follow along. They say it is a sequel to \\"Ask and It Is Given\\", but even without reading \\"Ask and It Is Given\\", I was able to follow the trail without a problem.The only reason why I give 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that I think the book has too much filler. Same technique is explained with so many boring examples that I started feeling a bit irritated (revising those feelings as I write). I don't know about rest of you, but I get it with few examples. I don't need fifty examples how to apply it. I am a creative being, I can do it on my own. The way Abe-Hicks did it is that they gave a technique, and then made up tens of different cases and instructed on each case how to use it.. It started to feel like \\"Abraham-Hicks for dummies\\" toward the end... DUH!However, my slight irritation and skipping those examples paid off and in the end of the book I found much appreciated Abraham-Hicks transcript with Q&A.; It too seemed more or less like filler.... but at least it was ten times more interesting to read than the examples.Beginners --- feel free to get a copy of this book.. Advanced Abers, I am not sure how much new information you would discover from this book... These same things are discussed on numerous Abraham-Hicks tapes that a friend has shared with me previously. So it is not all that new.It works, if you do those damn drills... and this is science that I love...

He has divided the works into categories as follows: the &quot;Trooping Fairies&quot; (fairies, changelings, and the &quot;merrow&quot; or mermaids); the &quot;Solitary Fairies&quot; (the lepracaun, the pooka - an animal spirit, and the banshee); &quot;Ghosts&quot;; &quot;Witches &amp; Fairy Doctors&quot;; &quot;T'yeer-na-n-Oge&quot; or &quot;Tir-na-n-Og&quot; (a legendary island said to appear and disappear); &quot;Saints &amp; Priests&quot;; &quot;The Devil&quot;; &quot;Giants&quot;; and &quot;Kings / Queens / Princesses / Earls / Robbers.&quot; Yeats introduces each section with background information on the creature the stories in that category will concern. He also includes numerous footnotes of interest, making this book a valuable resource for anyone seeking to learn about the tradition of Irish folklore.While I have given this anthology a five-star rating based on it's value as a source of information on Irish mythology, it would probably be worth only four stars for entertainment value alone. Some of the stories are very short and/or don't have much of a point, and are less interesting. These tend to serve more as testimony to the nature of a particular mythical being rather than being an actual story with a plot and message for the reader. Nevertheless, the book as a whole offers a very comprehensive look at just what defines Irish folk culture. The stories that do have a point sometimes take the form of &quot;how things came to be this way&quot; tales, or provide a moral lesson, etc. Many of the stories are rather dark, as that tends to be the nature of lore from this region, but there are also some lighthearted and cheerful pieces.Despite the book having been compiled more than one hundred years ago, most of the stories are quite easy to read. Yeats makes things even more simple for the reader by making footnotes where old Irish words or phrases are used, giving us their meaning. However, there are a few stories that have been left in a more archaic form, which is distracting and a bit harder to decipher. Take, for example, the following excerpt:&quot;. . . the minit he puts his knife into the fish, there was a murtherin' screech, that you'd the life id lave you if you hurd it, and away jumps the throut out av the fryin'-pan into the middle o' the flure; and an the spot where it fell, up riz a lovely lady - the beautifullest crathur that eyes ever seen, dressed in white, and a band o' goold in her hair, and a sthrame o' blood runnin' down her arm.&quot;One of the things I enjoy most about literature is finding connections with other works I've read, and &quot;Irish Fairy &amp; Folk Tales&quot; does not disappoint in this regard. Many of the pieces are derivations of other, more common fairy tales. For instance, &quot;Smallhead and the King's Sons&quot; (Ghosts) incorporates some elements from both &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Hansel and Gretel,&quot; while &quot;The Giant's Stairs&quot; (Giants) has some similarities to the story of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk.&quot; There are more connections like this. On the whole I found this book to be very enjoyable, and also a valuable read from a literary / academic standpoint. I'd certainly recommend it to anyone interesting in the history of Irish culture, the study of fairy tales and folklore, or both."},{"Title":"Fairy and folk tales of the Irish peasantry (The Camelot series)","review":"These stories that Yeats collected are as deeply moving as his poetry. You have the feeling that this collection is a part of the deep well that Yeats' created his earlier 'Celtic Twilight' poetry from.

Read this in the winter by the fire with a copy of Yeats' early poetry and prepare for a twilight wandering amongst shadowy woods, quiet country roads and green green hills.

Yeats in 1892. There have been several other versions, under different titles, notably one published by Barnes & Noble, and another from Modern Library with a forward by Paul Muldoon. Both of the latter go under the title \\"Irish Fairy and Folk Tales.\\" All three are collected and edited by William Butler Yeats, arguably the greatest poet the island ever produced. They are essentially the same collection, with the exception that the B&N; version also contains an account of the Fate of the Children of Lir, together with beautiful engravings illustrating the entire volume.Both Yeats and Lady Gregory were especially concerned that the best of the tales from the Irish countryside be preserved before their main purveyors, the Shenaches (storytellers) vanished. Those collected here are a varied lot, and not all of them will appeal to every reader. That, however, does not affect their value at all, for here a way of life is preserved and we can look through a small window into the beliefs and habits of the Irish people in the days when the \\"Fairy Faith\\" was still common amongst them. It is probably best not to read the collection straight through, but rather peruse it, selecting from it that which most appeals.Yeats's singular contribution is the dividing the denizens of the Irish Enchanted Countryside into categories: The Trooping Fairy, The Solitary Fairy, the Sociable Fairy, etc, together with Ghosts, Witches, Giants and the like. Within each \\"type\\" there are essays, songs, poems, hearsay, histories ... in short, something to appeal to every taste, as long as that taste has a goodly sampling of fancy about it.These fairies are not the gossamer winged, luminous beings of Victorian paintings. These fairies are as likely to curse as to bless and it does not benefit the unwary or skeptical to offend them. Here are pookas, leprechauns, far darrig, Ban-Shees, and lanawn-shees.These creatures were ever present to the Irish peasantry, and were forgotten with the industrialization of modern times. Fortunately, thanks to the efforts of Yeats and others like him, much of this world was preserved for us.Some of the stories and poems retain their Irish intonation and syntax and may be difficult for some to follow, but patience will be rewarded; One can almost \\"hear\\" the storyteller and the bard.This is a volume well worth going back to again and again."},{"Title":"Fairy and folk tales of the Irish peasantry (The Camelot series)","review":"While Yeats relied on mostly 19th century literary versions of folktales, which often distorted the stories somewhat in the interest of catering to the Victorian English-speaking cities, the stories themselves are well chosen to represent a wide range of common Irish folk tales and mythical creatures. The stories themselves, moreover, are indeed more literary than perhaps more authentic collections, such as Kevin Danaher's, and are therefore a little more interesting to read. I plan to use this text in a course on Irish literature both because the tales are a good introduction to Irish folklore and because the tales demonstrate how the early-twentieth-century Irish Renaissance adopted, adapted, and remolded the Irish Gaelic tradition."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],P={key:0},E={key:1};function L(s,o,n,c,r,a){const u=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=i("div",{class:"top-banner"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),i("div",F,[(e(!0),t(y,null,w(a.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),g(u,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",E,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",P,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const j=d(D,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-eb7ae801"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/34.md","filePath":"quotes/34.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/34.md"},M=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(o,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(j)]))}});export{q as __pageData,M as default};
