Dune messiah paints it like it is."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I've read all 6 books several times (and I have a life!). The way Herbert builds a society, and describes its many aspects, is unparalleled. The entire series is really about control and power. Who/what is in charge? The government? econmics? religion? technology? military? males? females? nature?Once the reader gets by the new vocabulary (interestingly based on Hebrew &amp; Arabic), and gets into the story (you may wish to have a scorecard), you will be completely absorbed and will not want to put the books down.P.S. Even though the movie is pathetic, I have to thank its creators. I had not yet read the books, but the story seemed compelling. I bought the first book the next day, and my literary life was changed. This got me into sci-fi reading (Asimov, Heinlein, etc...). Thank you Frank Herbert."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Many times when reading this book, I became so enveloped by the story I even forgot that I was reading; turning the pages was only a reflex, necessary to maintain the even flow of time. It is the one book which I have been the most sad to see end, and yet the most happy to have read. Let Frank Herbert bring you into his world of great sandworms, Gods and Emperors, villains, heroes, and a small boy at the center of it all.If there were only one book I would ever read, this would be it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I just finished reading Dune, and it was so good!!! Frank Herbert has great talent expressing everything he writes in great detail.His writing style is very different from most authors, but it is fabulouse! The book is filled with all different things. Whether you like reading about fighting and wars, spirituality and religion, or imaginative futuristic worlds, everyone will love this book!! Dune is a book no one should pass up.READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert is a true master of this century. Dune is not merely a prophetic tale of our future, but a glimpse into every individual's most secret place."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I love the original Dune books and have also enjoyed the new ones. I own the entire series and can't think of a better recommendation to give."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I had watched the motion picture based on this novel years ago, not really enjoying the dark, sadistic overtone the movie conveyed. Needless to say I was a bit skeptical when I started reading Mr. Herbert's magnum opus. Please allow me to say the obvious. This book is wonderful, brilliant, and thought-provoking! The mental imagery that I experienced while reading was so much more fantastical compared to David Lynch's vision. I shared the hatred for the Harkonnens just as the Atreides family felt, I was in awe of the amazing supernatural capabilities Paul gained as he aged to a man in the Arrakis deserts. However, as the story came to it's crescendo at the end I was left feeling lost, confused, and wondering \\"now what?\\" This may end with Paul's success as Emperor but, as a woman, I felt a bit slighted that his true love Chani was almost pushed aside since she felt she didn't matter any longer. I suppose I need to read the next book. I do recommend this to anyone who has a love for a good story. This may be a science-fiction work but it reads just as well as any classic novel. Case in point, don't watch a movie and think the original is just as bad. Read the book!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"There are plenty of full-length reviews already written, I just wanted to give this book a 5 star rating. Along with Isaac Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" series it is one of the best sci-fi novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If you preferred the book over the movie, you will love this audio presentation. I preferred the movie version because it was a little faster pace. Audio kept me entertained on my Christmas drive from Houston to Phoenix."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would. The premise was very creative. There were some good messages about preparing for the future, and refraining before showing anger."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I was hesitant to read this book because I had seen the disastrous movie several years earlier.However, I can testify that David Lynch made absolutely no effort whatsoever to turn the book into a script. He just filmed portions of the book being \\"acted out\\", almost at random. The result: surprise...the movie made no sense.The book is quite a masterful piece of writing, describing an outer space society that has a fully explained economy and political structure, all while maintaining a good pace given the inherent dryness of many of the topics involved.Subsequent attempts to make a decent movie from the material also failed...but it remains a very good book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If you do nothing else in your life, read this series, including the works continued by Mr. Herbert's son. It is a feast for the mind, and a thousand lessons in the bit's and pieces that make up our collective unconscious."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Volume one beats Herbert's others hands down. With intriguing political plays and fascinating twists, Dune stands alone as a stunning fantasy. Those who enjoy it might find \\"Destiny Feared\\" by K. D. Snyder a great read. Both authors are among my favorites."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It's hard to add anything to what's been said about Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" in the 45 years since it first appeared. \\"Dune\\" was already a classic when i read it in 1981, and unlike many SF books from the cusp of speculative fiction's New Wave, its impact remains as timeless now as it did then. Herbert grounded his sprawling tale of imperial politics and ecological revolution in a character story worthy of Tolstoy, downplaying the nuts-and-bolts aspects of his milieu's technology in a way that prevents \\"Dune\\" from seeming stale, even today.As with many of the most seminal works of speculative fiction and fantasy, the most amazing thing about \\"Dune\\" is how close it came to never seeing print, having been passed over by twenty publishers before being initially picked up by a nonfiction small press. In the canon of F&SF;, there are few books whose importance literally cannot be understated. \\"Dune\\" is one of those. Without it, the world of imaginative literature would not be the same.I break with a lot of Herbert fans in my complete dispassion for the later \\"Dune\\" books, including the capstone of the original trilogy, \\"Children of Dune\\". To anyone who hasn't read the books, my recommendation is always to read \\"Dune\\" and \\"Dune Messiah\\" back to back as one continuous narrative, with the sequel bringing Herbert's vision to a satisfying and heartbreaking end."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is a quick read and a sci-fi favorite of mine. It was surprisingly a calm book. In hindsight the book is written just like the setting of Dune: it's super calm, can be harsh and violent at times like the dessert, and strangely charismatic. A must-read sci-fi classic that tells a story about a legendary boy's journey to adulthood and more!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This novel is considered by many to be a classic. I agree. Some have complained about proofreading and typo's in the Kindle edition. If these problems existed, they have been corrected.I thought the price was a bit high, but that didn't stop me. (I took off one star for the price.)"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Cool relationships and psychology between characters. Only downside is that the glossary is hard to access and the price is a bit steep"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is a very interesting and enlightening read. I have read many fantasy and scifi books in my time and rate this as one if the best. It is actually a blend of the two genres in my opinion. You do need to focus when reading as some of the words are just made up, but make sense in context so don't need unnatural narrative exposition.It is really a chosen one(s) story, but done very well. It has lots of intrigue and you are genuinely unsure who will live or die.A book for the ages."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"this book is the first in a series of such depth and majesty. the absolute skill with which this world is woven leaves the majority of science fiction far behind."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It took me a little bit to get into the book because of the (albeit necessary) complicated, lengthy exposition. Once I got a handle on the characters and backplot, however, it was difficult to put this novel down. I enjoyed the character development and the relationships between them. I see why it is a classic!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If you want to get lost from the current reality this world binds you to, there is no better way than through this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The best SF book ever written and thats saying something as I have been reading and collecting SF books for over 50 years... I just wish that his son Biran was half the writter that Frank was... Anyway I love the entire series."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This novel is not just a true masterpiece of Science Fiction but also of literature!! This book is packed with so many amazing ideas without distracting from the powerful story.No other book, other than Lord of the Rings, compares to its craftsmanship.Both books deal with the Theme of \\"POWER\\". LOTR with the quest of giving up power and DUNE with the consequences of pursuing and wielding power.Both are Must reads before you die!!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A lot of great sci-fi focuses on the effect the technological environment has on the people within it. Few if any sci-fi works do this better than Dune. The anti-technology Butlerian Jihad highlights that. Like many of the classics, it creates a brilliant setting, but goes above and beyond with that.With the political intrigue that dominates the setting, it's appropriate that Paul's outmanuevering of the Emperor is a key part of the climax, one of my many favorite scenes. Irulan as part of the deal (not to mention Leto keeping Jessica as a legal concubine) highlighted marriage as pragmatic, while the bit about viewing Chani as his real wife also highlighted marriage as romantic.I first noticed Paul's story as a bildungsroman (about a young character mentally growing up), but it also seems to fit the hero's journey archetype.Herbert has a brilliant way of handling religion."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The storyline is thick with intrigues, and sub-plots within sub-plots. The character development is superb and very believable, providing depth to the political planetary conflict between the competing royal houses.Spoiler Alert: I thought the failed Coup d'&eacute;tat formulated by the na-Baron Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, who concealing a tiny poison needle-dart just below the skin in the upper thy of a drugged slave boy, that was offered as a human sextoy to his homosexual uncle the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, was creatively exquisite.The fight scene at the end (without giving it away) was epic, but I'm sorry to say, the books in the series that came after this one were hurried and most unworthy of Dune.Anyone who reads my other reviews, knows I am one critical bastard, and seldom give a book five stars unless it's deserving. This is perhaps the best science fiction book ever written in American history (I read it at least three times). There is not much else to say, other than purchase this book, you will not be disappointed, even if you do not like science fiction.I highly recommend that at this exact moment you purchase this book. I am certain you won't be let down."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Unfortuantly, Dune Messiah does not live up to Dune. Dune I gave five stars, however, this book does not go in depth about anything. It merely skimms the top of everything and doesn't explain or explore as well as it could have, and should have.Dune Messiah attempts to build on Dune, the ultimate in sci-fi, and fails miserably. Instead of bettering the Dune story, it weakens it with bad plot twists that are nothing like that of Dune.I had trouble reading the end of this book because it starts out slow, and doesn't improve. It laggs through the whole story whereas Dune the origional glued you to the book.Finally, Messiah mocks the origional Dune by weakenning the structure with which Dune was created and the glory was origionally born.So if you're looking to find the magic that Dune brought, don't read Massiha, it just doesn't live up to the name Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Sure the book had some good concepts but the way the author had to constanly remind me that paul was a hero, got a bit on my case. Also the man managed to write a 500 page novel in which hardly anything takes palce. Having read foundation by asimov i find that this collection is paled in comparison. The work was creative but not creative enough to be hailed like the way it is."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book would be a great gift to a younger reader (age 12 or so) to get them interested in the science fiction field. However, for older readers there are just a lot of better books out there. To some a three star review is bad but this is not a bad book. It is just not a great book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is indeed one of the best science fiction works produced however I must give it a miserable review on account of the almost criminal selection of narrators! There are a great many text to speech programs available which offer a more enjoyable listening experience! I am no stranger to audiobooks but this one is almost unbearable to listen to on account of the deplorable narration!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"note that this novel came out in 1965. i would not recommend it as an introduction to herbert, for those who dont know his worlds, because it is his first major work. the full flavor of herbert is only developed later. some of the space-opera flavor of dune is old fashioned, but some fine writing is contained within. indeed, herbert in small doses can be even more revealing than long passages: study the chapter header quotes carefully; herbert speaks to you directly there. i recommend after a first reading, going back to reread the headers only. another recommendation for those new to herbert: forget what you've heard about this being a novel about 'ecology' or some such. herbert's ecological concerns are a background to the main story. the large idea is changes to human conciousness under duress. remember this if you read more herbert. a few words on style. the concerns, attitudes and thoughts of the characters here and in herbert deal with more crucial concerns than any other scifi world i have read. the reader is definitely challenged to keep up , especially when the innermost thoughts of characters are offered. matters of life and death are pondered. self reflection is a way of life in herberts world. the inner life of his characters makes quite an impression upon first, and subsequent readings. keep this important idea in mind when reading: herberts great strength is in the two person scene. all his concerns and themes come through strongly in the two person dialogue, that clash of minds that drives his plots. the characters navigate a realm where human conciousness is the measuring stick: you must be able to speak your mind and defend your ideas (remember changes to human conciousness under duress). to close, i urge all new herbert to seek out the dune world sequels; the style and ideas get better. my opinion is the final 2 novels (heretics of dune & chapterhouse dune) are far and above the best. also, if you have never read any herbert, consider reading whipping star or the dosadi experiment first. these novels of the 'jorj x. mckie' universe are lighter reading, relatively, and fast moving, especially whipping star, in which i detect a humorous tone. frank herberts universes stand alone in scifi for the reach of ideas adressed, though i understand some may find them 'ponderous', perhaps. remember that frank herbert is often speaking to you, the reader, directly, through the thoughts and concerns of his characters."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Wow, coming off Dune and you make this? I researched a lot after reading dune (b/c I hate to read sequals, especially of extremely amazing books). But, everyone's review said this was an amazing book. GIVE ME A BREAK. This book is nothing like the original. It's dissapointing b/c I think the author didn't have all these sequals in mind when he wrote dune. He came up with an amazing world, and a great story. Then, after he made a lot of money, decided to come up with some other books trying to get that magic the first book held. Well, it doesn't have that magic, and really I don't think I will ever read a sequal to a book ever again. I can't even imagine what crap will come out of his son who now is trying to write other dune books (make some money with your own idea)."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The events that led me to read 'Dune' are long and boring, suffice it to say that I only ended up reading the novel after first seeing the HORRIBLE HORRIBLE movie they TRIED to make... Normally such an embarassment would keep me from wanting to read it, but I had heard SO MANY incredible things about 'Dune' that I just KNEW that they had ruined it when they attempted to turn something SO complex into a 2-hour movie (which is just BEYOND impossible if you ask me). I finally tackled the book and after I stopped reading it a couple times, on my 3rd try (don't they say the 3rd time is the charm??) I finally succeeded in getting past the first 50 pages. I'll admit, this is FAR from the easiest book to get into...however when you finally DO, you are in for a ride you will NEVER forget.I have NO idea where to begin. The characterization is fully realized. Even the minor one's seem real. The detail is superb. To think that Frank Herbert was rejected by over a dozen publishers before finding one who gave him a shot is incredible to me. They COULDN'T have read it in order to reject it. That would be like rejecting Oxygen as necessary to survival. From the economics of not just the planet, Dune, but a complete Galaxy of planets and those who fight for control of the most valuable source in the known Universe: the Spice Melange. And let's not forget the mighty Sandworms. Truly on a level far and above EVERYTHING else available in the realm of Science Fiction today (at least to MY knowledge). I had high hopes for many other authors, but NOBODY ever came close to 'Dune'--not even Herbert himself. I might ruffle a few feathers here, but I never found the subsequent sequels nearly as truly amazing as the original. Its as if Herbert's hand was directed by a higher power when he wrote 'Dune' and it never came back entirely in the following volumes...close but no cigar as they say--which ISN'T to say they aren't good, just not up to the bar set by the facinating &amp; amazing 'Dune'.On a small side note, in the field of fantasy I do believe we have a series of books that could possibly be considered the literary equivilant to 'Dune' and that is George R.R. Martin's fantastic 'A Song Of Ice And Fire' series. But in this series I believe Martin has been able to not just be able to write a good first book, but he has managed to IMPROVE upon the first book and even the 3rd book is better. It's a runaway snowballeffect, but as it gets bigger, it keeps going UPHILL instead of DOWN. High praise indeed comparing ANYTHING to 'Dune' but I think it'll stand the test of time.If you are a science fiction reader, you cannot in good conscience consider yourself well-read UNTIL you have finished 'Dune'. It is the bar by which ALL other Sci-Fi books are measured, and by which ALL other's fail. I've read some truly great sci-fi novels out there, but I'm tellin' you, NOBODY has been able to beat 'Dune', and I'll be surprised if they ever do-- although I'd be thrilled if it ever DID happen. Simply put THE BEST Science Fiction book not just in print today, but more than likely of ALL TIME, in short, a TRUE MASTERPIECE."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"are the publishers crazy? i was hoping to pick up the kindle editions of at least the first 3 in this series to reread on a long train trip later this year, but i am not understanding what makes this '40th anniversary edition' so special that it should cost 3x as much as any other book on my kindle. pass."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"At first I was really loving this book. The whole idea of this desert planet where water is gold and worms s*** money. But as time went on, I started to become really paranoid about water. I had to have a glass of water next to me every time I would sit down and read a chapter. It was bad. The book kept making me so thirsty. Eventually it became even worse when friends would come over to my house and ask for a drink. I couldn't bring myself to hand them a bottle of water. That's my water, all right? Back off; get your own. Dune's effects then started to show whenever I would be out in public. I found myself licking my arm for the few droplets of sweat that perspired there. Completely embarrassing, I know. Yet I'm not just going to let that water go to waste. Suffice it to say, I have gone crazy. I now have tens of buckets on my lawn in order to catch rain. At night, I sneak over to my neighbors' yards, and I turn on their hoses and fill more buckets with their water. Avoid this book if you can because it will ruin you."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is one of my favorite books, but $16.99 for an e-book is crazy. I own a paperback copy and would still by the e-book for my kindle, but not at that price. I will keep checking back for a lower price, but so far in the last year it has only gone up in price."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Fascinating ideas, cool characters, and a page-turner to boot. Re-reading it is almost as sweet as the first time because the main character's ability to see the future and his reactions to it are more poignant and delicious when you share his unique knowledge."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I am not a big fan of fiction books in general, but this series of books and Orson Scott Cards \\"Enders Game\\" series really are terrrific works that deserve to be read over and over again. as a person who is interested in the outdoors and tracking animals in particular, I can say that this book and the books that follow it embody much of the spirit of tracking that my friends and I follow. It is a captivating story of a royal family who moves to a new planet and it contains many insightful observations about humanity and life. It is definitely not a kind of Star Wars fantasia book, it talks about the human struggle for power and our mentalities dealing with control. It is intelligently written, as are the rest of the original books in the Dune series. I highly recommend this book, as well as Enders Game and the other books in that series. These books embody the greatness of science fiction for me, definitely. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I loved Dune but this book does make a good addition to the Dune books, it was a little slower in pace and to much politics but the scheming and lies were absolutly brilliant, if you've read Dune and liked it why not go ahead and read the entire series."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I believe Dune is a remarkable and well-done book, solid sci-fi that hasn't worn out over the years. Frank Herbert's writing creates the idea and understanding of an entire galaxy one planet at a time. The plot is most certainly unique; I have rarely seen a science fiction novel about oversized worms, especially when the book is serious about them.The first book, of course, is best accompanied by the others. In Frank Herbert's writing style, he gives readers of the books knowledge only right when it makes a difference, which leaves many things less than full explained after this book. Even after reading Chapterhouse: Dune, there is still much more to know.Back to the book at hand. The novel is about one, small, almost uninhabitable planet. The irony is that this one planet is the place where a drug that the whole Universe needs is. The majority of the series is about how strange things and power struggles can be made around one small planet, and how the entire population of the Known Universe responds when it is...Ooh, but I'm giving it away. Read the book, it's the best science-fiction there is."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune may well be the finest piece of science fiction ever written. I read it over twenty-five years ago and it still sticks in my mind as a great and memorable book, one with a language and a world of its own. It is an awesome piece of imagination. I had my wife (never a science fiction fan by any means) read it and she too was amazed by how intense a read it is. You don't need to read the entire set, though. The first book stands on its own as a complete and satisfying story."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is without a doubt one of the best novels ever to be written. It takes the reader far off into the future where space travel is made possible by a substance called the spice melange, only available from a single planet in the known universe, planet Arrakis, also known as Dune.Long before Dune there was a Butlerian Jihad when artifficial intelligence threatened to end human life. Ever since, computers have been banned, high technology being replaced by other means, specially trained humans acting as computational minds.Intriguing and original concepts. Frank Herbert writes about many different aspects thus painting a comprehensive and complete picture of his vision.A must read not only for the sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Herbert's Dune is a brilliant masterpiece of science fiction writing that combines the realities of our world and places them in a universe far in the future.Herbert delivers on a broad range of inteconnected topics including ecology, environmental policy, religious belief and fanaticism, the power of the mind, and real politics.Herbert's Dune, the planet Arrakis, mirrors the reality of the modern Middle East. Dune is the only place in the universe that produces the spice melange (oil?) and that spice is intertwined with a group of dessert dwelling \\"jihad\\" yelling religious fanatics who believe all non-believers must be killed. Sound familiar?What makes Herbert's Dune especially orignial is the fact that in the Dune universe, computers have been outlawed, by a jihad no less, and all complicated computations are tackled by super-trained human minds.Dune is one of the most interesting and entertaining reads."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I read DUNE a few years ago and I really enjoyed it. It was written in a style hadn't read before and it was the first Sci-Fi/Fantasy book I had read that really engaged me in any way. After I had finished reading it I moved on to a different book and discovered that DUNE had spoiled me. It spoiled me in that it became my benchmark that I've been comparing all other stories to since then and, while I might not be the most completely well-read person in the world, I can honestly say I haven't come across another story (book, movie, or otherwise) that has equalled DUNE.

Frank Herbert is an absolute artist, and he crafted the book incredibly exquisitely. The story is gripping, the plot intense, and the character absolutely pulsing with life. Herbert created an entire universe with Dune, full of incredible devices and amazing people.

They just seem to be missing something. I rate Dune 5 stars and the other five books make four to four &amp;1/2 stars on my scale hands down.

Again and again I turn to this subject for hours of delighting discussions with the -alas!- much too hard-to-find 'Dune-literates' :))"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune by Frank Herbert is an excellent science fiction novel. Set in the future and involving four planets, the novel has a different spin from typical sci-fi books. The novel includes several appendices, a glossary of unfamiliar terms in the novel, and even a map of Arrakis.Dune is a complex and intriguing novel that can be difficult to understand. With a unique language of its own the novel takes on form and character. Arrakis, also known as Dune, a desert planet is the setting for the majority of the novel. On Arrakis an addictive spice is mined and whoever controls Arrakis controls the spice and whoever controls the spice controls the universe. The novel is about the struggle for control of Arrakis.The novel can be a difficult read because of its unique language and verbose dialogue. If you are looking for a good science fiction novel that isn't to sci-fi, this is and excellent novel to read. It has some to do with space travel but it takes on more of a Jurassic Park genre than a Star Wars one. Overall it was an excellent novel and a great read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune by Frank Herbert is an exxellent science fiction novel. Set in the future and involving four planets, the book has a different spin from typical sci-fi books. The novel includes several appendices, a glossary of unfamilial termsin the novel, and even a map of Arrakis.Dune is a complex and intriguing novel that can be difficult to understand. With a unique language of its own the novel takes on form and character. Arrakis, also known as Dune, a desert planet is the setting for the majority of the novel. On Arrakis an addictive spice is mined and whoever controls Arrakis controls the spice and whoever controls the spice controls the universe. The novel is about the struggle for control of Arrakis.The novel can be a difficult read because of its unique language and its verbose dialogue. If you are looking for a good science fiction novel that isn't to sci-fi Dune is a great read. The science fiction part is more of a Jurassic Park genre than a Star Wars one. Overall it was a great read and an interesting twist to science fiction."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is simply amazing. The storyline itself is interesting and somewhat easy to follow, but beneath it all, is the deep politics of Dune that function on so many levels. Impossible to grasp it all on your first read, but so beautifally written, I couldn't put it down. It has wonderful ideas within it, my favorite of which I still recite to this day when I am afraid. \\"I must not fear, fear is the mindkiller...\\" For any reader, particularly sci-fi lovers, but as I see it, it appeals to all. Not an easy read, but very rewarding in all aspects. A must!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"are you a disgrace to bookahloics? if you haven't read Dune then you are. frank herbert skillfully weaves politics, religion, and for lack of a better word, magic into a suspenseful page turner that will keep you wondering for days. but beware, if you are an impatient reader you may not like the beginning and be tempted to move on to a more face paced sci-fi novel but trust me, if you stick with Dune you receive a large reward."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Few books can compare to The Lord of the Rings, but I believe Frank Herbert has produced one such story. Set on the desert planet of Arrakis, or Dune, the book follows a man destined to become the savior of Dune's desert dwelling Fremen. Herbert brings this tale to life with memorable characters, brilliant detail and an intruiging plot that will keep the reader interested from cover to cover. A book no science fiction library should be without."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The whole setting of the book is a vessel in which to allow many concepts to be raised, but it surpasses this meagre limitation into much more. I have read the series of 6 three times over, now either I am very sad man, or this is a bit of a good book. The first book is almost undoubtably the best in the series, however once you get past children of Dune (the beginning is a little long) and into the realms of the Bene Gesserit in the last two the completion of the many aspects is obtained. Beware however, intensive reading of this can be detremental to your outlook on life, the whole series takes a perspective set apart from the selfish personal view and instead highlights global thinking, thoughts for the good of humanity with little significance placed on the value of the individual in comparison."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"During this previous summer, I was visiting a friend who was realy into books. I didn't read much at the time, and we were talking about what gets us into a book. I said the book had to grab me from the begining, hold the excitement. He told me that he had just read the whole Dune series, and that I should at least read the first book. So I read it. To say the least, it held me to the last word. This book egnighted a spark in me to read, and to keep reading. I am curently reading book three in the series, and the whole series is wonderful. I've recruted several of my friends and even my father to read this terific book. This has to be one of the greatest science fiction books ever writen."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This masterpiece was written to stand the test of time. Herbert's avoidance of specific technology makes the story plausible even after 35 years.Aside from its enormously entertaining plot, the creative exploration of alternative cultures, religious fanaticism, war, and political intrigue will tweak you view of the world. In light of recent tragedies, this novel gives a fresh perspective into the mind of Jihad.Perhaps we are finally ready for our own version of the Orange Catholic Bible??? If you would like to contribute to such a project, contact me."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is one of the most popular science fiction novels, and with good reason. If nothing else, it's ambitious; a complex plot draws on elements from ancient and medieval history as well as Islamic culture, blending ecology, politics, messianic religion and mysticism to create a long, sometimes engrossing, sometimes baffling tale of a young superhero who revolutionizes galactic civilization.The novel has several flaws; much of the mysticism is not luminously clear, and much of the dialogue is stilted. Herbert's style is in the process of maturing here; it's a quirky and distinctive voice, and his writing is generally of high quality, but the pacing is uneven, and many readers will find the book difficult to get into. (I started it seven times over a period of several years before it finally caught on for me; and Herbert himself admitted the book was not an easy start.)With so many details involved in the story, it's not surprising that there are questions and plot holes. Some readers may find the characters two-dimensional, and Paul Atreides, the hero, remains remote. Still, Herbert deserves credit for tackling so many issues in the context of a science fiction adventure, and also for constructing what's basically a Van Vogt-style superman story whose central character is opaque, rather than the straight-up-and-down hero a more simplistic writer might have created.Many of Herbert's ideas don't fit comfortably into a single novel, even one of this length; I found that I came to enjoy both his writing style and his ideas as I read further books in the series.This is a worthwhile book that deserves all the attention it's garnered, but many readers should expect to be patient and to make a certain effort to get used to Herbert's approach to storytelling. The opening chapter is a stunner and immediately grabs your attention, but the book shifts gears after that and takes another fifty pages or so to pick up the pace. But stick with it --- it's fascinating and rewarding."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Well if not book definately series. This is an addictive series. a must for anyone who calls themselves a sci fi fan, and anyone who doesn't! This was very real and detailed. Frank Herbert really understands human nature. The only problem is that there are no sentient species. Odds are there would be at least one in the universe. Otherwise great book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Ok, so my first review was childish and inane, spare me the criticism . . . Take 2:Dune is by far one of the greatest works of modern Science Fiction, creating such a vibrant, invigorating, and awwe-inspiring picture, despite the the fact that it's most important planet, Arrakis, (Dune) is as wasted and barren as any imagineable. However, that one planet is the source of the spice, melange, which gives both life and knowledge; yet, at the same time, it enslaves it's user, and binds them to Dune forever.The main character is Paul Atredies, called Maud'Dib by the Fremen, the only people who live out in the desert of Arrakis. The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen conspires against him and his family and defeats them upon their arrival at Arrakis, killing Paul's father, Duke Leto Atredies, in the process. Paul and his mother, the Lady Jessica, escape to the Fremen and live among them. And they welcome him as one who may yet be the Lisan Al-Gaib, the Voice of the Other Void, who will lead them to freedom and make a paradise of Dune. Paul grows to become the greatest of them, their finest warrior, bravest raider, and most cunning tactician, and he plots his revenge against the Harkonnens, and against the Padishah Emperor himself.This book, to put it bluntly, owns. It is my second favorite work in Science Fiction,(the first being Dan Simmon's Hyperion) with a tremendous plot filled with enough twists and turns to keep any sane person happy. The characters are dynamic and believable, except for Paul, he sacrifices some believability because of the sheer power of his persona, his prescience, and his deadliness as a fighter. But he is more than human, and maybe shows a promise of what humanity can be. Who knows? In closing, this vision into the future is one that I am glad Frank Herbert shared, and should be read by as many as possible.If you want to find other great books by him, read The Jesus Incident, or The Dosadi Experiment. But you will probably have a hard time finding them, I did."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This was truly a classic Sci-fi book. Frank Herbert has created a whole new world to get lost in, and boy is it interesting. Imaginative ideas abound throughout and the plot is very tightly woven. A whole galaxy is out there involved in the conflicts the book presents and the different houses are well-portrayed.My only wish is that we had more Frank herbert books in this series and less books by his son and a hack Star Wars writer."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert's Dune Chronicles are a must-have 6 editions for any science fiction/fantasy fan. I just re-read Dune for about the 4th time, and plan on going through each of the following editions again. I'm a fan of sci-fi works that are very rich in plot, character population and total immersion into alternate worlds. Dune does it for me in so many ways. But very basically it puts me into the universe of Dune so deeply that I can see it in my mind, I can live it. It is visceral in nature. Not many books, sci-fi or otherwise, can do that to me. I think that Herbert's mastery in creating this alternate place so imaginatively, with so many layers and history and visualization and mythology and religion and philosophy and psychology, so convincingly is key to the popularity of Dune. And come on, who can resist the desert dwellers riding the wild worms? Like, totally rad! I also discovered just yesterday that there will be a Dune miniseries on the Sci-fi Channel in December. Can't wait!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"...and beat them up. You just won't be able to look at them the same way any more. Dune is just that kind of novel.As you may already know, Dune is the story of Paul Atreides, the young son of a Duke in the far future. The world that Frank Herbert creates is lush, imaginative, and oftentimes genuinely alien to ours. Though this book can be taken as a straight-out story of a young Messianic figure who wins over a corrupt Emperor and a vile Baron, that would be silly. Paul is a very human character, as are most of the others you get to meet in Dune. This is where the book really shines, and where David Lynch's movie really failed. The lovingly detailed political factions and ways represented within Dune are fascinating to read about, and you'll come away wanting more.Of course, this is provided in ample measure, and any reading of Dune should be followed with a reading of Dune Messiah, which is less of a sequel and more of a continuation necessary to understand the character of Paul.Dune is a book about ideas--including the morality and politics of a messiah figure. It's not a book you should go into looking for another adventure story, and not one you should come out of without at least having a different perspective to look on philosophical and sociological issues from. It's not a marvel of storytelling (not that it's bad), but it does just make you wonder.Pick up Dune. If you like it, you have plenty to follow it up with. If you don't, it's only a few bucks out the window."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is incredibly well written in that you always know only as much as the author wants you to know. Set in this confusing future, the author runs a twisting course through the life of Paul Atreides, allowing the reader to discover the universe as they read. It's an exciting reading experience that I'd reccommend to any diehard sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Complex, political story with an environmental theme...just enough action and heroics to make you want to wade through the in-fighting and vague mystical references. The first, and by far, best of the Dune series."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If I had read this two or three years ago when I had not been exposed to as many writers that I am now, this would probably be my favorite book. But being exposed to a variety of authors it does not seem spectacular. Still it is an enjoyable and intelligent adventure, set on an interesting world with interesting characters. It is also a very well-written (prose-wise) book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If you read Dune, then do yourself a favor and read Dune Messiah. It is a much easier read, with a great conspiracy and plot. Much less cumbersome than Dune. The story stays with its main focus and doesn't go in different directions each chapter. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is astounding. I read it at age 15 from cover to cover. I'm now 21, and have just begun reading it for a second time. Set in science fiction--but with enough H20 molecule-sized, real-life metaphors to fill an empty glass--Dune is an almost unbelievable marvel in literature. The manifold italicized character thought-processes nestled within allowed me to truly feel as one with the characters, to actually understand them, and to almost feel as though it is the year 10,191. To say this novel has outstanding character development is like saying the human body has only 1/3 water. I look forward to re-reading this novel and may post more reviews in the future."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is continually listed as a scifi classic. After reading it for the 2nd time I wholeheartedly agree. I read this for the 1st time about 10 years ago but I enjoyed the book much more now. This book is very original. It covers the story of a planet being exploited for the Melange spice, a slightly narcotic substance that is highly coveted across the universe. Various families are fighting for control of the planet, which happens to be a complete desert that it is very difficult to survive on. The native people work for whichever family controls the planet and are not treated too well. This of course is a theme taken from the present-day world. I saw a lot of similarities between Arrakis (the planet) and various 3rd world countries and between the Fremen (the native people) and various 3rd world populations that are exploited for their countries' natural resources. The way they deal with this struggle is what makes the story interesting. The science aspect of the story was well thought out also. I particularly found the ways that the Fremen controlled their water usage interesting. The plot moves along well with an exciting conclusion."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I loved this book. I liked how Mr. Herbert described various objects and habitats. The characterization is phenominal. This IS one of the best books ever.What happens in the beginning of the book is a whole story of it's own so I won't reveal too much for those who haven't read the book.The main character is a fifteen year old boy named Paul Atreides. His father, the Duke Leto Atreidies is forced to move from the planet Caladan (A planet that is rich with water and forests.) to Arrakis AKA Dune. Dune is a harsh desert world were water is scarce and food is even scarcer. The thing that the planet is best known for is the spice Melange. Melange is used for food, drugs, and many other things. Melange helps people see into the future, Starship pilots use it to pilot better. There are a few people who can have special powers by using it. Paul is one those, he is also the only male. The natives also beleive that he is their Messiah and that he will lead them to freedom.Dune intertwines politics, religion, ecology, action, and adventure all into one story. I love this book and I give it a *marks a five into Paul-Muad'Dib's stillsuit\\" FIVE!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I thought that the book was ok. I like sci fi books but this got to deep and intense. I enjoyed the book at some points. Like when Jessica became the revrend mother and she was pregnent and her daughter got all the memorys too.

I can't say it is the best in the series though because I have not read them all. The plot has so many twists that is sometimes hard to follow, but it has an interesting course. They followed no basic formula in this book. It is one of a kind. There is very little missing in this book. It has deceit, magic, prophecy. romance, and adventure. what else could you want. It is a book for everyone. The difforence in the charecters in this book is amaising. You have everyone from witchs to warriors. The auther also carries the points of veiw of all the charecters. That is a great strength. The only thing I did not like in this book, was the ending. It seemed unfinished to me. But that left room for the sequels."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The economic/political/religious/science-fiction is amazing. I read it and it is electrifying. the rest of the series is a little worse, but is still great. This book makes a lasting impact and requires to be reread at least twice.

Frank Herbert's masterpiece is, and allways will be, the greatest example of science fiction available. Herbert wieves an intricate universe, one that he describes down to the tiniest particle of sand. I find it hard to believe that anyone that has READ the book could not like it. I read the book for the first time when I was in sixth grade, and I have gone on to reread it, and the rest of the series, 5 times. I would recommend this book to anyone, whether they are interested in science fiction or not. No book enthusiast should go with out reading what many consider to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, science fiction novel of all time."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Herbert is like a prophet, he seems to have the same vision of the future that I do, the battles will keep you reading hours into the night, and the storyline seems to keep on rolling, and rolling, and rolling, never a stop in the excitement.

I have always been a slow reader, so trying to get through a book the size of Dune is really quite an acomplishment for me. At first when I began to read this it startled me because it started off with a fast paced adventure which many long sci-fi novels lack. As I kept getting further into the plot I just got more inthusiastic. By the time it ended I was totally posesed by Herbert's writing. Today, even after a few years to forget the plot and stop reading more about Dune and the Fremen, I was stilled involved as I was before.When I was finished reading it I was so into the plot that I got the encyclopedia and looked on the net for more info.If you are interested in any good science fiction, this is the story to read.

The thing here, though, Frank Herbert may have done just that, imagined it.I read this book about 15 years ago, and though I haven't read it again since then, I can still remember some of the most minute details. In this day of turn-stile novels, pumped out as fast as an author can make up a new title, that truly says a lot.I read a few reviews back, that the said critic knew what was going to happen after he read 10 pages... Well, all I have to say is that he must have been consuming some Spice!

Bravo! It doesn't get much better than this folks. Even the most staunch hater of the sci fi genre would enjoy it. The only way the characters might not be totally realistic is that they are all highly intelligent (and that's not a complaint!) They are unique and intreguing, and the ending to this and the others in the series are far from predictable. I've never completed a series of books (six in all) so quickly. And at the end you'd just kill to be able to become a Bene Gesserit! Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Absolutely the best fiction book I have read, Dune is an increadably thoughtful insight into the workings of human thought and ecology. Beyond the brilliant concepts Herbert not only creates an amazing cast of fully developed characters but a novel and exciting Universe.

If you havent read it yet your missing out, and if you've already read it read it again."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Power! imagination! drama! a masterpiece!Those are but a few of the superlatives that describe this book. Saying the least, Dune is the best si-fi book of all times. An unparalleled saga painted on the vast canvas of Herbert's imagination in vivid colors, but that metaphor is only a two-dimensional view of a manifold work. It's a complete Herbertian Universe with all the detail and intricacy of reality. No si-fi author gets close to the perfection he achieved here. The plot, or should I say plots, twist and turn in completely unpredictable ways, like the non-rhythmic dance of the Fremen. I am yet to see another author that eludes anticipation like Herbert.The intrigue! The sophistication! So exquisite! The cast of larger-then-life figures in classical rolls, the Hero and the Villain, the Tragic and the Noble, Arch-typical yet not stereotypical. A unique writing style combining the broad objective view point of third person account, with the subjective &quot;thoughts&quot; of first person.Not to mention the scope and the breath, Herbert plays out philosophical and political, environmental and religious themes with unmatched canny. He was a thinker way ahead of his time, way ahead of OUR time! Maybe future generations will appreciate his full genius. I can not think of any other book that surpasses Dune, with the possible exception of &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; on greater philosophical and political depth.No si-fi fan that respects himself could miss reading this book, but it really is a classic you all should read.&quot;The truth carries the ambiguity of the word used to express it&quot; (Frank Herbert -- \`God Emperor of Dune')"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I give this book a 10 because it deserves it"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"After Dune, Dune Messiah is my favourite.This book shows you a different part of Paul Atreides' personality and tells u more about his life as an emperror.Also it deals with her sister,Alia, destiny(a tragic one unfortunately).The end is special,something u won't imagine at all while reading the book.Read it,cause it's astonishing!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"There is not much left to say about this book that has not already been said by the other 500 reviewers. Let me just utter &quot;ditto&quot; to everything Lowkell said in his excellent review.Here are the main points you need to know before reading this novel:1. If you are a fan of science fiction, you will be blown away by the detail and complexity of Frank Herbert's imagined universe. I've never read anything quite like it. It truly has a &quot;cast of thousands&quot; and weaves together over twenty subplots.2. If you are a fan of simple, direct writing, skip this book. Read DUNE only if you enjoy complicated, interwoven plots full of ambiguities and mysteries that the reader must &quot;unravel&quot; for himself.3. Underneath the details, mysteries, intrigues, and &quot;feints within feints,&quot; the story boils down to a boy with special powers who saves an entire race of humans from extinction. Personally, I don't much care for superheroes and think the story would have been better if Paul Atreides had been an ordinary man who accomplished these amazing feats."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have nothing new to say. My review is just my way of paying respect to one of the finest Sci-Fi novels written."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"As I read through most of these reviews, I see many people complaining of how this book is more literature than Sci-fi. In fact, I agree. I actually believe that Dune is very anti-technology and science, and instead, focuses more on the spiritual side of humanity and the iniate abilities we have as a species. There is very little dealing with technology and science in these book, but rather a strong emphasis on politics and religion, and the effect they have on each other. To call this book a Sci-fi book in many ways seem offensive to me when you see what most people percieve Science Fiction to be. Every book in this series blows all other Sci-fi books away, the polical intrigue, the depth of the characters, the symbolism, no science fiction writer can compare with this, George Lucus be damn. If all of you people writing these reviews have a problem with this novel, then go back to your Star Wars and D&amp;D books. The book was absolutely amazing, the decontructing of a messiah, the jealousy that even his own people showed toward him, the angry and bitter former rulers that conspire for revenge. What did most of you people think would happen after what occurred at the end of Dune, all the defeated former rulers would just go away and sulk, be serious. This book shows the true extent of Frank's genious and it too bad most of you are too dimwitted to realize it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Exellent product!

Here in my country I can't find it.."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"First off, Herbert has done an incredible job building and detailing his world of Arrakis. There is a clearly defined mythology, religion, political system, philosophy and ecology in this world. Despite all the introduced terminology in the book, I feel it is easy enough for the reader to pick up and understand these new terms.Having said that, I did not find the main characters, or many of the other characters, interesting. Paul and Jessica are unappealing characters because of their seeming penchant for all of their actions to be based on political reasons. While there is a need for it at times, it seems like all of their actions are made for manuvering their survival on Arrakis. I feel that the better characters are Gurney Halleck and Dr. Yueh. Both men have detailed backstories that fully explain their motivations in the actions they take, which are made for a myriad of reasons, not just political.I felt that the book would have benefitted from more of a balance between action and political intrigue. The action sequences that did take place were ok, and would have kept my interest more.I realize that I am in the minority with my opinion of Dune. I give Herbert a lot of credit for creating a fully imagined and detailed world, and this novel was no doubt groundbreaking at the time of publication. For me, the book would have benefitted more if the same detail had been paid to his characterizations."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is an impressive novel, though not quite the Great American Sci-Fi Novel. What makes it impressive is that in an era of technology-obsessed sci-fi, Herbert succeeds in fleshing out the characters of Paul, Jessica, and a few others; Dune was the best-described planet in science fiction until Robinson's Mars came along three decades later.The problems? It's rather difficult to get American readers to care about a feud between two aristocratic families in a future Empire, culminating with the hero making himself king, so Herbert has to turn Harkonnen into the ultimate heavy (including making him homosexual, which dates the story) while making Leto and Duncan into cardboard heroes. And sometimes the mumbo-jumbo gets ridiculous: in the first chapter Herbert says \\"The statement violated what his mother called his INSTINCT FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS\\", as if there was something exotic about having moral standards; why not just say Paul disagreed? And, unfortunately, the mumbo-jumbo dominates most of the sequels, as reflected in titles like \\"The God-Emperor of Dune\\"."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"THIS FIRST BOOK OF THE DUNE CHRONICLES HAS ENTERTAINED ME MORE THAN ANY OTHER BOOK I REMEMBER,(INCLUDING THE FOUNDATION SERIES).

It was around 1987, I was spending the weekend with a distant cousin. She asked if I wanted to watch a movie-she mentioned a few titles including &quot;Dune&quot;. The title caught my ears. I watched and was totally enraptured. When I turned 19, I had a job, and I sought out to buy the book. &quot;Dune&quot; is one of those novels that engrosses your entire senses. You can feel and walk through this world with infinite measure. The intrigue and the open tragedy of each characters affairs unravels seamlessly.As each character spoke and acted, I walked with them. Each presented a delicate thought for my appetite. Herbert, not to mention other writers like Anne Rice, capture you in a world of their own making without encroaching on your own imagination.Herbert reflects on the idealistic and strategic yet emotive wanderings of humans and aliens alike. Rice reveals a world of undone promises, wishes, sensual arrays, plots, schemes, and mental jewelry. I love soaking it up.I have yet to read the new saga presented by Brian Herbert, but I am eager. I have had so many books to read. I have had to put a hold on reading the last books in the series.

A book that is excellent the first time you read it, and only gets better every time after. Don't worry if certain terms or descriptions seem wordy the first time, these are the &quot;easter eggs&quot; for those who enjoyed the story the first time and are hungry for more. I swear, every time I start this book, is seems like somebody snuck in about 20 new pages that I missed the first time. I love the way that Herbert writes tragedy instead of revelation. For example, the traiter's identity is revealed very early in the book, rather than at the act of trechary. This makes all the action up to that point seem tragic in ways that are rarely seen today. Sorry Darth Sidious, The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen has you beat for villany on all counts."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"As a child I remember my father reading the Dune novels and I always wanted to read them myself.

I read it every spare moment I had and always hated to put it down. I had seen the movie as a pre-teen and I have to say the book makes the movie look like a Saturday morning cartoon.

The book's setting is dense, confusing, intriguing, and belies a strange understanding of the human conciousness. The problem is, Herbert rushes over his descriptions of setting to put us in some boring desert. I always end up wondering about Caladan and Ix and the Bene Gesseret the Imperium and all those other details. Not surprisingly, my favorite parts of the book were the glossary and essay on religion.For most of the book I never really liked Paul or Jessica or the Fremen or any other character. I was interested in Paul's metamorphosis into a super-being, but I think that Herbert understandably has trouble explaining the shift into hyper-conciousness. And the way Herbert writes in general seems a bit undisciplined, a lack of polish and refinement if you will.The 'Dune' universe is brilliant, but it probably made a hell of lot more sense inside Herbert's head.Despite all my complaints, it's probably my favorite sci-fi book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I finished dune a week ago after less than a month of fabulous reading. i asked my dad if it was a good book, and he interested me with the sandworms, and other things. the characters were wonderfully detailed, and the world was filled with colorful descriptions. such a great book. i know only one other kid my age who is reading dune, but i don't expect many others. what with the educational system, and the reading ability of kids in the USA, it's makes me sad that more kids probably will not read this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is supposed to be the most sold science fiction novel in the world.

Now im in my twenties, ive read quite a few of the older hugo award winners this was one that I had neglected to read from the list so i thought id give it another shot. My problem with the book is that it is just too incredibly tedious, my kindle tells me that I completed 57% of it and that was about as far as i was willing to go. When you read a book and the thought of whether or not to just stop where you are or keep going in the off chance that something good will come of it, enters your mind, then just stop reading. A good book will never let that thought enter your brain. The main characters were incredibly flat and static, and too be honest it got to the point where it was going nowhere and it was heading there fast. as other readers and reviewers have noted there is a slogan in the writing business, show dont tell, well mr.herbert must have never heard that saying. Most of the book, up until i stopped reading, were just thoughts of the main characters, jessica and paul. Paul being the protagonist of the novel should be an incredibly dynamic and round character but he is in fact not. After his \\"awakening\\" ,i guess that's the only word for it, he really got obnoxious and had this whole teen-angst feel to his attitude I guess.I consider myself a smart guy, I'm an engineering student and ive pretty much read science fiction my entire life, so this is no fault of my own. I really don't understand why this book has so much fan-fare surrounding it, or why it won a hugo award. if your looking for good science fiction, i'd recommend \\"Way Station\\" by clifford simack, or \\"A canticle for leibowitz\\" i forget the author, also \\"The Man In The High Castle\\" by philip k. dick. much better than this over rated \\"novel\\"."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The foundation of the story is a galactic empire whose inter-stellar navigation requires M&eacute;lange Enhanced navigation.

To control the spice, control Arrakis.Any rational emperor entertaining hopes to rule for more than 2 days would park his capital on Arrakis and guard the access and distribution of spice very, very tightly.Yet Frank Herbert tries to makes us believe that here is an empire who for generations has left the control of Arrakis and Spice to various Feudal Lords who have acquired and lost the control of Arrakis at the whim of the distant emperor and everything has been fine.Until the Harkonnen's finally figured it out and passed Empire Politics 101. And after taking a beating and some hard lessons in the desert, Paul Atreides finally figures it out also.

It is a set of selected readings: it only contains four random selections for a total of 3.5 hours, drawn from across the entire original trilogy.

You experience learning about this world as the characters do or in like fashion.I saw the movie of this book shortly after finishing the book and I was very disappointed at the film. I'm hoping for an update of the original movie."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Finished my reread of Dune by Frank Herbert. It still holds up extrememly well--I believe it's The Lord of the Rings for science fiction.I won't recount the plot here, since there are probably a million reviews of the book and the series, and lots of folks have seen the regrettable David Lynch movie (fortunately for millions of Star Wars fans, Lynch turned down Jedi to direct Dune). The movie was like looking at something through pavement heat--you can tell what it is that you're supposed to be seeing if you can account for the distortion. But, I'm biased; I don't understand how Lynch continues to get work.But I digress. There are at least two things about Dune that really make the novel stand out against the background of other science fiction novels:First, the absence of technology. As part of the backstory of Dune, there was a revolt against computers in humanity's past (our future), and they are banned from society. This plot convention steers Dune away from where many science fiction works crash and burn--an obsession with technology and \\"technobabble.\\" Some sci-fi is so tech-heavy that the stories read like stereo instructions. Sadly, this is a trend which has only gotten worse after the advent of cyberpunk. Rejecting technology as a crutch allowed Herbert to focus on the humanity of his characters.Second, the story is character-intensive. The characters a very well developed, and Herbert develops them with an economy that should make other writers envious. The exposition in Dune is kept to a minimum, which is remarkable considering the tone that Dune possesses. Almost alone in the genre, Dune has a voice that's more akin to Homer, Tolkein, or Arthurian legend. The story is an epic on a grand scale, with nuanced heroes and villains that lack Homer's length (and beauty) or Tolkein's ponderous prose. The way the characters interact with situations, each other, and even within themselves shows Herbert's skill as a writer.One helpful note to Dune: if you've seen the movie, then you know the general idea of the plot. Go ahead and read the appendices at the back of the book first. It's not great reading, but it will give a little more backstory that'll make the book easier to understand.If you haven't seen the movie version of Dune, just start the book from the beginning. The appendices have a few spoilers in them if you're new to the story.Dune explores a number of important topics with depth that's rarely acheived in science ficiton: religion, climate change, human nature, life, death, ecology, among many others. It's an outstanding read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I should be ashamed with myself that I have not written a review on this wonderful book until today. Anyone with an interest in politics or economics will love this book. Likewise, a reader who enjoys science fiction novels will enjoy this book and the the books following in the series.\\"Dune's\\" ability to pull the reader quickly into a tumultuous time in the novel's universe is uncanny. Picking this book up, even on the first page you'll be immersed in the Dune world. The interjections of quotes from the Princess is a theme Herbert keeps throughout the series, and they offer unique insights into the story to come, the story thus far, or anecdotes that might shed interesting colors on the uniqueness of the characters.Younger readers may find this book to be a tough read, and may miss the more subtle points of the novels interwoven political and economical undertones and the bearings they can have on our world today in our current political climate. But nonetheless, even younger readers that have an open imagination can easily enjoy the vast sand dunes of Arrakis and all their mysteries."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I've been a fan of Dune for as long as I can remember. It was a book series I avidly enjoyed while growing up, and its thoughts on enviromentalism and how long, small changes can make a big difference have always stuck with me.This is definitely a book that gets better and better each time you read it. You can read it at age 12 and think it's a great story of a young boy growing up, how he grows and changes and matures as a result of all of the things he goes through. You can read it at 20 and think it's a great book about environmentalism - how changes to a planet and its ecosystem have wide-ranging effects that can be disastrous. And as you continue to read it, you catch all of the subtle nuances - the way people treat each other, how communication and trust can make and destroy lives, how desire for love, desire for power, desire for wealth, desire for knowledge, all shape humans.Some people label this book as 'science fiction' - and it is in the sense that it occurs in a galaxy that has space travel, where technologies unknown to us are in use. But in a grander sense it is about human drama - how humans react to the situations they're in, how their passions drive them, how they think and feel and relate to each other.Yes, there are terms to learn and ideas to understand. This is true whether you're reading a book about the aborigines of Australia or mountain climbing in the Himalayas. It's not something you need to obsess over, constantly checking glossaries. Like in any book, simply read the book from start to end and get absorbed into the culture. The terms will make sense, the personalities will reveal themselves.Some have said the book has characters that are good or evil. I actually find that the MOVIES did this, but the books are extremely good at layering the many shades of grey. People always have motives for what they do and feel that their motives are perfectly justified. Some motives are compassionate, some motives are self serving. Very much like real life."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"What a disappointment as a continuance of Dune, which was a truly great story and epic. My dislike of this book is not due to the fact that it is different in structure to the original. I enjoyed the change of pace and setting, as this book is dialogue oriented and takes MANY unexpected turns. While reading it, I couldn't put the book down.My dislike comes after having finished it - and of wondering what the point of this novel was in the first place. The ultimate flaw in this story is the total change in Paul, making the first novel irrelevant. Everything stems from this crucial fact. I'm not even going to bother with the other characters, who would have had to behave differently had Paul remained a strong character fighting the direction fate wants to pull him.The galaxy is not a better place after having suffered the terrible consequences of Paul's life. He admits to a \\"conservative estimate\\" of having killed 61 billion, sterilizing 90 planets, demoralizing hundreds of others, and wiping out 40 religions. While noble and admirable at the end of Dune, an atmosphere of degeneration, court rivalries, and intrigue is readily apparent in the beginning of Dune Messiah, which takes place about twelve years into Paul's reign.Paul has been helpless against fate and spends too much time feeling sorry for himself. In Dune he is determined to avoid the future Jihad, which takes place anyway. He is pathetic and useless in Dune Messiah. He suffers mood swings and is more interested in feeling the collective sociological movements of humanity in a melange-induced stupor than in making decisions.I mean, what has he been doing these past twelve years to avoid the Jihad? There's plenty he could have done! Why doesn't he act like the Messiah he is supposed to be?! What a wasted opportunity! This Messiah failed to change the galaxy in any positive way. His failure makes one wish for the triumph of the defeated Vladimir Harkonnen, who, while corrupt and self-serving, had a taste for ruling and decision-making. The materialistic Harkonnens were too small minded to have devastated the galaxy as did Paul, who is an inverted version of Hamlet - unable or unwilling to act but suffering melancholy after the fact, thus becoming even more useless.Despite all the carnage Paul has wrought, the true problems of galactic society continue to exist at the book's end. Manipulative secret organizations like the Bene Gessereit, Bene Tleilaxu, and who knows what else is out there, continue to pursue their own bizarre objectives. The Spacers' Guild, with its dominance in stellar transport, continues to be powerful and oppressive.By playing his ultimate trump card, as he threatened at the end of Dune, destruction of the spice on Arrakis, Paul could have simultaneously broken the backs of his enemies and avoided the Jihad. Sure, he would have plunged the galaxy into a Dark Age with the absence of spice destroying intergalactic travel. But would this have been worse than the death and destruction that he brought about anyway? Somehow someone would have eventually figured a way to get around the problem of spiceless navigation.A Messiah is someone who is to be a savior or liberator. Paul didn't save or liberate anything. Herbert ruined something great."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have read very little sci-fi, but have been curious to explore the genre. My husband and brother-in-law, both sci-fi geeks, recommended DUNE as a must-read that has in many ways become the gold standard for science fiction. Although the hype may have created overly high expectations for me, I did get engrossed in this epic otherworldly adventure.On an unforgiving desert planet called Arrakis (aka Dune), the young Paul Atreides inherits both his betrayed father's planetary fiefdom and a bitter feud with the rival Harkonnen family. But there's another dimension to the story: Paul is rumored to be the Muad'Dib, the messiah figure Dune's inhabitants have been waiting for.What makes DUNE remarkable is Herbert's intricate creation of an alien world. The reader becomes immersed in the imaginative details of Dune's ecology, mysticism, politics, and culture. The planet itself is a hellish world nearly devoid of water and home to massive, fearsome sandworms. Yet it is also of great value for the interplanetary empire it belongs to, since it is the only source of \\"m&eacute;lange spice,\\" a mind-expanding and life-extending drug. Economically, the empire is dominated by the CHOAM corporation, which plays an important hand in the power struggles between noble houses.I truly enjoyed delving into this imaginary empire. Although set many thousands of years in the future, the civilization Herbert conjures is a surprisingly anachronistic one, resembling a medieval feudal society. Despite the importance of the female Bene Gesserit religious sect (often feared as witches), women play a subservient role to men. Even combat is a futuristic version of fencing. Dune's indigenous inhabitants--the Bedouin-like Fremen (Herbert mixes in a lot of Middle Eastern linguistic and cultural influences)--have a fascinating culture shaped by their arid environment. In this culture, water is so precious that moisture is harvested from the dead, and to shed a tear over someone is a profound honor. The Fremen treat their planet almost as a complex living organism and survive by living in harmony with it rather than trying to bend it to their will. Perhaps Herbert's representation of this intricate desert ecology contributed to the budding environmental awareness of the mid-60s.As immersive as DUNE is, the fiction I usually like best is character-based, and it was here that I found the novel lacking. There is some interesting character development in Paul, who matures and is affected by his status as the rumored Muad'Dib. But the reader never really gets in the characters' heads, and there is a dryness to Herbert's narration.After reading DUNE, I certainly plan to pick up some more sci-fi in the future."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have read and reread Dune many times, but listening to it is a whole new adventure, and this audio version is excellent.

Even the sci-fi aspects of the story are logically explained, so as to make it realistic had such a planet existed. One thing that makes the book very \\"at the edge of the seat\\" exciting is how Herbert lets the reader into the thoughts of each character.

However, if you are a science fiction fan, you will love this book. The story, characters, technology, and world are all wonderfully crafted. The writing style is wonderful as well. It does not explain everything for you, but it withholds just enough information to make you think. With a unique and wonderful storyline, and excellent writing style, you can not go wrong when you decide to read Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The level of detail in the universe created here by Herbert is astounding.Great story of politics, murder, mayhem and betrayal all set with an exotic backdrop. Try reading this and not thinking of how oil is used in our world.Futher chapters in the series have diminishing returns, but the first 3 books are worth reading.I have read the first book at least 4 times in my life and will probably do so again."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A great novel is one that you can read multiple times and get something new from each new reading. Dune certainly qualifies.This is, I think, my third reading since I first read 'Dune' as a freshman in college. My first reading had been a year before 9/11 and my second reading about a year after. In many ways, my second time through 'Dune' was like like reading an entirely different novel. My awe at the vastness of Herbert's vision gave way to Herbert's ruminations on the intersection of government, religion, and violence. The differences I found in my third reading were more subtle. I came out of this reading thinking about the power of both fear and promises of redemption.But subtle difference in my reaction aside, Dune is a novel I can return to again and again because Frank Herbert creates something close to the perfect science fiction novel. Herbert's universe is fantastic and intricately detailed. Societies, economies, and ecologies are all carefully crafted. Each one is entirely alien in some way but the way that Herbert's characters interact with these 'great forces' of civilization are instantly recognizable as human.Dune, despite its purposeful depictions of human society, sweeps the reader through a story rife with betrayal, political intrigue, violence, and human struggle. Unlike other pieces of science-heavy SciFi, Dune never bogs down.Herbert's masterpiece, almost half a century after its first publication, certainly still has something to show us about humanity, especially about the relationship between power and society and power and the individual. But there are bits of the novel that feel dated. While not as blatantly as other SciFi works at the time, Herbert's female characters lack some of the verve of the male characters.Don't let that dissuade you. Dune is a giant in the world of SciFi for good reason. It's well worth the time of any reader with even the smallest disposition towards Science Fiction.That said, Herbert, and later his son, followed Dune with a string of sequels. I read them all of the Frank Herbert sequels and one of Brian Herbert's after my first reading of Dune. They are all dreck. Don't even bother. But whatever you do, don't miss Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"\\"Dune\\", written by Frank HerbertThe Atreides family is scurrying about on their home world of Caladan in preparation for their journey. The Atreides have been awarded the fief of the desert planet Arrakis also known as Dune. The planet Dune is rich in a substance called spice which people all across the universe use for different purposes but the true power of the spice is known to only a few. What all know is that the controller of the Fief of Arrakis can make themselves rich and powerful. The former controllers of Dune, the Harkonnen's are plotting the death of Duke Letto Atreides for having been awarded the Fief and the death of his whole family. The Atreides are well aware of the peril they face, even young Paul Atreides the Duke's son. Paul has been prepared all of his life for the challenges he will face and his training along with the spice is bound to make him something more than human...I was somewhat skeptical going into Dune. The book is held in such high regard and books that have so much hype surrounding them rarely live up to it. The books opens up slow and wasn't quick to grab my full attention which had me thinking that once again the legend had exceeded the reality. But after a slow start the hooks finally set and I was eager to see where the story was going.The Good: As many have likely noted, Herbert has built a complex, and unique universe with great depth. The overall government is led by a tyrannical Emperor that also comprises royal families. The Guild who are the only ones capable of deep space travel and hence have a vast amount of say regarding war and the transport of troops etc. The natives of Dune who have their own culture and religion with such great emphasis placed on water. As I said, a vast reaching and complex universe.The character development and evolution were all well done and the way Herbert was able to tie his complex universe together regarding Dune at the climax was masterful.The Bad: The only bad was that it took a while for the story to get my full attention but once it did I was hooked for the duration.Overall: Did Dune live up to the hype? Can anything really live up to that much hype? Dune was masterfully done though and if you haven't read it pick it ASAP."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is undeniably the best SciFi book ever penned. I've read it numerous times and every time I learn something new. This book is meticulously planned so an entirely new world (worlds) is created. Down to peoples nationalities, religions and style of dress, everything is created new by this author. There is no lingering tant of earth or stupid weapons that are simply discribed as \\"Laser guns\\". For those of you who haven't read this book the best I can describe it is to picture the Star Wars series for the amount of backstory the author put into even minor charactors and worlds. If you haven't read this book, you are missing out on something truly great. Frank Herbert is the best that SciFi has to offer, and Dune is his masterpiece.

This book is okay, but certainly not &quot;the best&quot; as many claim. My suspicion is that people on this review site tend to be a small but determined bunch of supporters. The biggest flaw is that the book is boring. It truly is difficult to keep turning the page. After being 1/2-way through, I just had to toss the book out. If you scroll through the &quot;real&quot; reviews, you will find this is a common lament. Also, it doesn't have the same emotional life as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and does not draw one in.

However, I found it boring and disjointed. Some of the characters are interesting and the story has it's moments but it's not worth the time it takes to read it. The story spends too much time building up to events which are either unsatisfying or over the top. The main character was extremely shallow and what personality he did have was still obscure. I didn't care for him at all. He seemed to be as bored as I was with the things going on around him. The book had good concepts but they were never really put to good use. I really wanted this book to be good. I was on it's side to begin with, but now I can see why Herbert had such a hard time finding someone to publish it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Thank goodness it takes only eight thousand years for a little political instability to worm its way in. Dune is crap. It's a bunch of pseudo-science hoodoo. I tried reading this book as a child and I was enchanted for awhile, the idea is so lovely it practically throbs. But really, for some reason, I just couldn't finish it. Now as an adult I tried again to read it and it's just more than silly. I guess Proust is right, you can't go home again. Or whatever. Maybe there was a time to read it and it passed. Of course, the idea is nice. If there was a book on the idea of Dune I'd probably read it. Even the idea of Frank Herbert. Just a book about some cat with a big prophet beard and a penchant for writing crackpot books of science fiction/philosophy. That would be nice. That would compel. Even if he veered at times dangerously close to fascism, which he does, and so does that Nazi Heinlein. It would be hilariously funny to read about some chubby floodge who wrote silly books of facsistic science fiction but never had the heart to get them published (there's a spin on things), and whose rantings were restricted--safely--to the confines of his kitchen. Funny. Sabbath's Science Fictional Theater. Yeah. But Dune is, sadly, really sadly, poorly written and should have been better. Sorry."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Clearly, you have to be a fan of the robot genre to remotely even come close to liking this book. The first chapter gets off to a very slow start, the storyline becomes boring rapidly, and after a while, the book is unreadable. I would imagine that those disappointed with this highly overrated book would turn to other science fiction. Lord of the Rings puts this book to shame. J.R.R.

When I start bringing girls back to my apartment again, do I really want them to see this.

When Pual's sister struggles against her possession to throw herself out the window, when Leto II merges with sand trout, when the Fish Dancers dance while packed into the meeting room, Teg running up to guards in a blue blur, the no globe making a depression in the ground where it sits for a long time. Interesting images but later in life I realized the ideas behind all of this (totalitarian religion and cultism, better living through chemistry, eugenics, fear of technological progress all sitting on a foundation of materialism) are the worst ideas of the last 200 years. The empty, awful, evil ideology behind this book accounts for untold numbers of innocent lives in the last 100 years. Herbert crafted this series for young impressionable kids so that they could learn to be monsters. He was a vile man.And more than that! The books were completely humorless. The real world is a funny weird place and full of hypocrisy and silly actions. Herbert took himself too seriously throughout the whole series. Just another underlining reason why my opinion of this story went down the toilet."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Comparing this 500 page sleeping pill to Lord of the Rings is like comparing a Rolls Royce Phantom II to a 1975 Pinto.

Jessica reminds me of Jan Brady or a 1970s coffee commercial where the character is always talking to themselves about the things around them.

The reader will find himself or herself saying over and over again, &quot;No, not another sand worm!&quot; The writting style is deplorable. Herbert's prose is some of the worst I have ever read. Unlike Hawthorne, Dickens, and Melville, Herbert sentence structure is choppy, uneven, and cumbersome.I made it through this book, but I must admit, it did not hold my interest and I did breeze over a few pages.

I know a few who own and love the movie but have never read the book. I have lent DUNE to friends who could get no further than page 20 because it was too \\"out there\\" or too difficult, with its array of characters and glossary of made-up terms. But of all the people who have gotten past page 20- I don't know one who doesn't praise it among their absolute favorites. I am no exception.I love sci-fi but don't read much of it because I prefer fantasy. DUNE feels like a perfect blend of the two. A war of noble houses set in space. Paul Atreides is heir to the duchy- and to say that he is well trained for the job would be an understatement. His father, Duke Leto, is given charge of Arrakis- a hellish desert-world and the sole source of \\"the spice\\" which the entire universe needs. A very prestigious assignment, but treachery and peril comes with it. Paul finds himself thrown into the mystery of Dune and its fierce natives, the Fremen. Is he the savior their prophecy speaks of?I was first blown away by DUNE at the age of 16, and have since considered it \\"the one to beat\\". In 8 years, very few books have made me question that judgment: Game of Thrones, Foundation, Lord of the Rings, Ender's Game. I had to reread it to be sure I wasn't just nave at the time. Was it really THAT great? Absolutely."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune Messiah suffers in the general consensus from being plot-driven and extremely complex; for readers who take the time and effort to delve into its themes and characters, it is one of the greatest sci-fi books of all time. Messiah is not so much a sequel to Dune as it is a companion; it is impossible to fully understand the themes, motivations, and implications of the original Dune (or any of the others, even) without reading and comprehending Dune Messiah. Herbert takes his average hero from the first book and shapes him into a realistic, faulted human -- ironic considering Paul's decidedly abnormal powers. Finally, we see Muad'dib as he really is: torn by his position as emperor, cursed by his vision of the future, yet still capable of his duties to kingdom and family. His ultimate fate sums up a masterful, twisted analogy to the life of Christ. This is also the incredible origin of Duncan...the Duncan you will come to know throughout the other books. Messiah is not for the faint of heart though. If you can't handle a lot of philosophy, just keep walking. Some points in Dune Messiah are so profound that I had to quit reading and just spend a couple minutes thinking about what Herbert means. What a rare treat that is; I can honestly say that Dune Messiah changed the way I think about things, about life. If you give it a chance, it may just do the same for you."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The first time a read Dune: Messiah I was more than a little disappointed. By when I re-read Dune I also re-read Dune: Messiah. This was the first time I'd read them back-to-back, and I realized that Dune: Messiah was actually the conclusion to Dune and not a seperate book. As a stand alone book it's barely passable, as a sequal it's worth 3-stars, but as the fourth part of the first book it's a perfect conclusion. Dune was divided into 3 parts (called books) and the last ends with a nice Hollywood ending. Dune: Messiah shows the real conclusion to Paul's Life and the real consequences of his actions in the rest of the book. I think Herbert had to end the first book with Paul on top of the Universe because that is what reader's want, but Messsiah is a more somber look at what it means to have power. After I had re-read Dune and Dune: Messiah, I came across used cliff notes for Dune, and I noticed that it had an essay which treated to two books as one and compared them to a Greek epic pointing out that Greek epics didn't end when the hero was on top, but continued to the end of the hero's life. With the inclusion of Dune: Messiah, Dune now tells us the complete story of Paul's life, and what an incredible story it is. Do not read this book, rather read Dune and this book together."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert's Nebula and Hugo award-winning &quot;Dune&quot; is widely acclaimed as the best science fiction work. And rightly so. As entertainment it's a suspenseful tale of adventure that sparkles with imaginative creativity. When the family of Paul Atreides arrives on the desert planet &quot;Arrakis&quot; or &quot;Dune&quot;, they find that their goal to take over rule from the Harkonnen family is difficult to achieve. Paul faces treachery, murder, as well as the rigorous conditions of a dry and deadly planet where water is more precious than gold. It is only with the help of the mysterious battle-hardened desert tribe of Fremen, and his newly-discovered religious powers that Paul stands any chance of triumphing over the powers of evil. The plot has a complexity of layers reminiscent of Tolkien.The sci-fi classification does not mean &quot;Dune&quot; is inaccessible to non-sci-fi fans, because most of the traditional sci-fi elements are either absent or mere background. Several remarkable scenes of hand to hand combat are more reminiscent of ancient Roman gladiators than of science fiction! There are weaknesses: mature themes (such as allusions to pedastry) make &quot;Dune&quot; unsuitable for children, and Herbert's use of language is not outstanding. But what especially makes &quot;Dune&quot; great is the complexity of ideas. Herbert has created not just a story, but a memorable world conveying an elaborate philosophy of ideas, with three outstanding themes:1. ECOLOGY. Arrakis is a barren and bare planet of desert sands, with characters reminiscent of desert Arabs (Herbert studied Arabic extensively in researching for the novel). As well as hosting titanic deadly sandworms, the desert sands feature a mysterious and narcotic spice substance known as Melange, which is central to the diet of its inhabitants, heightens powers of awareness, and is a central part of the economy. The power and value of water in this hostile sandscape environment is manifested in that shedding tears is an expression of great devotion. It becomes evident that there is a plan to rescue this planet from its barrenness and turn it into a paradise. Significantly the book is dedicated to dry land ecologists. Herbert was an accomplished ecologist himself, and one wonders whether he is expressing his own vision of the possibility of a man-achieved paradise on earth.2. POLITICS. There is a complex interplay of people, tribes, politics and economics, with constant scheming, plots and subterfuge revolving around personal and political ambitions. Herbert has created an intricate and plausible history of tribes and peoples, with unique languages (much originating from Arabic), names and ambitions. The lust for power and wealth is combined with a determination to succeed at all costs, stopping at nothing - even murder - to achieve it. The political corruption and chaos of Dune's world is analogous to our contemporary world, as Herbert once observed in an interview: &quot;the scarce water of Dune is an exact analog of oil scarcity. CHOAM is OPEC.&quot; Paul's triumphant leadership is also thematic. In humanizing a messiah figure, Herbert raises an important question: why do people blindly follow leaders? &quot;Dune&quot; conveys his theory that &quot;superheroes are disastrous for mankind&quot; because even the greatest leaders are human. Despite their strengths, relying completely on them is fatal.3. RELIGION. Religion is inter-woven with politics, and centers on women, such as the powerful matriarch, the Reverend Mother. Herbert at times seems to picture religion as the manipulation of the masses by the intelligent, since the Orthodox Catholic Bible functions as a human invention rather than divine revelation. The strong religious component especially comes to the fore with Paul, a Messiah figure who fulfils prophecies, the long awaited Kwisatz Haderach who is somehow both man and god, and from whom all blessings flow. These prophecies have their own pitfalls - and are used to show the paradox of a system of predistination. The religion is a mixture of Christianity, Islam (jihad and similar Arabic words are clearly borrowed), Buddhist philosophy, and a strong eastern mystical component. Strangely, there is no active involvement of the Creator, since &quot;the most persistent principles of the universe are accident and error.&quot; The power of the divine resides instead within oneself, and there are definite occultic overtones, such as the mention of &quot;wierding&quot; (a form of witchcraft), and very obvious new age Eastern spiritualism and mysticism. Herbert also makes a profound connection between technology and religion. In light of the fact that this novel was written at the hey-day of space travel and lunar landings, it is remarkable that in an appendix Herbert observes that technology and space travel affects one's view of creation. In his opinion, the god of technology and machine-logic is destined to be dethroned, and replaced with a renewed realization of the significance of man. Instead of placing hope in machines, it is to be placed in mankind. Herbert optimism about mankind is evident: a self-made paradise is attainable.In short, Herbert has created a plausible world, reflecting his multi-faceted interests in society, culture, environment, politics, religion and science. Dune's fictional cultures (Fremen), political parties (Harkonnen, Atreides), worlds (Dune), languages, religions, customs, geography, and ecology are imaginative, realistic, and function in a rich complexity that places him in the same league as Tolkien and similar eminent writers. Though written in the 1960s, the fact that Dune is still relevant, readable and in no way outdated is a testimony to its greatness. You will find that this book has so much depth that you will not just read it once, but many times, with increasing enjoyment. So, don't hesitate, head for the sands of Dune for an unforgettable adventure!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert built three dynasties inside a galactic empire that is based on melange, a drug that was available on one planet only -- Arrakis, also known as Dune. Using melange, navigators have the power to fold space, which allows space travel.In spite of a blood feud that was more deadly than Romeo and Juliet's Montagues and Capulets, Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV takes the rule of Dune away from the Harkonnens and gives it to the House Atreides. He has his reasons. The scene is set for political intrigue, sabotage, subterfuge, war, romance, survival, revolt, and revenge.Dune is a masterpiece. It was the first novel to win the Nebula Award (1965), and it shared the Hugo Award in the following year (1966). Not only are the plots and characters intricate, but also the political, financial, religions, lifestyles, military, and honor structures are created. Dune is like no place on Earth.This book is written from multiple points of view (POV), and you know every main character in the book because you are privy to their thoughts. The abundant use of Italics is unacceptable in today's market, yet it is one of the most effective aspects of Dune.The effect of knowing what someone thinks while they say or do something else is an ability most people would like to have. Jessica, concubine to Duke Atreides, a Bene Gesserit witch, and Paul's mother trains him, against the wishes of the witches, to use his mind for control. The most powerful Bene Gesserit tests Paul Atreides, as she holds his mind captive she wonders if \\"he is the one.\\" Fremen believe he is Muad'Dib, the messiah who will deliver them, even as they challenge him in a fight to the death.I have read this book and the sequels several times.

Guess not.Look elsewhere for your ebook copy of Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"One of the problems with a sequel is that it must contend with the preconceptions of readers, who have ideas about where the plot should go. Never mind what the author thinks, thank you very much. In this case, the handicap is what we think Should Happen to Paul after all he's gone through in Dune. Isn't this the time for them to ride off into the sunset? It would be really great to think that he is a wonderful guy, marries Chani and lives happily ever after. A lot of the reviews of this second volume in the encyclopedic Dune series seem to yearn for it. Sorry, we have to disappoint you.Imagine for a moment that you are the son of a pretty influential guy, that you are pretty happy in your present home, and dad's boss sends him on a wild goose chase after a fortune, hoping, no Planning, that you fail, in order that he can secure a fortune, kill your whole family, and discredit your name forever. Now imagine that you narrowly escape, head off to exile where you are treated with suspicion, alternately an outsider and then as a god. In taking your revenge, you acquire the most important commodity in the universe, and you acquire the status of cult hero living god and emperor of the universe. Do you really think that you would be Mr. Nice Guy after all that?If one looks at Dune in this light, what happens in this sequel, Dune Messiah seems right. Your relcuctant bride, Irulan, is sure to be bitter, and want only to be the bearer of the next emperor. If you are Bene Geserit, you would do anything to interfere with Paul. If you are from one of the conquered worlds, you very likely not be happy about this bitter guy being emperor. If you are of the spacing guild you won't be happy about him having control of the spice. If you are a Paul disciple, you are going to die for him and the heck with anyone else. Thus the fight card is set: Paul and his cult vs. all his detractors, virtually everyone in the universe. Mr. Herbert gives us the blow-by-blow in a relatively compact synopsis.Perhaps the above is a bit too obtuse. Suffice it to say that if you expect to find Mr. Wonderful hero in this, you should look elsewhere. Likewise if you need a warm and fuzzy romance or a shootemup space opera, you may not want to venture here. But if you want to explore the logical consequences of the price of power, and the bitterness it generates, this is just the ticket. I have read and reread this series at different times of my life, and each time am amazed at what I find new in each reading. Mr. Herbert holds up well beside so-called \\"legitimate\\" authors, and is head and shoulders above most of our current fantasy crop. Read this book and the rest of the series with an open mind and be amazed."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"First off, this is a review of the Kindle edition of this book. I apologize in advance if you're considering the paper edition and this isn't helpful; Amazon doesn't give us a way to rate the Kindle version separately.I really like the book itself, but can't recommend the Kindle edition due to sadly sloppy formatting -- in literally hundreds of places, the Kindle edition will spuriously add italics where none belong, or remove italics where they do belong, or remove spaces between words so they run together, or confuse dashes with hyphens and use quotation marks or apostrophes that point the wrong direction. There are some typos too (which I think are not literally typos, but OCR -- optical character recognition -- errors).All of this distracts from the enjoyment of what should be an excellent read, frequently reminding you that you are reading a book published by a company that couldn't be bothered to proofread their work.The fact that this is an extra-cost \\"40th anniversary edition\\" adds insult to injury (the Dune sequels haven't been given the 40th anniversary treatment, and aren't full of these annoying errors, and they cost less to boot)."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"In the first novel of his entrancing saga, Frank Herbert takes his audiences captive with the haunting epic of the desert planet, Arrakis. Herbert displays his unique capability for blending the elements of religion, politics, culture and nature perfectly to form a society that is, though alien, slightly reminiscent of the world today. Though fantastical and outlandish, Arrakis is very realistic and believable world.The novel takes place primarily on Arrakis, also known as Dune. A place where water is a luxury and the sun is the ultimate enemy of a man. Many secrets are buried within Dune's sands, many of which only its natives, the Fremen, are aware of. One mystery that the government has still not reasoned out is the spice, melange. The addictive spice practically runs the universe, giving the Guild navigators their enhanced navigational skills and Muad'Dib his prescience. Strangely, though, the spice is only found on Arrakis, and quite abundantly. All of this Paul Atreides must encounter when his father, Duke Leto, accepts the fief of Arrakis. However, through a series of events involving the Atreides' arch rival, the Harkonnens, Paul and his mother, Jessica, must flee to the desert, leaving behind Paul's inheritance as Duke. When Paul encounters the spice-filled desert, the prescience that he always possessed is enhanced to the point of sensing truth and predicting the future. Hiding in the cover of the desert, Paul and Jessica are taken in by the Fremen and accepted into their religion. It is through the Fremen that Paul becomes the notorious Muad'Dib, and the long awaited Messiah of the Fremen, destined to lead them in battle. However, the battle is not only with the Harkonnens, but the Bene Gesserit also. The Bene Gesserit are the founders of a human breeding program to reach the goal of creating a Kwistatz Haderach, the ultimate human.Soon, the man known as Muad'Dib must fight the battle with his old enemies, the Harkonnens and his own future.This book is a classic science fiction masterpiece that displays the immense talent and imagination of its author, Frank Herbert. It challenges the imagination, inspires the mind, and fills the senses until you feel you can taste the melange on your tongue and feel the desert sand of Arrakis on beneath your feet. If you appreciate intelligent literature, this book will not disappoint you."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert possessed one of the most fertile imaginations I have ever encountered. Dune is a fantastic novel of so many layers that I find new truths ever time I read it. It won the Hugo and the Nebula awards (sci fi's top two awards), and is considered by many to be the finest example of the genre. It is frequently compared to Tolkein's fantasy novels because both authors build complex worlds containing myths, histories, and conflicts, that seem utterly real to the reader. In fact, Herbert was influenced by Tolkein.Dune tells the story of the boy Paul Atreides, a future duke whose father is murdered, forcing him and his Bene Gesserit mother Jessica to go into hiding on the desert planet Arrakis. We see Paul's transformation into a powerful prophet and leader known as Muad'Dib, and his rise to galactic prominence. The book explores ecological issues, and Herbert has said that the scarcity of water on Arrakis is meant to parallel the scarcity of oil on Earth. Many other issues and characters are explored with penetrating insight and masterful prose. This book cannot be recommended highly enough for anyone interested in a moving, thoughtful, and brilliant book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The novel Dune is one of those works that you hear of by reputation as being a classic and which you always see in the bookstore but never seem to pick up to read. I had seen the David Lynch film when I was younger and was confused and bored by it. I borrowed a copy of the Dune tv mini-series recently, and after watching one episode I found the story intriguing but the special effects lacking. So I decided to read the book in order to experience a better effects company, my imagination.To me, one of the things that makes Dune unique is its glimpse of what the future holds for the human race. It isnt a future controlled by machines and dominated by technology as so many science fiction worlds are. The universe that Frank Herbert creates here is a humanistic one, almost a mideval renaissance world. Going along with that thought, this universe is filled with court intrigue. The known universe is loosely ruled by an emperor named Padashan IV who keeps his rule going with the threat of his imperial guard, elite fighting units called Sardaukar. He also keeps his noblemen in suspicion of each other and sometimes helps bring about actual wars between them if it suits his purpose.As the book opens, one of his most respected noblemen, Duke Atreides, is sent to the desert planet of Arrakis (Dune) to take over spice production. Spice is the most important product in the universe and whoever controls it, controls power, and brings danger on themselves. One of the sources of conflict is that the Atreides have replaced the House Harkonnen, their bitter enemies, on Arrakis, so the whole place smells like a trap waiting to spring. The Harkonnens have sworn eternal war, called \\"kanly\\" with the Atreides and it is only a question of when and how they will strike. In addition to this, there are mysterious native inhabitants on Dune, known as Fremen, whose allegience is unknown, and the Duke also has to deal with giant sandworms who can swallow ships whole.The main character of the book is Paul Atreides, son of the duke, a fifteen year old boy trained by the best fighters in the galaxy and also learned in the ways of his Bene Gesserit mother. The Bene Gesserits remind me of the Jedi in Star Wars. They are trained psychics who have strange powers feared and respected among the general populace, such as future vision, and can sometimes control weak minds and sorta steer the galaxy. Some say that Paul is destined for some terrible purpose that will lead the human race to a new destiny.This is a great book. Like the Lord of the Rings, you can tell that Herbert not only wrote this book, but in the process developed and shaped his world with legends and past histories that are only hinted at in this work. There is lots of action and adventure and also religious questions and philsophy, almost a little for every kind of ruler. It does have its dull moments, especially after Paul meets his destiny, but you have to expect that anytime you have a work that is an \\"epic\\". There's so much information that not all of it can be interesting. There is a large cast of characters, so I would maybe suggest watching the first episode of the tv series like I did because it gives you a visual reference for most of the main characters. I'm going to start the next book, Dune Messiah, today."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have been turning up the pace on my reading lately, and last time I entered a book store I remembered multiple friends had been urging me to read Frank Herbert's Dune. I snagged a copy of the book, and noted on the drive home that Arthur C. Clarke was quoted as saying &quot;the only thing I know comparable is Lord of the Rings.&quot; I could not help but consider this an extremely bold statement.As I read it, however, it did not take long for me to realize how true this statement rings. In Dune, Frank Herbert has crafted a dizzyingly imaginative universe. Every social group and race of people, from the Bene Gesserit to the Harkonnens to the Sardaukar to the Fremen is described in such mad detail that one cannot help but believe these societies exist in some remote corner of our universe. The ecology and geology of the planet Arrakis, from the sandworms to the barren deserts, are crafted with such grace that there is no doubt in my mind Arrakis has to be real somewhere in the galaxy, if not merely inside of Frank Herbert's head.And it gets better. All of the characters, from the confused-yet-focused Paul Atriedes, to the Baron Harkonnen, one of the easiest to hate villains ever crafted, are completely real and filled with depth, and the way they interact with the world around them is absolutely believable.All of the characters are involved in a breath-takingly epic story of politics and religion, with many subtle and not-so-subtle parallels of our own society interwoven with the entertaining quest. However, this grand story never overtakes the development of the individual characters, which always remains key to Dune. I didn't feel like I was reading a story with a beginning and end and a clear message to be brought out of it as I read Dune. I felt like I was watching these people play out a small portion of their lives, and when it was all over I was heart-broken that I would not be able to follow them any longer.In the end, I could only agree with Arthur C. Clarke's assessment of Dune. The amazing degree of craftsmanship in creating the planet of Arrakis has not been seen in any book less epic then J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, and, if it is possible, I found Dune to be even more believable. Despite my hectic class schedule this quarter, I found a way to tear through this book in under a week. If you have not read Dune, pick up a copy: you will not be disappointed.Exaggerated one-line review: Dune is science fiction's Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is quite possibly the finest science fiction novel ever written and fares well in comparison to non-genre novels as well. Combining elements of adventure, romance, political intrigue, sci-fi/fantasy elements and character study in a single work would be a daunting task to begin with. Herbert has successfully accomplished this in a fully realized and fleshed-out universe with a coherent history, economy, ecology and political structure. And beyond that, he uses this setting to examine such wide-ranging issues as the impact of technology on human society, the essence of self-discovery and the world-shaking (and potentially disastrous) impact of messianic figures on society.The characters are memorable, multi-layered and possessed of plausible motivations. The settings are diverse and well-articulated as is the futuristic technology. And the techno-speak doesn't get in the way of the story.Additional gems await those with a varied knowledge base such as the fact that the doctor, Yueh, is named for the Chinese god of epidemics.Don't be disuaded from reading this marvelous book by the movie or mini-series. The first is unintelligible if you haven't already read the book and both succumb to symbolism at the end that is not in the book.Dune is one of the (very) few books worth reading more than once."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The Dune series truly is a wonderful collection of sci-fi books. The vividness and completeness of the 'alternate reality' being portrayed is staggering. You truly are thrown into another world; given the number of books available, you can 'wallow in it' for quite some time. If you want a break from everyday reality, dive into these books and don't surface until you need food, sleep, etc."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"There is no praise that can be sung about this book that has not already been sung. When it was first published in 1965, it burst upon the science fiction scene like a supernova. Nothing had ever been written that was even remotely similar. Reviewers coined new phrases to describe the novel: &#65533;space feudalism&#65533;, &#65533;feudal-futurism&#65533;, even &#65533;sand fiction&#65533;. Yet, anyone who has read the novel can attest to the poverty of such labels. This is a book that defies pigeonholing.Where shall I start? Firstly, unlike so much in science fiction, even by grand masters like Asimov and Clarke, this book develops characters of exceptional depth. They each have such vibrant inner lives that it is impossible not to identify with them. The writing is absolutely first class. Spare, tight, exquisitely metaphorical, not a word wasted, it&#65533;s a pleasure to read. The imagery is so effective you can feel the grit of sand in your teeth. Then there is the sheer genius of Herbert&#65533;s imagination. He borrows from history the religious and feudal societies, but transform them into something unique and original.This is one of the most complete science fiction classics ever written. Whether it is writing skill, plot, themes, setting, characterizations, breadth of imagination or sheer weight of ingenuity, it beggars parallel. I can&#65533;t think of a single fault, except perhaps that it had to come to an end.The only unfortunate aspect of this work was that it scaled pinnacles of such extraordinary height that Herbert would never attain them again. Each of his sequels fell further and further from the mark set by this novel, and some of his later works were simply embarrassing.Beg, borrow or steal this book. Just don&#65533;t pass up the chance to read it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Let me start off saying that this was a great book but it was very different from the first one. It was good in a different way. The plots twist gave a lot of depth and suspense. There was a lot less action in this book which is why it only gets 4 stars. I also wish that Stilgar was involved more, he was one of the most interesting characters in the first book and i think that he should come back for this one. If you read this book you will be going back to read over things A LOT. Its really complex but thats what makes it great. In this book Paul has to deal with being a god and a man and an emporer all at the same time which prooves difficult for him. The plots against him go really deep. (REALLY REALLLY DEAP) They all just seem to weave together trough a bunch of twist and turns and interweavings of character. (yeah, i don't know what i'm saying) But for real, this is a must read book! If you want an action book, then don't read this one. But if your looking for anything else in a book, this one has it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert's Dune is the first in an epic series, titled after the first book. It is a intricate story which is both entertaining and enlightening. Frank Herbert spent six years prior to writing the book just researching related topics, and he was a reporter before that time. His book has a complicated by addictive story centered around Paul Atreides, an heir to a planet in the human empire. The empire is divided in a kind of fuedal system - and the Atreides family is one of the noble families. Their enemies are the vile Harkonnen, a morally decrepid family of dictators. When Paul's family is sent to Arrakis (titled Dune by the natives), he is caught in an intricate plot filled with politics, morallity, and military planning. I loved the book, and it remains to be one of my favorite stories of all time. There are a few reasons for this. The first is that the book is not a Hollywood style movie, it has realistic and detailed events. I learned more about the inner workings of politics from the book then I knew before reading it! The second reason involves the level of maturity, which is self-explainitory. I feel it portrays events that could happen in the future, not just a story that has a futuristic setting. It details daily life, character traits, and countless other things that are crucial to such realism. Also, every character has a flaw or two; a stark contrast to the typical, invincible main character of most books. It is, however, a very complicated plot. To fully understand the book, or to get anything out of it, one is required to read between the lines. Motives are not directly thrown at you, and there is very little to no forshadowing. Very complex issues with extreme amounts of detail are explained in the book, and not a single page of it can be missed. I had to re-read many of the pages just to understand the events fully. I tried to have one of my friends read it after I was done, and he seemed to get confused on the simplest topics - let alone the deeper lessons of the book. If you are a reader who feels limited by your current material, or if you feel you really need something different, Dune is definately the right choice. If you are new to reading, or do not feel comfortable with spending large amounts of time on a book, then Dune is probably a book that should be read at a later time."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Power! imagination! drama! a masterpiece!Those are but a few of the superlatives that describe this book. Saying the least, Dune is the best si-fi book of all times. An unparalleled saga painted on the vast canvas of Herbert's imagination in vivid colors, but that metaphor is only a two-dimensional view of a manifold work. It's a complete Herbertian Universe with all the detail and intricacy of reality. No si-fi author gets close to the perfection he achieved here. The plot, or should I say plots, twist and turn in completely unpredictable ways, like the non-rhythmic dance of the Fremen. I am yet to see another author that eludes anticipation like Herbert.The intrigue! The sophistication! So exquisite! The cast of larger-then-life figures in classical rolls, the Hero and the Villain, the Tragic and the Noble, Arch-typical yet not stereotypical. A unique writing style combining the broad objective view point of third person account, with the subjective &quot;thoughts&quot; of first person.Not to mention the scope and the breath, Herbert plays out philosophical and political, environmental and religious themes with unmatched canny. He was a thinker way ahead of his time, way ahead of OUR time! Maybe future generations will appreciate his full genius. I can not think of any other Si-Fi book that surpasses Dune, with the possible exception of &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; on greater philosophical and political depth.No si-fi fan that respects himself could miss reading this book, but it really is a classic for all to read.&quot;The truth carries the ambiguity of the word used to express it&quot; (Frank Herbert -- 'God Emperor of Dune')"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is possibly the most imaginative and one of the most original science fiction novels I have ever read. Never have I seen a universe so completely, lovingly, and interestingly created. Dune contains all the elements of a medieval adventure seamlessly combined with a plausible future (well, except maybe the messiah part). This was (along with Dandelion Wine) the book that turned me on to science fiction and made me excited about reading over twenty years ago. Now the sacrilege: Read Dune, then stop. As Frank Herbert should have. Everything after Dune is, by comparison, trash. Dune Messiah seemed like an afterthought. Children of Dune was a little better, but then the series got worse from there. Sometimes the original is so good, there just shouldn't be a sequel. This is one of those times."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a novel justifiably known as a classic of science fiction. It is a fantastic blend of political intrigue, religion, science, ecology and adventure. In looking at a fictitious future, it also reflected on the past, in particular on how religions were founded, especially Islam. Any similarities between Paul Atreides and Mohammed are definitely not coincidental.Dune concludes with Paul triumphant, the spiritual and political leader of the desert planet Arrakis having seized the Galactic Emperorship. Dune Messiah opens twelve years later with Paul at the crest of his power, his religious movement having been spread throughout the galaxy, whether other people wanted it or not. Billions have died, but Paul has been successful, even if he isn't certain if that is what he really wanted. Trapped by his own power, Paul cannot take pleasure in his victories. And since he is so powerful, both a prophet and a political leader, he has enemies who constantly plot his downfall.While a good novel, Dune Messiah focuses too much on the political intrigue and loses some of the complex richness the previous book had. Also, the absence of Paul's mother, Jessica and Gurney Halleck (among other characters from the first novel) leaves the reader wanting more. Instead, we get the return of Duncan Idaho, a relatively minor character in the first book who has an importance on several levels in this book.As with many sequels, this should not be read without having read the predecessor. Fans of Dune should read this book and will not be overly disappointed, even if they are not overly satisfied either."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Duke Leto Atreides takes control of the desert planet Arrakis when given to him by the Galactic Emperor as a fief. The planet is the galaxy's source of the narcotic spice melange, and the planet's importance is therefore critical. The previous rulers of Arrakis, the Harkonnens, however, refuse to surrender the planet peacefully.The Duke's 15-year old son, Paul Atreides, has been prepared all his life for the burden of command. Unknown to him, though, he represents the culmination of generations of genetic and religious manipulation. When the Harkonnens attempt to reclaim the planet from his father, he must join the native population and fulfill his destiny as their messianic leader to free them from the Harkonnen's brutal regime.Though written over 35 years ago, Dune is still considered one of the two or three best science fiction novels ever written, and is de rigeur for all science fiction readers. The characters are both vivid and epic, and the descriptions are lush and rich without being baroque. Though some have difficulty with the jargon (sprinkled throughout the book), most feel that it gives an air of authenticity to the text. There is also an extensive glossary in the appendices.Though later novels in this series are not as strong as Dune, Herbert's world nonetheless leaves the reader hungry for subsequent installments in the plotline.No reader's library should be without a copy of Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The prices that publishers are now charging for eBooks ($15) are ridiculous and makes me regret the purchase of my e-reader.

Well, they are not going to get my money anymore, I'll go to the library or look for a good used copy on the Market Place. Shame....."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The fact that this edition cost twice what the print edition does should mean someone at the publishing house took the time to edit and spell-check it. This is not the case and this is sadly a widespread practice with Kindle books. Get it together publishers!

That said Dune is boss and totally worth reading more than once."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune should have been moved from SciFi to Literature long ago. While it does have the makings of an amazing SciFi novel, Dune is also a catalyst for inner change. This book will make you a different person. I've read it 6 times over my life and everytime i pick it up i set it down a little wiser. A must read!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is said to be one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written and I happen to agree. Labeling it as merely science fiction, however, is to sell this work of imagination and insight far short. Dune tackles many of the problems encountered in the human condition, the perennial conflict between free will and fate being perhaps the most interesting question examined. Herbert masterfully drops the reader into this existential question along with providing great insight into the nature of religion and politics, how the two are related, and why people easily combine the two. Overall, this is a masterpiece deserving of careful reading, thought, and eventually many re-readings."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This isn't a rehash of of the first book, Dune. Instead this is somewhat a prologue to Children Of Dune, the third book in the series. Even though this doesn't contain some of the key characters from the first book, such as Lady Jessica and Gurny Halleck, I'm not to sure why people really don't like this book. My cousin doesn't like it because he said that the aurthur took away Paul's power. Of course he didn't though. Also, if you thought that the first book was steeped in political intrigue, this one takes it to the next level. I'm not going to give the story away so you will have to read for yourself. Really a good read that leads up to the even better Children of Dune. If you're looking to continue with the series, ignore the negative reviews and get this today."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"For me, finishing Dune was like walking out of a great movie with a smile on my face thinking, &quot;Damn, that was good.&quot; I'm not a regular reader of science fiction, but I can see why the cover proclaims it &quot;Science Fiction's Supreme Masterpiece.&quot; Herbert combines politics, religion, strategy, psychology, intelligence, and emotion inside an incredibly detailed and seemingly tangible universe.Despite the alien environment, Dune is a book that drew me in instantly, and didn't let me go until the end. Herbert's writing style was a joy to read, as he managed to find the delicate balance between detail and brevity, resulting in a fluid tale with both depth and raw emotion. What makes books like Dune and the Lord of the Rings series so great is that their respective worlds seem completely natural and real to the reader. Add some great action, plot twists, and wonderfully fleshed out characters, and you have a masterpiece of not just science fiction, but modern literature as well. The incredible epic of the Muad'Dib, the deadly beauty of Arrakis and its inhabitants ... Dune is a novel I will never forget."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If you intend to continue on in the Dune series, I strongly suggest you do so in rapid succession. Dune Messiah, Children of Dune and God Emporer of Dune are really one continuous story. Read them too far apart and you break the flow. If you need a breather, take it before you start Heretics of Dune.Frank Herbert was a tricky man--he first blinded us with the brilliance of those with abilities difficult to understand and then proceeded to unweave this intricate tapestry of belief. Perhaps he wanted his readers to understand the ease with which people are cowed by that which they do not understand, and the inevitable costs of such self-deprecating behavior.Be prepared to take several small breaks to appreciate the philosophical musings intersperced throughout the book. It is a novel stimulating more for the actions it causes you to undertake as a spectator than for the actions of the players."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I've always been a fantasy fan...I enjoy reading Jordan, Tolkein, etc. All of these books created a world from basic ideas. Herbert does much of the same...Dune is a desert land that requires a hard existence. The Fremen, people that naturally habit this land, are a troubled people that exist for nothing more than to create life from nothing. Paul, the main character, is adopted by these people, and becomes their spiritual leader. It is a good story that is very origonal (I haven't read any other story that compares). I find that as you read fantasy books, many of the ideas presented by todays top writers are borrowed from one another (just written in a different way, with different characters). I don't know about you, but this gets old after a while.Anyways, I started reading dune 5 years after I bought the book. I had tried reading the story many times over those five years, but I'd get lost or disinterested in the story because of all the made up language, philosophical mumbo jumbo, and from the fact that basically, the book starts out slow. After getting through the first 50 to 100 pages, the story becomes very involved and very real. It was written very well. I understand why this is the highest selling sci-fi of all time.For those that enjoy fantasy, this book is clasified as a sci-fi, but really, it is in between. It doesn't have the space-flying-fighting juck that i normally would associate with a sci-fi novel. It's definitally worth the money and the time. Buy this book. You'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"In comparison to the original &quot;Dune&quot;, &quot;Dune: Messiah&quot; is a lot slower and takes more dedication. After immediately reading it, I was a bit disappointed, but that was before finishing the other books. &quot;Dune: Messiah&quot; now reveals itself to me as a gateway into a larger universe as envisioned by Frank Herbert. It foreshadows events that take place in the following books (not necessarily in order) in detail so that one might better understand Muad'Dib and how he is a springboard for all that happens with his son Leto and beyond.If you casually enjoyed &quot;Dune&quot;, I do not recommend &quot;Dune: Messiah&quot; as it requires reading the following books to fully understand. If you were enthralled by &quot;Dune&quot;, and intend to read the entire saga however, reading this book is a MUST. It is necessary to understand and enjoy the following four novels."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I'm still reeling from the spell that Herbert wove! I have not felt so strong about a book since I read Orson Scott Card's &quot;Xenocide&quot; . Incredible.This is a layered book: The tensions between the royal houses; the tensions between the houses and the Spice Guild; the tensions between the patriarch and the shadow matriarchy of the Bene Gesserits. You you are looking at a real world!In fact, this book is AS complex as &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; but does not have Tolkien's archaic quasi-Middle English. Herbert's prose is smooth. The only down side is that I had to return to the index to check on the unfamiliar words. I'm glad Herbert put that index in there: although they are humans, this is an alien world and an alien culture.Herbert's genius is, however, his ability to meld Sci-Fi and Fantasy into that rare elixir of &quot;Sci-Fant.&quot; Look at &quot;Star Wars&quot; and the Force, or even Ghostbusters where you catch ghosts not by magic but by technology. Chief among the fantasy elements is the Melange, the Spice, the macguffen. Another element is the Bene Gesserit &quot;witches,&quot; that secretly are controlling the destiny of humanity.The milieu is a marble cake of Mid-east cultures: Judaism messiah, Islam's jihad, Christianity's Bible. But the wild card is the mideval royal families, or &quot;houses&quot; (Pharaoh=&quot;Great House&quot;)that compose the main political force. Then the Spice Guild jockeying for their power. Most authors would stumble and crumble by trying to wangle in such diverse milieus, but Herbert scores yet another touchdown!The protagonist is Paul Atreides, a cross between Luke Skywalker and Ender Wiggam. We are lead along as he grows to understand his destiny as the messiah of Dune. In a sense, we are Paul Atreites as we work out our calling and mission in life.Four final observations:1) This book is a great study for fans of &quot;The Hero With A Thousand Faces.&quot;2) The only draw-back with the book is that it is very serious. There is not a lot of humor, or wise-cracking, even with Gurney, the troubador-soldier. The closest thing to a jock is Duncan Idaho's name. 3) I got thirsty reading this book.4) Don't let the 1984 movie adaptation deter you. Use it as an overview to one of Science Fiction's greatest books."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Before I start this review, i would like to say that i am 14 years old, and I think that everybody should read this book.Dune is set on the desert planet of Arrakis. Arrakis a wasteland but has one thing on it more valuable then gold: spice. The spice is the most important thing in the whole universe. The spice gives the Spacing Guild(the monopoly on intersteller travel) the ability to transport from planet to planet.For years the Harkonans had ruled Arrakis. Now there is a new House in command: the Atradies (sorry I can't spell). The Atradies have become so popular that they have aroused the jealously of even the Emporer of the Universe himself. A plot to destroy the Atradies begins...Young Paul Atradies manages to escape when the Haekonens and Imperial Troops arive. He learns to live off of the desert with the Fremen. The Fremen are what make this book great. The imagination that it must have taken to create such a people is beyond comprehension. Paul learns that he is a vital part of the Fremen religion. He is the voice from the out world. He will lead them to paradise. Paul raises the Fremen into and army to avenge the wrong made on his family by the Harkonens and Emporer. Paul also learns that he might be the Kwisatz Hatderatch(The result of years of manipulated breeding by the Bene Geseret and the &quot;One who can be many places at once.&quot; The Bene Geseret are somewhat like a religous order dedicated to making the Kwisatz Haderratch)Dune is complex but that is what makes it so great. The plot is so thick you can feel the tension and emotion between the characters. There are times of nothing more then conversation where I still was not bored. This book is writen beter then anything I have ever heard or read. There is also a movie based on this book that is worth seeing."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It's said fairly often that Dune was the greatest science fiction novel ever written, and rightfully so if you ask me. Many of these same people go on to say that Dune Messiah is not very good, and the series gets worse as it goes on. Too many people.Dune Messiah finishes (almost) what Dune started to describe: the life of a man who becomes a living god, and the effect he then has on the world surrounding him. In Messiah the forces of the universe (the Imperial family, the Fremen, the Space Guild, etc) react to Paul Atreides, the Muad'Dib, and the results are fascinating to read. I must confess that while I enjoyed Dune, I wasn't sure it was enough to keep me going through six books, much less consider the new prequels which are now popping up. Dune Messiah made up my mind for me, and I bought the next four books that week. This is where the series really starts to take off and flesh out a future that is sometimes dark, sometimes hopeful, and never boring."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"On the encouragement of a friend who was very into the &quot;Dune&quot; series at the time I tried reading this first book about sixteen years ago and couldn't get into it then. The movie came out about that time and I was lost in it also. Recently I picked this book back up and found it a joy not only to read, but to complete.The only thing I can add to these already glowing reviews for &quot;Dune&quot; is if you had tried reading it when you were younger and couldn't muddle through it, try it when you're older and have a little more experience and knowledge (and patience) about life and it's workings and it should be a lot easier. It's worth another attempt-or two-for it is one of those rare experiences that will change your life, and make you see the world in a different way, enriching it.Also I recommend checking out the movie before you start the book. Even though it only touches upon the events in &quot;Dune&quot;, skimming over them almost in a superficial way, it will help you to understand the deeper actions in the novel, and bring together some of the more confusing elements-of the &quot;plots within plots&quot;, that incredible tapestry that Herbert succeeds in weaving so well. It works great as a &quot;travel guide&quot; to the &quot;Dune&quot; book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Usually in science fiction, some compromise is made between those who want explorations of humanity and social dynamics at the expense of hard technical accuracy and those who want the opposite. As brilliant as some authors in this genre are, they tend to borrow their scenery and supporting casts from established conventions of spaceships and near-magical technology that follows no rule of science of which we are currently aware.While this is foremost a story about the lives of individuals, the subtle and overt variances between life in this world and the one Herbert envisions give life and strength to _Dune_. You understand the value of a cup of spilled dishwater on Arrakis as easily as you understand the fear of Big Brother in Airstrip One, because Herbert and Orwell support their world's differences throughout the entirety of their books.What Herbert does is to postulate several things, incredible to us now, that mark his created world as very different from our own:1) A ban on artificial intelligence leading to the rise of humans trained to compute with the speed and accuracy of a machine; 2) A universe where democracy does not exist to any significant degree; 3) A universally consumed product that everyone wants to prolong life and health that permits a small percentage of its users to perceive the future.Many of the secular inheritances of empirical thought, from the early Greek mathematicians and philosophers to the present, are strangely gone from this universe. We assume that computers shall take more and more of a dominant role in mechanisms of labor and society; we assume that all humans are fundamentally equal and that class divisions of a feudal nature are nonsense; we assume that precognition is speculative and a fantasy yet unproven by any science.These alterations lend dimensions of interest to a book which would otherwise be an exploration of an alternate ecology, of the preternatural desert of Arrakis and the means by which its human residents cope with the hellish if scientifically plausible conditions.Don't misunderstand me - the saga, the medieval melodrama still fascinates me years after initially reading it during slow afternoons in sixth grade. What locks this in your mind is the vast differences between this world and the one that Frank Herbert describes, and very few have the sheer imaginative faculty to equal his achievements."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"&quot;Dune&quot; is an illustration of what normal people are capable of when faced with extraordinary danger and hardship.

Last month, I read it again for the second time at the age of 32, and I'm happy to report that the book is one of the few things from my teens to remain significant and moving to me as an adult. Another reviewer commented on how it was disappointing that Paul seemed to &quot;become a different person&quot; in the second half of the book. Of course he did. Just as iron becomes steel, or coal becomes diamond; so do we change down to our roots when we feel extradinary heat and pressure; the superfluous parts of us are burned away, and the core of ourselves is revealed. This isn't always a pretty process, but the core isn't a bad thing; it is the best part of us, like the heartwood of a tree. It just isn't something we're used to seeing. For me, Dune is about the contrast between the ethos of people who live in peace and security, vs. the ethos of people who live in constant danger and hardship. The value of Dune, in my opinion, is that it is a good start in any attempt to begin to train the mind, to focus one's inner power, to be human intentionally and not just by accident. And Heather B., if you are out there somewhere, thank you for introducing me to this wonderful book so many years ago. God Bless you, wherever you are.

On the surface, it's an epic tale of good vs. evil, emperors, dukes, royalty, and romance all set on an alien world known as Arrakis. The cultures and concepts in this book are so palpable, that it is mindblowing. My only complaint when it comes to the novel, is that this book is very difficult to follow, and can be downright boring in certain parts. But all in all, Dune is a must-read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is the shortest book in the series, but at the same time it is the most complex. What a fascinating insight into the mind is offered in this story! Paul is torn between what is right for himself, and what is right for humanity. Saving humanity requires his own demise at the hands of others...saving himself requires the suffering of others. How does one make such a choice? There are times while you are reading that it may seem a bit much to absorb, but stick with it until the end. This work can be only judged as a whole. It is difficult reading because it makes you think, but then, what's wrong with that?"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A book which can be read on many levels, every reading reveals something new. As art, it has few equals. Herbert creates an entire world and peoples it with interesting, complex people embroiled in high drama - which makes for a ripping good story. Its explorations of the nature of messianic religion and societal dependence on a single, fragile substance are as relevant today as ever. Not to be missed by any SF fan."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"\\"Dune\\" begins with a spiritual awakening of Paul Atreides, heir to the Atreides noble House and son of a defiant Bene Gesserit, Jessica. Just as the House is forced by circumstance to move to the planet Arrakis (Dune) and take it over from the Harkonnens, Paul enters adulthood. He is different; mature for his age through his noble upbringing and aware beyond the norm thanks to his mother's 'special' training.Through his father's intelligence network, Paul comes to realise that moving to Arrakis is not as straightforward as it seems. There are sublte undertones of byplays and \\"tricks within tricks within tricks\\". The Emperor, the House Harkonnen, and the Fremen who cultivate the precious but deadly addictive spice on Arrakis all have a hand in the game.No sooner have the Atreides arrived, in fact, and an attempt is made on Paul's life; and a little later, his father is murdered by a traitor. Circumstance would have it that Paul and his mother make a lucky escape from the hands of the Harkonnens who are behind his father's murder. Or is it the Harkonnens?Paul and Jessica are thrown into the desert, an environment so harsh and unforgiving that survival appears impossible. It is Paul's determination, training, but mostly, his unquestioned willingness to accept the new environment for what it is, that eventually help them to hook up with the Fremen who have been a thorn in the Harkonnen's side. From there, Paul and his mother can build a base that will allow them to challenge the Harkonnens and seek revenge for the Duke's death and regain control of Arrakis. But, unbeknownst to his mother, Paul aims higher ...The entire novel is stunning. It is rich and intriguing without being overly complex. The writing flows for easy reading without over-analysis. There are plans within plans, and interesting tangents. Herbert built complete people, communities, religions, and even an entire planet. Arrakis is a real, dry, dusty, harsh world, easily padded out in the reader's imagination (you'll get thirsty reading this book!). The book encompasses political motivation, economic dependency, spiritual awakening, ecological limitation, love, revenge, war and the human ability to persist, overcome and achieve.But first and foremost, \\"Dune\\" is an amazing story and a pleasure to read. In writing \\"Dune\\", Frank Herbert was far ahead of his time - it was first published in 1965, but still relevant today. That's what makes it a true classic."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is not the best book ever written. Nor is it the most exciting or intriguing story. It is however a modern classic that envelops the reader in a different universe where the problems we have today -- politics, business evils and shortage of natural resources -- are mirrored in a fantastical realm.The main character is good. The antagonists are bad. For the most part, there is not much &quot;gray&quot;. Like a western of old, the hats are easy to recognize. I read this book twenty years ago and recently picked it up again from the local used book store. I found that it was still as fun to read as it was long ago.Read this book because it is a modern classic. Enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune Messiah is a much less ambitious book that its predecessor, but that doesn't mean it comes short as one of the greatest sci-fi books ever. Much shorter than &quot;Dune&quot;, this sequel focuses on just a couple of storylines at a time, and basically serves its purpose: present the outcome of Paul Muadib as ruler of the universe and prepare us for the coming of his children, whose actions, narrated on the forecoming novels, are the real juice of the saga. Anyway, Dune Messiah has a simple, entertaining story, but you certainly can't stop there. In order to find out what's the destiny of the universe, you need to read the ones that follow this sequel."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I first read Dune at the age of 15. I never really liked fiction and I wasn't all that much of a reader. But after reading a few lines from a copy of that book, that I just happen to be holding for a friend, I knew that this was no ordinary piece of fiction. Few books, save maybe The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are comparable with it in terms of the depth and vision. In certain aspects I find Dune even greater. Many of the poems and songs composed by the fictional Gurney became my own songs. I recall them even now, 15 years after I first read them.Dune is not just a piece of fiction. It is literature in its finest form. In the world of science fiction, there is nothing that can be compared to it as yet. Few writers have mastered the art of making the unreal future, as tangible and believable as Frank Herbert does in this book. My only disappointment is the fact that the sequels never live up to the promise seen in the original. Nevertheless, that fact does not in any way detract from the greatness of Dune.To a fifteen-year-old mind, the impact of such vision is profound indeed. I can still smell the spice, I can still feel the dryness of the desert sand and I still believe that the dreams we remember may be visions of the future. Such is the product of great literature! Such is Dune!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"4???? 4 stars???? How can any self-respecting sci-fi fan dare, heck even dream to give less than a full 6 stars (x10) to one of the pillarstones of sci-fiction. A book so immense in scope and in imagination, in knowledge and in mystery that even the self-appointed guardians of 'true literature' quail at the thought of dismissing it - well my friends, my knife is sharpened and I'm kinda hankering for some holy cow cutting-down to size.Dune is magnificent, it blows your mind with the sheer scope of the imagination, you really can believe 10,000 years from now human society may develop along these lines. Herbert cleverly plays on the idea that often the future is a derivation of the past - thus this feudal society, with Barons &amp; na-Barons, Emperors &amp; peons, where swords are used, atomics are House heirlooms and huge spaceships depend on the psychic power of their Navigators.It's crazy, it's clever, it's captivating - his use of economics and arcology, his prescience regarding terraforming, the shaping effects of ecology and terrain on peoples and cultures, his synthesis &amp; evolutions of religions - all of this is blinding and really, really makes your imagination soar. Compare it to most standard current sci-fi novels and settings they describe (even pre-made ones like the Star Wars series) and it's frankly pitiful, the paucity of imagination with over-elaboration they display. Compare and contrast if you will with the recent prequels to Dune....oh dear.And yet, yet....it's is sometimes overly pompous, sometimes overly obtuse and sometimes in the later novels it frankly seems the Frank-ly decided to stick in a escape hatch from a story-line when it got too bogged down and ran into the mud that was once the sands of Arrakis."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"...The Duke Atreides is given control of the planet Arrakis by the Emperor. Arrakis, also known as \\"Dune\\", is the only known planet to locate the most precious substance in the universe, the spice. The spice controls everything. It prolongs life, permits space travel, and is also an extremely addictive drug. The Duke's son, Paul, and his wife, Jessica, must secure the planet Arrakis and restore control as orders by the Emperor. Their greatest enemy, the Harkonnen, threaten to retake control of the planet after holding it for 80 years. The Harkonnen try everything from assassination to invasion secretly backed up by two legions of the emperor's own elite troops, the Sadukar. Paul and his mother are forced to flee their home and their only hope lies in the Fremen, an extremely rugged desert people.The characters in this story were absolutely amazing. Each one had is own personality, habits, and ways of doing things. They sounded like they didn't even come from the same author. They were very believable and make this futuristic sci fi story even more fascinating. Throughout the book you really see the main character evolve and change as the story progresses. He changes from an intelligent young boy nervous on a new planet to an extremely disciplined brilliant man. All the characters are extraordinarily well woven into this complex sometimes confusing story. Even the Mentats, human computer like minds, have a whole different view on things. Everyone seems like a real possible person put into those circumstances.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes long, complicated books. This book really makes you think about everything. Most of the concepts in the book were very interesting. This book almost needs to be read several times."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is, right off the bat, amazing...its a world so amazingly put together, that it just attests to Frank Herbert's genius...the only world created in depth as well as Dune's is Tolkien's Lord of the Ringsstill, being 14 when i read it, i got lost sometimes, and had a hard time understanding the actual writing of Herbert's, not the story itself...though i managed to figure it out, Herbert could have written it simpler, but i prefer to instead recognize it as great literature that i was just too young to understandon that note of literature, this and (again) Lord of the Rings are in my view, two of the very few sci-fi/fantasy books that can be accepted as literature...i doubt i could look my honors english teacher in the eye and call a book like Sheffield's Aftermath, or Hubbard's Battlefield Earth literature...Dune IS literature, and excellent literature at that...though it has a great number of sequels (im still dragging my way through Dune Messiah), Dune can easily stand on its own as a single novel, one that i suggest for anyone to read, SF fan or notPaul Muad'Dib is a great, true character...like a real person, he doubts himself and thinks about problems that a real person would think about...he second guesses himself and hates what he has to do at times..just like in real life, which i think is great writing on Herbert's partthe society Herbert created is genius...with the spice melange, the fremen way of life, and the sandworms, which i have a strange interest in, and love any mention of them...the Bene Gesserit is a stroke of genius and the mind capabilities of Herbert's characters make the society...just well, amazingas read in the beginning of the second book, there also exists Bene Tleilaxu, another genius creation of Herbert'sDune is, by itself, one of the best books i have read (albeit a small list, but i plan on adding to it)...i doubt my praise is needed, as writers like Arthur C. Clarke have given Dune their seal of approval....still, i just wanted to throw it in, because i think no matter how many times its been praised, if it is really worth it, then it will continue to get praise...so here is my small piece of praise for one of the classics"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune. The original. Much has been said about it, most good and deservedly so. Some have called it the best Science Fiction book of all time. I'm inclined to agree. Herbert has actually created a world with different cultures and religions and ways of life. The characters are well drawn, if a little cold. But that's the way of the world in which they live. In which Houses come before love and people seldom matter, except to a few. However, as usual, the good guys are easily identified, as are the bad.The world of Dune has a life of it's on, one that seems seperate from the rest of the known universe. The Fremen are one of the most remarkable culture of people ever put to page and one of the most fascinating. You are drawn into Paul's story and his destiny, of which these desert dwellers are a part. The other characters are great as well. Just can't get enough of Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck. And Duke Leto is about a noble a character as you can get.I was introduced to Dune by the mini series and the prequel novels by Kevin J. Anderson and Brian Herbert, all of which were vastly entertaining, but this book is easily levels above those works.I really don't have a lot to add to what has already been said, but to encourage you to believe the legend. Dune is THAT good."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"But of course you have heard that this book is one of the greatest novels are imagined. The truth is...it probably is one of the greatest novels are created in the twentieth century. Only a few authors come to mind that could create their own worlds so stunningly, namely J.R.R Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, etc.The story basically revolves around the boy Paul Atreides and his fight to achieve revenge for his father, Leto I. Not only does his retribution include the despised Harkonnens, but also the Imperial family, the Corrinos. The intricate plot line is further convoluted by the introduction of the principles of the major political parties in the story. The Bene Gesserit, the Spacing Guild, etc. all have their own motives to secure a stake in the plantet of Arrakis. The Fremen are another interesting group of people that have an elaborate cultural identity finely honed by their oppressive enviroment. These are fierce warriors and stand up to the best soldiers in the galaxy. Paul and his mother Jessica's introduction to them only go to make them a stronger race of people. As loyalties change and the numerous characters are introduced it seems as though the plot line has too many tangents, but somehow Herbert deftly maneuvers them into an outstanding conclusion. The novel is brillant in its complexity. The only other book to my limited knowledge that emerges so adroitly is the classic Lord of the Rings.Herbert is a very skilled and imaginative writer, his writing style, while complex, enraptures the reader and makes the book pass with relative ease. His scenic descriptions are excellent and his characterizations are no less than incredible. Everything about this book rings classic, something no one should miss out on. Excellent read, superb."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is an intricate and complex story. I read the book several times, and kept learning about it each time. The only drawbacks that it had to my mind is the overly complex vocabulary and how quickly it leaps into the story without giving the reader enough reference points: you are lost a little bit at the beginning. I would not recommend the other books of the original six. The one exception being Heretics of Dune, which grabbed me by the collar and I could not put it down. Chapterhouse Dune, to me at the time I read it, completely undid everything that Heretics of Dune accomplished. So I truly recommend nothing more by this author, though I add the disclaimer that I was a passionate teenager when I read them, and perhaps if I had read them at a different time in my life, I would not have been so offended. Dune is definitely the most complex of the original books. I have no insight into the Dune books written by Brian Herbert/this is for the original books alone."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"In fact, I would consider Dune Messiah to be better than the original Dune. Dune is a masterpiece, don't misunderstand, but Messiah goes much deeper. Dune was about Paul, rising to become the leader of the Fremen, and focused on his power and prescience. In Messiah, we find out that prescience is not a gift, and is much more a curse. Paul Muad'dib goes through many trials in this book, but the recurring theme is how his prescience warps him to become less of a God, and more of a man. Paul was not perfect, as we find out, and while the book is more philosophical than action-packed, it is a much better experience. Many say that because it is not like Dune, it is not good. The good in this book is hidden. The conspiracy to kill Paul, the hidden intentions of Reverend Mother Mohiam, Paul's mind, Alia's abrasiveness, Hayt's true purpose, the list goes on. To understand these things is to understand the entire Dune series, and to say that this book is not as good as Dune is to admit that you didn't understand Messiah for what it was."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I loved this book. I liked how Mr. Herbert described various objects and habitats. The characterization is phenominal. This IS one of the best books ever.What happens in the beginning of the book is a whole story of it's own so I won't reveal too much for those who haven't read the book.The main character is a fifteen year old boy named Paul Atreides. His father, the Duke Leto Atreidies is forced to move from the planet Caladan (A planet that is rich with water and forests.) to Arrakis AKA Dune. Dune is a harsh desert world were water is scarce and food is even scarcer. The thing that the planet is best known for is the spice Melange. Melange is used for food, drugs, and many other things. Melange helps people see into the future, Starship pilots use it to pilot better. There are a few people who can have special powers by using it. Paul is one those, he is also the only male. The natives also beleive that he is their Messiah and that he will lead them to freedom.Dune intertwines politics, religion, geology, action, and adventure all into one story. I love this book and I give it a *marks a five into Paul-Muad'Dib's stillsuit&quot; FIVE!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Then these are truly the ones.They are not fiction, they are an education. This first book is an amazing introduction to Dune, the planet Frank Herbert created with his own bare hands. Frank Herbert, just for creating this world so imaginatively and vividly, deserves godly status,for he is truly a genius unlike myself.I have never read such an enchanting, amazing, horrifying, insight into our world around us and our religions and societies, yet this book really does teach everything whilst telling the most enriched story at the same time.Whether you read between the lines or accept the text literally there is pure delight and contentment in reading it. The Bene Gesserit are most fascinating, intellectually supreme, devine genetically engineered beings. They show you something beyond your reach that makes you want to be like them, wise and spiritual.Paul Atreides is an amazing character to follow and I recommend that you MUST read the following books in the series and they only get more and more amazing and above beyond where the wildest imagination can take you.You live Dune. An amazing literary works that really does describe everything, putting you there watching everything happen as if it were there in front of you, although you would still not get the insight if you were there- as you could not perceive the situations on such a vast scale!I only wish I had a wide enough vocabulary to fully express the true pleasure I enjoyed while reading this book and if you pass by the opportunity of reading it you are missing one of the greatest experiences of your life."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Herbert's classic masterpiece &quot;Dune&quot; expertly interweaves a science fiction future world with socio-political and religious theory to construct a compelling, although sometimes confusing, novel. The telling of the transformation of Paul Atriedes from young, innocent ducal heir to the Kwisatz Haderach is engaging and at the same time, disturbing. We see him both prepare for and fear the on-coming storm of the Muad'Dib jihad across the universe. Taken by itself, this story seems lacking at the end, but it must be read in concert with &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; and &quot;Children of Dune&quot; to fully appreciate Herbert's efforts."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune deserves every bit of its acclaim. This is what science fiction should be. It is hard to fathom the level of creativity needed to create this book, much less the series. Herbert successfully created another galaxy within the pages of these books.I first read Dune (and the rest of the series) in middle school. Years later, half remembering the story, I read it again. This is one of the few books that I have read twice and gained more than just academic insight. Dune breathes wonder and emotion.If you have never read Dune, read it. If you have read Dune, read it again."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book was the greatest most intricate novel I have ever read. Save &quot;The Lord of The Rings&quot;. The book was not an overnight job. It had Tons of info to back up every event in the book. It is a whole world with a long history and a reason for every event. It shows what good and bad things can come from ultimate power. The Long animosity between House Aterdies and House Harkonnen came to a climax in the Harkonnen attack on the Atredies. Paul survives by falling in league with the fremen and comes back to defeat the Harkonnens and the Padish Emperor."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I rate this book (but not the sequel ! ) among the best SF I've ever red, along with Asimov's Foundation, Brin's Uplift series and Vernor Vinge. Although the author borrow some nuances from middle east culture/language into this book, but he had successfully using it to create his own believable fantasy world. The result is a live description and narative about the Arakis desert, the Fremen people or even the giant sand worm. The action is not a fast-pace one, but I don't think it is the main factor to judge a good SF book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I don't think I need to say much. I've read most of the best books sci-fi and fantasy have produced, and I would say Dune is to SF what The Lord of the Rings is to fantasy. Simply incomparable. I just wish high school English teachers would take it up as a subject of study in lit classes. It would be a hell of a lot more interesting than To Kill A Mockingbird."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The real reason that I decided to read this long and detailed book is because a guy I know is a complete Dune fanatic and I wanted to see what it is all about.This book is for two types of readers: the ones who like epic adventures, struggling against evil powers and the roughness of nature, and the ones who enjoy books on detailed insights to the human mind, human instincts, and most of all --ecology.Dune is a desert planet with absolutely no water except for some that the locals, Fremen, carry around with them. Paul Atredes is the main character whose goal is to make this planet a paradise world --like earth. However, there's many obsticles that must be passed to begin this plan.That is the basic rundown of the book but there's a whole lot more than that.Dune won't appeal to everyone, but its a nice one to try if you have the time."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Oh my goodness! That book is so amazing. You have to read it to belive it. I was introduced to Dune through the movie, which is also really interesting. (If your looking for a really different movie to watch go for Dune. It gives you really great pictures to think about when your reading the book) Wow! The book was so cool. Yes it was a little hard to understand, and yes it didn't explain everything that happed in the book in perfect detail. BUT that leaves more up to your imagination. As other reviews have stated you can't say nearly enough good things about this book, but maybe the sheer number of reviews should tell you something about how great this book is. If you have never thought of yourself as the kind of person to read SF, but you've decided to give it a try Dune is a great book to start with. It gave you a great view of religion, politics, and the depths of the human condition. I loved it. Hopefully you will/do to."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Having put off reading Frank Herbert's tome for some time, I was thrilled to find it worthy of all the critical acclaim it's received. It's clear that Herbert's confection of religion, politics and ecology played an important role in the development of another well-done science fiction enterprise---Babylon 5."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Although Dune Messiah undoubtedly did not turn out as good as Dune, it was a good read. Granted, it had less action, but I am certain that anyone who is vaguely interested in SF, philosophy, or realistic atmospheres and characters could pull through this book, which is less than 300 pages long anyway. Some people closed the book feeling unsatisfied, but I didn't; the ending was, I thought, very fitting. It was also, as mentioned in one of the previous reviews, better than a &quot;happy&quot; ending. I thought I fully expected to be disappointed and to feel very gloomy after reading this book, but I loved it, and it deserves more credit than it has gotten. It you have read this whole blurb, you have been a brave person. ; )"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I know you've heard this before, but Dune is the best science fiction book of all time. The first time I read it, it was difficult to read, yet well worth the effort. The size of the glossary at the back of the book may scare off some readers, but how can you truly portray a galactic empire thousands of years in the future without such complexity? The characters are still recognizably human, given that their societies are so different from ours. We can still relate to them, even if one is on the edge of becoming a &quot;messiah&quot;. Herbert incorporates religious and political (and even ecological) issues in his works which many SF writers dissmissively ignore. Once you've read this, you'll probably enjoy the rest of the series. About the movie: I'm willing to forgive David Lynch for a lot, simply because the movie exists. He had most of the plot elements, and most of the characters were done well (I don't like his version of the Baron). The movie was sadly incomprehensible to most who hadn't read the book, and fans of the book were overly critical of the movie."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The late, great, Frank Herber's \\"Dune\\" is a classic in the true sense of the word. I've read many wonderful novels (2001, Stranger in a Strange Land, Foundation, Hyperion, Ender's Game, etc, etc.--classics all) that will stay with me for life, but none \`wormed' its way in so deeply as \\"Dune\\". Herbert's masterpiece works on so many different levels, it would take another novel just to describe the depth.I won't lie to anyone, when I first picked up this novel many, many years ago and took a look at the dictionary, I began to wonder what I got myself into. This isn't a \`light' read. However, Herbert hooked me on the first page and never let go. For me personally, this novel had everything a great classic should have, including stunningly rich, vibrant characters (something most sci-fi novels grievously lack). Granted, there are many that may not like this novel as much as I do, but I believe \\"Dune\\" is the standard by which all science fiction novels should be judged, and the goal all authors should try to attain--a quite daunting task, I might add.After many years (and a few failed attempts), \\"Dune\\" was made into a movie. Now I know that most people didn't like the movie (me included), but let's be fair. How does anyone make a successful movie of a novel that has so many intricate layers? While I thought the casting was first-rate and the costumes authentic, the task before them was monumental (and, alas, the special effects were \`cheesy' at best). The movie tried desperately to be true to Herbert's vision, but it just cannot be done, and probably should never have been attempted.Between 1 and 10, \\"Dune\\" gets a solid 10. This is the only 10 I have given any novel, because no novel I have yet read matches the artistic depth and richness of Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\"."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a complex and fascinating novel. At first glance, itseems to be simply a very imaginative adventure story - andit's a great read even if that's all you ever get out of it.However, Dune is much more than just an adventure. It's ananalogy - from a writer who was very concerned withecological issues - for societal over-dependence on a singlesubstance and the ways such dependence skews the structureand character of that society. Further, the book itself, andthe Dune series especially, devotes considerable attentionto exploring the messianic dilemma. As you venture throughthe six-book series, this theme becomes a central issue, theseeds of which, naturally, are sown by Paul Muad'Dib on Dune.These are the levels upon which Dune can be read that occurafter only a few readings of the book. Dune is one ofthose rare reading experiences that improves each time youreturn to it. Every subsequent journey - as it can only becalled - through the Universe that includes Arrakis, Dune,desert planet, yeilds a richer, more satisfying experience.Dune, simply put, is the premier example of the speculativefiction genre."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"After reading the Kindle sample of this book, I have to agree with the many critical reviews of this edition. This is not a review of the writing, which is excellent, but of this electronic edition of the title.Aside from the fact that $15 for the electronic edition of a book that is over 40 years old and has already been widely published as a mass market paperback for for half the price is obscene, the quality of this Kindle edition is so horrible I would not want it if it was free. DUNE is one of the great classics of scifi literature but this ebook is an embarrassment to both the publisher and the author and I would urge anyone interested in reading this book to pass on this edition. Instead, find any one of the cheap tens of thousands of used copies that are easily available of this title."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When I got this book, I was thrilled. My father said this book was great. My teacher said this book is great. So, of course I decided to check it out. I read part of the Lord of the Rings and the first chapter just drags on and on. Dune however got exiting on, say page 7, with the Gom Jabbar. I was captivated with the world of Arrakis from the rolling dunes to the leviathans of the sand, the worms. This is a classic story of a boy's journey to manhood. Overall I'd give this book a 5 out of 5"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is one of those rare books that changes every time I re-read it. Perhaps the most interesting thing about it is that it takes place in a futuristic, sci fi setting but involves no computers. Although the underlying meanings and political subtelties went over my head the first time I read this, Paul's basic revenge story was more than enough to keep me occupied. The characters (particularly the Baron and the Bene Gesserit) were memorable and uniquely original.The heroes (with one or two exceptions) are not genetically or accidentally gifted with thier powers. They grow slowly, out of painful and careful work and sacrifice, making them both undeniably human and strikeingly different from most other heroes in other sci fi books.A classic."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"There are two types of Dune fans. That is because the original book is written in two halves; the first half is pure political intrigue and world-building and action and conspiracy. The second half is more about Dune itself, its culture, its conditions, and ideas about religion, prescience and godhood.If you are looking for a book in the vein of the first half of \\"Dune\\", you will be disappointed. Yes, there is a conspiracy, and intrigue, but it is subtle, complicated and philosophical. No one is slipping poisons in drinks and stabbing people in the dark.On the other hand, what this book does have a good deal of is unique ideas, and interesting things to say about Paul Atreides, who really gets fleshed out as a character here. Major props to Herbert for making a god-like character, who should by all rights be incredibly boring as he steamrolls his enemies with ease, into a very compelling, even tragic figure, in the grip of his own powers, unable to escape the future he's seen himself in. Other interesting ideas abound. The conspirators weapon to destroy Paul is.... a ghola (basically a clone) of Duncan Idaho, one of Paul's good friends and blade instructor from the last book, where he died bravely but unceremoniously. Here, he's the most interesting character in the book. And how is he a weapon to destroy Paul? Thats one of the more satisfying things about the book, the way subtle ideas become weapons and words and visions have power.Expect a dark tale of a man, who upon reaching godhood, is nearly destroyed by the forces he generates. And a lot of interesting ideas with it.Even more interesting is the reason why Paul walks out into the desert at the end, but thats only revealed (and only implicitly) in the next book, which I also recommend."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I am not making a comment on the story, but if you love this book and you're thinking of buying it, don't get this edition. The book is not very sturdy and is poorly bound. Let's face it, it's a big book! And it needs to be well made so that the binding doesn't break halfway through the book. :("},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When I started reading this book, mostly because I wanted to have read the book before I saw the miniseries that my dad had bought on DVD, I was a bit discouraged by the size of the book. The edition I had, which had photos from the 1984 movie on the back, was over 600 pages, which seemed pretty darn long. However, I devoured the book in three days--and then, what do you know, I read it all over again. Then I read the sequels, and watched all the movies, and read the prequels, and in short became a huge fan.Don't be discouraged by the length. You'll quickly forget that you're reading a book to rival Harry Potter once you start reading. The characters are complex and the envisioned world is mind-boggling. Don't watch any of the movies first, because they kind of ruin it. Between the adaptions, I liked the miniseries more because the architecture was less depressing.Lord of the Rings? Practically pulp fiction compared to this!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Wonderful book. It's hard to know what to say about a title like this that's been reviewed by so many people, but we're all suppose to have a voice here. I might as well add mine. I loved this book. It's particularly amazing for me to imagine that this was written years ago, before so much of the sci-fi we've gotten used to ever existed. Perhaps Herbert is part of why what's come since was even imaginable. To think that this had trouble finding a publisher! I'm sure the reason for that is that it's so unique, so individually unusual, so speculatively imaginative. I don't think anyone should judge this series on either of the movies that have been made from it. They both pale in comparison to the original. I guess, frankly, that Herbert's work triumphs purely because he's a genious who found his way of leaving a legacy on the world. Read and enjoy this book. It's a ride like none other, and it'll leave you thinking."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"As well as being one of the best selling science fiction novels of all time, Dune is arguably the best science fiction novel ever written. Certainly, the planet Dune is the most fascinating planet I've ever seen created in a science fiction novel.Set 8,000 years in the future, Dune tells the story of the planet Arrakis (known as Dune to its inhabitants). Arrakis is unique in the known universe. It is a planet covered by vast desert terrain and is one of the harshest environments ever encountered by man. Strange creatures inhabit the desert, the most unique being the giant sandworms that live beneath the sand and viciously guard the deposits of Melange on the planet's surface. Melange is a spice, found only on Arrakis, that has many special properties. Extremely addictive, it prolongs the life of those who consume it regularly. It is also used by navigators of the spacing guild to allow them to \\"see the future\\" and thereby plot a safe passage through \\"foldspace\\" to enable huge starships to traverse the heavens. Without Melange, the galaxy would have no space travel and would fall back into a barbaric existence.The Emperor Shaddam IV rules the Galactic Empire. Controlling an empire of one million inhabited worlds, Shaddam must keep peace between the Great Houses (ruling families) of the galaxy. The currency of the empire is Melange since it is so vital to space travel. Shaddam has allowed the Harkonnens (one of the Great Houses) to rule over Arrakis for the past 80 years. Their only mission has been to ensure a steady flow of Melange to the Empire and the spacing guild. Without the spice, the Empire would surely crumble as space travel ground to a halt and millions of people addicted to Melange died.A secretive society of women called the Bene Gesserit, also use Melange to allow their \\"reverend mothers\\" to see into the future. However, only females have been able to use the Melange to achieve this forecasting ability. For some reason, there are pieces of the future that women are unable to look into. Therefore, the Bene Gesserit have spent centuries working on a genetic breeding program whose aim is to produce the \\" Kwisatz Haderach\\". The Kwisatz Haderach (or messiah) would be a male Bene Gesserit whose mental powers would be able to bridge space and time and avoid the limitations suffered by the female Bene Gesserit.As the story begins, control of Arrakis is being handed over to House Atreides, the bitter enemies of the Harkonnens. Paul Atreides, the son of Duke Leto Atreides, is supposed to be one generation removed from the Kwisatz Haderach. However, his mother Jessica (a Bene Gesserit) has hopes for him to become the long sought after messiah. But first, House Atreides must fend off the evil machinations of the Harkonnens and enlist the help of the mysterious Fremen (native inhabitants of Dune). Failure to do so will certainly result in the ultimate destruction of House Atreides.Herbert's story is very engaging. He plumbs the depths of political intrigue in a society that while advanced, manages to get along quite well without computers. The infighting amongst the Emperor and the Great Houses is reminiscent of medieval Europe and makes for a very interesting plot. However, the most fascinating parts of the book revolve around the ecology of the planet Arrakis and the struggles of the Fremen to exist in such a harsh environment. As you would expect, moisture is very precious on a desert planet and Herbert was very inventive in the devices and behaviors he created for the Fremen to conserve the body's precious water. I've read this book at least many times and I enjoy it more each time I read it.Herbert wrote five sequels to Dune. Alas, they are all seriously inferior to the original novel. But nevertheless, Dune is a must read for all science fiction fans."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"but strangely short--given the first book's gargantuan size. The book also seems as tho' it didn't have Herbert's full attention. He seemed tacitly to admit this once when he said that &quot;parts of Children of Dune were written before Dune was finished.&quot; It also suffers from the fact that it was first serialized in a SF magazine. It seems as tho' it were &quot;remixed&quot; after the fact.Although Herbert continues to use the Prophet Mohammad's life as a scaffolding for his story, he departs widely from the Koran's account while still retaining an essentially Arab flavor to the story. (These books are, by the way, incredibly popular in the Muslim world.)Those minor criticims aside, the story continues towards its headlong conclusion in the Golden Path. To say much more would spoil it for the uninitiated. If you liked Dune, read this one just to get to &quot;Children&quot; and, the piece de resistance, &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot; where Herbert's mastery becomes complete and the Golden Path is revealed to us in all its terrible majesty.The last two books before cancer and grief killed him were almost after thoughts. After Leto II, what was there to say?"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is one of the deepest science fiction books of its time, you'd never really guess that it was written about 50 years ago. It tells of a boy named Paul who is destined to become the religious leader of the Fremen, the native dwellers of Arrakis. The politics and religious aspect in Dune are very well balanced and the characters are quite realistic for a sci-fi. If you're into sci-fi or not, you really should read this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Anyone who read Dune prior to the early 1990s will see that Frank Herbert had an excellent grasp of the politics of petroleum. Anyone reading the book after Desert Storm will probably get the creeps. If you read the author's preface to the short story collection Eye, you can see that Herbert was interested in describing the interworkings of business and politics, as well as the effect of \\"hydraulic despotism.\\" (Hydraulic despotism, by the way, is what happens when an area is dependent upon one stream of water for the basics of life and somebody upstream attempts to dam it to gain control over the people downstream, exactly what happened in the 1973-74 oil shocks and in Desert Shield/Storm.) That's just the politics of it.Herbert also examined the role of religion in politics, and thus we have the Fremen, a \\"Zensunni\\" group of fanatic beliefs (Ascetic Buddhism combined with Islam), made ferocious by their efforts to survive the desert landscape of Arrakis, the planet known as \\"Dune.\\" Herbert creates or extrapolates some really remarkable technologies for drawing or retaining moisture from the desert air.What really grabbed me about Dune, though, was the first third of the book, when we observe the society of the Great Houses of his futuristic Galactic Empire. For as much as the David Lynch film was panned by the critics, the movie got the \\"look\\" of this society dead right. It is a form of straightforward feudalism, with the primary spoils and properties being planets, commodities, and shares in the overarching Imperial corporation, CHOAM (Combine Honnette Ober Advancer Mercantiles, if that helps you any). The feudal arrangements of the Empire are complex and fascinating. The Imperial House rules by fear (Herbert's version of Stormtroopers or the Praetorian Guard, the Saudaukar), and the Great Houses of the Landsraad (legislature) fight amongst themselves for the scraps that remain. The opening story is a fight between two of these Great Houses, House Atreides and House Harkonnen. They war openly and by stealth, using blatant and subtle means of inflicting damage. A \\"Medici\\" look is entirely appropriate to their world.Into this mix, Herbert also included the Bene Tleilax, a totally amoral technocracy focusing upon genetic engineering. The people of Ix are likewise technocrats, but focus upon standard machinery. Technology is slowly developed and unobtrusive. Instead of computers, there are humans trained as \\"mentats;\\" instead of disks or magnetic tapes, there are \\"scrolls\\" or \\"cielagos\\" (coded data transcribed into and relayed by a human or animal). There are also the Bene Gesserit, a group of women similar to Catholic nuns in their appearance and behavior. They endeavor to manipulate bloodlines in order to improve the human species. They wish to create the \\"kwisatz haderach,\\" a man with the powers of a Bene Gesserit (contacting the memories of female ancestors, ability to transmute poisons, yoga-type mental and muscular disciplines).Does all this sound incredibly complex and heavy? It is. That is part of what makes the book fascinating and difficult to read. Herbert has gone to the trouble to create an entire world, recognizably human, brutal, and unlikable at times, but very convincing and well-thought-out. As a story, all of this must be explained while the plot advances forward. This Herbert manages to do, as well as insert a great deal of philosophical and political thought. This is one of the best-wrought works in the science fiction canon. Alas, it can almost be too hard to read. Go forth bravely, and you will be rewarded."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"My Uncle is the one who encouraged me to first read Dune. Ever since I can remember, my Science Fiction-loving uncle always favored Dune. I picked it up and I will admit it was quite hard to get into at first, but I stuck with it and am glad I did.This book introduces interestingly imaginitive characters and tosses them into a wonderfully intricate world. Not only did Frank Herbert create a world, but he provided histories, legends, cultures, ecology, and even prophecy in order to bring this world alive.The world of Arrakis is one of the most exciting ones I've ever read about. The Fremen culture is so cool. They fight with unmatched fury, they know secret legends and ways to live in the desert, and yes, they even lure out the giant (and feared) sandworms to the surface and ride them across the desert.The universe created by Herbert is awesome. It is a future where, although there is technology, the weaponry is swords and daggers. Only one group of people have the means of interstellar travel, and they have a monopoly. And everything depends on the only important thing of Arrakis, the spice.I've heard this book compared to Lord of the Rings, and I agree that this is a likely comparison. I highly recommend Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"On the desert world of Arrakis a boy will become a man. This book is his trials and his initiation into the harsh reality he has been planted in. Treason, warfare, and entangling alliances abound in this world where values vary and trust can kill you.Frank Herbert writes with a feeling of conviction rarely seen elsewhere. He creates in the pages of this beautifully structured novel a sense of the dignity of the human race and how a few can bring down an empire. It is a wonder to read such a book where there is no chance action, no word without another meaning. While some books would leave someone feeling empty and disappointed this book fills its readers with satisfaction and provides a breathtaking new world where our morals seem obsolete and our lives soft and weak. The society we are plunged into is a shock to the senses in its harsh beauty. The Fremen are humanity boiled down to its barest essence. In a land where one wrong move could kill they prove remarkable in their visionary approach to life.This view of the smallest minutinae of the human soul is set on a backdrop of interstellar politics and a bitter struggle for rivalry between two Great Houses. While this book is sometimes shocking in its brutal approach to life, there is no doubt as to its truths. Dune is an excellent read if you are up to the challenge."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"DUNE is, simply put, a masterpiece. It's also a legend with spawned a movie and two TV miniseries which are nearly as famous as the novel. Frank Herbert's science fiction/fantasy tale centers around Paul Atreides, a young man who has recently moved to the planet Arrakis, better known as Dune, sometime in the far future. Paul is the son of a duke, and after the duke is murdered in a raid by the evil Harkonnen family, Paul and his mother journey in to the desert. From there, a prophecy shall be fulfilled and life as Herbert's characters know it, will change dramatically.Never have I read a book as realistic as Dune. It plays out almost like a historical fiction. The characters are so real, with so much emotion, you can't help but believe these people may one day truly exist.The story, which took in the first Nebula award, is complicated and may throw off some readers. Indeed, the book itself may prove to be a challenge to many readers. Unfortunately many will put down the book after the first about 100 pages, during which it is somewhat uninteresting. But, if you should make it past those pages, you'll find one of the most interesting and life-like masterpieces of our time."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune Messiah, the follow-up to Dune takes place 12 years after the end of the first book. Paul is now emperor and is finding that the real challenge is not gaining an empire, but ruling it. He has become cynical and disillusioned, as plots against him abound and the jihad continues.Although Dune Messiah is an enjoyable sequel it lacks the sweep and grandeur of Dune, while keeping its complexity. In Dune Messiah the complexity is the result of Herbert just not fleshing out the story enough. I've read the novel twice and I still don't understand exactly the nature of the conspiracy against Paul. Why the stoneburner if Duncan Idaho was programmed to kill Paul. Why did Paul feel that Chani's death was necessary? What was the point of the dwarf? It seemed as if Herbert had more in mind than he put on paper, and the reader is left to fill in the blanks."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It's been 20 years since I read Dune Messiah and I just finished re-reading it ten minutes ago. I enjoyed it much more now than I did back years ago. Although like other reviews have stated it can be somewhat philosophically verbose and repetitive, and does have a tendency, for me at least, to take away from the characters at times. Paul and Alia are caught in their heads too much with the same philosophical rantings. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy philosophy in its myriad forms, but Frank Herbert does have a habit of being a tiny bit repetitive with the same point, but that's Herbert' view and way of writing and I respect that. I do enjoy reading him.Another point is, I believe, that you have to be in a specific mood to read Dune, but especially Dune Messiah and the rest that follow. It does at times require a herculean effort to continue, to wade through long passages internal; so if the mood strikes Dune Messiah must not be missed.Easily 5 stars for a masterwork. Now I'm ready for Children of Dune!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It's been a good 20 years since I've read Dune. I've been introducing my 10-year old to science fiction and thought I'd see if he was ready for Herbert's classic. I'd forgotten the intensity of the story-telling. Herbert's language is big and bold and you get a sense of the poetry his son writes that Frank H. used when crafting this SciFi classic. There is no levity in the story. All aspects of the plot are deep and weighty and dramatic.I found myself realizing how the core plot can be found in many an epic tale - Kings and Queens battling over power and treasure. The setting is science fiction, but there's a significant fantasy component baked into the prophetic and magical powers of the two lead characters: Paul and his mother Jessica.This story is placed in a space-traveling future on a planet called Dune...as desolate, dry and remote as the name sounds. The Atreides family is in a generations-long battle with the Harkonnen family. Both are embroiled in the treacherous manipulations of the Imperial Emperor, the all-female religion-building Bene Gesserit, and the space traveling monopoly holding Guild.Herbert has built an imaginative, vast and realistic Universe. It's clear from this debut novel in a series whose publications stretch over 40 years, that Herbert put a tremendous amount of thought and effort into layering on the flesh of his world's history, past, and future. And all aspects are based in bits and pieces of our own histories, religions and cultures. And this doesn't even cover the very clear and obvious ecological message wrapped around the true central figure of the book - Planet Dune. The metaphysical philosophizing works well within the royal dramas and intrigues.This edition contains an afterward written by Herbert's son Brian who's carried on the Dune tradition with a series of books published over the last several years placed in the Dune universe along various timelines relative to Dune.Stay away from the movies, but absolutely jump (back) into this book. At about 500 pages, it's still a fast and exciting read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune Messiah is overall a decent book. It concludes the story of Paul Atreides and the implications of becoming a God/Emperor. However, I felt like some of the philosophical aspects of the book were overdone. Although I appreciate an intellectual book, it felt like Herbert kept trying to drive the same point over and over at times, and it was not necessary. Also, I felt like the tragedy of some of the moments of the book were lost on me because of all the moments spent on philosophical musings and not on the \\"real\\" events. However, Herbert's writing is still moving and he has a great talent for creating an amazing world and a good plot."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is the best SCI FI book ever. if you are a SCIFI fan get this book. also note that there is 2 movies based on the book i have never seen the original but i have the one form scifi channel and is great."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Seriously, this is so well read, I would pay 20 bucks just to go to a theatre and listen to it on speakers if it were the only way I could have access to this recording. Thankfully, I don't have to. Just buy it. No possible chance of regret here. No way."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I like the direction Frank Herbert took the Dune series in his first two sequels. This book has a bit more development than the original Dune. We get to learn more about the inner turmoil of Paul, Alia, and then meet the kids. Frank has a way of creating politically exciting twists and power struggles, without making any one character the villain. Paul and Alia in their own ways are both despots and victims. In terms of storyline, I think this brings the story to a satisfying conclusion (I'm not so big a fan of what happens afterChildren of Dune (Dune Chronicles, Book 3)).Frank's writing style can be a bit dense. Sometimes the dialogue is filled with philosophical or nonsensical musings. Some of it is quite deep - but certainly not how people actually talk. It takes some getting used to. I'd recommend only continuing on to this book if you got through the original Dune and liked it.If you liked the books, I highly recommendFrank Herbert's Children of Dune (Sci-Fi TV Miniseries) (Two-Disc DVD Set)- it's a pretty good film adaptation ofDune Messiah (Dune Chronicles)andChildren of Dune (Dune Chronicles, Book 3)."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I read this book twenty years ago and bought it again to try to remember if I had liked it or not. I may not have appreciated it then, but I really enjoyed it this time. The story is an epic one, set on an intricately-designed desert planet with a variety of cultures and individuals scheming for political power. At the heart is a tale of a reluctant messianic figure who experiences tragedy and tries to find a way to rise again that will not cause his followers to doom the universe. Herbert plays up the epic nature well, by starting each new section with a quote from some fictional chronicle of these events. The effect does take out all tension of whether or not Paul (the messianic figure) will live or die, but the benefit of knowing that these events are Historical and Significant far outweighs the lack of tension.I imagine that the frequent references to jihad will offend many modern readers, as will the mingling of quotations from the Torah and the Koran without any reference to a supernatural God (in fact, I have been surprised to see this book described as a religious work, since there are numerous ceremonies and scriptures but no real concept of a supernatural force of any kind, and the salvation that Paul is expected to bring is an ecological and philosophical one). I also think the ecological significance of this book has changed a bit since its 1965 publication (I don't know that many environmentalists today are looking to convert deserts into rainforests, although the end of the book does point to a certain restraint and respect for systems that soften the thrust a bit).For me, though, the best part of the book is the way that some of the characters are gifted at translating conversations and reading body language. There is a particularly good scene at a dinner party when no one really means what he says, and the more astute characters observe and tell the reader what each exchange really means. It changed the way I listened to group conversations for a while, honestly, and made me think a lot about the layers of meaning I hide in my own speech. I have no plans to finish this series, as I'm quite satisfied with the state of things as Herbert left them at the end of this book, but I recommend this to anyone interested in science fiction and fantasy, especially those looking for something to compare favorably with the Lord of the Rings and Wheel of Time classics."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I like books for different reasons - characters, writing style, exciting plot. I will remember \\"Dune\\" for its remarkable world-building.Dune (or Arrakis) is a desert planet. It is barren, almost waterless, and it is the only source of melange - a spice with unique geriatric qualities - it extends lives, enhances mental abilities, and is necessary for space travel. Dune is at the center of an Imperial scheme to bring down the influential House of Atreides led by Duke Leto Atreides. The plan is to give Leto the rights to extract spice on Dune, the rights that previously belonged to Atreides' century-long enemy - House of Harkonnen with Baron Vladimir Harkonnen as its head. The feud between the Houses is later used as a cover-up for the extermination of the House of Atreides. This plan however has a flaw, as it doesn't take into consideration that Leto Atreides's 15-year old son Paul is not an ordinary child, but the end product of a long-term genetic experiment designed to breed a super human. It's Paul's destiny to give Dune back to its native people - Fremen and to upset the power balance in the Universe.Having finished \\"Dune,\\" I now understand why this book is considered to be for science fiction what \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is for fantasy - basically, it's a standard all other works in the genre are compared against.The world of Dune has an unprecedented depth to it. Herbert creates an entire culture built around the world that simply has not enough water. This planetary condition affects Fremen tremendously - they constantly wear stillsuits that are designed to conserve and recycle bodies' water emissions, dead bodies are processed to extract water, the population is controlled to accommodate the a total amount of water available. I found this world extremely interesting and well thought out.The concepts of Bene Gesserit (a school of mental and physical abilities whose hidden mission is to advance humanity through various genetic manipulations), Mentats (people trained for supreme accomplishments of logic, human computers), Missionara Protectiva (a wing of Bene Gesserit order whose goal is to plant superstition on primitive worlds to later make these regions easier for the order to manipulate), etc. are equally fascinating.The depth of the world, however, is the biggest weakness of the book as well as its biggest strength. It takes a while to figure out various concepts and terms which are introduced early on (thankfully, there is a very helpful glossary at the end of the book). The narration is a little too dry at times, especially when characters' mental abilities are explored. The book is in many ways happens inside people's minds, so there is a lot of thinking and analyzing involved.But these negatives aside, \\"Dune\\" is rightfully called a masterpiece of science fiction. It is much more that a story about aliens and space travel, it is an ambitious philosophical work which explores the issues of ecology, cultural identity and the nature of religious leadership. Although I am not sure I will read the rest of the books in the series (as far as I know the total book count is now 16), I will always remember \\"Dune\\" as an impressive work of literature which will definitely stand the test of time.P.S. I also watched David Lynch's movie adaptation of the book. My advice - spare yourself, DO NOT watch it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Duneis perhaps the most original and exotic sci-fi/fantasy epic ever.

The galaxy is ruled by an emperor and several powerful feudal houses.Duneitself chronicles the struggle over the planet Arrakis, source of the crucial \\"spice,\\" as well as the rise of a new politico-religious leader. Of course, for many, the stars of the book are the giant sandworms, huge creatures hundreds of meters long that ultimately create the \\"spice.\\"Frank Herbert's writing style inDuneis flowing and exotic. Each chapter begins with a quite from history or religious books in the [[ASIN:0441013597 Dune] universe, putting the story in context. The book and dialogue are littered with dozens of \\"pearls of wisdom\\" (\\"He who has the power to destroy a thing controls it absolutely.\\")I saw the David Lynch movie [[ASIN:B0007PAMR4 Dune]] before I read the book, and in a few aspects of the bookDunewere disappointing. First, the narrator reveals key information at points, ruining the suspense. For example, Yueh is revealed as the traitor to the reader long before any of the characters realize it. Thus, when we see the rest of the characters accusing each other (which takes up a good bit of dialogue during the first third ofDune), it loses its suspense.Also, some of the characters' powers are never really explained. Paul at times seems more like a computer, too perfect and calculating (for example, he detects a secret door in a room because of a change in wind patterns). Paul also sees into the future even early on inDune. I guess you just have to accept these things as possible in theDuneworld.A few notes on the audiobook: I liked the audiobook version ofDune. The narrators do a good job changing voices between the characters, as well as introducing sound effects and music to supplement the text. It did seem like some of the characters' voices changed (Baron Harkonnen goes from a deep voice to a British voice at some points). Nonetheless, if you don't have time to read the book, it's a great alternative."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I always find it instructing to start with the one and two stars reviews, when I try to form an opinion... Herbert's writing skills and his characters are the favorite targets of these reviewers. Many of the reviews here are based on a hidden presupposition that all readers share the reviewer's view of the world. They are not literary criticism, but rather philosophical critiques. IF one happens to agree with, or is persuaded in the process by Herbert's arguments, swayed to his weltanschauung so to speak, then the plot and the characters are VERY adequate, being intensely allegorical yet realistic, in a fractal-like relationship, in which the individual microcosm is reiterated to ever larger encompassing structures/universes. If you don't think the universe is funny, if you don't buy into poetic justice and the noble savage fairy tales, if your view of the world is realistic - as in positivistic, scientific and pragmatic - then your reaction to Dune is bound to be different and the author's literary craftsmanship (or lack thereof) will have nothing to do with it.As far as his writing skill is concerned, many seem to find his omniscient, character shifting third person lacking, in that it prevents one from empathizing with one character or another. I find it brilliant and a delightful tour-de-force, with so many points of view in the same scene and each character a mirror to the others.This book is not for Star Trek fans. It is not uplifting, it does not speak of the glory of Man, it is not about exploration, it does not serve any system's propaganda.

There is never really much of an element of suspense throughout the book, and the reader has the impression that he or she already knows how the book is going to end from the very beginning. It's a bit difficult to sympathize with the protagonists. \\"Dune\\" is obviously more fantasy than science fiction, but Paul is always a bit too sure of himself for this book to feel like some kind of bildungsroman as is typical of the fantasy genre. The Bene Gesserit as a whole are an incredibly annoying concept in their seeming omnipotence and omniscience, and the whole concept of them seems a heavy-handed ploy to make female characters an important element in the plot. There are too few elements of protagonist vs. antagonist direct conflict in the book, and when they do occur the action appears a bit stilted and anticlimactic. As Paul and his mother's powers grow in the book, one gets a sense that they are basically unstoppable and that the antagonists are absolutely no match for them whatsoever, which was incredibly vexing and made me eager to put the book down.Why this book is considered one of the best science fiction novels ever, I have absolutely no idea. Sure, the world created by Herbert is incredibly detailed (although implausible), but if you can't tell a story well, the book isn't going to work. This is one of the more overrated novels in science-fiction history, but perhaps I've watched too much \\"Star Wars\\" and read too much \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"Harry Potter,\\" where there actually is an excellent story to go along with excellent world-building elements, to really appreciate \\"Dune.\\""},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When I read reviews on Amazon, I generally wade through the sea of 5's looking for the dissenting voice hoping to find honest criticism instead of yet more gushing praise. If you're like me, here's your review.Despite the cult that revolves around this book, it's just not that good. It holds up pretty well if you haven't read much complex fiction (i.e. you're 18), but when viewed as part of the greater mass of English literature, it rises only slightly above the rest of the SF genre.The characters are changeless cardboard, the epic historical veneer and societal exposition only paper thin, the political framework simplistic, and the technology overly convenient to the story. In a lot of ways it's a very ambitious project, and I think it is the ambition rather than the success of the project that has contributed more to the book's popularity.It's a bit of a shame that Herbert didn't stretch out more and really flesh out the world of Dune, but that would have made for a 1200 page story that was already pushing its luck at 400 pages.Within SF Dune is an unquestionable high-water mark, but outside the genre it's only barely worth the time to read it, if that."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is not my favorite book, that would be Enders Game. But this is the best book ever. Sound like a contradiction? It's not. Enders Game is my favorite for some sentimental reasons best left to another forum. Dune is, quite simply, the most complete novel ever written. It has everything!The one downside to this tale are the names. Come on, we don't need some guy who's name has 27 consonants in it. Let's just call him Bob for expediency, shall we?Otherwise, this book has it all. Read it, and you won't be disappointed, I guarantee it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune has about seven interweaving plot layers. This book has maybe one, which is life and death. At just 278 pages this book is by far the shortest book in the six book series.

Why should I have to pay more for an e-book then one thats actually printed and shipped and stored? Thats crazy."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It is easy to forget that Herbert wrote in a time when the Sci-Fi universe was sparsely populated, with technology based on analog vacuum tubes and such. The dazzling world of Arrakis & its worms, space travel technology etc are original and reflect raw imagination and talent. SOme aspects of Robert Jordan's Aes Sedai seem eerily similar to Herbert's Bene Gesserit.I couldn't relate to the all-knowing all-powerful main character who seemed too uni-dimensional to be interesting. literal use of Arabic, Slavonic, Chakobsa, Persian etc was disconcerting and jarring. much of the pseudo-philosophical mumbo jumbo in Dune seems to have been lifted straight from hallucinogenic trances - the book at times sounded like a diary from a druggie, complete with rapid review of the past and the future. Not surprisingly, the threat of diminished drug supply as a literary device was lifted straight out of another fiend's (Crowley's) oeuvre.Historically speaking this book was ground breaking. Personally, I wasn't as touched as I expected to be."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune Messiah was disappointingly not Dune. I enjoyed listening to the book but I just did not get into it as much as Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I love reading good sci-fi because of its innovation and imagination. This book has both. The description of stil suits and the complex economy developed on spice are both examples of Herbert's ability to create. You also get amazing adventure and worms the size of semi's. And for those with a political interest, you get the back stabbing and dealing of an empire. Where could you go wrong. Well I found out in the next couple books of this series."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I am an avid science fiction reader, and this book tops every others.

They aren't the same book?! It's like someone came and changed Huck Finn... ha,ha... I know he tried to make it &quot;better&quot;... more literary, but he took out Paul's humanity and replaced it with a Messiah. It was more of a love story in a very strange culture with more mystical stuff about the spice and the second moon. There was a sound weapon that has disappeared completely as well. In my opinion he ruined it by messing with it? He lived too long and tried to make perfection better...It reminds me of the pigs in animal farm who can in the night and changed the laws on the wall.We should go back to that Ace edition.... the laws were better."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Herbert is one of those people who have a great imagination, with beuatiful skills of creativity. These people can create amazing worlds in their head, with politics, culture, and a unique language. The only problem is, he can't write. I am an avid reader, and recently decided to pick up this renowned novel. I was sorely dissappointed. With such poor development( I do not mean an introduction-I hate introductions. I mean actual coherency), I could barely bring myself to finish this book. Don't waste your time. This so-called &quot;Brilliant&quot; sci-fi novel is nothing more that a pieced-together third-rate material.

Maybe I've been spoiled by author's such as George Martin &amp; Dan Simmons who write truly captivating prose.Dune is one of those books that I may get back to one day (with emphasis on the &quot;may&quot;)."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I read the whole book, and only for brief periods of time did I find it the least bit interesting. I don't know how it won a Hugo Award, or how it is considered to be a \\"classic.\\" It's a sci-fi/fantasy book that doesn't bother to ever create a visual picture of the world. It is extremely dialogue-heavy and the dialogue reads like a poor movie script, where people talk in ways that no person ever does. There is an overwhelming amount of made-up terms that deal with the mythology/religion/culture/philosophy of the Dune world, but it's incredibly painstaking to look up all the different terms every time a new nonsense word pops up.I'll admit that some of my rating comes down to personal taste. I always reserve one star for my personal preference...but even so, this book is only for really, really, really big fans of obscure sci-if/fantasy...and masochists.Mind you, I love sci-fi and fantasy - they are about the only fiction genres that I read on a regular basis. I mostly read non-fiction books of every genre and difficulty. I am an avid reader, though, so this review does not come out of ignorance on my part."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Very happy with my purchase. Packaging was excellent (no damage done whatsoever) and arrived faster than expected! :)"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I first read \\"Dune\\" when it was originally published, I enjoyed it. Paul seemed to be an interesting and complex character. I read it two or three times since then. My opinion did not improve. There are two or three spots in the story where I get bored. Also, the story-line has always seemed a bit far-fetched to me. I always wish for more true hard science fiction and less of the psychic stuff.While I rate it at four stars, I, honestly, do not understand why this book has gotten the huge reputation that it has."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I basically found Dune to be an airball in comparison to the reviews some people gave me. The plot was too intricate, the book was too long, and for God's sake it is a pain to have to flip back to the glossary every page or so. I actually began to uderstand the book at page 425 when the Baron is discussing his plans with Thufir Hawat...but I shouldn't have to read that much for it to get interesting. And I hate to get all of you SF freaks angry...but Frank Herbert was a BAD WRITER. Some of the things he describes are very clunkily worded, sentences either too brief or two wordy. Plus he never used the word &quot;and&quot; in the entire book. An example would be a sentence like &quot;He walked over to the case, opened it.&quot; It just got annoying after awhile. It is a long dull story told with modest talent."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Wow, the Kindle version is selling for $15.99 but the used paperback is selling for like $3.25, the new paperback for $9.99.

I began reading it with high hopes. About 10 pages in, I got drowsy and set the book down. I found it extremely hard to pick it up again. In the end I got about 150 pages into it before realizing I should only read ten pages a day (and read another book full time) or just quit it altogether. I have yet to take either initiative (although I have started a different book). I can appreciate Herbert's world building, but the pace is incredibly slow and the writing itself is pretty abysmal. It's just not my cup of tea. Many others seem to enjoy taking their tea with a large dollop of m&eacute;lange. In my opinion, it's a love-hate affair and I'm one of those indecisive types who are stuck in the middle."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is supposed to be one of the best SF novels of all time. I like SF, so I should read Dune. In fact, I have started to read it at least half a dozen times, but I have never managed to get beyond the first few dozen pages. It just doesn't appeal. There may be some brilliant ideas in there but the writing is so ponderous, it kills any desire to read further."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read, very complex, yet not way too hard to follow story.

The first time I read it (years ago) it sucked me into it's rich universe so completely, that I read it cover to cover in ONE day! I had other things to do, I just couldn't put it down. This is not a short book!The worlds, politics, emotions, characters, and violence will live in your mind for some time to come after reading this extraordinary story.Some of it's most tantalizing points: Great houses feuding, viciously skilled armies, hidden ruthless allies - as well as secluded and powerful deadly ememies, huge violent sandworms, magical/spirtual powers, children fighters as fierce as wild dogs, deep - meaningful - and sometimes painful relationships, disparate cultures at odds, and a knife that cannot be re-sheathed until it has drawn it's victim's blood!I'm not even a fan of the fantasy style of fiction, but this one pulled me in whole! It is not however, a short story. Be prepared to be immersed in detail, and to wish that you were a part of the vast fantasy that is Dune.If you liked the movie, this book will show you the other 75% of it's story, and universe you never saw. If you've never seen the movie; don't bother. Read the book instead! Highly recommended. Just make sure you have some spare time to read. You probably won't want to take long breaks from Dune. :) Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Most people interested in sci-fi has heard of Frank Herbert's Dune series, not as many has acctualy read it. This is a sad mistake on their part. The main thing about Dune though is that you don't have to be &quot;in to sci-fi&quot; to enjoy it. What makes it such a excellent work is not the sci-fi part but F Herbert's eye for details. The way he tells his stories has many times been compared to Tolkien and many other great authors, mainly for this reason. The reader is taken on a journey filled with legends, side stories and plots, told in unique way - the Frank Herbert way.One should however not ignore the sci-fi aspect of this work to easliy. Instead it should be seen as something that takes Dune to even greater heights - the heights that won it both the HUGO and the NEBULA award.Dune lets us follow the young to-be-Duke Paul of the house Atreides to the planet Arrakis (Dune) as his father, the Duke, is given the govering rights of the planet. Arakkis is however not just any planet - it is the only planet that has the melange - the spice. &quot;He who controlls the spice controlls space travels&quot;. As such it is a great source of power, and thus the house of Atreides will not go unchallenged. What will happen to the young duke, to the planet Dune and to the original inhabitans of the world. There is only one way to find out, and it involves a lot of reading - time to considered well spent."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is astounding. I read it at age 15 from cover to cover. I'm now 21, and have just begun reading it for a second time. Set in science fiction--but with enough H20 molecule-sized, real-life metaphors to fill an empty glass--Dune is an almost unbelievable marvel in literature. The manifold italicized character thought-processes nestled within allowed me to truly feel as one with the characters, to actually understand them, and to almost feel as though it is the year 10,191. To say this novel has outstanding character development is like saying the human body has only 1/3 water. I look forward to re-reading this novel and may post more reviews in the future."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"...by the well-studied poet and ecologist, the DUNE books are unbelievably entertaining and philosophicall and psychologically provocative.

I wouldn't bother with the rest of the series, though, as Herbert went off on rambling tangents that lost the basic sci-fi basis of the story."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is a GREAT book. It is probably the best book I have ever read. Lord of The Rings is the only other book that I have read that compares to it. It is a must read to any person who likes science fiction books."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is great.

In my way back home one question was disturbing my brain. &quot;- Ain't Dune That good?&quot;. Well I'll tell you all that i &quot;devoured&quot; Dune in about 48 hours. Once you start to read it you can't stop before you finish it. It is so amazing. What kind of mind could develop such a masterpice? Frank Herbert (God bless his soul!!) was a genious. He created the &quot;Bible of Science Fiction&quot;. Listen to my words as i say &quot;- Buy it now. You won't be disapointed.&quot;&quot;Ain't Dune that good?&quot; &quot;F_ _ K.

The plot, themes, and characters are all very deep. It's good from beginning to end. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The Atreides family is assigned to Arrakis, where they exploit melange; a special spice needed specifically for interstellar travel.

Overall, I think the magnificent book Dune, stands among the major literature achievements ever to have been written. The only thing comparable is Tolkien's work. However, I reccomend the book only to readers with patience and a love for science-fiction and fantasy. The book is very misleading to read and contains constant flashbacks, historical notes, and is very difficult to read comprehensively. Good luck to all who read this book. It is truly a work of art."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"By far the best book written since &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; Herbert was talented beyond belief.

It's a great mixture of science fiction, philosophy, and ecolgical events. Some people find that Dunes only shortcomming was the dialog,however I found if quite interesting. It differed from the norm and reminded you that it is a completely alien society."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The indepth detail and overall picture that Herbert paints throughout the Dune series is spectacular. I first saw the move when I was 10, when I found out it was a book I read it, and continued (over the next 14 years) reading and re-reading the next series of books(God Emperor, ChapterHouse.) I am know 24 and have read the Dune Books at least twenty times. Only Star Wars comes close to creating a Universe so real. I am the biggest fan of the Bene Gessrit order, perhaps one day humans will posses the abiltiy to function in the manner of a B.G. witch. I can see where Herbert got some of his ideas for the B.G. training(Yoga, eastern meditation) I wish Mr. Herbert was still alive so he could create a T.V. series, don't get me wrong the mind is the besst place to see Dune but a T.V. series would bring it to life."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Herbert puts a whole world into one book. Every time I read this book I catch something new. The wonderful part is that you can read it very superficially or VERY deeply and enjoy the book every time. Paul Muad'dib is such a fantastic character who is not just a man in himself, but a figure bred out of millennia of selection for salvation of the entire human race or the tool of a select group of religious fanatics. Herbert cunningly leaves this dichotomy for his readers' judgement. The introduction of the Orange Catholic Bible and the Butlerian Jihad allows the book to move away from the static placement in time that troubles many other great novels of this century. Our only loss in this series is the untimely death of the beloved author before its completion."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It is sad for me, that I saw the movie frist. the movie SUCKS. And only in a few aspects does it match the greatness of the book. When I found the book in my father's library I thought &quot;sure why not.&quot; At least I had heard of the name DUNE before (unlike many of his other books) When I read blew me away. A universe so detailed and so well crafted that for those few days that it took me to read it, IT WAS REAL. This man has vision. I went on to re-read DUNE 6 times in the past 5 years and have read the entire series twice. the first is definatly the best. But the REALITY of this place is consistant in all of the books.This is not some mindless good vs. evil story. this is a deep probing look into this world's society and the REASONS why people do the things they do.One of the things that makes this world so successful is what some people call &quot;the history of the future.&quot; that is, A story set so far in the future that it traces its roots back though its history (which is still far on our future) alowing the reader to see this long and imaginative timeline which, if we trace backwards, will lead back to us. This gives us a connection to the story. And makes the entire story more emotional for us. DUNE does this.This is a book that will OPEN YOUR MIND to new ideas. READ THIS BOOK!NOTE: of the 6 books. 1 is the best. 5 and 6 are very good too. 4 is the worst in the series (i would give it 7 on the amazon rating so its not a bad book either) #4 is a little more philosophical.. thus being trier. not much action."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I enjoyed Dune a lot. The imagery is very good, you really feel you are in this strange desert world. The story is very intense, as the central character faces potential death in the safety of his home with trusted people in the very first chapter! Plus the central character gets stronger as the story progresses, feeding the reader's ego and encouraging optimism towards life's difficult situations. This is a great escape novel, as it has successfuly enabled me to forget all about work! I had read this book as a college student, and only felt lukewarm, but 20 years later, I love it. This is not a difficult read, and I would not try to read too much into it. I see Dune as mainly an escape novel. The harsh medieval values of loyalty and death are very black and white which successfully removes any moral considerations, as none of these situations can apply to daily life. This helps the Dune fantasy. The strength of Dune is the visialization of the desert world, which seems very real. The weakness is that Dune does not make you think about moral issues in your life (in contrast to classics such as Animal Farm). But since Dune is a fantasy sci-fi novel, so what?"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"(no offense to George Lucas)To say that DUNE has many layers is a gross understatement.On a first, casual read, it might seem just another (but brilliant) SF adventure novel. A mix of Star Wars and Foundation, perhaps, or a coming-of-age/hero tale, like the epic sagas of mythology and folklore. The Forces of Good fights (and conquers) Evil, everyone lives happily ever after..?Then, you may notice the setting. From the harsh desert world of Arrakis to the byzantine intrigues of the drug-embracing feudal Imperium, DUNE creates an environment unparalleled in SF.Next, free your mind from the heroic mystique, and put it to what actually happens to the characters. Do they live happily ever after? Do most of them live at all? DUNE becomes a tragedy; beautiful and sad and strange.And only then will you notice the things that don't seem to fit. Like why did Paul have drums made from the skin of his enemies? And why does Jessica refer to her saviours as 'peasants'. And what happens to the power? Above all, what happens to all that power!? And maybe you will see the philosophy and morality of DUNE. The wisdom of DUNE.Notice the language. The delicate use of contrast and surprises, allusions and understatements. The way Frank Herbert seems to toy with his readers, distracting us from the point on enjoyable side-trips. Notice the irony, how DUNE continually questions its own premises and concepts.And you will suddenly realize, that on top of all, against all probability, DUNE is incredibly, impossibly, hilariously FUNNY!Then read the sequels. Then come to alt.fan.dune to share the experience with the rest of us. Enjoy! I wish I could do it all again. (And I can. I reread it at least once a year. :-D )I truly pity those who don't like it because they think the vocabulary is too difficult."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I got this book after watching the movie, and I tell you, it IS perfect.

If you read the whole serie of the Dune books you understand that this is not only about some worms and some people fighting on the desert planet, it's a book about religion and how to get power of it. They manipulate peoples bye giving them a religion (usually with a messias) and so they get the power and the control over the people. All in all it's really great stuff and worth to read every page of the 3500 (or maybe even more)."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is a VERY good book and was in fact the book that opened my eyes to fantasy/sci-fi. The way it mixes hard-core science and advanced electronics with &quot;magic&quot; and religion is absolutely brilliant!As a counterpoint to the review below: The fact that they use monarchy is a very nice touch. In fact an absolut monarch (or ruler of any kind) is probably a must in order to advance that far. Democracy isn't the wave of the future, it doesn't work that way."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This volume might be a downer for those who were enthralled by the teen adventure aspect of the 1st part. It picks up 12-15 yrs after Dune, with the unstoppable Fremen waging a holy Jihad against the Empire that has killed 12 billion and counting. A lot of confused, self-absorbed would-be conspirators against Muad'dib, supposedly masters in the occult art of thinking clearly, bicker and blow philosophical smoke in each others' faces in attempts to get some power back. Meanwhile Paul is surrounded by loyal fanatics, suffering his long-dark-night-of-the-soul as his visionary abilities wane in the face of the bloody chaos he has created. It might not sound like it, but I did enjoy this book a lot as a well-written, natural continuation of the series. The first 3 books in this series were originally intended as one novel (as F.H. stated in an interview), and you're cheating yourself if you only read the coming of age story that kicks it off. The major problem is that the political intrigue is done badly, with uninteresting characters, unlike the (anti?)heroes such as St. Alia-of-the-Knife and Paul-Muad'dib. There is still plenty of philosophical depth, and this has to be the least &quot;commercial&quot; sequel I've ever read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When I first read this book I was in ninth grade. I have read it about twice a year every year since then. No book I have ever read even comes close to matching this book. It is so in depth and realistic that even when I hear a song that was on the radio when I was reading the book I unconsciously see the desert and the fremen. You will never read another book, science-fiction or otherwise, that is better than the original, and still the best, Frank Herbert's Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The changes to society that Paul has brought about cause complex plots and factions to spring up, and he does fall victim to one of these. Part of this is resistance to his strange supersister, who is slowly being driven insane because of what she was exposed to at birth. The Bene Gesserit have lost control of their superman, the superman controls the most valuable substance in the galaxy, an so controls transport throughout the universe.As part of the plot, the Tleilaxu send Paul a clone of one of his childhood mentors, Duncan Idaho, who is now dead. His sister falls for the clone, and the clone is also part of an assassination plot. His wife is also poisoning his mistress.The problem for the prescient man is how to be sure he is doing the right thing, and choosing the right path.A radiation weapon blinds Paul, and the Fremen have a strong taboo against the blind, even though Paul's powers clearly enable him to see.Eventually, he removes himself from the equation, as his decision on what to do, after the death of Chani."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Wow, did Paul's plans backfire on him. His bloodthirsty quest for vengeance lead him to the one thing he initially set out to prevent. He could see into the future, but not prevent destiny. He finds that becoming a god is not all its cracked up to be. An amazing story, full of surprises, and such a relief from the cookie-cutter flawless characters that Hollywood typically delivers. Very yin-yang type characters. Hard to determine how good or bad the characters really are...and seeing into the minds of each character allows you to empathize with each one. A very interesting story."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune has clearly cemented its place in the Sci-Fi and literary canon on the legitimate strengths of its deep plot and intricate internal philosophy, the fact that it also includes a deep political underpinning only adds to its ability to insinnuate itself into the zeit-geist of the day. What I find odd is the seeming lack of uniform assent that Dune and Paul Ateides stem from the story of T.E. Lawrence. The connection to the desert setting is obvious, less so is how the abiding love that Lawrence has for the beautiful austerity for the desert and the discipline it engenders is incorporrated into Paul Atreides and Liet Kynes and resonnates outward thoroughout the course of the story. Even though the vision of Paul Atreides and Liet Kynes is the transformation of the harsh landscape, all of the \\"prophets\\" of Dune see the need to maintain the deep desert of Arrakis for the faithful. The maintenace of the desert, on the surface, is a concession to the economics of Dune, the giant sandworms require the deep desert for the chemical catalyst of the spice menlange, the drug that stands in for petroleum as the center of the economic commentary portion of this masterpiece. Stangely lost in the economic strategy is the complete lack of effort by anyone to synthesize the drug despite the presence of a scientific cult race, the Ix, who's best effort to break the economic monopoly is to smuggle young sandworms off-planet. The meaning seems clear, like Lawrence, Dune values the desert for the way it alters the character of those who live in its presence. Other signs that Lawrence was the inspiration are not hard to find: a \\"voice from the outside\\" that serves a leadership roll for a hiterto fragmented band of nomads (the bedouin for Lawrence and the Fremen for Paul Atreides). The manner in which Larence created a guerilla force that attacked and moved, attacked and moved, is matched exactly by Paul Aterides in Dune. For Lawrence, the opressing forces were the Turks and the subtle and political overseers,the British, for Paul Atriedes they are the Harkonnens and the Bene Gessirit/Great Houses. The end of colonial imperialism is a fact for both Lawrence and Paul. Both men, powerful and visionary though they are, have no desire to hold onto power or godhood, they both want the people to be responsible for their destiny. Although there are many more similarities, suffice it to say that, for me, Dune certainly serves as a paen to the indominitable spirit of T.E. Lawrence. Just one more facet of a book that works on so many levels."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Begin your adventure here into the amazing universe of Frank Herbert's Dune. It is a rich and incredible work of storytelling that just happens to be classified as \\"SciFi\\". This is first class literature, period. Mr. Herbert will grab you on the first page and you will not be able to put the book down until you have finished it and have purchased ALL of the other books about the Dune universe, including his son's contributions. I promise you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Taking place about 12 years after the action in Dune, Paul Atreides is now Emperor of the galaxy, ruling from his palace on Arrakis. Legions of Fremen followers revere him as a deity and have led a bloody religious jihad across the universe to spread his philosophy to the \\"unbelievers\\". This has resulted in millions of deaths and the complete obliteration of several planets. Dune Messiah chronicles the attempts of the Bene Gesserit, the Spacing Guild and Emperor Shaddam's daughter (now wife of Paul Atreides) to bring about Paul's downfall.Most of the novel is just silly philosophizing around a muddy plot. Herbert fails to make clear the reasons for the actions that the characters take. Most of the scenes with Paul revolve around him brooding about taking steps to avoid a future timeline that will supposedly bring about the downfall of the galaxy. Unfortunately, Herbert never clearly articulates this peril or makes it seem tangible enough for the reader to care about it. The book lacks the charm of the original as well as the action sequences and any decent political intrigue.Unless you are a die-hard Dune fanatic, don't waste your time with this inferior novel."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When you read something this good all you need to say is \\"It's a great book,\\" that's all. This is one of those books that you wish it would never end, but unfortunately it does, but then you get to read the sequels. This is Frank Herbert's masterpiece that started a saga and turned into several movies.The story is about young Paul Atreides (son of Duke Leto Ateides) and his family who are moving to take control of the planet Arrakis also known as Dune. Dune, however, is not a normal planet, it is all desert and is the only source of \\"spice,\\" the life blood of the human race. While on Dune they must overcome the Harkoneans, a noble house that will do anything to gain power.Over all this is one of the best books I've ever read and definitely the best sci-fi I've ever read. This is truly a master piece more than worthy of Frank Herbert's name. From the amazing story and great detail and description this is an astoundingly interesting book one you should read even if you don't like sci-fi."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Paul Muad'dib Atreides is now the emperor of the known worlds and respected as the messiah of the Freman religion. But a plot is underfoot to destroy his reign and get house Corrino back into the emperor's throne.While this is not as fast paced as the first Dune, it is still an exciting read with just as many plots within plots within plots as the original. It is a good portion shorter than the original and others of the series as this mainly focuses on the pregnancy of Chani, the desire of Irulan to have children with Paul, Irulan's involvement with the plot to bring Paul's downfall, the return of the ghola Duncan Idaho, the guild's fear of the events unfolding on Arakis, the finding of a dwarf who possesses the names of the enemies of Atreides who also has a strong role in the plot, and the introduction of many rich characters.Frank Herbert may be a lot more philosophical (read: long-winded) in this book and its subsequent sequels. If you can get passed all of that then you have an amazing story that I found just as rich as the original Dune book.If you loved Dune I, then make sure you stick around and read this book. If it doesn't tickle your fancy then drop the series. But if you find it as intriguing as myself, you can thank me later. :D As for me, this was most definitely a \\"must read\\"."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"\\"Dune Messiah\\" is the second novel in the \\"Dune Chronicles\\" approximately twelve years after the prior book. The writing, though not as comprehensive as the first novel, still contains strength in grammar and vocabulary. The story isn't developing a culture and world as much as following select individuals, squandering the original creativity.Unfortunately the Jihad Paul Muad'dib tries to avoid earlier has come to pass, leaving fanatics preaching a twisted faith in his family name. Yet the prescience of Paul and Alia drive the majority of the story in great detail. They struggle with the affects of shady junctures in the visions while not fully comprehending every possible path, keeping Muad'dib busy to prevent a more horrible future even as he avoids the schemes of those wanting his genetics. Interesting opponents and a breakthrough involving an individual from Paul's past makes the book a remarkable read.No appendixes conclude the novel but still a glossary would have sufficed. As with just about every film-based novel, I would suggestion at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movies thereby leaving the series entirely to the imagination.I highly recommend the series to any fan of the science fiction genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"As Herbert would express in the latter books of this series, there are limits to words--and no review can capture \\"Dune.\\" All I can say is that this is a must-read, this is the core of Science Fiction, the pinnacle of the genre. Clarke and Asimov cannot compare, this is the definitive work of Science Fiction, and, surely, belongs on any list of the \\"greatest books\\" of our, or any time. Herbert is wise, knowledgeable and literate and lets it show. This is, surely, the most literate work of our civilization after \\"Paradise Lost\\"--something any literature person ought to take the time to enjoy.It would be unfair, though, not to address this books shortcomings. Herbert's writing is, at times, cut short on areas, he'll gloss over a few details or rush certain elements; or get overly-impressive when he needn't do so. He seems to be finding himself much more in this book, or, rather, finding Dune. In the later works in this series, though they themselves don't compare to Dune, he seems to have found a much better way to balance philosophy, action, narration and dialogue. The problems with this are minimal though, at worst, you may feel a little rushed by the ending, but still satisfied with the work as a whole.There is so much this book has to teach, so much it has to share--don't let yourself get overwhelmed, just dive into it and you'll find it to be one of the most enjoyable reading experiences you've ever had."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a long novel. it's split into two books, that each make up this story. Science fiction always seems to rely on the human factor. The struggles that we deal with today. The dirty politics. The writer can only write what he knows, that's what makes this genre so compelling and yet so frustrating for the writer. And at times the audience can translate that frustration. It is this that punctuates his core characters. I could feel the struggles he took in deciding things for his characters. I fought with his characters with great apathy. I felt fatigued at one point, At midsection through the book, when poor Paul is left with his mother. Estranged, driven out of their proud house. I wanted to believe that only good would come for the young boy and his mother. Frank makes good use of his genius and technical sources. He made a world, a world of fabulous riches and depth, real. This is the hardest single achievement for writers. Shakespeare created a world where you could imagine anything occuring. Tolkien created, gave birth to a cultural sense for his beloved LOTR's. Frank takes us to a desert planet, on the shoulders of a royal family. A duke, and his mistress, whom he shares love with, and with Paul whom belongs to a rare school of teachings, in which he is the only male. A living legend it is told, and great turmoil, mixed with hope. Paul, as a young boy, is faced with this legend. You are tossed into his mind for instances. You read in soliquy. His thoughts are aged and his coherence is quick. Every step of his realization, do you follow. Every love, and then the betrayel. You follow it all, and inside this young boys head, you hear the unnerving duty that calls him. His attraction to the spice. His inherited understanding of the world of Arrakis. The mysterious spice. It is the power of Arrakis, and the understanding of the spice is his destiny. I am proud to have read this book.-jeff"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is in a class of its own. Yes it is a sci-fi story, probably the best one ever told, but, as far as sci-fi goes, Dune creates an entirely new category of science-fiction. Dune, for me, was more than a book - it was an experience."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune Messiah is set twelve years after the end of Dune, with Paul firmly ensconced as emperor of Arrakis. Never have I read a sequel that so closely followed the feel of the original. Had I not known better, I would have sworn this book was the second half of Dune as opposed to a separate sequel.Being so well matched to the original was very good and kind of disappointing. The story continued in a comfortable fashion, written in a a tone I was already accustomed to. I easily reentered the world Frank Herbert created and found the new twists to the Atreides story meshed well with the characters I already knew.Unfortunately, while Dune felt like an epic story that changed everything from beginning to end of the story, Dune Messiah felt like a small snippet in the life of the emperor. Things that seemed as though they should have been major didn't have the impact they should have. It all felt less important. This is a common problem with sequels to huge books like Dune. The next book never measures up to the original.While I enjoyed the story, I don't feel compelled to continue the series. The book was good and it was fun to revisit the characters, but ultimately Dune was best left with its original ending. Dragging things out further promises to mar my opinion of the first book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is an all respects a truly great piece of work.The synopsis of Dune is fairly simple. A family takes over the mining operations on a highly sought after resource (spice) on a distant planet. However, treachery awaits and a young boy and his boy find themselves as outcasts with desert nomad people the Fremen.It's a good story. However, what makes the book great is the depth of the writing. Herbert, took a chance with his writing style of weaving his personal philosphy into the story and risked alienating the casual reader. But he had the talent to pull it off. And what a pay off. A fantastic novel. And what I like best about it, is that it has great re-readability. Everytime you read it, you get something you didn't before.By now, I'm read the story 5 times. And I know it inside and out.

With Dune, Frank Herbert creates a sci-fi classic that will be remembered throughout the ages.Herbert, a journalist, generally wrote short stories; however, he is best known for his sci-fi classics of the Dune saga. Sadly, after he wrote Chapterhouse Dune, Frank Herbert died of a massive pulmonary embolism. However, his death hasn't stopped Dune's success, and even after his death, Dune has left a huge impact on the science fiction community.Dune isn't without its challenges; in fact Dune is a complicated and sometimes confusing book. With the plethora of fictional words the book introduces, Dune is a book that is easy to get lost in. However, readers who are not deterred by the daunting task of getting past the complicated plot and vocabulary, the reader will be pleasantly surprised. The book's plot is engrossing and full of twists, and will keep the reader on the edge of his or her seat. Besides the plot, the world of Dune is also wonderfully described, and the mysteries of the world awaken the inherent curiosity in the reader.Personally, as a high school student, I found the book to be rather slow in the beginning, especially with the annoyance of annotations. However, I decided to stick with the book, due to the fact that it fit the 500 page requirement perfectly, and I was blown away as a result. In fact, I ended up condensing all of my annotations into the first half so that I could read the rest of the book uninterrupted. Another nice thing about the book is that it appeals to fans of the fantasy genre too. Dune has overtones of fantasy that melds with fantasy lovers' preferences, resulting in a thoroughly enjoyable experience. In conclusion, the book Dune is a wonderful work of literary art, and will present an unforgettable story for any lover of literature."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"By far the best in conteporary science fiction. Herbert has created a world far greater than any other author in his field. A must read for all."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Long before \\"Star Wars\\" presented us with a desert world of adventure and intrigue (and for some reason cute creatures who can make a living salvaging robots for scrap on a world that doesn't seem to have much industry and therefore need of robots...), Frank Herbert gave us \\"Dune.\\" It's considered a classic, and \\"Dune\\" is definitely a triumph in world-building, with giant worms and clever bodysuits that capture precious water, the most valuable commodity in such a place. It's also got an intricate plot filled with political machinations that keep the reader on their toes; you can't just breeze through this one and expect all the answers to fall into your lap.The sole weakness in \\"Dune,\\" at least for me, lay in its characterization. There are far too many two-dimensional characters in this novel, and far too few gray three-dimensional ones (Dr. Yueh was the only one I took any real interest in). This hampers the novel's story, since it limits how much each character can grow and develop. I suppose this is why I can remember Arrakis as a place so clearly, while Paul Atredies is only a blur. I did enjoy the references to family-owned nuclear weapons, though."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I wish I could distinctly remember the first time I read this book. I wish, in fact, I could go back and read it again for the first time all over again - it's just that wonderful. I associate it with The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) and The Foundation Trilogy, although I read those two at different times - the association is more to do with their being science fiction books that are overtly concerned with the political, sociocultural, and ecological parts of world building and that is also how I think of Dune. Later I read The Snow Queen by Joan D. Vinge and was struck by how Dunelike it was in its own way.I'm not a huge fan of the space opera kind of science fiction in novels. Love it in movies, but in novels people rushing about in spaceships just doesn't do it for me. Dune is not that kind of science fiction. It is sharp, fresh, and fascinating even all these years (45 of them) later. In it Herbert built an amazing and intricate world and culture that he populated with wonderful characters - that he then wrote a really great story is what makes this book a classic. I re-read it periodically and find something new to like each time.As always, I like best the early parts of the novel - the preparation for taking over Arrakis, the gom jabbar, the intricate political maneuvering towards the inevitable betrayal. I like the rest of the book, but the first third is what truly pleases me. It's so Shakespearean in its plot and scope and Shakespeare always was a crowd-pleaser.It was good to revisit Arrakis and it is still bitterly disappointing to know that the books that followed this one in the Dune Chronicles are fat, pretentious, and boring (sort of like Baron Harkonnen)."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a wonderful book. Hearing it told on audio cd's allows you to use your imagination to create the world you're hearing about. If you are reluctant to buy this set because you saw the awful film version of Dune put that out of your mind.

If it's Paul, the freman legesy or even the malange spice, Frenk Herbert has mannaged to build a world and not just a book that the rules it are diffrent - allmost perfect. From alot of sides even to prfect. Now more then 2 years after I read this book I can realy say - that book gave me more than any other book or event gave me. It gave me a new prespactive to look on the world. That book suceeded where others have failed - it's not a book with just a story (even if it's the best story) like every other book, it is a book about changing, philosophy and winning. A documentery book about several yeras that will accored ( or not ) in 8000 years.

This is not a book for the impatient or easily-wearied.But Herbert was a brilliant man. He deliberately and cleverly avoids including 'futuristic' technologies, despite the scenario being set millenia from now. This and the primitive lifestyle of the desert-planet's natives (the Fremen) give the book a fantasy feel without the mind-numbing embarassment of including dwarfs and dragons, instead creating a fresh idea of science-fantasy with super-human Bene Gesserit and desert-roaming sandworms.The characters are superb, each very strongly motivated within the brilliantly constructed world. And don't think Herbert is scared to see large numbers of the cast die horribly through the course of the book (and the trilogy). Not once are you left knowing what is about to happen, and, each time something major happens, you'll find yourself quietly wishing that your favourite characters aren't going to perish.One last thing. Some people complain that a certain decisive battle is not described in enough length. This seems a stupid argument to me when the description of war combat would have been far less interesting than the ending we do get: a tense and exciting battle of words, then a hand-to-hand duel.If you've ever liked deeply involving plots and large, large worlds, you should read this book.

Frank Herbert has the ability to immerse the reader in his tale, having them constantly wanting to read more and more. The term &quot;page turner&quot; comes to mind.

This is one to read over again. Some of the concepts are hard to visualize, but when the movie is watched, it becomes a little clearer. The movie falls way short of the book and leaves the viewer puzzled if without prior knowledge of the subject matter (ie: reading the book), but should not be discounted either. This book can change beliefs and ideas. This is the ultimate SF book ever!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I'm not sure what to make of this book. I know there are a lot of people who love it, and I can see why, but I can't include myself amongst their number. There's just something so cold about this world that it makes it hard to open up to. I'm not referring specifically to its harshness nor am I calling it unemotional. I don't mind either of those things. Perhaps detached or contrived is a better word? It's a hard impression to explain.At any rate this book is about Paul Atreides, who is basically a cross between Orestes, Lawrence of Arabia, and Muhammad. He moves with his family to the planet Arrakis (only source of the spice on which the empire relies) where he is entwined in a trap to destroy his family. Something that Herbert does very well is set up a sense of approaching disaster and doom. You know what's going to go down from the beginning but it still feels tense and sudden when it finally comes. There is a lot of political maneuvering and odd religious beliefs and it isn't particularly easy to see where Herbert comes down on these issues, at least not in this book. He generally treats the religious stuff as if it's phony but then he has mystical events that seem to imply some of it is real.None of the characters are particularly likeable. Leto (Paul's father) probably comes off best but in the end he risked his entire family in a gambit to gain political power. Paul's mother Jessica is fiercely devoted to her family, but she's a Bene Gesserit and manipulates everybody else in addition to putting her son in mortal danger through her ambitions for him. Paul is much the same as his mother in that sense (he's trying to play at being god) and once he becomes the prophed Maud'Dib he becomes even worse and less understandable on a human level. His ability to see the future is one of my least favorite elements of the book since I don't think it was handled in a particularly interesting way.This is an eminently quotable book with such famous lines as \\"the spice must flow\\" and \\"fear is the mind killer.\\" Mot impressively of all these quotes do not seem at all out of place when seen in context. It also features a memorable world complete with endless deserts, Bedouin substitutes, and sandworms. Everyone says that this is the world that Tatooine was based off of and it's hard to disagree. Some other claims for Dune's influence are harder to agree with (Brian Herbert's afterward claims that everything from Spock to the Terminator is based off his father's work) but it has certainly had a major impact on the science fiction community.So I don't know, maybe I'm missing something but this book just doesn't do it for me. I read it when I was eleven and felt the same thing but I thought I'd give it another chance since I didn't like a lot of things then that I do now (the equally deserty Lawrence of Arabia for a start). But while I definitely appreciated it more now with the benefit of my extra years it still didn't thrill me like it does some people. It's certainly a decent book and I'd recommend that people read it but I don't understand all the excessive devotion. I found other classics like theFoundation TrilogyandThe Robot Seriesto be much more worthy of my time."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Solid read! A little slow at times, but a good 3rd Dune. I'm ready to see what appens next, which accomplishes the author's goal."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Back in the '80s, a TV commercial for a bath-water softener named Calgon featured a harassed, stressed-out woman. She says, \\"Calgon, take me away,\\" and is then transported to a bathtub surrounded by a calming, misty forest.When I face stresses I wish to escape, I don't use Calgon. I read The Lord of the Rings (J.R.R. Tolkien), The Dark Tower series (Stephen King), or Dune. This time I chose Dune.These three writers have created complete alternative worlds in which I can escape. The characters face seemingly unsolvable problems, but they keep on keeping on and they prevail. Luckily, I have the ability to lose myself in a well-told story, so these three, in particular, can \\"take me away.\\"Dune is the story of a feudal society of the future, when humans have spread to many planets. The Atreides House has been given control of Arrakis, a desert planet also known as Dune, which alone supplies \\"spice,\\" a substance that has geriatric qualities and also allows the pilots of the Spacing Guild to navigate from planet to planet. Treachery awaits them, and the Duke Leto Atreides is killed, but his 15-year-old son Paul and his concubine Jessica escape into the desert. There they must face the dangers of the environment, of the natives of the planet, and of the worms, giant (really, really giant) sandworms, who devour everything that they sense.Herbert has included every aspect of his created world in this book--the language patterns, the politics, the mythology, the religion, the life-style, the environment. His treatment of the science of desert ecology is apparently accurate (so I have read). Mysticism and mind-enhancing drugs also enter in, which may be one reason this book was so popular in the late '60s. This world is so clearly delineated that I would recognize it immediately if I ever found myself there.The plot here is intricate and not easily anticipated; the politics are also intricate; the characters are somewhat archetypal, but that is fitting.Suffice it to say, if you have the kind of mind that can suspend disbelief and escape from reality, you should read Dune and at least two of its sequels. If you have not read them already."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have always enjoyed the movie, and thought it about time to read the book. I was amazed on how many others stories, and details there were. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have read Dune fifty times and i still could read it another 50 times. This novel can be read by people who don't even like science fiction at all. Hubert's fantastic vision of mans far future is so real and profound that it could actually happen. The Characters are just superb and so real you could touch them. The Movie by lynch based on the novel is nothing like the book, but i've seen that movie a 100 times because i really love the Dune novel series. This novel is about Man's ultimate destiny in the cosmos in relation to the many archtypes of humanities various beliefs and the apothosis of those beliefs, which is the perpetual survival of the human species. This is a novel to be read and cherished as a true monument to human creativity."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is one of those books that I have started and abandoned many times over the years. This time, though, with Goodreads to motivate me, I pushed through, and I'm glad I finished it!The beginning of the book is very political. It begins with House Atreides moving to the desert planet Arrakis (known colloquially as Dune) to take over spice mining operations from the incumbent House Harkonnen at the behest of the Emperor. I really enjoy political intrigue and thrillers, and this stage of the book roped me in and kept me hooked.The middle of the book concerns itself more with people (I cannot say whom for fear of giving anything away) wandering around in the desert. Many pages and chapters are dedicated to this, and to describing how these people grow and change through their experiences. This is the phase where I most often gave up and put the book down, because I'm not a huge fan of desert survival.From around two thirds of the way through, the book returns to it's original political theme, only the stakes are far higher. It's about bribes and deals with guilds and the Imperium, and it's riveting stuff!The finale of the book is filled with action! I'm really glad I stuck with it this time around, as armies clash, cities and planets are annexed, and regimes are overthrown. The ending was absolutely amazing!Following the main story are three Appendices that go about explaining the ecology of Dune, the religion of Dune, and in particular an influential group known as the Bene Geserit. These are written in very much a scholarly tone, and I thoroughly enjoyed them. They may not be everyone's cup of tea, though.Another review I read on Goodreads about it complains about the archaic language used. I can see where the person who wrote that review is coming from. The entire book is written in a particularly dated English, including the dialogue. It was a little distracting, and it's true that people just don't talk like that any more... nor did they any more at the time this book was written.In conclusion, I think that this book may not be everyone's cup of tea, and it goes through ebbs and flows. But for me anyway, it was worth a read, and I enjoyed the way everything came together in the end."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I put off reading this a long time and finally got caught up to read it.

What the Lord of the Rings did for fantasy, Dune did for science fiction. A Desert World peopled by anentire race devoted to a single great cause!

The plot centers around a conspiracy to usurp thepower of Muad'dib (though there are side plots galore). Although the scope seems limited compared to Dune, there is plenty of intrigue to captivate readers of Dune. While not as gripping as Dune itself, Dune Messiah features new faces and new places, as well as old friends (some of whom are now enemies!!!), and enough fare to engross any reader. Read on!!!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Can I say more than what already has been said about this book? Dune is easily the most enthralling book I have ever read. Frank Herbert has managed to comment on many of our greatest worries (e.g. energy, religion, drugs), weaving them into a tapestry of interstellar proportions. The work takes place in the far future, where the politics of an entire universe is dependent upon a drug (Melange) which can be mined on only one planet: the desert Dune. Plot twists and intrigue abound in this greatest of Herbert's works. One small detail: if you read this work, be sure that you will read each of it's sequels (and there are five). Still, this is as pleasing of a punishment as you ever will receive, so take the risk!!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Thats it, actually.It is the best I've ever read, anyway.P.S.When you have read it, please visit alt.fan.dune for discussion of this awesome book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Revealing yet more conspiricies, and even more of Arrakis' secrets, Dune Messiah NEVER has a dull moment- I just COULDN'T PUT The booK DOWN!!!

Since reading Dune a mere four years ago, I have ravenously eaten up every other novel he has written, including reading the entire Dune series three times. He is profoundly brilliant in his complex story lines, adept observation of human character, and wonderful story teller. Dune is not only the best book I have ever read (It shares the number one spot with &quot;My Name Is Asher Lev&quot; by Chaim Potok), he is the greatest writer I have ever read, sharing that title with Chaim Potok.

I am speaking of the novel DUNE by Frank Herbert. A masterpiece of modern literature, DUNE is the greatest novel I have ever read. From the vile, perverted Harkonnens, to the savage but honorable Fremen, DUNE is filled with excitement, intrigue, and magic. In short, a must read. And don't miss the film, either. Despite what others may tell you, David Lynch made an imaginative, relatively faithful adaptation of this masterpiece. The film is as good a film as the novel is a book"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Most of what can be said about Dune has been said already, so let me throw in my two cents briefly.No other single science fiction book I know of creates such a marvelous, believable universe. From the religions of the future to the assassination weapons of the rich and targeted, from the mastery of mental and physical powers to the breeding program for a superbeing, and- ABOVE ALL- from the oceans and rivers of Caladan to the desolate, sandy wastes of Arrakis, it is easy to believe that Herbert researched this book for five years before writing it. This is a masterpiece. Buy it. Read it. And don't hold me responsible for any isolationary side effects."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The Dune books are a famous achievement in the science fiction literature world, and I think that the recognition is well-deserved. Herbert has found the perfect bridge between the two main camps of sci-fi fandom. For the purists, there is a well-detailed culture, realistic scientific advances, and a glimpse of a far future on a distant planet. For the pulp fan, there are giant sand worms that can swallow a spaceship whole, frequent action scenes, and heroes and villains to watch.Dune takes place mostly on the desert planet Arrakis, which is important because the giant sand-worms of the desert produce a valuable spice, that is worth a fortune. Arrakis has been under the control of an one of the \\"great Houses,\\" ruled by Baron Harkonnen. But it is about to come under the control of the heroic House Atreides, ruled by Duke Leto Atreides.The two houses comprise one side of the interstellar triangle of power that is formed by the Great Houses, the Emperor, and the Guild. House Harkonnen and House Atreides are feuding families, and both sides know that Baron Harkonnen will commit treachery during the transition. The treachery leaves House Atreides in ruins, and Duke Leto's son, Paul, who is the hero of the book, flees into the desert while the planet reverts back to Harkonnen rule. Over the following years, Paul grows in power as he assumes the role of religious leader of the desert people, the Fremen, who are coveted by the powers that be for their superior fighting abilities. Paul is a uniquely powerful individual, blessed with mental superpowers that are both difficult and unnecessary to relate.The end of the book features a conflict between the Fremen, led by Paul, and the Harkonnens and their intergalactic allies. Needless to say, the villains are vanquished, leaving a fresh hope for the Fremen, whose secret dream is to convert the planet from a land of sand into a more temperate world that will allow them to enjoy life.Herbert has painted an epic world, fully detailed, which incorporates the elements of many different mythos. Mysticism and technology coexist without overpowering the human conflicts and politics. Codes of conduct are reminiscent of knights from the Middle Ages, giving the interactions a flavor that bears the excitement of tales of that time. Herbert does a good job of balancing action and character development; he shows us a neverending story, and tells us just a piece of the ongoing tale. Dune is the first of five books written by the original author; his son has written three prequels, and there are probably countless spinoffs, as is the case with the Weiss/Hickman Dragonlance chronicles, and Star Wars.I also liked Dune because of the ecological message; the Fremen sacrifice their immediate comforts for the chance to be environmentally responsible in a good way, and it's interesting that this is an integral plot point.Dune asks for effort from its readers; the first fifteen pages were so much gibberish to me as I tried to begin to assimilate the names and terms that were specific to the world of the book. A criticism would be that there was too much of that kind of thing; but I guess that that's the flip side of the coin if you want to present a richly textured world."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This novel is quite simply the greatest work of imagination of all time. The time: the year 10,191. The place: the planet Arrakis. This is the story of humankind in an inconceivably distant future and a divergent society that is utterly unlike our own. Nevertheless, the triumph of this novel is that Frank Herbert makes this strange setting utterly real to the reader and every bit as internally consistent as today's world, despite its frank alieness from \\"modern day\\" 21st century society.Essentially, many millinieum from now, mankind has spread throughout the Galaxy by way of a hazardous faster-than-light means of space travel. The danger of space travel is mitigated by a single resource: the spice melange, which is available only on one planet in the galaxy: Dune, the planet Arrakis. Melange makes it possible for spaceship Navigators to foresee, and therefore avoid, the many hazards of space and space travel. This novel is the story of a struggle to control Arrakis and thereby control the Galaxy by controlling the one essential resource that makes all interstellar commerce possible.Herbert's characterizations are incomparably brilliant. The discerning reader will never forget Leto Atreides, the Lady Jessica, Paul Muad 'dib Atreides, the Naib Stilgar, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, and a host of other characters that Herbert conjures up seemingly effortlessly. This is a great story of human struggle on a titanic scale.Although this novel is somewhat hard going for the first time reader, the rewards of seeing it through are great, for this is a wonderful story of imagination, intrigue, struggle, and triumph. This review cannot begin to do justice to a novel that is quite simply a masterpiece of imagination."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Amidst the politics, the social playoffs, and the romance, Dune is certainly one of the best novels that I have ever read. Frank Herbert creates an amazing world where spice is sacred and water is treasure, and a struggle between the Atreides, the Harkonnens, and CHOAM reveal a new leader and a saint. Each chapter left me curious for more, and I eventually even moved onto reading the rest of the saga.Although some of the politics get drawn out sometimes, the novel itself is amazing and keeps you interested. It's a must read!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The book, Dune, by Frank Herbert is a futuristic science fiction novel involving loss and gain. The protagonist of Dune, Paul Atreides is the son and heir of the Duke Leto Atreides. In the beginning of the novel Paul lives very comfortably on his home planet of Caladan. He has the very best that his planet, similar to Earth, has to offer. Everything changes, however, when he and his family move to the desert planet, Arrakis, also known as Dune. Arrakis is one of the most inhospitable places inhabited by humans. The temperature is so great, and water so scarce that its inhabitants must wear stillsuits, gear that channels all of the human bodies released water into reservoirs that can be deducted from if necessary. Even the smallest amount of water is precious to the populace of Dune and its people have learned not to waste anything. Although Arrakis is extremely harsh to organisms that opt to inhabit it, there is one element that makes it special and preferred above other planets. It is the only source in the known universe of the essential Spice, a cinnamon-like substance used in foods that prolongs life. This Spice is the reason that Arrakis is a coveted planet among the houses of power in the universe.Only a short time after the Atreides arrival on Dune, the Atreides were betrayed by one of their own and a rival house, the Harkonnen, captured Paul, his father, Leto, and his mother Jessica. Duke Leto Atreides was killed but Paul and Jessica, a member of the ancient Bene Gesserit order, (a group of women who have special strengths and mind reading powers) escape into the desert. Paul was left stranded with only his mother in the middle of the harshest place in the universe, fleeing from the colossal sand-worms, organisms roughly the size of a space frigate who inhabit the sands of Arrakis and react to and kill anything that they sense moving on the surface of the sand. In this harsh position, Paul begins to think up a plan for him to regain his title and all that he had lost. His mission was to rally the Femen, the native nomads of Dune and unite them to fight against their common enemy, the Harkonnen. Rallying the Femen would prove to be no easy task however, scattered throughout the planet in different tribes, Paul had to gain their highest respect in order to gain anything from this venture. Although Paul is very smart and skilled in battle, it would prove a daunting task to unite the Fremen, defeat the Harkonnen, and regain his position as Duke of Arrakis.Frank Herbert's epic novel Dune is one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written, in my mind comparing only to The Lord of the Rings in its greatness. Dune is a truly timeless epic to be treasured for all eternity. I am currently enrapt in Dune's sequel, Dune Messiah, and am thoroughly enjoying it. Another aspect of Dune is the variety of excerpts from other made up books and biographies relating to Dune such as this poem...Frank Herbert's Dune is an incredible story with superb writing. It is a great science fiction novel ranking in my mind up with the Lord of the Rings and other classic sci-fi tomes. Overall, Dune is a timeless epic that will leave its mark on our society for generations to come."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I'll be the first person to admit that I'm not the biggest fan of science fiction, but Dune is a classic. After watching the original Dune movie, I felt that reading the book might be able to fill in some parts that I thought would be clearer and better explained in the book, and it did. Dune may be science fiction, but I felt that it was easier to read than other sci-fi books I've read. It didn't have the long sections of confusing (to me anyway) explanations of scientific principles and electronic equipment. Also, with the abilities of the Bene Gesserit, the book takes on some of the feel of a fantasy novel. Dune is based on a desert planet called Arrakis, where a substance simply referred to as spice is mined. The book starts with Paul Atreides growing into his role as the Muad'dib. After his family is betrayed by a friend of the family, through the plots of the House Harkonnen. Although the political intrigue was, at time, beyond me, the adventure of the story pulled me in. The first in an ongoing series, Dune is a classic in the science-fictions genre."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book was a complete let-down from the first one. The ending was well done, but other than that I cannot find anything at all good about this book. The first half of the book is completely pointless, unlike the first book we don't need to know about the characters because they are basically the same. The only reason I finished this book was to read the next book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I'm sitting here with this huge selection I've assembled in my TBR (To Be Read Pile) of sci-fi and fantasy books written within the last few years. I start one and put it down and then another with the same result. I've been doing this for days. The problem is that my early reads in this genre were so good that it's hard for anything else to fill their enormous footsteps. At the head of the class is &quot;Dune,&quot; a very intricate novel involving the casting out of young Duke Paul and his eventual return to claim what is his. It is a political struggle, a religious struggle, and most of all an interfamilial struggle. I couldn't help thinking of Shakespeare writing sci-fi fiction as the drama unfolded! This is an epic saga of towering imagination that will hold you enthralled. Deservedly, it won all the major sci-fi awards. It was made into a terrible movie and I hope someone remakes it eventually so that there is a worthy film version to the book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I am not a huge fan of all of Frank Herbert's books. Some of them have left me feeling very disappointed, but not Dune. It is a powerful novel that can stand alone comfortably, despite the sequels. In fact, the sequels are not in the same class; worth a read but not equal to his masterwork.Like some of the best books, you get a strong sense of history in Dune. We may be reading about a small part of one man's life but in it, we glimpse the sweep of time. Political machinations, that have been brewing for hundreds of years, are laid bare. We see secret organisations that have been working toward their lofty goals for millennia. And, family credos that have been refined over many generations. Paul Attreides is the product of all that and more.Dune is not a light book. You won't read it in an afternoon. But when it is finished, you will not be able to forget it. The characters you have read about, will become permanent fixtures in your mind. Duncan Idaho, Gurney Halleck and all the rest, will be the yardsticks by which you judge similar people in the future. The fact that they populate incredible worlds and live with creatures more strange than any out of legend, only makes the reading more enjoyable. If you don't have a copy of Dune in your collection, then you don't know science fiction."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is one of the best, if not THE best book I have ever read. Frank Herbert does a great job explaining the characteres and all their fealings through italics, which lets you have a insight that you wouldn't usually get in novels. The book is packed with tense scenes that are good even if you re-read them several times. The only problem I had with this book, is that it is not divided into chapters, which makes it EVEN harder to put down, so it's not really a problem I guess. It definitely scores a 5.Thanks, John Horsley"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I first read Dune six years ago after seeing the movie at a friend's house. I soon realized that the movie was barely a Cliff's Notes version, though it is a good pronunciation guide! There are simply too many plots and subplots to squeeze into 3-4 hours. The imagination of Frank Herbert is profoundly at the core. How could one person invent so many original concepts - the Bene Gesserit, the Mentats and the Guild for starters! And then to go on to so thoroughly and accurately codify human nature and societal nature in things like the Bene Gesserit axioms. It's as if he sat on top of a mountain and just studied humans, and our cultures and religions, for a few years. One of the greatest strengths as far as the plot goes is in developing three-dimensional characters. It is not always clear-cut who the villains are and who the heroes are - they are human, a compilation of good and bad, just like we all really are. The most two-dimensional is the overtly evil Baron, but in a book where the line between good and evil is so frequently blurred, it was probably a necessity for him to stand out as the villain. However, there are times when it's hard to hate even him too much. Not only is this a great book with an almost Shakespearean plot, but I believe I learn something new every time I pick it up. It can be a beginning point and and ending point in a study of human and cultural evolution, not forgetting the other books in the series, especially Book 3, Children of Dune. If it's possible for one's I.Q. to increase, this is one book that could do it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Is Dune Messiah as good as the original?

Many who have lost loved ones in the Jihad wonder why they followed who seems to be now just another megalomaniacal tyrant.The tragedy is that Paul does not want to be where he is, and really wants only to escape, leaving the future path to his heirs. The ghola Duncan, a blast from the past, only worsens his psyche but he can't destroy him, even as he knows the ghola is programmed to kill him. He's not completely helpless in the novel, as there are many plans up his sleeve as well.The ending is a satisfying conclusion, and it's recommended that you don't bother with the rest, as they become practically unreadable after this Messiah."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"dune is not only a book, it is a world in which you must immerse yourself. this is a daunting task in thd beginning of the book because there is so much to learn. a load of names of places, people and ideas.i personally enjoyed this book very much.as an avid sci-fi reader, it was obvious to me that this book should spawn the sci-fi literature we know today. frank herbert's works are not as widley know as say, issac asimov although Herbert played as big of a role in the modern evolution of this delightful genre.purchase dune and immerse yourself in a new intergalactic environment with herbert's first installment of Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a classic.

It took him several years to write the novel, and it shows. There are a lot of things in this novel. It tackles drug addiction, oil, mysticism, eastern religion, several other philosophys from the stance of a sci-fi/fantasy. It's a modern day epic in my mind. Just 'cause it is sci fi doesn't mean its not literary, either. Herbert has a lot to say, and he says it in the intrigue of this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a five star book because it deserves the honor. This book is perfect and of thousand of books written per year it's doubtful there is a book of this quality produced every five years.The main character in the book is Paul, the son of Duke Leto. Paul and his family have to move to Dune, a desert world. It is at Dune that the ordeal of Paul and his family begin.The novel Dune could best be called a science fiction version of Lawrence of Arabia. But this isn't quite true. Dune has some plot similarities, such as a stranger in a strange land becomes a leader of a revolt. However, Dune is so much more than that.There are lots of politics and opposing forces in Dune. There is the Guild, this group controls interstellar space transportation. There is the Sisterhood, a group of women looking to use eugenics in a quest to produce the ultimate human being. There are the Harkonnen, a vicious group of people who wish to exterminate Paul and his family for a past perceived slight. Another force is the Fremen, the inhabitants of Dune itself. Last, there is the Planet Dune.Dune is a perfect world. Dune requires perfection. If you are less than perfect you die. The enviorment is as unforgiving as space. Basically, it has no water. A world like Dune should either keep people away or invite terra forming. However, this is not done. It is on Dune that \\"Spice\\" is found. Spice's other name is Melange.Spice is the driving force in this book. Spice is everything. Spice allows the Guild pilots to peer into the future to allow faster-than-light spaceships to navigate in space. Spice allows very long life for humans who take the drug. The trouble is Spice is addictive. If you quit taking Spice you die.Dune is the only source of Spice. The economy of the universe depends on the free flow of Spice.Frank Herbert's Dune is a perfect book because it takes place nearly 8,000 years in the future. It removed from our modern world by sheer volume of time. Everything has changed. The Catholic church has survived as the only religion but not as something we would recognise. The \\"Orange Catholic\\" Bible is an amalgamation of all the worlds religions. Guilds control working life. Planets have been populated by people, and have been populated for thousands of years. An emperor governs the galaxy. However, his power depends more on alliances power rather than his own monopoly of power.Herbert's Dune is full of political forces fighting for the planet. All of them want the Spice and raw power.What makes the book so timeless, it was written over 40 years past, are some parts read like how the people of today would act them out. Example, people in the future use personal \\"shields\\" for protection. If a laser hits a shield the energy release produces an near nuclear sized explosion. One of Paul's bodyguards rigs up a shield because some attacking enemy troops are using lasers in an attack.After the explosion a briefing is given to Baron Harkonnen. You can just see the word \\"spin\\" leap off the pages. The Baron ends up thinking to himself \\"it was pretty bad\\" despite the briefer's wish to give a different impression to Baron Harkonnen.The book is full of examples like that. It's over 10,000 ACE and some basic things about people have not changed. A Fremen woman steals damp rags, sells the squeezed water to beggars, and commits pilferage against Paul's family. The Fremen see Duke Leto risk his life to save the crew of a Spice mining machine, the Fremen are impressed with his concern for his men.Another thing is thinking machines, computers, are banned in the future. Why? They are used to oppress people and a revolt led to their destruction. Amazing that Frank Herbert in the early 1960s had to foresight to see the oppression that we will be living with in the future.Paul himself is a perfect character for Dune. The book starts with Paul as a young teenager. The book concludes with his as a young man, sure of himself and in control of all around. We get to see a man who was bred, literally, to be summation of all people in the universe. Paul makes the connection between the worms and Spice. Paul builds up the Fremen to be the ultimate soldiers in the Universe.My poor words do not do justice to this book. I re-read Dune ever five years. Yes, the book is that good. I always find something I miss in the book.Now, Dune has been made into a wretched big screen movie. That was back in '82 and I suppose the makers of the film just threw money at Frank Herbert until he agreed to make the movie. It's terrible. Avoid it. Dune has been made into a Science-Fiction channel movie. It's not bad. It's not in the same class as the book, what mini-series is? However, if you don't want to spend the energy reading Dune, Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune then they are not too bad.Warning, I gave up reading the Dune series after God Emperor of Dune. Past that point, over 5,000 years removed from Dune, you wonder if the government that poor Arrakis (it's not Dune at that point) got would have been any worse if the Harkonnen been in charge.Dune is a perfect book.

Paul's mother belongs to the Bene Gesserit, an elite group of women who have fine-tuned their muscles and nerves to the point of absolute control. The Bene Gesserit have a secret breeding plan for all the nobles of all the worlds to create the one they call Kwisatz Haderach, a male Bene Gesserit with fearsome powers. But Paul's mother disobeyed the Bene Gesserits' order to bear a girl child, and had Paul. Now Paul must learn to survive on a desert planet, and comes to realize that he may indeed be the Kwisatz Hederach.Herbert's futuristic world has amazing characters and a captivating plot. The Bene Gesserit way is extremely fascinating to me. I found the idea of absolute control over the body and mind incredible. Their ability to hold completely still or to move only a single muscle was amazing to me. I also liked the desert people of Dune. Their society was so different from ours and was portrayed with great detail. They aren't at all wasteful like us today, and conserve everything to the point where they lose only a thimbleful of body water each day while living in the desert.

It had everything in it: Adventure, Action, Romance, Drama, Comedy. If you haven't read this book then you have missed out. And hopefully ever science fiction fan has read this, it's a classic."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is probably the greatest Science Fiction book you can find, excluding Fantasy. If I were to recommend someone (especially someone who doesn't read Science Fiction) a Science Fiction novel, Frank Herbert's Dune is what I would primarily recommend. Frank Herbert adds myriad, quite verbose and hard to read details to intensify the condition of this story. While these details may be considered unneeded to some people, without them many people would probably be reading Arabian Nights even though these two books are scarcely similar.Frank Herbert creates a nearly uninhabitable landscape for the moisture-lacking desert planet of Arrakis for the Atreides family including Paul, the main character, to live on. However, Arrakis was once inhabited by House Atreides' archenemy, House Harkonnen and is also currently inhabited by Arrakis natives called Fremen during the story. The Fremen are an intelligent race that do everything they can to survive on the planet which includes wearing special suits called stillsuits to preserve the \\"body's water.\\"Adding yet another variable to the living conditions on Arrakis are the colossal sandworms; many are larger than whales. They reside under the sand and can hear movements on the sand's surface. They hunt down travelers and spice factories alike, completely consuming anything moving on the surface of the sand. Fremen have adapted to this way of life but people like the Atreides have much to learn.There are two things that are valuable on Arrakis. One is water and the other is m&eacute;lange spice. Spice is the only reason why people other than Fremen inhabit Arrakis. It is the major export and profit maker of Arrakis. It is addictive like a drug to and is prized among the wealthy outside Arrakis. Atreides make portable spice factories to mine this spice despite their high vulnerability to sandworms.15 year-old Paul Atreides has intelligence beyond perceptibility in this novel. He is the son of the Duke Leto Atreides, leader of the Great House Atreides. Much of his intelligence comes from special training, but it is easy to doubt this is where he gets all of his superhuman adeptness. He is burdened by a self-founded \\"terrible purpose.\\"I really enjoyed this book. It isn't a book that I couldn't put down. It's too much of a mind-draining book to read it continuously for hours. I wouldn't recommend trying to read this book all at once. Dune gives you an idea of how good your present living situations are compared to the characters in this book. This is a book that I would have regretted not reading.Tyler H."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The background against which Herbert sets &quot;Dune&quot; is Humankind's struggle for survival. Against this curtain he examines such issues as the dynamics of religion and politics especially when the two collide in the body of a messiah, Paul Muad' Dib Atreides. Herbert also created a rich environment in which he could explore questions that faced society at the time he was writing the novel.The characters in &quot;Dune&quot; are incredibly dynamic and engaging. While readers may not like the old Baron Harkonnen,they will have a complete understanding of who he is and what his motivations are. Paul, Leto, Jessica, Gurney, and Stilgar are characters easy to identify with and readers will find themselves living the the story through those characters.&quot;Dune&quot; is a convoulted story with many twists and turns or as Herbert would say: &quot;it is a feint in a feint in a feint and so on into infinty&quot;.

I wish I had read it sooner. I reccomend this book to the young Sci-Fi reader (there are battles and giant worms and space craft), to the young adult (learn a little about how fuedal politics work as well as conservation), and the adult alike (apply water discipline to your business and see how it changes).A book that transcends the author and format itself, a true marvel of writing.

The best book i've ever read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert's Dune describes a futuristic political power struggle with an underlying lesson that teaches us about the human condition of adaptation. The power struggle is centered on a need for a substance called \\"the spice\\" and involves several parties, including the Imperium, the Harkonnens, the Atreides and the Guild. This power struggle sends the main character, Paul Atreides, into the deep southern Arrakeen desert where he has to learn how to live on a dry, worm infested, desert. Dune demonstrates the idea that humans must adapt to their environments in order to survive. One of the earlier examples of adaptation is the use of still suits. Still suits are specially designed garments, made by Fremen (natives of Arrakis), which prevent the loss of bodily-water. These garments are essential in the deep desert because there are no water sources. Paul and his mother, Jessica, have never before used still suits on their home planet, Caladan, so they had to adapt to the desert and learn to use them. Without the still suits, the two would not have survived their escape to the south, and could not have found the Fremen. It is the Harkonnen's lack of quality still suits that kept them from exploring the deep desert. This adaptation is very essential to the plot because there would have been no story if they hadn't found the Fremen; Paul and Jessica would be dead. Paul had to learn the Fremen ways. Like how land, air and sea power are utilized on Earth, the Fremen utilize \\"desert power\\" on Arrakis. Desert power is more important that anything else on Arrakis because of the simple fact that Arrakis is all desert. Desert power involves the effective use of all desert resources; using worms for the water of life and transportation, sandstorms to knock out shields on an assault, and spice to enhance the mind. The Fremen taught Paul their religion, and all of the aspects of desert power. If he had not adapted to the desert by learning the Fremen ways, Paul would not have learned that the spice opened up his revelations and he would not have been able to mount the successful final assault on the Imperial city. Neither the Harkonnens nor the Sardaukar (Imperial forces) had desert power so they were massacred (3 dead Imperials to every 1 Fremen) when fighting in the desert. Learning the Fremen ways seems to be the most important adaptation in the novel; Paul couldn't have survived and taken back the Imperial city without it. Paul's adaptations through the novel were directly related to the plot. It shows that people cannot survive in an environment without adequately changing to meet that environment's requirements. Ultimately, the book shows how the better-adapted fremen with Paul beat the unready Imperial forces and Harkonnens. This novel very effectively combines great descriptions of the setting and characters, with an intricate plot that utilizes the thoroughness of its characters and setting. It is a masterpiece of science fiction and I recommend it to anyone who has to time to read a long novel."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"behold the mighty universe of dune! Its so perfect and flawless and oh so great and mighty! Not really, this novel is a snoozer, Frank Herbert always wants you to guess, so much has happened, great cities have been built, Paul rules the entire universe, the book does not really go into any of this, the follow up to the incredibly gripping DUNE is pretty dull. Its very predictable in some parts and in those parts it never follows up on it and acts like it never happened. The Dune universe is still shrouded in mystery, the book does not go into as much detail as you'd like it too. It seems all the characters do is sit around and talk and talk and talk about things you could have already guessed.Duncan Idaho's return is great and now you finally get to the know the character and Paul's exile into the desert forever changing his seeing into the future curse is a fresh breath of air into the Dune universe.Nothing much happens in this book but its a great opening for Children of Dune which is probably the greatest Dune book ever.Buy them all, its worth owning every single book, this is the weakest one but it gets better and better."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I first read this book about 14 years ago when I was in high school.

I probably read hundreds of book during those teen years. My favoriate place to go was the library. I couldn't tell what most of those books I read were about or the names of most of those book, but I do rememeber what Dune was about. This book is a epic story about religous beliefs, hallucinogenic visions, man overcoming nature, personal betrayal, and how the hardships of life and love make you stronger. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to look at life from a non-main stream cultural and religious prospective. I think this is the best book of the Dune series."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"First off, I have a slight phobia towards science fiction. I was left unimpressed by it when I was younger, too many corny aliens and spaceships. So that it is understood, I am not usually a big fan of Science Fiction genre. But, Dune is a fantastically written book. Frank Herbert certainly has a way of pulling the reader into the heart of the plot, which is most tense once it gets up to full speed. I felt as if I was a bystander watching everything that occurred and for me that style is fascinating. The first parts of the book are slow, not tedious, but it seemed to me as if I were moving at turtle speed-unusual since I normally read quickly. The read is only slow because Herbert is dishing out a lot of information that is quite helpful for understanding the rest of the novel. After I passed the thick reading, the whole book was very easy to speed through. I would have finished last week had it not been for the appendixes at the end of the book. I am even tempted to skip the last ten pages or so of appendix because it is starting to become the &quot;tedious&quot; that the beginning was not. This is why I decided not to give it five stars. I would recommend Dune to everyone. There are some higher level thinking topics, but even if one prefers not to ponder too deeply Dune is exciting on a less intense level, too. Frank Herbert did a spectacular job on this book. Next week I am going to pick up the sequels at the library. I wonder if they can measure up to the high standard set by Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have not finished the novel yet but I wish to do so very soon.

The novel has a lot of science fiction in it and I usually do not read science fiction novels but I thought I would give it a try and I am glad that I did. The planet arrakis sounds like it would be a good place to live but I am not sure if I would want to live there because of some of the stuff that happens. After I get done with this novel I may read some other novels by Frank Herbert because I am starting to like his work and he seems like a good author.

VERY POWERFUL."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune by Frank Herbert/ Science Fiction; Chilton Book Co., 1965:Sometimes one man can make every single person?s lifelong dream come true. This notion is effectively conveyed in Frank Herbert?s science fiction masterpiece, Dune, published in 1965. Just like many science fiction novels, Dune takes place at an unknown time. Dune could have taken place many years ago or could take place many years in the future. Dune is the story of the Ducal heir, Paul, of House Atreides, later called Muad?Dib. Herbert tells of Paul?s quest to avenge his family?s demise, and about the consequences of such a quest. Laced into this epic tale are elements of theology, and the majestic power one single prophecy can hold over an entire race. The prophecy was that a man would come who would change the face of the desert planet, Arrakis, the capital of House Atreides. This man would fulfill humankind?s most impossible dream, water on Arrakis. He would also be the rightful ruler of all humankind. He would be called the Lisan al-Gaib ? Guess what? Paul is the Lisan al-Gaib. Herbert writes in a highly detailed and logical fashion. Although Dune is an extremely descriptive book, Herbert writes in such a way that a reader cannot help but remember all the small details in Dune. This quote from page 466 shows Herbert?s writing style: ?He was warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous, ruthless, less than a god, more than a man. There is no measuring Muad?Dib?s motives by ordinary standards.? The same can be said of Herbert?s writing, it surpasses ordinary standards. In my opinion, Dune is one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time. Touching on religious and superstitious beliefs, Dune almost undetectably deals with issues that were happening when Dune was written. I believe that Dune gives a person incentive to do something with his/her life. It inspires a person by showing that nothing is impossible if a person tries hard enough. Herbert?s omnipresent view of conserving resources, especially water, will make one think about conservation. The reader of Dune is like a fish; once you are caught, it is hard to escape. --Ben Mandel, Greenwich CT."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune demonstrates one of the best blends of both religion, sci-fi, politics, and adventure amidst the backdrop of a brilliant universe, rivalling that of any other.An entire universe and it's history had the benefit of being largely supported by some amazingly in-depth back story by Frank Herbert.The political schemes that the different houses come up with could easily make a persons head spin, as well, the legendary lore associated with the mystical/religous history of the different cultures is also a treat. It's very cool how they associate the Catholic Church through some of the ancient writings. Very interesting, showing it more as an institution of power that lasts far into the future, even after dropping it's Christian fundamentals.And that's just an extremely small example of the backstory that Frank Herbert provides us with...the movie is nothing like the book, I might add."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This was the first trek onto the sands of Dune, the first tale of Paul Muad'Dib and the Atriedes name that would haunt the planet of Arrakis forever. This novel stands as a true pinnacle of science fiction, the alpha and omega of fantasy. Mind you, I am not a Dune fanatic that believes every novel ever touched by Frank Herbert is gold. I simply believe that this novel is one of the most finely crafted masterpieces of all time.We are presented with a word unlike no other. The Imperium is headed by an ignorant Emporer, and feuding houses war against each other in a legalized game of assassination. Two feuding houses, Atriedes and Harkonnen, battle for control of the planet where melange, the spice and currancy of the Imperium, is found. This spice allows mystical power and longevity, to say the least. And with this simple outline, the world of Dune is created.With social, political, environmental, and religious strands woven into this grand tapestry, we are shown the world of Dune. Never have we seen a world on such a grand scale...a world that we can actually see and feel. This is not a world of paper, but a world of color, life, and spice. We are not visitors of the world, but wanderers of Dune, Fremen travelling the sands.Yet, I am not going to rave about the book without giving small rants (every novel, not matter how great has some flaws). At some points, this novel can drag. Many of the dialogue is internal, and the long winded sentences can slow some down (many reasons why my companions have thrown down the book). Yet, there is another part of this novel that I loved, yet many others hated: the novel is deep. Deep, enthralling, detailed, and engrossing, and many readers are not ready for that level of experience.So, in conclusion, if you are a reader of science fiction and fantasy, or are just looking for a good read, pick up Dune, and live the life of Dune once more."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The descriptiveness Herbert applies to every aspect of this novel is unbeleivable.

So it's not rapid-fire action at all times.The story, though, is well worth it. One of the greatest ever written. I remember, years ago, reading that it had sold &quot;ten million copies&quot;, some kind of record at the time. Surely it has sold more, now.This novel is brilliant, and worth the effort. Think of the time it takes as the long drive from home to Disneyworld.For those who care: One obvious thing Herbert was trying to examine was how a &quot;hydraulic monopoly&quot; effects society. This is when something essential to existence is controlled by a single authority.He also looks deeply into politics, religion, and economics in general.But it's all done in the context of the story, not as boring lectures, and you need never even be aware that it's happening, you can simply be captivated by the story itself."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Well, after reading all of the other reviews on Dune it is pretty clear that most people feel that Dune is rightfully one of the classic Sci-Fi pieces.

I have also noticed that many well known science fiction movies borrow from elments of Dune, such as the almighty Zarlack in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; cannot possibly be misconstrued as anything other than a giant sandoworms of Arrakis. This is obviously a winning formula. In seceral editions of Dune, a feviewer refers to it as being &quot;a story that will live in the imagination of all those that read it&quot; This could not be more true.

A masterpiece, nuff said."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I always knew that Dune was one of the milestones in the genre, the seminal masterwork that influenced many other writers and visionaries. Herbert's well-known opus has transcended all of my expectations.

Paul, Jessica, Halleck, and Hawat are completely different people by the end of the book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I've always believed that great art is a piece where looking at it in awe, you say to yourself &quot;How could this be done by human hands?&quot; Dune is just that."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Most science fiction is about contemporary humans in futuristic situations. Dune is a rare look at how humans and human institutions might change over time, and that is why it is considered so visionary. Herbert has deliberately suppressed technology here to leave himself free to address the future of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's tools. Dune is also a massive, fascinating story set in one of the richest universes ever created for science fiction. However, people who don't like the book are right to point out that it is long, sometimes overblown, and Herbert is given to having his characters give utterance to endless, repetitive soliloquies. It's not everyone's cup of tea. But if you can stick with it and get past the awkward passages, you will be well rewarded."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I don't think of Dune just as a simple fiction story.

It has suspense, adventure, treachery, and supernatural powers. All of these areas are used to create a philosophical outlook on the idea of human consciousness.

I remember reading the entire series in school and being engrossed in the story. Now, having stopped reading fantasy and sci-fi except for \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", I was wondering how I would look at Dune as literature. Interestingly, \\"Dune\\" is a \\"Reading List\\" book in Montgomery County Libraries, a well deserved indicator of its classic status.The pace of this first book is outstanding. You get the background necessary on the Atreides family's departure from their lush home of Caladan to the dangerous, though potentially more lucrative, world of Dune. Herbert skillfully reveals how this royal family has to adapt to the extreme conditions of the desert world. The theme of prophesy and destiny is also there from the outset with Paul Atreides trial with the Bene Gesserit \\"gom jabbar\\". The book has action, war, politics, philosophy, religious meditation, scarcely concealed environmental commentary and wonderful characters. Paul's evolution from insightful adolescent to desert prophet is the central theme of the story, but the political and military struggles between the Harkonnens and the Atreides family is equally compelling. The shifting allegiances of the struggle and the historical backgrounds that introduce each chapter are the tale telling of Herbert the master. This book is immensely ambitious and, for the most part, succeeds in creating a compelling world with compelling characters.I can't help stating a few things that struck me as minor flaws. The polar opposites of good and evil were a little tough for me to take at times. Duke Leto is potrayed almost as an innocent saint and Baron Harkonnen is portrayed as irredemably evil. For a book that usually tries to model real political drama in a sci-fi context, Harkonnen especially was hard to stomach at times.The philosophy and religion of the Bene Gesserit were interesting to me, but I think the politics are stronger than the spiritual in the book. Other readers and reviewers may disagree here, however. I'm more concerned with the Bene Gesserit and the religion of dune in future books. In contrast, Herbert's approach toward seeing the future, a philosophical core idea of the book is outstanding. Paul's struggle to negotiate vision, prophesy and leadership will challenge all to think about the challenges and responsibilities of predictions.There are a few key silent periods; Herbert sometimes chooses to skip a few years to maintain the pace. I don't know if they exist, but I'd like to hear tales of how Paul started leading Fremen raids or how the Harkonnens oppressed the everyday citizens of Dune. Like the history of our world, the history of Dune often neglects the everyday citizens who had to operate in the midst of conflict. Here, though, I understand Herbert. It's more that I dig the book so much that I want to know more about Dune in this time period than that I think Herbert could have written a significantly better book.I dig Dune even better than the Star Wars world, especially given Lucas' flawed efforts in the prequels. It's just harder to write visually stunning stuff for movies in a bland desert than in \\"a galaxy far, far way\\". Still I can't help but wonder if Lucas borrowed any ideas in constructing Tattoine?Kind of wandering here, but I hope everyone gets the point. This is great sci-fi, not to be missed if you've get any interest in the genre at all.6 stars!!!--SD"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is the kind of book that defines Epic. The story spans generations, but every character has depth and interest. It is a fascinating read for any science fiction fan, and especially for anyone who has felt that he is - or SHOULD have been - made for greatness. In particular, this is a book that both men and women of any age will enjoy.One big caveat - DON'T buy the Ace paperback, it's disintegrating. It's worth buying the hardcover version, anyway."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"One of the best scifi books ever written. The imagination and the planning that had to go into these books is just simpley amazing. Even though I don't agree with all of Frank Herbert's politics, the books are still amazing. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes sci fi even though the reading is a bit tough, and i might take a few chapters to understand still a great book, well worth you money."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Contrary to some others opinions, this book was just as good as the first. Frank Herbert once again works his magic in creating a book that you can't put down. I finsished it in less than three days, mostly reading at home and during Latin. But I digress. Dune Messiah is a worthy addition to the Dune saga, proving that once again Frank Herbert is the best Sci-Fi writer of all time. This book deals more about how Paul/Muad'Dib rules the massive empire that his jihad has taken over. No spoilers, but the end of this book has you saying goodbye to some beloved characters. I won't give away the story, but it as just as great as the first. I DEFINITELY reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I've read this book twice, with about ten years in between. I liked it even better the second time - - I believe that was because I was in a better position to ponder the intricacies of the plot, which is incredibly involved, in both time and space. I sometimes think it was Frank Herbert's vision of a galactic empire that was the inspiration behind the Galactic Republic in the Star Wars movies and novels.Of course, the star of this novel of conflict and war is the desert planet Arrakis itself, or Dune, where giant sand worms roam the desert and make the invaluable spice melange that makes it possible for the giant space craft of the Spacing Guild to travel between the stars by folding space. The spice melange, which also turns the whites of your eyes blue, is what everybody is fighting about. And on Arrakis, water is worth gold too, can power an army, and is being secretly hoarded by the Fremen, the native desert people of Arrakis, who are also waiting for their messiah to lead them to freedom.The ideas and concepts behind this story are simply mind boggling. So rich are the characters and elements in the plot that it has never been equaled: the secret order of the Ben Gesserit, the evil Harkonnens and their even worse leader Baron Vladimir, the Spacing Guild that controls intersteller travel, the Emperor and his fanatic Saudaukar troopers, the boy messiah Paul Atreides, his father Duke Leto Atreides, the all-blue-eyed desert Fremen of Dune, the Dune planetary ecologist Pardot Kynes, the sand worms, and more.I can nitpick, however. I've always thought that the author needed to do some work to present the beginning of the story better. The beginning reader has simply no idea of the richness of the universe that will shortly unfold, and can get somewhat lost and confused in the beginning, which is why it's a book that can be read twice. I remember the first time I read it that I was tempted to give up on it after the second chapter, because I was quite confused, even alienated. I continued, however, because I had been warned in advance that this might happen, and I'm now passing the warning on.My only other nitpick is about the atomic weapons Paul and the Fremen use in the big battle at the end of the story. For the life of me, I've never been able to figure out how they got their hands on nuclear weapons, which require extensive industrial processing to make; there was no sign of any such plant among the Fremen. But this is probably just a minor plot flaw, of no significance to this magnificent story. The book is a classic that will endure forever."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It's about time this modern classic became part of the secondary school curriculum. Hey, maybe some forward-thinking teachers have already introduced it into a classroom. So many of today's authors and filmmakers have been influenced by this book, it seems rather retrograde to ignore it. Rite of passage, societal obligations, moral ambiguities--it's all in there, and, in my opinion, is a much more worthy work than some of the material I was forced to read in my HS years."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The Dune Trilogy, written by award winning author Frank Herbert, is a spellbounding trilogy that captures the hearts of billions. At first glance, Dune seems no more than another tale of fueds and conspiracies, but after reading the book through, it is a complex, deep story that will keep you from putting the book down. The Dune Chronicals is by far one of the most compelling pieces of writting in modern literature and is science-fiction's answer J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings'. Dune is a grand story and should never be without the rest of the Dune Trilogy that ties it's concept together. I myself am looking forward to the conclusion of the Dune Chronicals in Brian Herbert's 'Hunters of Dune' and 'Sandworms of Dune'."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Really good book :) It is very easy to read, and the flow is really good!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The great cosmic Jihad has swept across the known universe. Everywhere the Fremen legions are victorious. The old corrupt order is gone or driven into the shadows. However, this has not been done without a cost: 61 billion dead, 20 planets sterilized, 500 planets totally broken and demoralised, the followers of 40 religions exterminated....But the greatest tragedy, perhaps, is that Paul Muad'dib has been enthrowned and deified by the legions and the new priesthood. Blood rights are being practiced in his name. His sister, St. Alia of the knife, is also worshiped as a virtual battle goddess. For all his powers, Muad'dib knows that not even he can renounce godhood once bestowed. He also comes to realise that while his legions love him, he doesn't necessarily have total control of them or \\"his\\" priests.Yet, he also knows that it could have been even bloodier without his guidance. Indeed, if he flees into exile, or even dies, the future will become unimaginable worse- without someone with his superhuman powers to moderate the storm.

For this book most were 5 stars. This book is a must read for any sci-fi fan but the content is somewhat dry, literally.

Our hero is 15 when he comes upon the desert people who begin to worship him as one of their own. Author Frank Herbert did a fine job on this book, it is filled with information and you can picture it, I think a bit too much.

Here are some reflections from my recent re-read of this classic: in a master stroke, the author makes his characters as beautifully waterless as his landscape. Not a hint of frivolity, not a moment of wit or humor do any characters display through their hundreds of pages. Romance is all serious passion, childhood subverted by the harsh political climate. Just as human life must hold on with grim strength on the barren Arrakis, so Paul, Jessica and the rest forebear all light-heartedness and even wasted dialogue, focusing grimly on the need to survive, politically and physically. Perhaps a callow reader might long for Jessica to try to stump Chani with a knock-knock joke . . . but such devices would be as destructive to this work as taking a noontime stroll on Arrakis without a stillsuit."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"To borrow a line from a film adaption of this novel: \\"When politics and religion ride in the same cart, the whirlwind follows.\\" Frank Herbert's Dune is easily one of the most layered works of fiction produced during the twentieth century. From examining byzantine political gambits to the human penchant for hero worship, Herbert using a far-flung future setting to examine the best and worst aspects of human nature. Dune is easily one of the primary masterpieces of science fiction despite being a dense, somewhat difficult book for the average reader.To read the rest of the review, please visit The King's Crier, Books Reviews.

Anderson prequels and two sequels. Lately I have been revisiting the original six Dune novels. OK, so I have a lot of time on my hands. I am a big fan of long form science fiction. I got into it in high school in the 50's with Isaac Asimov's Foundation Series. DUNE is far more interesting once the reader continues beyond the opening story to follow \\"The Golden Path\\". Some reviewer or other said the story was humorless. What could be more humorless than \\"1984\\" or \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"? In DUNE the human race just barely escaped more than a thousand years of slavery under the oppression by their own machines. During the following millennia all human institutions had to be remade. I see the situation as similar to the Renaissance after a thousand years of darkness at the fall of Rome. All authority was in the hands of closely held insular institutions and conflict was only resolved by war or alliances of families. Religions and secret societies ruled for another 500 years. In DUNE Chronicles we get a much expanded and detailed version. As a result of the Machine Revolution and the rebuilding the human race had evolved in unexpected directions and then settled into a violent form of stagnation. In DUNE an unexpected element appears and unhinges all that stagnation and releases pent-up passions. Thus the human race begins a desperate race against total destruction by unknown forces. Reading Dune is much like reading Moby Dick or War and Peace, much elaborate dialogue and description building to the occasional climax."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"So I had heard about this book from my father when I was younger but didn't know if I'd actually like it even though I'm a huge fan of sci-fi/fantasy novels. The concept of a desert with sand worms just reminded me of the movie Tremors and the last thing I wanted to do was read the novel version of that terrible movie, boy was I wrong. Dune is an epic novel that tells the story of Paul (later Muad-Dib) who aspires to overthrow an evil Baron for a treacherous plot against his family.Almost from the instant I started reading I began noticing obvious similarities between Dune and the Star Wars franchise (I'm a huge fan of BOTH). Arrakis is similar to Tatooine and has indigenous inhabitants who remind me a bit of the Sandpeople...only much more bad ass! Paul has been taught many tricks by his mother and father to help him become a strong leader. His mother in particular is a Bene Gesserit, a band of people that are like a cross between the Jedi and the Genoharadan (for KOTOR fans)..only much less bad ass, and Paul appears to have skills beyond the dreams of either of his parents. I could count the many other ways I was reminded of Star Wars (crysknife/lightsaber) but that's not the purpose of this review.The fact that this novel has inspired so many important pieces of work has proven that the world that Frank Herbert created is a masterpiece of human imagination that successfully made the leap from mind to paper without being an unintelligible jumble like so many novels in the genre become. I recommend Dune to anyone who loves sci-fi or fantasy. I also assure you that yes, it is possible to love Dune and to love Star Wars. It may seem like a daunting book at first (too me 2 weeks to force myself to move past the first chapter) but if you give it a chance it will take you on a journey to a land that you won't soon forget!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Reaaly Great I felt I was there most of the time Characters strong and believable and plot well thought out"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"From my blog:Last year I got it in my head that I wanted to read all those classics that true sci-fi book nerds are supposed to have read, and Dune was definitely on that list. When I am mentally able, I really love a good classic sci-fi novel. There is something so satisfying about the slower pace and lack of hand-holding of the classic style. Dune is an excellent example of this style in fact, something that makes it wonderful if that is what you are looking for, but horrible if you just pick it up at the airport because it looks interesting and you are bored....Title: DuneAuthor: Frank HerbertPages: 474 (paperback and not including the appendices)Premise: Paul Atreides noble family moves to the desert planet Arrakis only sort of against their wishes. The people on this planet have some strange legends that Paul's mother seems to have some hand in and a political plot against his family is soon making their lives even more interesting. As they then deal with the repercussions of those plots, it becomes clear that those legends are much more than just legend.Setting: Arrakis is a harsh world that holds a great treasure: spice. It is fairly addictive, has wonderful health and mental benefits and attracts GIANT worms on the already fairly inhospitable planet. Those worms are also attracted simply by the patterned vibration of walking on sand though, so it's not really the spice's fault if you get eaten harvesting it. The native people, however, have found ways to deal with all these difficulties and so have free access to the spice. Between their diet and their adaptations to the harsh environment, they have some very interesting differences both biologically and culturally.Strengths:Absolutely amazing world buildingVery well thought out native cultureComplicated and well developed political structureInteresting character developmentVery cool ways of describing the psychic sort of powers that developEco-friendly message :DWeaknesses:If you aren't that interesting in political intrigue, the politics get a bit boring in the beginningA complicated world means that there is a steep learning curve for the vocabulary and customs for the readerThe book is definitely more world focused than character focusedAs I said in the intro, it is classic sci-fi and so it is definitely not an easy readSummary: It's classic for a reason and got a lot of awards and recognition. It is an absolutely amazing world and I have to applaud Herbert for how thoroughly he must have thought about what life on a desert planet would have done to a people both biologically and culturally. An example of this is that the native people learn in childhood that you don't cry because it wastes so much water. This makes the act of crying exceedingly significant in their culture. I think it's safe to say that anyone who loves sci-fi really should read one of the great classics just to experience this amazing world.More reviews at [...]"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A lot of people are not fans, but I think it's better than the first or the third since it focuses on Paul, his thinking, and his power.

So when Dune popped up at the top of almost every list I saw I decided that I had to read it. There were some interesting concepts I loved but ultimately the book didn't really do it for me.::: Things I liked :::-The concept of Arakis (Dune) being a desert world with a unique ecosystem etc.-The idea of blue-eyed Freeman with stillsuits and all their other abilities got me really excited.-How the worms and spice were related was fascinating!::: Things I didn't like :::-This book has extensive politicking in it and does not really provide any background for why the political groups are at each other's throats-I found myself confusing characters and I realized half way through my read that it was because they were forgettable or didn't seem to have real human reactions and emotions.-Prepare yourself for a long wind up. I read through about 40% of the book until the main characters even reached the desert and culture of the Freeman began to be revealed.-Granted this is the 40 year anniversary edition of this book but the dated language and flow really made it a chore to read sometimes.-Overall the plot was a bit vague with visions and mystical characters that never really receive and explanation. The writer forces you to pick up tidbits and try to piece them together yourself.::: The Verdict :::Ultimately there was nothing that held me to finish this book. I always give a book at least a 50% completion before setting it aside and making a judgement. With Dune I gave it 60% because I really wanted it to be good. In the end I set it aside and decided to watch the tv/movie adaptations to see if the ending is really worth the trudge through the book. I really had high hopes for the \\"all time best sci-fi book of all time\\" but found an old drab of a book that could be awesome if the right person came back to revive it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A must read.

This book easily laid the groundwork for Star Wars and Star Trek, and even Terminator since the book talks about man's dependency on machines being the downfall of the modern world.The book itself takes place in the far future amid a interplanetary empire and tells the story of 14 year old Paul Atreides and his family moving from their homeworld of Caladan to Arrakis or Dune, a desert planet occupied by desert people (Fremen). It tells of Paul's father's betrayal and assassination by one of his own men and the family's becoming fugitives on the run from the villainous Harkennon noble family who seeks the planet's sole treasure: a spice capable of giving eternal life.Now, without going into all the intricacies of ecology, politics, religion and environmentalism this book offers, let me just say that on the surface it is an entertaining story that will stimulate your mind and make you wonder. Like Gene Brewer's K-PAX, this book will make you think about the subjects it espouses.I recommend this whole-heartedly as one of, if not the greatest Sci-Fi adventure ever.The new edition comes with an afterward by Brian Herbert (Frank Herbert's son) and of course the appedixes which delve into the books themes and points of interest.So go pick this up for a great read over Christmas or summer break. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I heard about the Dune series from a friend. I decided to pick up the first book and give it a shot. I made it through the first twenty pages or so and started to wonder what all the fuss was about. It seemed wordy and very complex. I decided to keep reading. I am so glad that I did. The story picks up and turns into a fast paced adventure. Mr. Herbert came up with this idea of a distant world and brought it to life for me. Not only did he create some great characters, but he created an entire society riddled with a vast array of cultures, politics and a shared struggle for survival."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I first read the chronicles of dune 12 years ago, to be ready fr sci-fi's release if their miniseries.

Otherwise, I liked this a great deal."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Perfect science fiction. There is absolutely nothing I would change about the book. If you like sci-fi then you MUST buy this book and read it and then read it again!!!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Pros: Within this book dwells a story unlike others. For that alone, I could go on for quite some time about how few narratives of greatness we possess, and the strange world that powerful people inhabit, but I think that is known. What really surprised me was how philosophical everything was. The people in this novel all spoke the same language (besides esoteric references) but if they were from different cultures or possessed different ideals, it seemed impossible for them to communicate with one another. The divides of class and culture were so great that the entire universe turned on individual realizations and cunning deeds that took advantage of those without knowledge, which was entirely thrilling for most of the book.Cons: While some technologies and strange mental forays seemed well placed, others were muddled and awkward. It was readily apparent that the author had not dwelt in the desert - his renowned ecology is wrong on some fundamental points and several episodes of desert survival jarringly bizarre. The survival of people there was at least plausible, and directly resembled the culture of some desert natives, which, along with the assimilation of Arabic words, lead me to believe that Herbert outright appropriated western ideas of middle-eastern culture without experiencing the places first-hand. While this isn't necessarily bad, it did reduce my enjoyment of the narrative in places to the point of disdain. Also, like the Aeneid, it ends abruptly with the death of an opposing champion and no anti-climax.Summary: You shall not find a story like this one. It has flaws, but it is still far more interesting than most of the other science fiction you'll read. It hinted at a theocratic empire like that of the Warhammer 40,000 Imperium, but was deliberately steered away, and that was an exciting alternative to a future of devout bleakness.-FW"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"These books, by Frank Herbert, may not be for every sci-fi reader. They certainly aren't light reading, but when you need to escape, these are it. Through the years, I've read and re-read them. I find more parts that I missed. The movie(s) were horrible. The Baron should have been one of the best 'bad guys' ever - equal if not better than Hannibal Lector. Last night, I even heard one character on a new TV show - Wilfred - quoting lines from Dune, \\"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer . . .\\" Oddly enough, said to the former \\"Frodo.\\"I work around physicians, from the US and internationally. These are some of the brightest people around and need to escape with something that will engage their minds. They really know how to critique what they read, too. At my recommendation, one physician recently finished reading the initial Dune books. He was stunned by what Leto is/will become.Tolkien's Hobbit and LOTR books are also ones I re-read. LOVE the movies. Peter Jackson et al did a wonderful job and New Zealand is incredible. I don't compare Herbert vs. Tolkien. I just read and enjoy both for their own uniqueness. So many phrases from LOTR have now become standards in our language -- \\"I know your face,\\" \\"go in his stead,\\" \\"what say you?\\" Quite a tribute to Tolkien, as it should be."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book was a very long and mostly boring brood-fest in which the protagonist finds himself trapped in an unhappy and inevitable fate. This fate being the jihad to be carried out by his followers. I just don't buy it. Why can't he stop it? I think that Frank Herbert wants us to be so impressed with the over-complex under-explained dialogue that we feel like we are too small to have a valid opinion. The protagonist is just so inhumanly smart, so vastly more intelligent than us, we cannot possibly know of his problems. But then Paul Atreides doesn't exist, there is only Frank Herbert, and he is only human. To me it just smells of BS.The first book (Dune) was good. But like the Earth's Children series, I think it ends there. If you read Dune and want another Frank Herbert, I recommend picking up \\"The White Plague\\". Not the best book, not even top ten but intriguing and original."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is an epic and seminal work of science fiction. Any true fan of the genre has to read this book to see how it should be done. The depth of the world, the plots within plots, creative characters and systems, etc. The story of Paul Atreides is well-chronicled so I won't go over the plot, but if you have never read this amazing book I encourage you to do so. This, along with Lord of the Rings and Stranger in a Stranger Land are among my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I first read Frank Herbert's Dune perhaps twenty years ago during a long hot Sacramento summer. I worked at Toys -R- Us, a 3 mile walk from my grandmother's house, where I was living, as I enjoyed the bargain of low (okay, nonexistent) rent, and a mediocre job in the retail industry. Despite the hundred degree days (and intolerably bad traffic), I walked to work every day. I didn't savor being hit by a motorist careening through the Arden district. It took 45 minutes to an hour, and I often walked home, through East Sacramento, in the dark at 10 or 11 PM to return home. Whenever possible, I had a book in my hand: this was where I learned to walk and read. Peripheral vision is my only physical gift from the gods, and I've used passionately it ever since. I've finished dozens of novels walking to-and-from work, or to classes. Dune was my first walking-and-reading adventure.I remember very little from my first reading of the novel. I remember a young man with powers beyond those of his peers. And battleship-sized sand worms. And a planet so dry it made the Sahara seem downright moist. Mostly, I remember the love story between young Paul Atreides and his bride Chani, from his youthful visions. Maybe I was young and horny. I was living with a 90-year-old woman, and my libido was certainly not running unchecked at this point in my life. So when i recently picked up the book, about a month ago, I was expecting Dune to be, from my recollection, a beautiful Bedouin-like love story set on the desert planet called Arrakis.Okay, so maybe I should have paid closer attention to the book, and less attention to Sacramento traffic, all those years ago. The first book had the love story (and the worms in the desert) to be sure, but I somehow missed all the political intrigue. I was at a point in my reading career where I wanted a book to get to the damn story, I suppose, and skipped over the first, say, 150 pages, where Duke Leto Atreides, Paul's father, was sent to Arrakis and the readers were struggling to uncover his potential assassin. We know from the excerpted writings of Princess Irulan that head each chapter that there will be one the desert call the Muad'Dib. We know The Duke will die, and Paul will go into exile. We know Paul's mother, Lady Jessica, will be suspected by many people of the treason that killed her husband. We just wait for it to unfold. The anticipation is enormous, and when it finally happens, the payoff is great. Herbert writes wonderful characters against a bleak desert backdrop. The Duke's real killer was the very nasty, very round Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, who is perpetuating a longstanding feud between the Duke's house and his own. Behind all this intrigue are the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, who have a secret campaign to \\"breed\\" the greater houses and give birth to the one known as the Kwisatz Haderach. The antagonists are nasty without being embarrassingly evil. Their motives seem reasonable, if not to us, at least to them. You can picture some politician making the same decisions as the Baron, or trying the same manipulative policies of the Bene Gesserit. They're not simply antagonistic for the sake of the plot.Yep. Rather than being the love story that I fondly remembered, Dune is the story of a desert messiah: one who would bring peace and order to the universe. Oddly, I missed that minor detail during the first reading.Herbert's backdrop is rich: amazingly so. When you step into the world of Arrakis, you finding yourself needing a drink of water. When you read about Harkonnen schemings, your mind wanders down the myriad paths that may possibly allow Paul Atreides to escape the designs of multiple political camps. It is rare both the story and the characters in a novel have such depth and richness.And I must say this: Dune stands on its own. I was satisfied with its ending. Twenty years ago, I didn't want to leave the characters. I needed them to be alive awhile longer, so knew what happened to them. During this reading, I realized they'd be all right. It's how Herbert intended them to be: they were painted correctly in the first book of many to eventually be delivered from this author, and eventually, his son Brian. But I urge readers to stop with the first one. You can still love the characters, and enjoy the intrigue, perhaps even more so, without knowing what happened to them. Each book afterwards just seems to weaken the power of the first story.I would also recommend, perhaps, sitting on a sofa and reading the book. Definitely not a commuter pamphlet, like so many I have read in the past. You can try, but you will miss a lot of the power of the story if you don't give Frank Herbert's Dune the attention it deserves."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is the one. It's the iconic sci-fi space-opera epic. It began a franchise that has survived and continued to grow well after the author's death. It's a movie, a mini-series, a computer game, a role-playing game, etc. etc. etc. Like it or not (and I love it) you can't consider yourself well-read in sci-fi without having read this one.The story follows young Paul Atreides from young, ducal heir on his agricultural home world of Caladan through his family's relocation to the desert planet Arrakis, also called Dune, and on through incredibly detailed and convoluted political intrigues on his way to avenge his father's murder and win the imperial throne. Wow, that is way too simplified. There's no way to appropriately describe or properly praise this book. It's a richly developed world, even in this single book, with thousands and thousands of years of future history created and seamlessly integrated into a totally engaging story. I've reread this one too many times for me to be able to remember. And I will read it again and again."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune includes several classic elements of science fiction, such as spaceships, laser guns, and fantastical creatures. However, other aspects of the novel such as the dialogue and the political structures described in the plot seem almost retrospective; the supreme ruler is known as the Emperor, and is addressed as Your Majesty by his subjects, while the typical entertainments are ministrel singing and sword fighting. This book depicts the story of Paul Atreides, a boy of fifteen raised in Castle Caladan,and who is the son of the local Duke. His mother, a member of the Bene Gesserit female-only society, had been instructed to bear only daughters, but she disobeyed this command because of the Duke's wish for a son for his heir. Jessica trains Paul in the hope that he will be the first male Bene Gesserit. However, at the same time, Paul must train to be the next Duke. These two responsibilities combine to present a formidable challenge for Paul.This novel was very intriguing; it made me think deeply about every single event that happens along the storyline; Frank Herbert gives just enough information about a situation to make the reader curious, but leaves out some details to give the story a mysterious air. When I started the book, I was confused with all the new and strange terms, but as I delved further into the story, the new language became more familiar and enhanced the reading experience. The book is also very suspenseful and is filled with many memorable passages: \\"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me.\\" This early excerpt, part of a calming Bene Gesserit ritual, foreshadows many frightening scenes to come. All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the combination of science fiction, mystery, and thrill."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I started Dune with great expectations but, sadly, these expectations were unjustified. I'll admit the plot is amazing, and the ideas and undertones driving it are indeed deep, but the presentation is lacking. Perhaps I've been spoiled by truly great works of fiction such as Gormenghast, but the prose is crude and the characters undeveloped. Dialouge is sparse, and when it comes it usually sounds like the ravings of a lunitic. I truly wanted to enjoy this book, but because of the poor writeing style I couldn't. Don't put your twenty some bucks to waste rent it from your local libary if you must read. I suggest using that cpaital to buy Gormenghas or C.S. Lewisi's Space Triliogy, two remarkable works of fiction. ..."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This was one of the books I've been meaning to read for a long time, and when I finally began reading it, I was utterly engrossed in the story. With the movie and the TV miniseries both available, it's superfluous to state the plot, so. And the story of a young boy becoming a hero isn't new, but the vivid geographies of Dune and the subtle complexities of life on Dune and in the Imperium are fascinating, and all make this a science fiction masterwork. It's got something for everyone: political intrigue, warfare, romance, evil vs good, spirituality. But it's definitely the Fremen and the planet Arrakis (Dune) that cativate me. I'm certainly going to read the rest of this series."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Book ReviewI usually do not consider literature as a favorite pass-time but sometimes there are books that cannot be put down until you your eyes are sore tired, and Frank Herbert's Dune is one of them. Although the book is in the science fiction genre, it is a great pick for anyone who appreciates a good story, and the book also includes quit a bit of mystery and romance which fits in perfectly in the world that grips you in and does not let go even after you are done with the book. I am a big fan of the science fiction genre, especially the Start Trek and Star Wars series. Actually most of my reading revolved around those two names, so when I stumbled upon Dune, I was not very enthusiastic to say the least. The book was large and very long (almost made turn away right there), complicated, and dated, but since I did not find anything new in the two categories mentioned above, I picked it up to pass my time during the holidays, and because I like to spend my free tome in front of my computer I though that I might not even start on the book, boy was I wrong. I started reading during the second week of the not so long holiday. I was instantly possessed by the storyline, which was impossible to predict but satisfied with what it revealed to you. The story is a bout a Royal Family Atreides who has to leave their paradise of a planet to govern a desert planet, which is full of the most valuable substances in galaxy. The story twist from there on into betrayals, mystery, romance and finally revenge. I finished the book in less than three days, and the book was almost five hundred pages long. I had little time to do anything during those three days, and I must admit I was never that devoted to a book before. The best part about is the ending. It ends the story in passion able way, and although one can draw a conclusion with it, it acts a lot better as an opener to the continuation of the saga. In fact the book created four sequels (I am already into the second book in the serious) and prequel. The reason for all deviation/continuations is due to a very high critical success of the book and enormous sales that it generated, in fact all of the sequel and the recent prequel have scored very well with the fan base. Due to the big popularity of the book, there was a motion picture created based on the book back 1989, and featured some big stars such Sting himself (I did not know that he acted either), but did not do the book justice and failed in the box office, and it was very recently recreated a six hour special edition show on the Sci-Fi channel, and although a much better than the first was still somewhat out of place. I guess some things have to be left to your imagination."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have to admit that this is not a proper review of the book Dune, but actually more of a review of the mini series. The other reviewers have done well in convincing me that I should buy the first book, but it was actually the mini series that first provoked me. This is not the movie I am talking about, this is the mini series of 3 parts. Each one is more or less feature length. The movie was not very good and friends of mine assure me that it was a complete failure in capturing the book's mystical fantasy and amazing vision. When I saw the mini series of Dune I was amazed. My friends who have read the book say that it is a very good representation of the story, but as with any re-make or television adaption there will be parts you dislike or parts that you wish were included. Watch it! It is great! I think it's better than any Star Wars episode I have seen to date. That's why I knew I had to find the book, because if the TV version was that good, the book had to be out of this world. Muah'dib, the Spice, worms, everything! If you don't like it...keep in mind that it was at least good enough to make me want to read the novel and all the other books in the series."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune, or as I like to call it, When Genius Met Brilliance, is a book with all the elements of good literature. One that defies the genres, the accepted limitations. The book that launched a thousand imaginations. Like Lord of the Rings, it is a book that defined what good literature meant. I can go on about the technical details, but that will only ruin the mystique of the book. Venture forth onto this journey of human accomplishment."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is hands down the best novel I have ever read! I read it in apprx. 7 hours. I'm really 14 but.... I just don't understand why none of my teachers have never recommended this book? It is great epic, not just a scif-fi novel. I've been hooked on it, I'm almost finished with book 3 in the chronicles, they're good also. If my dad hadn't told me about this book I never would've heard about it! That's sad. I recommend this book. Too bad Herbert died- I wonder how his son's writing style is. Hopefully he writes dune novels like his dad.:)"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book was a little slow to start off. The first few chapters about Paul (Muad'Dib the main character) and his family are essential to the plot development but after those chapters this book is a wild ride. Once Paul meets the Fremen and trains them in his special Bene Gesserit mind and body control fighting techniques he builds a Fremen army. With this immensely powerful army he eventually rules the universe. Filled with vivid hand to hand combat scenes and wonderfully majestic settings (Herbert is like Picasso) this book should cost alot more then it is priced. If you are a fan of Sci-fi this book is a must-read.

It is the best sci-fi ever written. If you have not bought it, order it now!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I first read this book in middle school and I loved it even though I completely missed that point about how Paul was afraid of a holy war being fought in his name until the second book. Reading it again I come to a realization of how deep and rich this entire book is.Paul Atriedes unknowingly is the product of generations of genetic planning by the bene gesserit, an order of women with almost supernatural powers of mind. He is thrust into the political machinations of his Duke father at an early age and then fate conspires to make him into a holy man with fanatical followers. What is interesting in this book is that the main character is ambiguous about his purpose in the universe and his role. He is the most powerful man in the universe and yet he is a puppet to the hands of fate. In many places in the book he is on the verge of suicide in order to postpone the inevitable. It's a beautiful balance the contrast between the adulation of others for the main character (including the chapter titles all narrated by the books of Princess Irulan - who would be one of the most minor characters in the book without those quotes) and the main character's sense of personal confusion.With this book Science Fiction became truly an epic adventure. This book is a classic in any genre and no longer can a person dismiss Science Fiction as bug eyed monster pulp.Read it many times. It's a great one."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Hmmm.Herbert tried to make the sequel to &quot;Dune&quot; as great as his first book. But he failed poorly. The Hero of &quot;Dune&quot;, Paul Attreides, now is emperor himself, and all the book does is merely giving a biography. There isn't much excitement in it, but in the end. Actually it took my three attempts to finish this one. The only problem is, that this book is important to understanding it's sequels. So take it with dignity and work yourself through the world of science-fiction policy.Good Luck!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Although it is not for everyone, and for those, they are truly missing a great treat. The entire series is so overwhelming in scope and imagination, and how humans get to where they are, and end up, well, not end up, but where we are left at the end of the series, is a very very worthwhile read. Of course, it does use many precepts already used in other books, but then, what book does not draw on the past, or use ideas already used? And the rewards for finishing the series is definitely there."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Only sci fi I have ever liked. Fabulous book ... a classic.A Great Expectations of a future world."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Finding any sci-fi series that rivals this one is difficult. Possible contenders are Stranger in a Strange Land or some of the early Asimov sci-fi novels. Herbert has a gift for description as well as philosophy, but I would not advise reading the book for its message or its symbolism (which does seem to be thrown at the reader like a wrecking ball at times). The simple fact is that it is a good story and it is an entry into an entirely unique universe. Every sci-fi or fantasy novel that has succeeded this book seems to borrow something from it. Yet modern writers often concern themselves more with the advancement of technology, where as Herbert dealt more with the advancement of humans.I do not wish to discredit those reviewers who gave this 1 or 2 stars. This book is not for everyone. It requires a great deal of patience at times. It is also not likely that the reader will grasp every element of the story on the first read because of the overall density of the material. That being said, this one has the potential to become addictive."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This has got to be one of the best books ever. There is such creativity in this book that while I was reading it I kept asking myself how can a single mind accomplish such a thing. Everyone has to read this book, not only science fiction fans."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is one of the greatest books, not just science-fiction books, of all time. It is an epic story in which intergalactic fiefdoms vie for power under the cryptic mechanizations of the galactic Emperor.The story begins when House Atreides is granted stewardship of a desert planet that is the sole source of the spice m&eacute;lange. The spice is exceedingly important to the galaxy as it is used by the Spacing Guild in interstellar navigation and by the Bene Gesserit to extend their psychological powers. The empire cannot exist without space travel nor the Bene Gesserit's controlling influence. So, it cannot exist without the spice. The Atreides are immediately aware of this and the tenacity of their situation, especially with their rivals and the former custodians of Dune: House Harkonnen.All this is backdrop to the real story though: the plight of a young man named Paul Atreides heir to House Atreides. Paul is the son of the Duke Atreides and the Lady Jessica, a Bene Gesserit and bound concubine to the Duke. Sharing both his father's noble upbringing and his mother's special powers, Paul is quickly identified as a powerful future leader and potentially the messiah of ancient Bene Gesserit lore: the Kwisatz Haderach.When the Atreides are betrayed by the Emperor, who reveals his true allegiance to House Harkonnen, a gripping saga commences that challenges Paul to survive to avenge his family against an empire bent on destroying him.The entire Dune series is engaging and complete in its imagined universe that each book is a treasure in its own right.

While I rate this story at a solid five stars, there is not much more I can say about this book that has not already been said.Never the less, this story is everything that a reader could possibly want in any fiction, whether science, fantasy, or otherwise.Even though this book falls into the \\"Science Fiction\\" Category, this story is so much more than fantastic space battles, cool gadgetry and futuristic scapes that encompass much that is \\"Science\\" fiction....This book is a story of love, betrayal, intrigue, personal trial, and triumph against overwhelming odds all set about 20,000 years into our future.There is much food for thought with this book and those that follow it.For any Star Wars fan, read this book.

I read his 1966 paberback copy and very quickly realized that I had found the holy grail of science fiction: A brilliant science fiction book that is also a piece of great literature. I have never, before or since, read a novel that was so deeply layered, so finely interwoven, and so fully satisfying. The true gem among gems in Herbert's writing style is the fact that he gives as much space to the characters thoughts as to their words and actions. You learn more about Paul, Leto, Jessica and the rest from what they think, and the contrast between what they think and actually say is often striking. Although several other books in the series are outstanding, especially God Emperor of Dune, none come close to the greatness that is DUNE."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I first saw the movie &quot;Dune&quot;, which is awful. David Lynch revels in the grotesque and overuses character thoughts (which works in the text but is overbearing in the movie) to ruin a good thing. Fortunately, the book is one of the best pieces of fiction I have ever read. It is chock full of archetypal themes, including the hero journey, and is just simply gripping. There is superb character development, internal and external character tension, and a helluva good story. If you saw the movie and hated it, approach the book with an open mind. It does not have many of Lynch's absurd interpretations or fabrications and will astonish you"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I was 14 when I first picked up this book at random in the library. Now, two years later,I now own copies of all 6 Dunebooks. Heavy reading? Yes. Does it sometimes drag? Yes, but reading those parts is worth it- you will learn an incredible much about politics, ecologics, religion theory.... I often find myself rereading passages on my dogeared copy until I fully understand exactly what Herbert was trying to say. I even went as far as to use a character's name in my email address (pathetic, I know). You will only benefit from this book intellecually, and you will be inspired by the breathtaking mythology... go for it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When I started Dune Messiah, I expected nothing better than the usual sequel (watered-down version of the first book, not nearly as good.) Dune Messiah was nothing like that. Herbert added many more dimensions and facets to Paul, as well as the mysterious land in which he lives. The ending blew me away. Definitely a good read for sci-fi fans and non-sci-fi fans alike."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is a masterpiece of the century, a book that will set the standerds for all sci-fi novels to come. Never have I seen such a book that created such a world in my mind, the world of Muad'Dib and his Fremen riding across the desert. This book was mentioned to me by my friend, and I loved it so much, that I have read every other book in the series! Do yourself a favor sci-fi fans and anti-fi fans alike. Read Dune and travel to the world which you will never want to leave..."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Like dune, it is flawed, spending too much time on internal monologue and exposition better left to the reader. Also like Dune, it is brilliant in many ways--symbolism, philosophy, intrigue, etc. I think one of the reasons that people didn't like it as much as Dune was because they were expecting more of the same and got, instead, a very changed universe (with several contradictions). Sequels in far-future sci fi always lack the wonder of discovering a new world; but in a way, watching the development is just as fascinating. If you liked Dune, read Dune Messiah."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert vividly describes all of the characters and created a very intriguing plot. This book is full of un-expected twists and is very exciting to read!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book isn't bad, however, it doesn't have the edge that some of the other classics have. The main attraction of Dune, is its characters and setting. I have to admit the plot gets monotonious and hard to read at times. The main reason that I didn't give five stars, was because the unreal change that Paul goes through to become prophet. He changes his personality, and thus the quality of the book (for the worse),"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"In &quot;Dune,&quot; Frank Herbert has created a world. Not just a story of political intrigue, it is the story of three hundred years of a planet's life. It is also a vindiction of everyone who's ever said, &quot;If I have what you need, then I'm making the demands.&quot; Beyond that, it is a fine dramatic work, into which the reader will be drawn. It sort of loses its thread in the middle section (the plot takes five years), but the descriptions of ecology and culture at the beginning and the thrilling ending more than make up for it. The only possible rival I can think of is the Star Wars series, but even the greatest sci-fi space opera in history has simplistic villains and a stock plot. Except for the Harkonnens, try to pinpoint one major villain (If you say the Imperials, you're wrong: They represent their interests, which end up being the same as the Atreides'. The Bene Gesserit? Any ill effects they have on Paul is merely an accidental result of their nature). There are few finer works created in any genre. Just once I would like to read &quot;The Collected Sayings of Muad'dib&quot; and Princess Irulan's other works. It's not often that a writer writes seven books at a time, but Frank Herbert has done it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"There are many reviews here that say a lot of the things about how I feel about this book. So there's little to add, read some of the reviews, but I must warn you they might be a bit of a spoiler if you want to be totally surprised at what the DUNE epic has to unfold.If you like to read a book that makes you think a lot yet at the same time keeps you intrigued, thrilled gripping the edge of the seat almost like a wild roller coaster, this book is fantastic. This is my 3rd time reading it, and I'm unfolding plots and mysteries I did not notice before.I've read many works of fiction and few authors can do what Frank Herbert has done. He has intricately created so many layers of stories in a different universe that is so consistent, it almost feels like you're reading history mixed with scientific exposition.I've given this book to several people as gifts hoping they'd enjoy it as much as I did. For informational purposes I'm not a hardcose scifi fan, I've read books by or like LOTR, HMS Ulysses, Jeffrey Archer, John Grisham, Agathe Christie, Oscar Wilde, Dick Francis, Alistair Maclean and many more, but Frank Herbert is on a different level."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a wonderful adventure, a dazzling piece of sci-fi, a great political thriller and a moving, memorable evocation of another world and a believable, whole people (the marvellous Fremen), vividly imagined to fit a profoundly hostile desert world, complete with a well-imagined culture, religion, social code, and so on.It is all these things - but it is also amazingly predictive. The novel is basically about a desert people with an intense religion who happen to be co-located with the most valuable resource in the universe - which they only come to realise with the help of a new and even more fanatical religious leader - and manipulate to take control of everything. All the great powers must focus on this wild tribe of outlandish religious tribal people and will eventually be defeated by them. And it's all the Universe's own stupid fault - for relying so heavily on a precious resource only found in their desert realm and so vulnerable to their control. Sound familiar at all??!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Hailed as one of the greatest works of science fiction in the history of the genre, this book, along with other writers such as Arthur C. Clark and Ray Bradbury, is definitely in a select company. While so much is written on how much it impacted science fiction, I find the focus of the book to be on both science and religion. The messianic journey of Paul Atredies to his ascendancy as the Muad Dib of the Fremen peoples and of the planet Arrakis is a tale told with a specific focus.The style of the literature is one where important points/events are highlighted and then time jumps forward to the next important event. What we are left with to fill the holes is our own imagination at work. For example, we never read about what happens in the time period between Paul's joining of the Fremen and his eventual ascendency as a man of importance. The chapter following the end of the second part of the book is a high speed run through a series of events leading to the important reason for the third part of the book: the prophetic escalation of Paul to become leader of the desert tribes. Yet again, in the third part of the book we are not given details on how the Fremen take over Arakeen. Frank Herbert leaves the savageries of battle to our imagination. What is important is what happens both before and after.Throughout this book we are reminded again and again that the focus is on the messianic journey of Paul along with a fantastic description of the planet where this occurred: the Arrakis. The story itself is told beautifully and through a creativity that is rarely seen, Frank Herbert is able to create a very realistic people who will eventually lead the Prophet into battle.I would highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to become introduced to great science fiction. So many writers have borrowed from this work, that it's familiarity is almost as commonplace as The Lord of the Rings. It's been tried and re-tried, but the original Dune series still stands as the quintessinial work of Science Fiction"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I admire Frank Herbert for writing what is quite possibly the best science fiction novel ever. The way he created this whole world and these complex characters shows how truly genius he is. I really felt for the characters as I read through the story. I could feel the nervousness in Paul when he realized that he was to become most important of leaders. I look forward to reading further in the Dune series."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It's true what they say about Dune - it is to science fiction what LotR is to fantasy, and for good reason. I won't go much into what the novel is about, but I found it a very interesting read. This novel is essentially about survival and politics. I guess Herbert was also interested in conveying the importance of our planets resources but that's a background issue. It gets 4 stars for its depth, vision and execution - but I did find it difficult to get through and sometimes frustrating. I've read another review saying it's for all ages but I would have to disagree, as it is sometimes not only hard to follow, but can be tedious for those of us who have shorter attention spans. Regardless, it's a great novel and my favourite part about it was the commentary inbetween chapters which was insightful and elevated the novel to a higher plane."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"whoever rates this book any less than 4 stars (in fact, I can't see how it could be less than 5) simply doesn't yet understand it. I'd recommend rereading it at least once, as well as finishing out the series. The scope of Herbert's plot is phenomenal and amazingly intricate. I'll admit that I first struggled with the beginning portion of this book - but that was in 7th grade... after rereading it, I found it came together beautifully.Herbert's story weaves politics and ecology with pure science fiction in an amazingly seamless way. And, to answer the claim that LOR fans would do well to read this, I'd have to agree - but more importantly, I think Robert Jordan fans will see tons of amazing parallels between that series and this one."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"this is the 2nd book in the Dune series written by Frank Herbert. and this book too i love. In this book Paul is now the ruler of Arakis and the freeman have set up a powerful and mighty kingdom in his honor after the jihad. Paul struggles with the consequences of the jihad and with what his people have become. and also paul begins to find the problems of possesion from the spice. all around a great addition to the dune series, and is definently worth buying. if you have read the first book you MUST READ this book, it is the continuing of what happened in Dune and begins to show the kind of changes physically it is taking and the peoples changes too."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I loved the first Dune book. It was an absolute masterpiece! But this second book was alright. It was a good book, but it didn't really grip you like the first book did. I kept waiting to be stunned by some unforeseen event at the beginning, but it never happened until the middle of the story. Overall, this was a good book that hopefully leads up to a great third book in Children of Dune. I hope that the third book can pick up some of the slack that was left behind."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I do not generally write reviews but this book was a necessary exception. I loved it. From the second I began to the instant it concluded, I was completely engrossed.The world that Frank Herbert creates is believable (as much so as can be expected for the genre) and the characters are very real. They suffer and we suffer; they succeed and we are irrepressibly happy. It is a well-written novel with an engaging plot. Above all, however, the book addresses universally applicable themes and profound concepts. It is this fact that allows Dune to transcend to a higher plane than the average science-fiction novel.The only negative aspect I found with this book is that, upon finishing it, I was terrified to experience anything else, any of its other forms. The sequels(Dune Messiah, House Harkonnen, etc.) and the movie stood no chance at all in matching this masterpiece. I am, to this day, paralyzed with the thought that at some time I may inadvertently witness some horrific misappropriation of the beautiful original. It would be a vile tragedy."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The best way I can describe Dune is that it takes the political and strategical elements of the latest books in the Ender series (Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets) and takes them even further in depth, all the while being supported by an incredible plot. The emphasis put on the importance of every little action affecting the overall outcome helps to paint a beautiful and intricate picture for the reader. The depth of this world is amazing, Herbert creates an entire alien culture better than any I have ever found. He has even made an entire ecosystem with everything having a purpose and explanation. This novel does not disappoint in the least and I recommend it to any sci-fi book reader."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is one of those books that never gets old. I'm only fifteen but I've read it at least seven times front to back. I've written fan fiction for it (as well as some really strange Dune/Star Wars crossovers) and find it intriguing, confusing, and beautiful. When I first read the book I was about eleven, and have devoured the rest of the series in the time since.If you enjoy an intellectually stimulating read, this is it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Herbert's Dune is truly one of the best books I have ever read. It has everything in it that one could want: war, heroes, futuristic technology, villains, suspense, you name and Dune probably has it. I strongly recommend the book over the movie. There is far more detail in the novel and you gain a better understanding of who everyone is and what the different people are about. The copy of the book I have has a dictionary of words that you may not understand, and it has a map so you can see roughly where each scene takes place. Herbert was able to keep my attention throughout the whole book and the way it was written kept me glued to the book and it never seemed like it was as long as it really is, about 500 pages. I thought that it had strong similarities to a Star Wars type story; however, it was at the same time completely different. I would recommend this book and I plan on reading some of the others in the series."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book picks up with in a few years of the end of Dune. It deals with Paul Atriedes problems as the new emperor and Messiah. It is a very human story as Paul tries to control what he has unleashed. If you read Dune, then you want to know what happened next. This book answers ALL the questions you are left with after reading Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The first sequel to the collosal masterpiece of Science Fiction, Dune Messiah takes up where Dune left off. Both in tone and in astute observations of the runnings of both government and religion.We follow the story of Paul Muad'Dib, the slightly reluctant messiah and emperor of a universe of opposites living in constant struggle.He is cursed by the prescience which shows him the ambiguous future, affording him glimpses at events so painful he can scarce look at them, and a way of avoiding those events even more painful yet.Herbert was one of the great masters, and every single book he wrote is worth our attention, but none more so than this stunning series called Dune.Whether or not you enjoy Science Fiction, you would be doing yourself a disservice by ignoring a social treatise of such skill and precision as these books."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"What makes science fiction so attractive is the author's chance to create a world, a universe into which he or she draws the reader into.However, as any SF fan will be quick to point out, this is not easy at all. And what makes great SF is books like these. &quot;Dune&quot; is rare even among the best with its carefully laid out structure and system. It even has a huge dictionary at the end of it. Frank Herbert's great work (which obviously spurred a series of books where he explores the depth of this universe, but I confess I didn't read any other for my fear of ruining the first book's charm) is an intricately woven web of relationships, loves and hates.Dune is a living planet that you easily believe in. Its ecology is very well established. The Fremen and the worms and the Houses. And spice, of course.The ugly diplomatic games and the wars are very human. The setting may be different but the greed is just the same. You find a reflection of medieveal Earth mingled with very advanced technology in every page.&quot;Dune&quot; is probably one of the best SF books ever. It is a classic and a must have for anyone claiming to have an interest in this field."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Don't get me wrong - I like science fiction as a genre, but some of it is just too technical and unbelievable. I'm more of a history fan. And I guess that's why Dune is so appealing - it is a very well crafted science fiction novel, but because of the concept of the family histories, the trade wars and other issues it has the feel of a historical saga as well.In addition there are great characters, inhospitable deserts, evil bad guys and giant worms. What more could a person want? But all in all its a real saga - a great book and a great read. Science fiction fans rejoice, and those who wouldn't normally consider such a book will also enjoy it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book has got to be the absolute best science fiction book of all time! When reading this masterpiece, I was lost in time and reality. I felt emotional yet it was subtle. All characters were intricately detailed and believable. I am reading the 4th book as we speak and will attempt to continue on with Brian Herbert's sequels. Although no one could mimic Frank Herbert's style!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I am not a Science Fiction fan, but I really enjoyed reading Dune because it was unique and interesting. It was hard to understand what was happening lots of the time, but I liked it that way. It had a unique and layered plot that I haven't seen in a book before. I thought that each character was interesting a carefully created. The only downer I have about &quot;Dune,&quot; is the ending. It ends just like almost every other book ends with the bad guy loosing and everything ending happily ever after. I feel something dramatic should have happened at the end. I would recommend reading it, and I think Frank Herbert is an excellent writer."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I thought that this book was very discriptive, so discriptive that I sometimes got lost reading it, and I had to re-read some pages as much as five times, but I really liked how Frank described the characters, when you read about them, it was like you were actually them and I got really involved in the reading. The only thing that I didn't like was that the reading was diffucult to get through. I think that Frank Herbert was an excellent writer, his ideas are so BIG that sometimes you have to keep reading something he said so you could understand what he was saying."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a very difficult book to read and one must have the ability to understand big words and a good memory. The ability to layer plots the way Frank did must have ben very difficult and intens. The new word he creates are very difficult to read. It makes you want to know what the word is and what is going to happen next."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I love this book but i refuse to pay $15 for the Kindle edition when the paperback can be had at a used bookstore for less than a buck. The publisher has made millions off this book over decades. There is no justification for this asking price by the publisher."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Without the novelty of the original, there's not a lot to recommend this (first of many) sequels. For all the self-doubt &amp; confusion of Paul, Alia, and Duncan's ghost, the characters are largely one dimensional. Herbert somewhat falls under the weight of his purportedly eon shaking majestic characters who rarely say or do anything clever or wise (particularly the Reverend Mothers here and in 'Dune', who are supposed to have the insight of millennia, but are essentially ineffective, even pathetic).While the plot does offer an interesting unifying twist, there's far too much irritating (cf. C.J. Cherryh, particularly 'Rusalka') vacillation about choices. We're meant to be carried along in the tide of mysticism, but it just becomes some vague hocus pocus to excuse any arbitrary action or excess of confused introspection.Some Messianic parallels: the disciples were, granted, confused when Jesus saw things so differently; Paul sees his destiny in sacrifice to save others, and is brave enough to do it. But we don't have the attractive wisdom and love of the real deal. Nor do we see the teaching result in good fruit; rather it's never even really addressed why Paul has this genocidal Jihad beyond his control - he's either not bright or not humanitarian enough to end it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book has long been acclaimed as a sci-fi masterpiece, and it deserves it. Frank Herbert has created a rich, full universe, centered on the desert planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. Arrakis itself is (at least on the surface) a barren, forbidding chunk of rock with extremely forbidding climate. It would be a worthless, unknown backwater except for one small fact: It is the only source of the spice Melange, which is required for faster-than-light travel. Since an interstellar civilization cannot survive without faster-than-light travel, the value of Arrakis becomes obvious.The central character of the book is the young man Paul Atredies, heir to the dukedom of House Atredies, which has been recently placed in charge of Arrakis by the Galactic Emperor. His father, the Duke Leto Atredies, smells a trap being laid for him by his enemies but takes the position anyway out of loyalty to his Emperor. Accompanying him is hs concubine Jessica, who is Paul's mother and a member of the mysterious Bene Gesserit, an ancient order of women with mysterious power. Plotting against the Atreides are their mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, led by the devious and clever Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and his nephews, Rabban and Feyd-Rautha.The plot of the book is concerned to a great extent with the ecology of Arrakis. We learn about the great Sandworms that roam Arrakis' vast deserts, plus the mysterious native Fremen who coexist with the worms. We also learn about the relationship between the worms and Melange, as well as the Fremen plan to transform Arrakis into a lush paradise. The Fremen are given a complex society which borrows heavily from Middle Eastern influences. The complex scheming and plotting between the Harkonnens and the Atreides, not to mention the Emperor and the Guild (the organization of space navigators with a monopoly on space travel), make for complex and interesting reading.The place where, I believe, Dune falls short is in its skimping over action scenes. There are a few points in the novel where action scenes are very well laid out, mostly small one-on-one duels and such, but there are a number of very large battles, both in the land and on the ground, that are skimmed over very rapidly. In fact, one of the most pivotal battles in the book is mentioned only by word of mouth. There is one major exception, though - the rescue of a crew of spice harvesters from the clutches of one of the giant sandworms is an extremely dramatic, well-written moment.There's also just not a lot of emotion in the book. The main characters never seem to make any decisions or take any actions from passion or anger. Everything is done with a cold, icy, methodical calculation.Overall, this is excellent sci-fi, but a very cold book. Young readers will have a hard time with it. Also, if you're more interested in action and such, there's little to be found directly. The book is very slow-moving for the most part. But, if you like a lot of cloak-and-dagger intrigue and plotting, not to mention heavy doses of mysticism and prophecy, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I first read Dune when I was in college during the late \`70s, and just finished rereading it. The second time around, benefitting from a backdrop of 20 years of life experience, the book seemed vastly more revealing, interesting, and coherent. For me, the most engaging facet of Dune is its byzantine, ornate setting. Herbert skillfully interweaves elaborate and richly detailed descriptions of Arrakis' ecology and geology, Fremen culture, Bene Gesserit mysticism, Space Guild politics, and the complex biochemical process by which the Arrakis' enormous sandworms (\\"makers\\") produce the desert planet's prized geriatric melange (spice). I frequently found myself fascinated by Herbert's very original constructions, and craving even greater detail.Dialogue proves to be Dune's Achilles' heel. In attempting to make his characters appear as alien as their surroundings, Herbert only succeeds in making them sound overly stilted. The interchanges between characters seem too deliberate and overwrought, particularly during the book's more dramatic sequences. An example: as Paul-Muad'Dib and Feyd-Rautha prepare to engage in a knife battle, Feyd - trying to intimidate Paul - intones \\"May your blade chip and shatter!\\" (not especially menacing, that). All things considered, however, the flawed dialogue is a trivial shortcoming. Dune is a fabulously well-conceived novel and an immensely rewarding read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I purchased this Kindle book because I wanted to re-read the book but also wanted to have the electronic version. Huge mistake. The book is horribly formatted and is almost impossible to read. One font size results in words being dropped from the end of a page and the next size down results in last passage of a page also appearing on the next page. It appears that there is not a way to get the text to appear correctly. Fifteen pages into the book and I have given up trying to read this great work in the format."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"As a piece of science fiction, Dune deserves its place among the best. Even beyond the sci-fi world this piece of literature ranks among the best books ever written, in my opinion. Frank Herbert has created a time and place that, while so alien also seems very familiar. He certainly immerses his readers in the world of Dune and in the politics that surround it. It's too bad that Dune has been categorized as a science fiction novel. While it most certainly is that it will also appeal to those interested in many other forms of fiction, especially those interested in political intrigue.That said the kindle version is rather dissapointing from the standpoint of all the editorial errors in it. Misspelled words, missing spaces between words, etc. At $15 for this e-book, which is way too expensive in my opinion, I expect a book that is professionally edited just like any other edition. I think Amazon owes everyone who has purchased this edition a newly editted version that fixes all the problems in the original download."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I decided I wanted to read it again. About once every 5 to 10 years I reacquaint myself with Paul and his world. I bought the Kindle edition 40th anniversary edition. What a hugh rip-off. I started reading last night and the family hasn't even left for Dune yet and there has been at least 10 typos. So I calculated that a minimum of 1092 people have bought this book (number of reviews) times $13.98 is over $15,000. Penguin could have paid a high school kid to read and correct this book for a year, rather than just sending it to Amazon sight unseen. Love the book, but feeling cheated."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Probably the most distinct moment of reading Dune Messiah came when my eyes lit upon the wonderful phrase: \\"Bijaz the catalyst dwarf.\\" Only in the prose of Frank Herbert could such a coupling be possible.As to Bijaz, himself, I'm not really sure why he needed to be in the book. He didn't seem to be an essential character, just a peculiar garnish on the storyline. The Station Agent this ain't.I'm a bit on the fence about this book. I see the point that some reviewers here are making, that it's the tragedy of Paul, but I have a hard time finding his tragedy paramount or even compelling. As he, himself, says, 35 billion people have died in the holy war he unleashed. Next to that incredible cataclysm, his own sense of self-pity seems rather piddling, and his own relative inaction inexcusable.The action in Dune Messiah seems more obscure than in its predecessor. I think a bit too much is left offstage. Developments seem to conjure themselves out of thin air. That said, it still leaves the overall storyline on an interesting path and doesn't disincline me from reading Children of Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Paul Atreides, Muad'Dib, is effectively Emperor of the Universe, and he finds that his power is not a benign force. In order to keep control, he must be ruthless in the face of an alliance of treachery that extends into his own household. He tries desperately to find an answer to an impossible problem.The Good and the Bad:From Herbert, I've come to expect an almost fanatical obsession with language and culture that paints a detailed, but not always interesting, portrait. There's something so haughty about so many of the characters that eventually, the grand moments and dramatic speeches lose their power for their frequency. Some of the characters remain interesting, in particular the warrior-turned-mentat Duncan Idaho, who has been reanimated for the purpose of destroying Paul. But there's something limiting about a character who has prescience and has already learned that there is no favorable outcome to his solutions. Paul seems helpless in the face of the enormous forces that surround him, even though his will can be carried out. But the absolute power makes too much seem pointless-when there are tens of millions dying by your every word and command, the human stories lose their power, and the masses seem overwhelming.However, Dune remains an engaging planet, and the \\"old guard vs. new bureaucrats\\" is always an interesting battle. As before, I found myself wading through a lot of boredom, but captivated by the occasional scene or image."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Many will find Dune dull, hard to read, pretentious etc. The book is however one of the greatest novels ever made. It is not a light read. It is not meant to taken lightly. An understanding of the author, his intentions and the overall messianical pattern that is interwoven in the novel is truely needed to comprehend the book.Readers of the book often focus soley on the plot line of the novel. Though they may think it simplistic and predictable, it is not. Though Dune can be read without having to read the other novels they truely should be read together. They work together and create a larger storyline. When I first finished reading Dune I had the distinct feeling of missing something, or that the novel was not really finished. It wasn't. The other Dune books contribute to build an understanding of the underlying motives of the books characters and orginazations.The book does at time seem simplistic due to the somewhat static characters. Many are archetypal, however I would bring your attention to Dr. Yueh. He was not just a simple traitor. He loved house Atriedes but he hated the Harkonnens even more so that he would betray the Atreides. He is not just a simple traitor acting for his own greed or vice. Stilgar as well is a dynamic character. He goes from a great leader to a worshiper of Muad'Dib. I find that a reduction of his character. Paul himself goes from a rather mouthy boy to a leader of the imperium. Anyone can seee how Paul is a very multidimensional character. He is Paul Atriedes, Duke of Arrakis. He is Usul, the lover of his Fremen concubine Chani. He is the religious icon Muad'Dib leader of the Fremen and the new order of the Universe. There are of course the single dimensional characters who are unchanging who function as a sounding board for the more dynamic charcters. Gurney Halleck is one. An idealist who serves as a control from which one can measure the change in Paul. He also represents the concepts of idealism.Ultimatly this book is not to be simply glanced over. It should be read more then once to gain a true appreciation. It is not a simple story but almost an exposition on concepts of destiny, agency, and struggle. If all of those things are taken into account and carfully pondered over then the true beauty of the book can be seen.Some complain that upon detailed scrutiny of the novel that the book falls apart. Not so. Everything is accounted for. Sometimes the premises for those reasons are all of one sentence and can be easily missed. Read carefully.The book is also full of underlying patterns. Compare the novel to the Greek Tragedy of Agemenon and his house from who the Atriedes descend. One can see the repitition of that storyline with a twist. All the biblical, and religious references. The book is full of such allusions.This edition has some typos, font changes, repeated lines, extra spaces. It was not proof read well if at all. The publishers should really do a better job."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"One of the worste books of all time, I feel.Actually... I couldnt make it past page 50.

Though the other books may have had more &quot;depth&quot; or &quot;philosophy,&quot; or whatever makes a reader feel smart, none of them really examined humanity as did Dune. All the while, Dune tells a gripping and deeply moving story with real characters (the bad guys were not, but it was a first novel; I'll give Herbert a break) and a thought-provoking plot. The examination of what happens to a man made a god is one of the most universal themes to be discussed in science fiction and offers grim insight into human nature and our deepest emotions and fears. Above all, the book shows the interconnectedness of everything--politics and economics, love and war, even ecology and religion, with a magical descriptive vividness that creates an atmosphere more perfect than that in any other science fiction I have read. I will always remember the thoughts and images in my mind as I read Dune, and I guarantee that you will too. The mere sound of music I was listening too while reading it brings pictures of the Fremen to my mind, and I saw at least one other reviewer say the same thing. So read Dune!

Now sixteen years later I've read it for the fourth time. Frank Herbert's novel was published in 1965 and is considered to be one of the greatest science fiction works of all time. Herbert wrote a series of six Dune novels before his death in 1986. This book, the first and greatest in the series, is a tale of political intrigue and revenge set on the desert planet of Arrakis, commonly known as Dune. The story encompasses religious and ecological themes as well as social upheaval. The wealth of the planet is the geriatric spice known as melange, and Dune is the sole source of the spice. The prescient powers of the spice allow for space travel. The hero of the story, Paul Atreides, son of the Duke Leto Atreides, is caught up in a far-reaching tale of a feud between House Atreides and House Harkonnen, and a centuries-old scheme of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood to secretly breed a being with mental powers able to bridge space and time.In 1984 David Lynch brought Dune to the big screen with a mixed degree of success. Naturally he had to do some serious trimming of the sprawling novel in order to encapsulate it in a movie. He also made some marked changes to the story. I read this novel again for three reasons: 1) Because it's a favorite of mine; 2) as a precursor to watching the Sci-Fi Channel's six-hour Dune mini-series; and 3) Frank Herbert's son, Brian Herbert, in collaboration with seasoned writer Kevin J. Anderson, has written a trilogy of prequels to the Dune saga and I want to have the story fresh in my mind when I read the first of them, DUNE: HOUSE ATREIDES.I have read five of the six Dune novels in Frank Herbert's series. The second, DUNE MESSIAH continues the story of Paul Atreides, but is otherwise unremarkable. The third, CHILDREN OF DUNE, is a tale with Paul's children as the protagonists. The fourth is GOD EMPEROR OF DUNE, and was my least favorite, as it was heavy on philosophy and short on action. The fifth is HERETICS OF DUNE which I barely remember and it is set thousands of years after the events of the first three books. Some liken HERETICS to the style of the first book and I plan on reading it again. The sixth book in the series is called CHAPTERHOUSE: DUNE and purportedly picks up where HERETICS leaves off. I'll read it after I finish re-reading HERETICS OF DUNE.A note from the official Dune Novels site: &quot;Shortly before his death, Frank Herbert had begun work on DUNE 7, and he had discussed writing possible future DUNE projects with Brian. Because of the beautiful and moving dedication to Beverly Herbert, Brian's mother, in CHAPTERHOUSE, for ten years Brian felt that the story should stop there, even though the last novel ends on a cliffhanger. In 1996, though, two safe deposit boxes were discovered that Frank Herbert had sealed before his death. Inside those boxes, Brian discovered the full and complete outline for DUNE 7, the final DUNE novel Frank Herbert had intended to write, which wraps up all the story threads from the previous six books.Brian and Kevin do intend to write DUNE 7, but it will not be the next project in line. Due to the complexity of the outline, many things need to be established in earlier novels, and it also seems fitting that DUNE 7 should be the last Dune novel published.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I'll start by saying that I LOVE the book Dune and have for years. The story itself is magnificent and should get five stars. The only reason I'm only giving my review one star is because the Kindle version is so full of typos and formatting errors. I can't believe I paid so much (more than a print book!) for a Kindle version that is so appallingly badly edited.If this were a physical book, it would never have made it to the printer. I can't imagine that this version was even proofread. It's distracting and disruptive, and ruins the flow of the story to be correcting things in my head as I read.Awful. DO NOT buy the Kindle version. Save your money and buy a $2 used paperback copy."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"As many have noted, this second work veers into an entirely new direction than the first book. Whereas \\"Dune\\" reeked of war and heroism and epic events on a grand scale, this one is more intimate, almost inwardly perspective. It is not in any way a clone of the first novel but a continuation of the story.The operative word is in the title, \\"Messiah\\". Both the first and the second novels are presentations of the hope of almost every ancient civilization: A mighty man of goodness will appear and smite the sinners while elevating the downtrodden. The way this prophecy coincides with the ancient breeding program of the Bene Geseret witches is the heart of the first novel. Although the author obviously favors Arabic/Islamic motifs, the personal story of Paul is more that of Jesus than Mohammed...the curious birth, the one who does not understand his own mission, the teacher and alas, the one who dies for the sins of the world.Like all Messiahs, the teachings are sublimated as the focus of the cult becomes the person. Despite protests, the object of worship becomes the man himself. Casual sayings are codified into a creed that followers misinterpret or translate to support an existing structure. This path may be inevitable since it is far easier to worship someone that follow their advice. Paul, like Mohammed, excels in bloodshed and his adopted Fremen have conquered the Universe in a Holy War to end all wars. The old adage, \\"An evil act is justified by its ultimate goal, \\" plays out repeatedly in this novel. The Fremen have their Messiah yet nothing really changes, people are still the same inside - only the externals have varied.The palace intrigues are more subtle, the dialogue elevated to a new plane, the philosophical arena larger. Like Islam, the cult becomes a hereditary institution whose power remains in the family. Once again, the story of the witches captivates and enthralls and ones attitude toward Paul's siter becomes one of pity at her helplessness.This is not an easy book to start out with but a necessary one for the series itself."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"&quot;Dune.&quot; You've all heard the name echoed down the corriders of masterful science fiction. But have you read the book? Hopefully so - if not, the following review is geared to stear you in one direction or the other. This amazingly complex novel follows an all too infamous VERY intricate plotline. Keep reading to find out what it's all about.Dune is set on the desert planet of Arakkis, where a precious spice is mined. This spice is the planet's main economic &quot;cash crop&quot;. But there are those that will stop at nothing to retrieve the amazing spice and its incredible profits. Elsewhere, on the planet of Atriedes, Paul, young son of the Duke, travels to the planet of Arakkis with the royal house. There he finds that he is the Kwistatz Haderach (sorry about the spelling!) and much more.Should you buy Dune? Is it worth your hard earned money? Take it from an avid and experienced reader of both science fiction and fantasy - YES. Never let the winds of change catch the classics, because very often they're the most valued. But I'm not going to stop here - what're the hard-core facts, you ask? Pros and cons?THE PROSA book well deserved of its famed name. It is indeed a science fiction masterpiece. Dune follows a complex plot, that although science fiction, capitvates the reader with extreme reality. It's been a long time since I've read a book - fantasy, science fiction, or otherwise - that relays such a believable message to the ever avid reader. But not ony the complexity of the plot attacted me to this novel. Dune is masterfully written. There's no other way to put it. The characters are so devoloped that the reader feels for them, hates them, and understands them. You can almost feel yourself in the neverending deserts of the planet Arakkis.THE CONSAh, if the book is so well written, why do many people lack the heart to finish it? 1 - its complexity. While this also makes the book believable and striking, it also makes the book complicated. You need to be a dedicated reader to understand the topics presented in this book. I don't recommend it for children - some of the topics, though perfectly appropriate, are extremely hard to grasp. Many people may say the book is &quot;boring&quot; with long conversations and a plot going no where. This is only becuase a reader does not understand the situations presented. If you want to pick up this book, be ready to re-read a few sections, especially if you have trouble understanding the words between the lines.Thanks for staying with me for so long! Those who skipped to the end, I'll sum it all up here: Dune's complexity makes it strikingly real and believavle, yet often times strict patience is required - as in real life. But if you're wondering whether to buy it - I didn't give it five stars for nothing. It's worth every penny, and more."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It's not that this book doesn't have a plot. It does, and an exciting one too. It's just that the writing, the setting, the side issues, the little tidbits can obscure it easily. The first time I read this book I hated it, because I couldn't figure out what the heck was going on. I bogged down less than halfway through. Then I saw the movie (not very good as a movie, but a darned good plot synopsis for the book). Then I reread the book, now nowing where things were going, and I was able to appreciate the intricacies of Herbert's world-building without getting bogged down in it. He does have a tendancy to overdo, to make his world a little too intricate and obscure, but this is one of the perennial classic SF books with good reason.As a side note, if you find yourself getting too bogged down in Herbert's prose, take a breather and go read the Lampoon's version DOON - the dessert planet. You'll howl!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune was a very complex book that followed a boy and his life to becoming a Messiah to the Bene Gesserit religion. It takes place on a desert world where water is vital and Paul Atreides, the main character, is a son of the duke of the planet. There are giant sandworms on this planet which stalk the planet and grow to over 1000 feet long. This book is very exciting yet somewhat predictable in parts. It invovles politics religion and how a society on this desert planet runs. I feel this book is very inspiring and very intrigueing. The characters are so well developed you feel as if they were your best of friends. I wish everyone could read this book to see how awe inspiring and enjoyful this book is."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is the most famous science fiction novel of all time. I read &quot;Dune&quot; (and all its sequels) when I was 21, turning 22. This was after I'd seen the books in the shop for so many years. As a youngster I was attracted by the airbrushed covers, with the giant worms, the robed religious followers, the sand. The books looked frighteningly thick though.I finally gave &quot;Dune&quot; a go in 1998. Arthur C. Clarke was right to compare this novel to &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. The planet Arrakis is described in as much detail as Middle-Earth, the story is monumental. When Paul Atreides' father is assassinated by the rival House Harkonnen, Paul flees into the desert with his mother. They join the native Fremen and eventually Paul leads them to greatness. There's a lot more to the story than that of course, but it's too much to describe in a paragraph.If you plan to read the entire series its probably best if you space the novels out a bit, read a couple of different books in between. It will give a better sense of time passing. I read the books one after the other. By the time I finished I thought I would see a Reverend Mother in the street. I found the last two books a bit slow, but I felt obliged to finish them. The original &quot;Dune&quot; is by far the best of the series.I've also seen the film (I think David Lunch did the best he could under the circumstances). We have the computer game too. It's amazing all the merchandise that has been created by this one book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The second book in the great Dune series. The first was pure classic. The second continues the tradition of great story telling and cliffhangers that you cannot stand to read (or should I say not read). Dune Messiah has a vivid string of plots going on that force you to think for once, unlike many other books. Dune Messiah sends the characters from the original into more deep adventures, all of which will surprise you and maybe even make you emotional. There is the dark temper and the colorful areas of the book, though this universe can be described as dark. Muad'Dib leads the long book which introduces many new things (such as the Ghola, which you all will learn about later).The ending is just so good that I cannot give you the slightest hint of what will happen, but I can tell you it will compell most readers that like this genre to go on to the next book. Dune Messiah is more like a new chapter of the story than a sequel. The excellent late writer Frank Herbert includes conspiracy, action, suspense, and a small level of romance into this epic tale which can never be finished. If you are one of those people who like to see the movie versions instead of read the book, don't. Dune cannot be filmed, you NEED the book for the full experience."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"First in the Dune chronical. This is THE masterpiece. There is no equal to this book.

As a devout atheist, it was increadible how quickly I became a fanatical follower of Paul Muad'Dib. :P"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Someone once told me that there are two types of science fiction: The type that makes you think (&quot;1984&quot;) and the type that's just for fun (&quot;Star Wars&quot;). On rare occasions, however, a piece of science fiction comes along that is both fun and thought-provoking. That is &quot;Dune.&quot;I first read &quot;Dune&quot; when I was in high school. I loved it. Paul Atreides really was the perfect human being: Fighting the giant sand worms, building an alliance with the desert Freman and defeating those evil Harkonnens to become King of the Universe.I read the book again several years later and this time the deeper meaning of &quot;Dune&quot; became clear to me. Okay, &quot;spice = oil&quot; might seem pretty basic, but there is so much more to the book than that. Rather than just Good Guys vs. Bad Guys, Frank Herbert gives us so many characters who you simply don't know what to make of. Do you like the Bene Gesserit? The Bene Tleilax? CHOAM?The sequels to &quot;Dune&quot; are good. I especially liked &quot;Children of Dune&quot; and &quot;God Emperor of Dune.&quot; Nothing, however, comes close to the original. It is a rare treat."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is the second book of the Dune series by Frank Herbert. This book picks up soon after the end of the first book. Paul Maud'Dib Atreides, main character in the first book and now emperor of the galaxy, has to deal with the results of the jihad he reluctantly released on the galaxy as well as the threats to his power from within his own palace. This book is more introspective than the first book, lacking most of the action and focusing instead on the foibles of the various characters and Herbert's musings on religion and politics.This book makes even more clear than the first book that Paul is not actually a hero, but a flawed man trying to cope with the enormity of his own power and the terrible bloodshed that is being committed in his name. The book is an essay on the dangers of absolute power and of the combination of religious and political power.Dune Messiah is also a story of the danger of a ruler becoming disaffected from those closest to him. The greatest danger to Paul comes from his disaffected wife. Paul also cuts off his beloved concubine from his decision-making and instead chooses a course which leads him towards personal destruction to save the galaxy. Perhaps Herbert's real message here is that domestic bliss is the key to happiness even for the all-powerful.Although this book is interesting, it is mainly filler between the masterpiece of Dune and the very good Children of Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Some books should never beget sequels. They are so perfect that any attempt to serialise them will only succeed in making the sequels look bad. Dune is such a book, and the sequels all meet their destinies by indeed looking bad. Some critics have even suggested that Herbert wrote the sequels only to cash in on the popularity of the original. This is uncharitable. Herbert wrote the sequels because he believed that he had important things to say. The problem is that he throws out most of what made the progenitor so good in order to say his Important Things.Nor does it help that those Important Things don't turn out to be too important. Crusade as a cleansing social/moral force; the psychoanalysis of prophesy; the pitfalls of omniscience; all are themes that have been explored more deeply and more cohesively by other writers.Moreover, such themes are out of place in the world of Dune. Dune was effective because it was simple. The Fremen commanded our interest because their outlook on life was as stark as their environment. Jessica commanded our sympathy because she chose her loyalty as consort and mother over her instilled training as social engineer. Paul commanded our respect because he continually overcame adversity, displayed courageous resourcefulness and showed himself in every way his father's son. These are all characteristics with which we can identify because they satisfy our yearning for love, honour and justice. And in Dune, Herbert successfully elevated them from the commonplace to the heroic by keeping them free of unnecessary artifice.In Messiah, Herbert forgets this principle and overindulges in cleverness. Every character has inscrutable agendas, unfathomable layers, infinite subtlety. Such properties must be used sparingly. When they are slathered on with a trowel, as they are here, they only succeed in turning the characters into caricatures of themselves. I was nauseous after the umpteenth description of such and such a verbal blade unerringly penetrating to such and such a depth because it was precisely engineered with such and such a sub-harmonic and delivered with exactly such and such a sneer. Ohh Puhlease!This is an unattractive work and the sequels that follow only get worse. But when a writer composes a masterpiece as fine as Dune, I suppose he can be forgiven his later excesses."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, the story itself was very gripping and enjoyed each and every character, I would easily have given it 5 stars.The kindle edition however leaves much to be desired, misspelt words (including character names), missing spaces, missing punctuation (often the leading quotation mark for speech was absent), etc.At times this edition detracted from the beauty of this novel.The kindle edition feels like it was generated using an OCR system, I can't think of any other explanation for the poor quality.In general there is little excuse, the digital version should be at least as good as the physical book, however the sf masterworks project is ambitious and so for this I am willing to grant a little leeway.I also wish the included dictionary (explaining foreign words that are used heavily throughout) was easier to access, ideally being used to supplement the kindle's built-in dictionary, however this is a limitation of the kindle rather than the text.Overall I would still recommend this book, and despite all of this, I will be reading the rest of the series in this same format.After reading more about the sf masterworks project I still think that what they are trying to achieve is fantastic.Given the choice between reading Dune on the kindle in it's current state vs reading it in paperback (or worse, not reading at all); I would still pick reading it on the kindle."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I am surprised that I had never read this before now. I have fallen in love with the Dune Universe through the movies and identify with Paul Atreides so much with the regards to the relationship with his father and the loss of his birthright. Anyone who has lost their father at an early age coupled with more tragedies after will know what I mean. This book still amazes me at how meaty it is. When I told several of my friends that I was reading this book, they were amazed I would take on such an opus. The only downside is not about the book, but the electronic format for eReaders. There is a lot of typo's throughout the book and became a distraction at times."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert has crafted a vast universe in his Dune chronicles, with well-established politics, religion, an established economy and family dynasties. At the forefront of his immense worldbuilding is our hero, Paul Atreides, who at the beginning of the novel is a mere fifteen years old. He is the son of a duke and has been trained since childhood to later become a duke himself. His mother is a Bene Gesserit, a school that teaches what most would consider a type of witchcraft.The novel takes place 8000 years in the future; however, it takes place in a time when computers have become prohibited. It centers around the planet Arrakis, which is the sole source of the valuable spice melange. The planet is so dry that its inhabitants wear stillsuits to maintain moisture. In fact, to shed a tear or to spit is a sign of honor, as each drop of water is so precious.Paul's father, Duke Leto has been named governor of this very important planet but is soon betrayed by a rival family. Paul Atreides escapes and is forced to brave the hostile environment and people on Arrakis to help restore justice to his family.The appeal of _Dune_ is well understood. While our hero is an aristocrat, we see his character develop over the course of the novel from a teenager in training with a great love for people into a messianic leader who saves the Fremen of Arrakis from the Harkonen family. To build a universe such as Herbert did in _Dune_ is monumental.Furthermore, like many of the greats of science fiction, Frank Herbert was ahead of his time. A great part of the novel focuses on the ecology of Arrakis -- a topic that we now see as the focus in science and industry on Earth. He writes skillfully and is able to communicate his intricate universe in a story that is approachable.My criticism of the novel first lies in the writing style. The narrative point of view is written in the third person, and the perspective shifts from person to person at a moment's notice. Perhaps a lot of the tension is removed with this style of writing, for the reader has complete knowledge of each character's motives in his or her actions. Unfortunately, I see this writing style has alienated some readers so much as to give this novel a 1-star rating, which is absolutely ludicrous. My only other frustrations with the novel are the excess detail often given about the Bene Gesserit and the quite abrupt ending to the novel.Overall, this novel clearly stands as one of the hallmarks of speculative fiction and is required reading for any fan of the genre. I have not read any of the subsequent novels, but I appreciate the vast world Herbert has created."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I read \\"Dune\\" when I was in college, almost forty five years ago, but Istill occasionally 'flash back' to its depiction of life in a world wherewater is extremely scarce. The book is interesting and thought provoking onseveral levels, and I recommend it now as much as ever."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Any genuine understanding of science fiction begins with Dune. It is not only a quantum leap ahead of anything from its time, it is arguably still today rarely equaled and even more seldom surpassed, in spite of the fact that Frank Herbert's successors have his own work (and all of the ensuing derivative work from the intervening decades) to guide them.Although Herbert originally wrote six Dune novels, I have come to think of the first three as a single work, simply because I never feel like I am done reading if I stop at the end of the first or even the second book. So this review should be considered to regard Dune, Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune. If you are not willing to read at least those three (and the second three, while worthwhile, are much less contiguous and less indispensable), you are missing a good deal of what is great about this work.The first word that comes to mind to describe Dune is \\"smart.\\" Herbert's main writing innovation is the amount that he leaves out. Although the POV is omniscient, it is still the POV of an omniscient in Herbert's world and not in ours. So, there is much that could have been written to acclimate a visitor from our world to the world of Dune. Herbert's mastery is in leaving it all out, and still leaving you totally aware (at least, if you are paying careful attention) of what you didn't read explicitly. The author never underestimates his readers, instead making leaps in narrative, character arc, and history, and expecting you to follow. You find yourself rising to the challenge, and feel smarter just by virtue of having read and understood.The characters are also \\"smart.\\" I have read science fiction from childhood on, and the more I read, the more I am amazed at how intelligent the characters in Dune are. There are factions within factions, schemes within schemes, bitterly opposed and fully developed characters locked in truly epic struggles for their own survival, the survival of their respective dynasties, and the success of plans whose maturity is measured in millennia. And the best part is, none of these characters need to be described as geniuses--we already know that just by reading.There is an old political joke that a candidate, when asked how he will address a given problem, answers \\"I'll just imagine a guy smarter than me, then do what he would do.\\" Obviously, it's not that easy. The same concept holds in writing fiction--it is impossible for a character to be both well developed and smarter than the author. This is doubly true in science fiction, where the myriad plot and character threads must intertwine with a society truly alien from our own, which nonetheless has a dazzling array of strictures in its religious, political, economic, and metaphysical aspects, all of which must be consistent and believable. Herbert set an extremely ambitious goal in creating the world of Dune, and the cast of characters with which to populate it. And he accomplishes that goal in grand style. It is the literary equivalent of knocking one out of the park, in the bottom of the ninth of World Series game 7.If you like science fiction and have not read Dune, you will be astounded at what you have been missing. If you do not (yet) like science fiction, you may find it both too dense and too vague, as a certain amount of literacy in the genre is required before you can confidently fill in the blanks and make the leaps required by the text. It is the book equivalent of a movie where you can't miss a moment, for fear of not understanding something later on. That said, you shouldn't let the book intimidate you, as it is a real pleasure to read. If I got more out of it in my 30's than I did in my teens, that is only to be expected. But whenever I have read it, I have been not only entertained, but broadened, awakened--in a word, edified."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The quality and re-readability of this book are not to be underestimated.The book has spiritual depth and metaphor and depths that I keep finding over time.

It has been at least 30 years since I sat down with this book and to this day it still remains one of the most original, enthralling, visionary and mystical novels I've ever had the pleasure to read.This was truly a novel way ahead of its time. Back then I was primarily fascinated with the elements of mysticism that permeated the story; Paul's visions, the ancient prophecies, the Bene Gesserit, the spice and of course the great sandworms. However now in the light of the world as it exists in the 21st century I clearly see the author's keen foresight at work. His environmental concerns pertaining to ecosystems and the scarcity of water, as well as the foreboding of an impending, universal Jihad bring his story to life in ways unimaginable forty years ago. Maybe he was really Frank Herbert the prophet, not Frank Herbert the author?"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Let me start off by saying that very few books of fiction have done it for me as far as giving me insight into the soul of humanity or the complexities of our planets ecological system. I am an avid reader of non-fiction, particularly biographies because for the most part they're interesting, for I find most fiction to be stale and lifeless, mostly due to plot contrivances that no living writer of today's post modern world can't seem to shake. But I have seen the light...and it's called DUNE!!! In all of my 31 years on this earth I have not read one piece of popular fiction that can hold a candle to this work. This is ingenious work for the sole reason that Frank Herbert presents multiple story arcs, themes and inner voices into a cohesive whole that the average reader(like myself)can understand without scratching my head and saying \\"huuh?\\" It literally transcends the genre of sci-fiction. George(Star Wars) Lucas should be giving profit points to the Herbert estate for literally outright ripping off ideas and motifs from Dune. Hey I guess if you're gonna steal, you steal from the best. This book is quite simply the best piece of fiction I've ever read. If I had the foresight to read it in my 20's, I can't help but to think that I would be in a better position than where I am at right now in my life, but hey...better late than never. Read this book and I guarantee you that your life will change."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"What can you say about Dune? Simply put, I loved this book. The political commentary was on point and reminiscent of colonization: it demonstrated the open exploitation of a people (Fremen) by outside market interests (House Harkonnen, the Emperor, the Guild) and the subsequent rebellion that led to revolutionary decolonization. The book also made a foray into religion, a sort of savage religion, in the tales of Muad'Dib and the prophetic Kwisatz Haderach, and environmentalism popped up with the vision of Liet-Kynes to turn an entire desert community into a lush garden planet.Frank Herbert does an incredible job and is an outstanding story teller who can blend different plot elements and themes under the embrace of science fiction. That is precisely why whenever science fiction is brought up, Dune is always the first book mentioned. It really is an outstanding story.Take it from me, someone who does not generally enjoy science fiction, Dune is just a great book, period. Disregarding all genres and labels, Dune is a solid work of fiction, entirely worth the read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I'll keep this review brief, as to be honest, I'm not sure that there's much to say that hasn't already been said (and said much more eloquently) by other reviewers. First published in the 1960s, Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" and its consequent sequels are the science-fiction equivalent to fantasy's \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Dense, detailed and complicated, \\"Dune\\" cannot be read just once in order to fully appreciate the immense time and effort that went into its creation.Best (but over-simply) described as a story of political intrigue and power, \\"Dune\\" takes place predominantly on the planet Arrakis, where immense sandworms traverse the endless deserts and cultivate the substance known as spice, the most precious commodity in the universe. Governance of this planet has recently passed from the Harkonnen to the Atreides household, and Duke Leto Atreides and his family is preparing for the upheaval in their lives. His young son Paul, the product of the Duke and his beloved concubine Jessica, is greeted with particular interest on arrival in Arrakis, believed to be a subject of prophecy by the native Fremen people.But the Harkonnen household will not so easily give up their hold over Arrakis and the spice, and have taken measures to ensure the death of the new royal family. Thrown in amongst the fierce Fremen people, Paul creates a new identity for himself as messiah and ruler, the only one who can restore the planet to its rightful inhabitants. Of course, that's easier said than done and the effort takes place over a great number of years, filled with intrigue, betrayal, love, allies, enemies, war, marriage and political manoeuvring. It is intensely complicated, with many futuristic customs and ideologies that are never fully explained, effectively throwing the reader into a brand new world in which they must sink or swim. Many will find this exhilarating, others will be immensely confused, despite the presence of Appendixes and a Glossary of terms used.Herbert's great novel is unique because, despite the fact that it is science-fiction, it still has plenty of room for religious belief and practice, which in fact makes up the most intriguing part of the novel. The Bene Gesserit order was (for me) immensely fascinating, what with its elaborate scheming and genetic planning. Their unique fighting abilities, their prescience, their sheer calculated guile - it all makes for one of the most interesting and imaginative components of the story.The narrative is primarily centred on intrigue and movement as opposed to any descriptive passages on either character or setting, making it a rather difficult read at times. In fact, the narrative technique of the novel is utterly unique given that it is so intimate in detail despite the fact that the story is so epic in scope; you never get any \`eye-of-God' passages, all events are strictly presented through the experiences of the character involved. A story that is told almost entirely through internal soliloquies and dialogue between characters - that's a rare thing, and it is a testimony to Herbert's skill that he got away with it. I must admit though, that at times I felt a little claustrophobic in terms of the intimacy of the writing. I know it is considered hubris by many to criticise such a work, but a little more \\"breathing room\\" amongst the density of the plot and ideologies would have been much appreciated.But in a way my complaints are irrelevant, as \\"Dune\\" should be read in any case. A milestone in the tradition of science-fiction as well as a fascinating read in its own right (both through technique and story), \\"Dune\\" is one of those modern classics that has to be read and appreciated before you die."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The complete Dune Saga is a masterpiece, especially for those interested in understanding politics and the role of religion in our society. I won't go into a synopsis of the story, if you haven't already gotten a pretty good idea what Dune is about from reading the 480 other reviews and/or haven't seen the movie(s), then frankly, you are just not paying attention.Dune is science fiction, but that is not what makes the book important. Frank Herbert is a pure student of anthropology and has an in depth understanding of the powerful, the powerless and all those in between. He also clearly demonstrates the techiniques that are used to motivate the masses. In the Dune saga Herbert investigates the archetypal messianic myth and why that myth is so influential to humans. In so doing he unmasks fundamentalists for what they are (fearful beyond reaon), while at the same time demonstrating the freedom in pure Spirituality.This one is a must read for Science fiction buffs, but more importantly, this is a must read for students of humanity."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Twelve years after the defeat of the emperor, the Fremen Jihad has reached the far extant of the galaxy. The imposition of religious rule throughout the galaxy has made a number of enemies who are plotting against Muad'Dib.There are many themes running through this book. Among them is the lack of children and the rivalry between Chani and Princess Irulan. Another is the notion of the actual amount of control Paul Muad'Dib actually had over the jihad. Another is the sentimentalism among Fremen for the old ways. Herbert does an absolutely masterful job of weaving these and other themes together in a well written, beautiful conceived saga.This diverges from the themes in the first novel in the saga, however, that in no way diminishes from this volume's contribution to the ongoing storyline. In fact, the changing themes actually is a testimony to the understanding of the author that as the sociopolitical environment changes, the issues change as well. Herbert handles that better than almost any other writer of any genre I have had the joy of reading."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"1. Read the book during the summer-time2.

This notion is effectively conveyed in Frank Herbert?s science fiction masterpiece, Dune, published in 1965. Just like many science fiction novels, Dune takes place at an unknown time. Dune could have taken place many years ago or could take place many years in the future. Dune is the story of the Ducal heir, Paul, of House Atreides, later called Muad?Dib. Herbert tells of Paul?s quest to avenge his family?s demise, and about the consequences of such a quest. Laced into this epic tale are elements of theology, and the majestic power one single prophecy can hold over an entire race. The prophecy was that a man would come who would change the face of the desert planet, Arrakis, the capital of House Atreides. This man would fulfill humankind?s most impossible dream, water on Arrakis. He would also be the rightful ruler of all humankind. He would be called the Lisan al-Gaib ? Guess what? Paul is the Lisan al-Gaib. Herbert writes in a highly detailed and logical fashion. Although Dune is an extremely descriptive book, Herbert writes in such a way that a reader cannot help but remember all the small details in Dune. This quote from page 466 shows Herbert?s writing style: ?He was warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous, ruthless, less than a god, more than a man. There is no measuring Muad?Dib?s motives by ordinary standards.? The same can be said of Herbert?s writing, it surpasses ordinary standards. In my opinion, Dune is one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time. Touching on religious and superstitious beliefs, Dune almost undetectably deals with issues that were happening when Dune was written. I believe that Dune gives a person incentive to do something with his/her life. It inspires a person by showing that nothing is impossible if a person tries hard enough. Herbert?s omnipresent view of conserving resources, especially water, will make one think about conservation. The reader of Dune is like a fish; once you are caught, it is hard to escape. --Ben Mandel, Greenwich CT."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune was a great book. I had a lot of fun reading it. One of my favorite parts was when the people would fight, it was very discriptive I could imagine the intire fight in my head. Dune was a very good book, the begging was a little slow but I would read it again just to pick up on everything I missed out on in the first run. My favorite character was Jessica because she was right in the middle of everything that was going on. If it wasn't for Jessica none of this would have even taken place. Frank Hebert is an excellent author I think he had a talent for writing in deep depth. In one chapter of Dune you can find many hidden meanings in everything that is what makes Frank Herbert a good author I will look forward to reading other books he has written."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is one of the few books I have read numerous times. The tale is believable once one allows for the place. Herbert's sense of time, ecology, heroes and the impact one has on society and the power of the human collective ego is phenomenal.The new SciFi movie is much better than the original, which focused on the absurd rather than the tightly written story line. Read the book upon which two movie have attempted to tell the immense story"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Read this book, you won't be dissapointed. It has everything you could desire in a work of literature: strong characters, originality, and literary depth, mixed with a healthy dose of action and an exciting science fiction setting.A warning: fans who like action or adventure in their science fiction might find books 2,3, and 4 of the series somewhat dool, and those looking for light reading will be dissapointed. However, books 5 and 6 are great reading."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is one of the most inspirational sci/fi books that I hav ever read.

The idea that the richest natural resource spot in the galaxy is not the empire's capital makes sense to me. The world's political nexus isn't Saudi Arabia &amp; ours isn't Alaska. So there's no problem there. It's just the book is too dark, baroque, &amp; now that I think of it absurd for me. How could you have this kind of multi-planetary empire without thinking computers? How could a few million Fremen conquer the millions of planets I'm pretty sure they mentioned? I don't like to nitpick, but was the rest of the universe so stupid that a planet could be conquered per Fremen? There is a book called &quot;The Planet Buyer&quot; buy Cordwainer Smith.

In least it's illogicalness is open &amp; kind of fun."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Excellent book, however the printing company has done a horrible job. They have not left enough space between the binding line and the words and one needs to struggle with every page to be able to read the book. Such a disrespect to this masterpiece and the author. Amazon should refuse to sell defected books of that sort to its clients. Shame on ACE printing company for doing such a lousy job."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Everyone else has given this five stars, but I am writing to let people know that some of you may not like it. BIG QUALIFICATION: I have to admit I have not read the entire book. The first time I tried was in college, but I only got to around p. 150. Now, 13 years later, I had to give up at p. 250. (I would appreciate it if someone could tell me at what stage it gets better.)The book is simply dull. I point out the following:THIS IS NOT SCIENCE FICTION: Yes, the setting is some distant future, with space travel etc. But this is definitely not science fiction. There is no theme around technology, scientific dilemma, or interaction/conflict between humanity and technology/science. The correct genre is fantasy. It calls to mind the Lord of the Rings (I did read all of that) in its rich detail of a fantasy world.STORYLINE IS TOO DULL: sure, the detail is impressive, but the story is predictable. It starts out with so much promise - the struggle among the noble houses, the Emperor, the Guild, etc. in a complex setting. But the book disappoints. The characters are so one-dimensional in their various superhuman skills or character traits that they are like comic book characters. The Bene Gesserit, Mentat, and others are capable of understanding the grandest significances from the minutest of details - it just becomes too ridiculous after a while.STORY HAS NO SUSPENSE: You know from the first few chapters how everything is supposed to turn out. So many prophecies. And then you have the silly, pretentious mock quotations that preface each chapter - there is absolutely no suspense because you see that everything is going according to prophecy. It is like reading the Bible - you know how all conflicts will turn out in the end.TOO MANY INCONSISTENCIES: Characters see the most elaborate intrigues in the simplest things, and understand the most byzantine possibilities in strategic maneuvering. Precisely because Herbert makes his characters so &quot;perceptive&quot; - and plots and intrigues so complex - you start to see silly inconsistencies. For example, you have Lady Jessica and Thufir Hawat (a Bene Gesserit and a Mentat - two superanalysts) know that there is a traitor and that their situation is precarious when they arrive on Arrakis. But the room in the fortress that controls the protective shield is occupied by a couple of engineers and an old woman such that the traitor is able to kill them with a knife and thereby bring down the entire dukedom. How can you explain this oversight? Another example: Arrakis is practically the most important planet in the universe because of the spice. Yet the Emperor has sent only one ecologist who has any idea what the planet is about while everyone else is only interested in mining the spice? In real life, would corporations and nations behave this way? Third example: if the Emperor and the Harkonnen are so ignorant and cavalier about the planet's ecology, wouldn't it have occurred to them that they could get rid of the pesky sandworms with bombs when they come to swallow the mining equipment? I know that no book can be airtight in its premises (and that there are inconsistencies in the real world as well). But because Herbert creates such a complex, rich world with clever, superhuman powers of perception, he invites the reader to read with a higher level of critical analysis. And the book cannot survive the higher critical analysis.I would appreciate if a fan of Dune could tell me why I'm wrong. Or at least around what page the book gets any better. Until then, the book goes on my shelf of books that I regretted ever starting."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I love the concept of this book, and the story is out of sight, it's that great. However, I can't give this 5 stars. First it's because of the unpronouncable names and various other proper nouns. I wouldn't complain if it was only a smattering of hard to read words. But in this cast of thousands, its impossible to go more than 20 pages without a new person place or thing called something close to jibberish. And I read mostly sci-fi and fantasy novels, so I am used to a strange name here and there, but this book is chock full of them, maddeningly so. Second, the amazing political machinations are enough to make a reader have to create a flow-chart in order to keep up. I don't mind political intrigue, I like it. But Lordy! Everyone has an agenda, everyone plots behind the scences, it's incredibly complex. I'm not that fond of the super-complicated plot lines. Those are my complaints, and these two thing make it difficult to read. But read it I did, and I do say the images are great, a reader can visualize everything clearly and accurately and the story is great. Shakespeare would be awed. Read it, but take notes."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is an epic masterpiece by Frank Herbert.The story begins on the planet Caladan in the year 10,191, home to the House Atreides.

After a collapse of House Atreides, his son Paul is taken in by the Fremen and given the name Muad'Dib. By harnessing the powers handed down to him by his Bene-Gesserit mother, and the focusing effect of Melange, the spice of spices that is only found on Arrakis, he challenges his enemies to try and take back his father's throne. This exciting science fiction novel will have you reading it multiple times, and keeping it close on your bookshelf.I Would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading fiction, and especially to those who enjoy stories such as The Lord of the Rings, Star Trek, and even Harry Potter. Truely one of the greatest works of fiction of our time."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Why another review? Supposedly things are so complicated and sophisticated these days. People know what they like what they don't. Computers need file names and folders. So publishers need categories, writers need to stay in them. Parents get pleased when the child learns to color inside the lines, conformity is rewarded. But what of art?Some think Homer never existed. Some think he was blind. We all know he did not put pen to paper. Yet all lists of the greatest literature of all time show the Iliad and the Odyssey at the top. And supposedly they were only two of many that did not survive the fire in Alexandria. But the tales were just songs, people heard them, memorized them, some wrote them down, more learned them, the writings got lost, things changed, poems got translated, and so on and so on. Has this reviewr lost the thread?Dune is mythology, an epic tale. Mr. Herbert left the building, went some where else so he could show the myths of our civilization. Those that had grown since the time of Homer. Homer wrote of the myths that had preceeded him, perhaps by 500 years. Mr. Herbert writes of the myths that arose over the last 2500 years. To do this he went to Dune. As Archimedes demonstrated you must go to another place to find the leverage to move the world.Now we can wait and see over the next 2000 years if this epic tale as deep as any I know of, can have the legs Homer has shown already. But I must admit I was inspired by this book. Not bad for $7.99? Perhaps you will too. But it helps to live in a rain forest."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is considered one of the best SF works ever written....and deservedly so. I will tell you right now that this novel is not one to pick up for light weekend reading. You have to be READY for it. If not, you will grow bored and tired of it really quickly. As for myself, I really liked the book. I was seduced into reading it by a friend of mine who is an obsessive DUNE fan. I think the characters and general plot lines are well developed, and both the intellectual and &quot;fly by night&quot; reader can find something enjoyable within the book's covers. However, I believe that Herbert took a little too long in developing the plot in exchange for going off on heavy philosophical tangents. I found myself, at several points, having to put the book down and do some real thinking before I could come back to it. Also, it seems that about two-thirds of the way through the book, Herbert realized he had to pick up the action, and the end of the book seems to be hurried along. Not that I am complaining! The action at the end is the best part of the novel...and Paul's quote near the end about &quot;love tempering wisdom&quot; has to be one of the most effective lines ever written in literature. With all that said, DUNE is a great novel. You should give it a try....you might find yourself reading the other 5 originals and the new series by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"One of the most intricate and challenging books of my experience. I can read it again 30 years later and see meanings and references that I never saw before. A book that can be read at many levels.This is the story of the far, far future. It is a universe where man has conquered space and colonised an Empire of many worlds. Yet, it is an Empire ruled in the ancient corrupt pattern- brutality, greed, fear, and Byzantine game playing. An Emperor rules, playing great family against great family. Secret societies play their own intricate games in the shadows. It is all the more terrifying because men have long since rid themselves of thinking machines (the Butlerian Jihad) and instead unlocked human mental potential to become far more than mere machines could ever be. Yet these gifts are still used in a vast dark, medieval web. Inspite of the intrigues, the wars, the assassinations, it is a narrow and stagnant society.Enter Paul Atreides, scion of House Atreides. We see Paul grow from boy, to man, to more than man. In Paul we see the result of ninety generations of selective breeding to produce the ultimate in human development- the Kwisatz Haderach, a being capable of stepping outside of space-time itself to see all aspects of past and future in the eternal NOW. Yet Paul has not awakened to his potential. It takes his being plunged into the heart of the hell-planet Dune to awaken him. Here among the wild and honorable Fremen of the planet-wide desert he is tranformed into the warrior prophet long awaited- Muad'Dib. Even the Emperor and his elite killers learn to tremble in fear, for the prophet has the strength of righteousness and heaven smiles upon him.

Dune is an introduction to a different, strange universe. Frank herbert did a masterful job of setting up this place- it is unique in a way that no other science fiction can replicate. Herbert's best creation is the world of Dune itself, and its mystical connections with the worms. But perhaps the most satisfying aspect of the book is the way in which its written. Nothing is spoonfed to the reader. You have to work to understand what he is trying to say- and its not easy for the casual reader. Dune is actually the most readable of the books in the series. From this one on, the series becomes more and mroe complex- until it became unreadable in my opinion, with Book5. But even lovers of traditional science fiction will find much to like here.

It has very serious undertones of enviromentalism. Frank Herbert easily created one of the masterpeices of SF with this one. I heartily recommend this to any fan of the genre. You won't be dissappointed."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"There is no doubting that this book is written in a different style than the original Dune. It is a completion of the original in many ways. The social explorations glanced over in Dune are more deeply explored and this may cause some readers to not appreciate it as much as the first. I have been reading this series at least once a year for many years. I read Dune over 30 years ago and snapped up each sequel as it appeared. There are only a few writers that I compare to Herbert, as well, there are only a few books, and a few series of books that I compare to his work. He is an old friend and I miss him (I never met him). I do not give away plots or give excerpts and I never choose 1 book of a series over another. I stop reading series (like Jordans and Goodkinds works) if they appear drawn out and pointless. That is never a worry with the 6 original Dune books. The Fremen would be proud of Mr. Herbert as he had no sweat on his palms..."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"What can be said about this novel that hasn't already been said. There are not enough superlatives in the English language. I have been reading this novel once or twice a year for 30 years. I have been reading the sequels in order as they came out for as long as they have been out. I read Children of Dune in serial form when it was printed in Analog magazine beginning in January 1976 and eagerly awaited the issues for Feb., Mar., and Apr. of that year. The entire series is well worth reading over and over again because, unfortunately, there will not be a seventh novel by Mr. Herbert. When you finish, you want more and what better praise can one give. The writing is excellent, the characters well formed, the plot consistent and whole. I love this series and this book in particular. I whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading. I dont mean reading science fiction or fantasy...I MEAN READING!!!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Science fiction combines adventure, fantasy, and horror into an imaginary world. Frank Herbert's Dune, set on the desert planet of Arrakis, is simply a science fiction masterpiece, setting itself apart from the typical novel by discussing themes that are uncommon in other genres. The style of writing and the language used in Dune can be difficult to understand and comprehend at times, but the storyline and the plot are quite easy to follow. The plot contains several issues, including the controversial topic of religion, that interest the reader and keep them reading on for more. For example, technology is a central theme. The reader can then relate to the book, since we live in a world that is dependent upon technology. Also, the characters are well developed and easy to relate to. Each character has their own place in the book; there are no characters that just suddenly appear, and then disappear. Overall, Dune appeals to the reader simply because it is easy to relate to."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If you are a fan of sci-fi, or even if you're not, this is truly one of the greatest books ever. Frank Herbert creates a fantastic world filled with amazing creatures like the sand worms, and unforgetable characters, such as Lady Jessica and Pual Maud'dib Atriedes.In the story there is one main plot, yet there are also sub plots, like Paul becoming the kwisatz haderach--the male Bene Geserit. I can't really put this book into words--you just have to read it for yourself. And if you have trouble understanding this beautiful and complex Dune universe, there is also the handy glossary in the back to help you understand the words. But don't just sit there reading this review--read Dune!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"As a child, I was first exposed to Dune- the movie. I liked the film, even if it was too strange and complex for me to fully grasp. But when I grew older, I found the book and I was truly amazed. Never before had I read a book so fancifully detailed in its plot, descriptions, and characters; Frank Herbert created an entire world, a masterpiece of imagination. Muad-dib's struggle still holds me spellbound to this day, even after hundreds of readings. This novel is a true work of art -- one of the shining stars in the history of science fiction."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is a lousy sci-fi book. There is no space travel, no robots, practially no aliens, ray guns, space ports or any advanced technology whatsoever. However, it's essentially the best story to fit into just one book I've been fortunate enough to encounter. The plot takes you to a distant world, far separated from us in both time and space, to the home of the Atreides family. They are nobles of some sort and have been comissioned by the Emperor to govern the planet of Arrakis, home of the mysterious spice, a substance with many miraculous traits. From here the book brings you right into the intricate plots surrounding the family Atreides and their adversaries, all surrounded by an environment that speaks more of the middle ages than the future.Well, I would be lying if I didn't admit that every now and then an ornithopter or a las-pistol enters the scene (alright, there _are_ ray guns), but this only serves as a backdrop to the vivid characters of the book, in my opinion the strongest side of the book. I grew attached to them from the first line they appeared and I felt close to them all the way through the story.If you havn't read this book already, I suggest you pick it up right away. I've yet so talk with any litterate person who didn't at least think it a fair read. If you've read it before, I still recommmend you buy this particular printing. It's nicely set on good paper with a very stylish cover. Personally, I think I'll schedule it for another reading in a year or so."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"There ain't much to say about this book else then: SUPERB! It really takes hold of it, makes you read it and then desire for the sequel-book &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;. A rich family, currently ruling the Planet Calladan, is sent by the Emperor to take control of the Desert Planet Arrakis. The only known place were the &quot;Spice&quot; is found. The Spice became an important resource, because it sharpens the mind of the consumer and in some rare occasions can make people look into the future. Who rules the Spice, rules the Universe. There's only one tiny problem about it. Arrakis is currently run by the archrivals of our rich family and they just don't want to give up the best income-source in the universe."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When I picked up Dune in 1998, I had no idea what it was. I had seen the horrible movie when I was a slight bit younger, and had been disgusted by it. I figured that the book would be pretty much the same. However, I opened the book, and could not stop reading. In Dune, Frank Herbert has created a living, breathing world, with characters that I can actually visualize. Herbert is a master of the speculative fiction genre. As far as I have seen, he is the only author capable of capturing my imagination in such ways that Dune (and later, its sequels) was able to."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Having read other reviews of this, the 2nd dune novel and bridge between father and son I feel that I have to put pen to paper, or finger to keyboard. Although this book does not offer the same level of action and adventure as Dune it is still a brilliant piece of work. Set shortly after Paul seizes the imperial throne from Shaddam IV it tells of the troubled pregnancy of Chani, the reluctance of Paul to follow 'The Golden Path' revealed to him during Spice trance and the various plots within plots within plots that are being formed to remove the Atreides from the throne and Paul from the centre of his newly formed religion. Although due to its lack of length and seemingly disappointing ending I felt that it was still a good book and necessary for the series to continue. If you have read this book and feel a bit put off I urge you to read the next in the series, 'Children of Dune', as it sheds light on the actions and motivations of Paul in this book, and between the two helps you to understand the development of the Dune story as a whole."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"What can be written about this book that hasn't made its way into a critical essay, somewhere? The thing I find truly remarkable about this work is how it stands up to the tests of time and repeated reevaluation. Like the protagonist of this story, the author seems to have had a certain amount of clarivoyance. This book bears repeated reexamination and discussion, and will until the current year and the books year coincide (around 10,000 AD or so, I think...) On a personal note, I find the idea of the best warriors in the universe using primarily blades, not guns, to be an interesting futuristic anachronism. Not to mention very cool."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When I first read Dune, a couple years ago, I was enthralled by it's wonderful writing style. It seemed as though Frank Herbert preserved the freshness and vitality of Dune and whenever I open it up I get that freshness. With all of this pulp science fiction nowadays, it's nice to be able to unlock the times of old. Paul Atreides is one of the most fully realized character in any book I've read, and the Baron is evil but not cartoonish. The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, with their special breeding programs, and the Guild with their plots and plans,make Dune a realistic, thought provoking, and fun book. Read this or the sand worms of Arrakis will come looking for you next."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book was the greates most intricate novel I have ever read. Save &quot;The Lord of The Rings&quot;. The book was not an overnight job. It had Tons of info to back up every event in the book. It is a whole world with a long history and a reason for every event. It shows what good and bad things can come from ultimate power. The Long animosity between House Aterdies and House Harkonnen came to a climax in the Harkonnen attack on the Atredies. Paul survives by falling in league with the fremen and comes back to defeat the Harkonnens and the Padish Emperor."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a timeless book. The writing style is superior to many novels, even after 35 years. I admit that I tried reading Dune and then quit(I was in the 7th grade). But after I saw the movie I wanted to read the book. Was I ever glad that I did! Buy this book. Oh, the sequels. People have mixed feelings about the sequels, so I recommend that you read them at your local library before deciding to buy them. P.S. This book is far better than anything Heinlein ever wrote."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"On the whole, this sequel is more transperant in its themes and intrigues allowing easier access to the cerebral, and showcases a larger cross section of Herbert's fascinating future universe.For anyone versed in theology and/or the Christian religon will recognize the direct implied comparisons between Paul and Christ, including the story of Lazarus being raised from the dead and the demi-deification of the Virgin Mary by the Catholics.The layers of meaning and symbolism are mind boggling, as in all of Herbert's books that i've read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"At first, Dune's complexity and length (mostly length) were a barrier to my reading it. I've read Heinlien, Assimov, and others. After I saw the long version of the movie, I felt there were too many unanswered questions. I knew that a respected science fiction author would not leave that many stones unturned. So that day, I began reading the book. I found that I could not put it down. I read each page fully looking for the clues and the complex plot twists. I was held in an almost suspended state as my mind's eye watched this drama unfold. The only thing that I wish was different, is the description of Gurney, &quot;an ugly lump of a man&quot; (page 31). My mind kept seeing Patrick Stewart and I don't believe he is &quot;an ugly lump of a man.&quot; This book is only the start of a complex and unique saga covering issues that transend time. If you are a light SCI-FI reader, try reading this book with the eye of yesterday, of today and of tomorrow."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have read the 6 books by Frank herbert and I have seen the vision that he was trying to create in the wording of the books. Those who read the books shouldn't just read them, but they should invision what Mr. Herbert was trying to say and creat in you mind. I would suggest that you underline those parts that you find most interesting and and learn what he was trying to say at the point in the book. Quote, &quot; I will let fear pass over me and through me.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This has to be the all time best book I have ever read.

To read Dune, is to embrace the wisdom and skill of Frank Herbert. Dune tells a story that appeals to everyone through its politics, environmental discussions, and religion.

Such a masterpiece deserves a place on your shelf."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a classic. I have read it several times and each time found new thought provoking truths to ponder over for the next several months. There are so many levels of meaning in this story that it will never grow old. Several themes include: The story of Paul Atriades and his family, conservation of natural resources, conflicts in society, management of greed, conflict between sacrifice and gain, the ultimate dangers of artificial intelligence, and the list goes on. All this and it's a terrific page-turner too. I cannot begin to recommend this book highly enough.

None of you have blindly found this page, because everyone knows the legend of Dune. A book that is so strong that it has generated several movies (Well alright, one motion picture and at least two made for TV attempts.) and a legion of fanatical, nearly rabid, fans.I'm writing this review for two crowds, those who've seen the movies and those who haven't read the book in years. If you've only ever seen the movies you should be made aware that virtually chapters of details and backstory are cut out of the movies. When I watch the Lynch movie version I'm left scratching my head, &quot;OK, Paul's Muad'dib...but what does that MEAN?&quot; &quot;What the heck is Choam?&quot; &quot;Why do the they call Paul 'Usul'?&quot; &quot;What is so signifigant about Alia being born a Reverend Mother?&quot; &quot;What's the deal with the Spacing Guild?&quot; If you ever got confused in the movies READ THE BOOK! There's a good reason everybody calls it a classic, it's just a good book. If its been a while since you read the book I recommend you try it again, it's not a kids book. You may find that you've forgotten why you like the book in the first place. It's an great story with some very interesting ideas.Young or old, I recommend that you read this book. If you at all were entertained by the movie, or can't remember exactly your favorite part of the story I'd suggest you get a copy of the book and give it a try."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book rocks. It was really enjoyable. This is one of the deepest series of sociological science fiction of ever read. This book grabs you and pulls you straight through. However, you read the appendicies first including the glossary. It really helps to make the book more engrossing."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The greatest book I have ever read. Where to start?Frank Herbert, the author, is as forward thinking with this masterpiece as any work I have ever seen. There is something here for every scifi/fantasy lover.It begins with the typical noble house situation. The young Paul Atreides is the prince of a noble house that is about to assume control over a world of great wealth amidst the typical feuds and objections of other noble houses, namely the Harkonnen.This is where clich&eacute; fantasy gets derailed and nuked.The world, Arrakis, is the only world in the empire that can grow a mysterious spice called Melange. The Melange is said to have many qualities such as granting longer life (kind of like a modern day low calorie/cholesterol diet, but nothing supernatural). It does however grant an ability to see slightly into the future and for some far into the future ( a la Star Wars). This ability is crucial for interstellar navigation to foresee disaster while traveling at great speeds. Why don't they just use computers you ask? There is a really chilling and mysterious reference about a war that took place 10,000 years ago when man made machines that could think. The machines fought back and humanity barely survived (a la Terminator). After that it was law that no one person could make a machine for a task that a human could do. People then began inventing incredible abilities such as the Navigators (the only ones who can fly spaceships because they can see into the future) the Bene Gesserits (predecessor of the Jedi who can manipulate people, move supernaturally fast, mind control with voice command, and see into the future) and the Mentat (a human computer trained to calculate the outcome of any situation where logic can be applied).It just so happens that the young prince of the Atreides house is an extremely talented prodigy who is a Mentat, Bene Gesserit, and fighter. Utilizing his immense powers of body and mind he will combat the evil house Harkonnen. I don't want to give anything away so I will just say that what ensues is NOT another lesson in morality like most fantasy. It is a fantastic adventure exploring an exciting alien world with very deep and complex characters, plot twists, and philosophic questions that will leave you wondering how on earth so much substance got crammed into one novel.Summary: Get this book. If it doesn't change your outlook on fantasy and on how good books should be written I will be shocked."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If you are looking for a Star-Wars-like action drama, then this is not the book. However, this one is a more intelligent book which focuses on human mental capabilities. You will amaze what a human mind can achieve through practice and belief. The very best Sci-Fi drama master-piece."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is completely amazing. I can't say much more then that. Every bit of it made me want more. The best way I've heard it put is by Arthur C. Clarke who stated: &quot;I know of nothing comparable but 'The Lord of the Rings'&quot;. That's all that is close. Every book in the series is as good or better then a book in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Great story that combines philosophy, ecology, adventure, romance and more. This is hard sci-fi, so you'll learn a lot.This book is so deep and rich that you can almost create a new religion on it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"To write about SF is very difficult, Asimov and Clarke are perhaps the first names that come to mind. Moreover, stories must be scientifically possible, at least a little. I think that Dune is not very SF, and yet, it is a landmark in storytelling. Frank Herbert conceived the best Political novels ever. His style, unsurpassed by any other writers, should be the guideline to future writers of this kind of novels. I have just finished Foundation, and some months ago I re-read 2001. These are classic SF. But Frank Herbert's Dune will always be the best political novels. Period."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a complete sub-world; it has its own political struggles, its own history and its own religious traditions. The setting is in the distant future, thousands of years from the present.The political system is based on the Imperium, the Great Houses and the Guild. The Imperium's military and economic power is balanced by the combined power of the Great Houses. The Guild, in turn, has exclusive monopoly over banking and space travel. The political system was established by the Great Convention, which set laws of war, principally the banning of nuclear weapons for combat purposes.The religions of the novel are faintly similar to current religions; there are strands of Taoist and Islamic ideas scattered about. The Muad'dib is a messianic figure who is able to combine male and female traits. The main character, Paul Atreides, of House Atreides, becomes this Messianic figure on Dune. He has great persuasive ability, limited power to predict the future and many other almost super-human qualities.Dune (the planet) is significant for its spice; spice is perhaps best described as a life-prolonging drug that is mildly or extremely addictive based on how much one consumes. However, the spice is produced by gigantic worms that make harvesting the substance dangerous to all but the native Fremen.I really liked the political intrigue of the book, the scheming within the Great Houses, the Guild and the mystical/religious Bene Gesserit School; there is no clear all-powerful faction in this Universe.The religions of the novel are strange. The characters frequently quote the Orange Catholic Bible. The novel's &quot;Terminology of the Imperium,&quot; says this about the O.C. Bible:&quot;the 'Accummulated Book,' the religious text produced by the Commission of Ecumenical Translators. It contains sections if most ancient religions, including the Maometh Saari, Mahayana Christianity, Zesummo Catholicism and Buddislamic traditions. Its supreme commandment is considered to be: 'Thou shalt not disfigure thy soul'&quot; (page 525)One of the Appendixes of the novel gives the religious history that led to the production of the O.C. Bible. The conditions leading up to that point are vaguely similar to the Thirty Year's War (1618-1648) in Europe; however, the outcome in the two cases was very different. In the European situation, the denominational theory of the Church (multiple denominations could peacefully coexist) was developed and the idea of separation of Church and State formed. In the history of the novel, the religious leaders form syncretistic religion. The leaders of the movement make their first public statement: &quot;We are here to remove a primary weapon from the hands of the disputant religions. That weapon - the claim to possession of the one and only revelation.&quot; (page 502)It is unfortunate that an otherwise good novel makes such a basic philosophical error. In ruling out exclusive claims, the leaders cut the branch they're standing on. This means that their authority and writings can have no supreme claim, they are simply one among many equal options. The leaders included everybody but those who thought that there was only one way; they weren't really all-inclusive.I don't know if I will lead the rest of the series but this first book was definitely a good read. One of things that I appreciated about the book is the fact that it takes religion seriously. In many of the futures commonly depicted in science fiction, religion of any sort is missing and secular humanism is triumphant. There were some parts of the novel that felt really slow and sometimes I would wonder when a certain section would end."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This year I read dune. It was the greatest book I had ever read but it was very complicated. When I figured out I had to do a short summary of dune for a book report in front of my class I was mad.

You are bombarded with so many weird names of things that it's easy to get overloaded, and put it down. But this time, I decided to power through that first chapter, and shortly thereafter I was hooked. I've never read such a good blend of story, science, and philosophy. With characters so layered, and plots so intertwined, it was seriously one of the best books I've ever read. But it didn't live up to itself. It felt like the author spent decades composing the first half of the book, making it perfect, and then rushed the last half to meet a deadline in a few months. I may not read it cover to cover again, but I will probably read the first part many times, and be quoting passages from it like sacred text."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book was an excellent continuation of the Dune saga.

I didn't care for it much then. To see Paul journey towards death disinterested me. That was before I remembered.....there is no death. My hard back cover is all white with a colorful dust jacket. The quality is the same for all ACE hard back books. The text font is larger than the Dune hard back by the same publisher. This book could have been combined with the book \\"Dune\\" and it would have been maybe 150 pages. Over three decades later after the re-read, I actually think this book is better than Dune. I love everything about this book. You could make this the third Testament. Probable selves! Seeing without eyes! 65 billion lives lost in Jihad! The consequences of choices made! The awakening of the Ghola! Frank Herbert's genius is on display in the book! His original name for this book was titled \\"Fool Saint\\". The greatest lesson for me in this book is that even with the ability to \\"see\\" into the future of infinite probable selves, each choice is made separately within the realm of time and space. There are consequences. Without the physical self of now, \\"one\\" gets lost in the past and future. Frank Herbert's philosophy is profound."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I read this book the first time when I was in High School. I went to the theatres to see the Dune movie. I got addicted to computer gaming after playing the Dune strategy games; so I had to read the book 30 plus years later. I definitely got more out of this book the second go around. 30 years of experience also helped. Mine is the hard copy version. It has a durable book cover and the color of the hard cover is white with black binder strip. In terms of the quality of the book material, the hard cover and paper are average. Nothing of the quality of what can be acquired for any of JRR Tolkien's LOR, Silmarillian and The Hobbit books. In terms of the content, still not as good as LOR but still brilliant. I don't consider this book purely a SCI FI book. The fusion of religion and spiritually in my opinion puts the SCI FI aspect of this book as secondary. While the politics in this story are simplified, the work is a most enjoyable and rewarding experience. Much of what I remembered from the first read was false; maybe due to the movie and computer games. I don't typically reread books. But was glad I did.

It has been described by critics as a \\"triumph of the imagination\\", and is often cited as the best-selling science fiction novel ever to be written. It is set thousands of years in the future, in which mankind now inhabits far-flung regions of the galaxy. The story delves deep in the life of a young boy named Paul Atreides, who being intellectually superior to us in the 21st century, enjoys \\"greater awareness\\", or a \\"raised consciousness\\", allowing him to think and feel beyond our current limitations of thought and cognitive capacity; even allowing him prophetic glimpses into the future. He moves with his aristocratic family to a desert planet called Dune at the request of their Emperor. Little does young Paul Atreides know, he is to become far more than a co-inhabitant for the long hunted indigenous people of Dune commonly known as \\"Fremen\\". He soon discovers that his arrival on the planet was predicted by these long suppressed natives thousands of years ago, and that his purpose there goes far beyond anything he could have possibly imagined. Deeply satisfying; many people go as far as to give this epic novel a somewhat biblical reverence. This is a story of betrayal and liberation, love and the power of integrity, the need for a savior, and the quaint idiosyncrasies that make us human.

I'm happy to report that it is the latter. Dune's pulls off the political intrigue of interstellar royalty with a compelling narrative. The characters are vivid in their actions and words and you're left questioning, all the way to the end, whether Paul will live or die as part of his role in it all (since either outcome serves the greater purpose.)I couldn't help but wonder if this clever mix of politics, royal houses and science fiction is what George Lucas was attempting to achieve (and failed) with the Star Wars prequels.

However, it's complexity is what makes Dune so enjoyable. This new and strange world becomes real to the reader because of all the clear detail that Herbert provides. The society is as complex as our own and the development of the characters is very rich and believable.There is not much more that I can say that hasn't been said already. Just give the book a chance, it may surprise you."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Well, actually Dune is about a whole lot more than mere revenge, but the final scene in the book is really good, a scene that will stand out in your mind for years and years. I won't spoil it for you, but for those of you who know: &quot;it was in my way, and I was in a hurry to get to you.&quot; The simple, top level plot is this: Paul and his family, the House Atreides, (in Herbert's future, humans are governed by Feudalism), is defeated by the evil House Harkonnen, driven out into the desert, his father killed and many Atreides followers slaughtered. Paul comes back to kick some Royal A**, if you know what I mean. But the way Paul does it is a credit to the genius of Frank Herbert. Paul winds up evolving from an outcast into a superhuman Messiah (literally), a heroic, noble Man who even in the moment of sweet, sublime revenge feels bitter. The reasons why House Atreides is betrayed, and by whom and for what reason, are part of the many fascinating sub-plots. Basically, however, Dune is about Paul Atreides, and it is much, much more than a &quot;boy comes of age&quot; story. It is a re-telling of the Messiah legend, in a novel of rich, intricate, hypnotizing detail, complete with language and ancient history. If you're like me, you'll re-read this book so many times you'll lose count. What a truly beautiful, grand tale."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is Frank Herbert's masterpiece about Paul Maud'Dib Atreides, descendants of the House Atreus of Homeric fame, and his battles with his arch-enemies, the Harkonnens and, eventually, with the combined forces of the galaxy. The first of six books in an unfinished series--Herbert died before he brought his series to a conclusion--this book is the best of the series.Set far in the future, after humanity has not only left Earth, but humanity's origin is probably forgotten, the setting for this book is a neo-medieval world of strict castes, nobility and civilized warfare. The basic plot is rather standard: the young hero, Paul must come of age quickly when his father is treacherously killed by agents of the hated rivals. Since Paul loses his rightful throne, he must come of age among the violent indigenous population known as the Fremen.Although Herbert does write the action scenes well, the plot is not the strong suit of the book--later books in the series have better plots. The strongest part of the book is the theme of religion and politics that runs through the book. Herbert combines many different religions in this future galaxy including Christianity, Islam and various eastern religions.Herbert sets his hero, Paul, up as a messiah to the planetary population, the Fremen and possibly to the entire galaxy. This path may ultimately lead to a bloody jihad. However, Paul realizes that being a messiah is a dangerous path to take, ultimately ruinous to humanity as later books show. However, Paul's desire for power and the evilness of the alternate leaders, the corrupted by power emperor, the overly secretive female priesthood named the Bene Geserit, the no longer human Guild, and the entirely evil Harkonnens force Paul at every fork in the road to choose the path that leads to his anointing as messiah. Herbert thus creates a hero who is not as virtuous as he seems at first glance.A final note: as with any good first book in a sci-fi/fantasy series, there is much that remains unexplained in this book. Anyone who says that they understand the entire book is either lying or missed something. Some of the mysteries in this book become explained in later books, and one--the reference to Richese--in the prequel recently co-written by Herbert's son. There is also a great deal of mysticism and musing on the general state of humanity, some of which was, frankly, over my head.Therefore, if mysticism and unexplained mystery are not your cup of tea, then you should skip this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"There comes a time when a book passes a level that surpasses all other books; when it reaches a standard that very few books in the history of mankind have reached. This is when a book becomes a legend. There are few books out there that I can give this title to. To name a few are: &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and the entire series of &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; Dune has reach this standard. Dune is one of those books that can stimulate the mind with questions that a normal person would dare to think of, much less actually come up with the idea.Dune is the story of a young boy, Paul Atredies, whose world is shattered when his farther dies in the master plot of the Baron. He must- now- abandon his palace life and live with the Fremen in the Deep Desert. A place where few venture to go....This story is well written and deserves to be recognized. Frank Herbert has done an excellent job of putting this novel together. I was first doubtful of it, but a friend of mine presuaded me to read it. I was instantly captivated. I now intend to read the other five novels and then the prelude- written by Frank Herbert's son- to the series. This is a book that EVERY science-fiction reader should read; this is a book EVERYone should read. I hope all of you- if you read it- enjoy it as much as I have."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have read this book many times. Story is great, but I won't pay this much for an e-book of it. Based on other comments a poor quality e-book as well."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune has so many levels to it that even after 30+ readings, I still find some new angle, something new, each time I read it. The way this book blends religion, politics, strategy, honor, culture, and family is absolutely masterful. Neither of the movies have come close to doing it justice. If you've seen the movies and didn't like them, just forget the movies. Read the books. Some say they have to slog through the first few pages, but those pages set the stage of a noble family constantly in preparation for war or assassination attempts.There are some quotes from the books that I think of often in daily life. \\"We exist only to serve,\\" as the Bene Gesserit saying goes - and often said between gritted teeth. \\"Beginnings are such delicate times.\\" Or that the best leaders serve the best coffee hearth.This book ought to be required reading for political science or comparitive religion majors."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"So I decided to read the top 20 Sci-Fi books as rated by numerous sites. Enders Game ( the whole series), Time Machine, Stranger in a strange land,American Gods,Asimov, Arthur C Clark. You name it.This was my favorite of them all. My list of 20 best books would have this at #1.That being said, I then continued to TRY to read the rest of the series , and it was horrible.It was like, initially , the , story flowed from the author, to its end, almost magically, if you know what i mean.But the rest of his books, didn't flow, but , rather seemed forced, as in, \\"I've got to write more books\\". Either for the moneyor public demand, I dont know, but I read half of his next two books, and changed authors. Just saying.Definately read this book. You can try the rest, AND you may like them, books are a personal preference thing after all, but dont be dissapopointedif like me, it just didn't work for you."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I must admit that I do agree with Arthur C. Clarke when he called it the sci-fi answer to THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Dune is an epic masterpiece. But unlike, Tolkien's difficult texts such as LOTR or THE SILMARILLION, Dune is difficult in a sense that I tend to get lost in its structure of the story. The language is fairly easy to grasp but the structure of the book may caught me slightly off-guard.That's probably because I tried to align the similarities of the book with the 1984 David Lynch's movie version. I admit that there were edited scenes that were not in the movie that I read in the book. Nevertheless, I'm pleased with the outcome.One part in which I'm lost is the transition when the Atreides folded space from Caladan to Arrakis. It seemed as if there a whole chapter is missing from the book describing that transition stage. Can anyone verify that for me. Suddenly, they've arrived on Arrakis. That doesn't make sense.Anyway, check out my suggested casting if the new movie is considered to be made: [...]"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I do not like the rest of the Dune series as much as this book but having said that, this is the only book in my library that I pick up every once in a while a read all over again. It is that good. If you feel mired in this mundane world of wages and bills, this book is for you. The Dune universe is at once bizarre in the extreme but very familiar insofar as its a very human story.I believe that as innately religious creatures, humans are drawn to stories such as this where the main character eschews his/her animal nature and embraces their spiritual side. Paul is a god-like character because of the human spirit within and it reminds us all of what lies inside within us."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have always seen this book listed as some of the top sci-fi of all time, but was always hesitant to try reading it due to how crappy the movie was. I could not have been more wrong about how this book would be. For me to call something epic, it must truly be epic. Frank Herbert created an amazing and deep world in this book with immensely life like characters. The depth he went into describing the technology and daily lives of the Freman was astounding. This book is down right amazing, everyone should read it at least once."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"\\"He who controls the spice controls the universe\\"Duke Leto Atreides along with his concubine, Jessica, and son, Paul, is leaving his homeworld of Caladan to rule over the profitable and highly desired world of Arakkis. But Baron Vladimir Harkonnen hates House Atreides and doesn't like how his House has been pushed out, so he plans a coup. Meanwhile, Paul begins to learn of his destiny and special purpose.This book is a science fiction classic, and I've been recommended it many, many times. Finally, I broke down and borrowed the audiobook to get a glimpse at this great work.The first thing I noticed when reading Dune was how detailed it was. Herbert really thought about how life would be on a desert world, and I was impressed and intrigued at his effort. I even believed it was possible to have such a desert world. In some ways, Arakkis is more real to me than even Tatooine (and I am a HUGE Star Wars fan!). The way the Fremen acted, the thought that sand is like water, the care for preserving moisture...all of these helped make Arrakis real and believable.Secondly, Herbert doesn't cheapen his characters just to show off his stuff in the planetology or politics department. My favorite character was Jessica. Herbert didn't make Jessica some stupid sexy woman who is only in the story to boink the main character. I felt Jessica was well written, smart, and active. Plus, I really was impressed how Herbert made her proficient in the use of the Wielding Way, a psuedo-martial arts. Other notable characters are Duke Leto, Stilgar and Count Fenring.But something else became obvious. The first section is slow and confusing. I wanted to give up so often, but didn't because of others cheering me on. After I got past the first part, however, the writing was somehow easier and more interesting. I was particularly interested in the big coup between the Harkonnens and the Atreides. But, around the time the story skips forward in time, I found myself drifting away. And the ending confused me and slightly bored me. So this uneven pacing and uneven interest does somewhat taint my impression of Dune...Now, before I get splattered with tomatoes, I do have a reason why this might be that doesn't include \\"It's the author's fault\\". I listened to this on audiobook (albeit unabridged, so I can't blame it on the audiobook being abridged), so it's possible that I missed something while listening, perhaps while finding my place, resuming in the middle of a section or just toning out and not paying 100% attention. So I would like to one day read this in book format so that I can fill the gaps and see if the novel drifts off the same way I experienced on audiobook.I also never really liked Paul. So many call him \\"older than his years\\", but I almost found him to be an impertinent, know-it-all twerp. Was it the audiobook again and my attention to it that is to blame or my perception of the book in general?I don't like reading about four year olds that act much older than their age, so when I read about Alia, I cringed. I will admit, that Herbert had probably the best explanation for her worldly wisdom, but I still hate children like that and had to fight myself against hating Alia outright.Although this book has a tough beginning to go through, it really does get more interesting. I also can't help but be awed at how well Herbert thought out Arakkis and the great characters Herbert filled his world with. The latter tends to be nearly unheard of in science fiction, hence the \\"Space Babe\\" and \\"Super Hero\\" male protagonist stereotypes that are flung around. I won't lie, I didn't like how slow it was, how much talking about everything that occurred, and how odd the ending is. And I wouldn't recommend anyone listen to this on audiobook as I did. I think I missed out on a lot of things (such as the appendices, which appear only at the end of the audiobook, and the glossary, which would have saved me many trips to Wikipedia). But I think anyone who likes science fiction should give this a try, if only to see a classic scifi novel. I can truly see why this is to scifi as Lord of the Rings is to fantasy.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Truly this is one of, if not THE BEST book I have ever read. It was recommended to me and I've passed it along. Any reasonably intelligent person can tell that the writer was brilliant and gifted. It upsets me that Herbert died before he could write the prequel books his son interpretted. It is not a \\"and then he said... and then she said...\\" kind of book. The writing draws you into the story. And what a story it is! Herbert created an entire universe that rivals that of star wars or any other. I was fully impressed by the attention to detail in character developement, politics, old feuds, economics, environtmental developement. The Bene Gesserit alone make the story worthwhile. When words cannot do justice, we say, \\"Wow!\\"I reread this book periodically just because it is so worth my time. Good reading for anyone who can appreciate a masterpiece. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I really love this book! Yeah, you have no idea what is going on at the beginning, but if you just continue reading you can dive into a truly interesting world populated by great characters. I fully recommend the the first three books, as well as the newer books written by Brian Herbert."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I think this is the best book of Sci-Fi that I have ever read. It mixed ecology, politics, mental powers, and a lot of intrigues. It's full of \\"plans within plans\\". Probably the best choice I could have done."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is probably the most hyped sci-fi of all time, and it deserves all the hype."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I had to put a word in about Dune because it's one of the most impressive achievements in science fiction and because it's the kind of book everyone with a weakness for science fiction should try and read at least once in their lifetime.Dune is the tale of a post-utopian humanity. It is us, twenty thousand years in the future, in a feudal universe controlled by entrenched economic, religious, and political factions. A massive empire consisting of thousands of planets is completely dependent on an unreproducable drug found only on a bleak desert rock called Arrakis. The plot is positively byzantine and weaves the tale of a messiah figure with elements of religious, political, anthropological, and ecological philosophy. Somehow all of these elements are weaved into a great yarn that will compel the reader to seek out and discuss it with others.Now alot of people try to read this book in their early teens and put it down. The first time I read it I was eighteen and had the benefit of a six hour train ride to soak up the initial hump. I re-read it at thirty and realized that I totally missed the point, I percieved it as a drug book when it's so much more than that. On one level it's an extended meditation on the influence of environment upon culture and religion. On another level it is a meditation upon the intentions of messianic figures and unavoidable distortion of those ideas by their fundamentalist followers. An incredible variety of themes are discussed and yet the human story remains compelling and interesting. It's a mindblowing book that elevates itself above the genre to become a true piece of literature. It should be as respected as any other work of fiction. I mean it! Any piece of literature because this novel is as relevant and profound as anything by Dostoyevsky or Hemingway or Kafka or James Joyce. You think I'm kidding? I dare you to read it and tell me otherwise.(This is a kick ass book that I reccomend to anyone. I liked the lynch film version for it's great cast and unparalelled art direction, but it's no substitute for reading the book and may actually turn off potential readers. The miniseries aired on the Scifi channel is shoddy and presents an unimaginative, if loyal dramatization.)"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"One of the greatest science fiction epics ever written. This book has it all: mind-expanding drugs, human computers, political intrigue, interstellar economics, and big-... worms. The reader should take from this book a sense of grandness of scale. The messianic fervor of the Fremen, the calculated patience of the Bene Gesserit eugenics program, the ecological ambition of Liet Kynes, and the universal-historical vision of the Quisatz Haderach, all ought to awaken us to the necessity and danger of human activity on the universal-historical timescale. That is the scale on which we all operate, whether we know it or not. Some of the themes in this book, which was written in the mid-1960's, foreshadow the adolescent field of chaos theory. In particular, the notion that seemingly insignificant local events can have calamitous effects on future history is analogous to the butterfly effect. Also, Herbert's conception of prophecy as a probability tree branching infinitely through time enjoys some endorsement from quantum physics."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune MessiahThis book continues the saga of the messiah/Kwistatz Haderach Paul Muad'Dib from the original Dune. Dune Messiah was a little more involving than Dune I think.Sometimes it is kind of slow moving, while at other times it is very fast paced and interesting. Also it describes scenery and thoughts very well."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"After finished reading this book, I really started to love water, started to notice how beatiful, how powerful, how useful those little drops can be. I used to fear get in to cold water and swim, but now, I love to swim in cold water, feel the coldness. This book is a book about a boy's legendary history. His father was a Duck, but their enemy killed his father, and he was been chased by that enemy. He hided in the desert with his mother, lived with the people on the desert, and he became the leader of those desert people who are really brave but were lack of technologies. Then, he had a huge fight with the enemy that killed his father and won. It has amazing plot. But something that this book lacks is the feeling of people, I have just read Ender's game before Dune, and you just don't feel that you are a part of the story in this book as you are in Ender's Game. I have learned a lot from this book too--Do not fear, come down and think of a way out, be confident of yourself, and also do not be too arrogant think your own idea as the always true thought. This is a good book, you should read it!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I love sci-fi and the worlds great authors can create with words and a little imagination.

One person said that this book was only good if you hadn't read many sci-fi books &quot;(i.e. 18)&quot; I read this book when I was 16 because my father suggested it to me. He waited till he believed I was old enoungh to understand and really comprehend the depth and meaning of the book. In my now 20 years I've read over 150 different sci-fi books and still nothing compares to DUNE. To all you people out there who don't understand this book or the characters or who have to flip back and forth to find out meanings of words(like the context clues weren't enough) then all of you must just be a little less intelligent than the rest of us because it takes someone with intelligence to understand the complexity of such an absolute masterpiece of literay genius. If you don't understand then I guess your mind just isn't intelligent enough to grasp or understand ideas such as honor, destiny, or even an idea or a cause that you feel strongly enough about to do something...then I can't and will never understand you people I just wish you could see what the rest of us do.I feel sad for you who can't understand this.

To rule Arrakis is to control the spice, but rule of the planet is a double edged sword, painting a target on the back of the nobleman who rules. The Atriedes family is given control of the spice, and the Harkonen family wants it. Paul is the son of the Duke, and escapes the attack, making it out into the sands of the desert planet, where the giant sandworms live, and the Freeman congregate, ready to form the new Duke's army. Won't say anymore that gives the story away, but this was an unusual setting for memorable characters to play in, and the start of a series that still continues today with Herbert's sone writing the stories. A great read and a necessary one for anyone who wants to be considered an expert in the field of science fiction."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is probably my least favorite of the Dune Chronicles, but it is a necessary continuation of the story. Still, a very well written sequel that stands up with the first book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I really enjoyed Dune. I think that Frank Herbert is deserving of being considered as one of the foundation blocks of modern Science Fiction. To me, what made this novel so special is the immense amount of care that Herbert put in to world-building and creating comprehensive political and religious structures that encompass many different facets of the people who populate the complex world (and universe) that he has created.In some ways, Herbert has almost treated this novel as more of a Fantasy-type novel that he then fleshed out with Science Fiction elements. So much care has gone into creating the world itself that you don't see as much in Science Fiction as you do in Fantasy. While reading the novel, I felt that you could have asked Mr. Herbert any off-the-wall question about the Freman culture or way of life and he would be able to answer without hesitation. I think this same feel also applies to the Bene Gesserit, House Atreides, House Harkonnen and the politics and people involved in the majority of the Imperial regime. It's this feel of a complete back-ground and established history that make this novel (and hopefully the rest of the series) truly special much like Tolkien's Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.The story itself is fairly fast-paced and filled with political intrigue. The story does have slow moments from time to time, but these times mainly focus on critical moments in character development or the building of important plot points, so they didn't seem to drag at all but actually served to enhance the more dramatic and action-oriented segments of the novel. Characters both good and evil, long-term and brief, are fully fleshed out and easy to root for or against.All in all, a very good novel and one that is deserving of the praise that it has received from fans and critics alike. I will not hesitate to pick up the next book in the series sometime down the road."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"One of my favorite books ever. Probably the best science fiction novel you'll find.

This is absolutely the Dune book I ordered.I understood from the description that it was a heavier bound book made especially for library multi-user purposes.

The world of Dune (both the planet and the larger fictional universe) is notable for its rich detail of culture, history and mythology. Herbert probably borrowed from Tolkein when he added the supplementary glossary and appendix, which I flipped to as often as I encountered a strange word or custom.Dune was first published in 1965 and while many of its themes endure to this day, I believe the story says so much more about the decade in which it was written. Environmentalism was gaining momentum as new movement. The hugely popular Lawrence of Arabia film was released just three years prior. The myth of the messianic off-worlder redeeming a tribal culture might seem overdone in today's fantasy novels, but that's because Dune and its contemporaries told that story so well."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I don't read much in this genre but this is a great book.

Though not much happens in it, I still read through it pretty quickly and didn't want to stop. The characters seemed so dramatic, though, and I felt like I was watching a cheesy soap opera. That was part of the fun, though. I like the simplicity in the action scenes; some books (the Dresden Files by Jim Butcher, for instance) have such overly written action scenes that I tune out after a while. Herbert did it right, telling us just enough. It's a fluidly written book that was a joy to read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Excellent book!.

It has forced me to continue on with the series, only to see if there is overall vindication.I would add though, that Dune is one of my favorite books (and yes, I love the movie), so i was predisposed to enjoy the story, it just did not live up to the original."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I almost gave this book four stars, because I felt there was something missing. I can't quite place why I feel that way.I gave it five, because I've rarely seen a fictional world more convincingly created. Everything works. The sheer imagination is inspiring. And there is profundity hidden in small passages. This may have been why I felt a nagging concern. Where other books would have hit you over the head with their brilliance, Dune is understated. When I fairly consider all the knowledge embedded in it, it's a true classic. The ecological understanding was ahead of it's time. I mean ecological in the fullest sense, as a system."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The deceit and plots that was planned against Paul, you know are not going to work. Even though he wanders into the desert as is Fremen custom, he is not gone, or defeated and the conspiracy was not fulfilled. I can't wait to read the third book. I have a feeling there is a surprise waiting."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It's widely considered to be the best science fiction book ever written. While I mostly agree with these most enthusiastic reviews, I believe that Dune has a few small points that detract from the overall work. I believe that Frank Herbert crafted a work that has (and will continue to) influence science fiction dramatically.The book begins as the ancient House of Atreides is preparing to leave their longtime home of Caladan, for the desert planet Arrakis. The majority of humanity belongs to a variety of major and minor houses and their constituent populations on their planets. The governing figure is the Emperor Shaddam IV. There are other forces in play, such as the mysterious Bene Gesserit (a secretive cult of women with special mental powers, whose goal is to ensure the genetic diversity of humanity), the Fremen (a mysterious civilization of desert-dwellers, who seek to revitalize Arrakis), and the many plots between the various houses and the emperor. The House Harkonnen plots with the emperor to eliminate the House Atreides (ridding the emperor of a potential opponent, and ridding the Harkonnens of their centuries-old feud). The Duke Leto Atreides is assassinated, and his son, Paul, flees to the deepest desert, where he joins the Fremen, and leads them in an assault against the forces of the emperor and the Harkonnens on Arrakis.Obviously, this book was received well, sparking one of the largest fanbases for a book. The book has many sequels (as well as a few prequels), that create what has become the \\"Duniverse.\\" This massive community has influenced science fiction since the \\"new wave\\" of sci-fi, and many famous works have connections to it, such as the Star Wars saga and Lord of the Rings.Possibly one of the greatest reasons for the appeal of the novel is that it doesn't fit with other traditional types of science fiction. Most sci-fi books feature civilizations based off of technology much more advanced or much less advanced than ours. Whereas most of the technology in Dune is more advanced that what we have, at the same time, it is less advanced (due to the fact that advanced computing is banned. Computational skills are taught to a select group of \\"Mentats\\"). This odd paradox draws fans into the book, much like a Penrose triangle draws the interest of mathematicians.As good as the novel is, it has its flaws. There are many points where the book skips decades in between chapters, leaving the reader confused and disoriented until they realize that several years have passed. Herbert also describes psychic events as Paul gazes into the future to look upon the oncoming war, or when he looks within himself into the \\"dark place where no woman can look.\\" These parts, as interesting as they are, are also problem sections. Herbert does his best to describe these mystic powers, but, more often than not, the descriptions end up confusing the reader, leaving them to guess feebly at what is really happening. And, possibly the most annoying, is the ending. The book builds to a massive climax as the Fremen prepare for their final assault on the emperor and the Harkonnens, and the book reaches a most abrupt ending, which leaves the reader wondering why it took so long to get from the climax of the novel to this unsatisfying end.For the most part, I do agree with the wide-eyed fans and critics who regard this novel as the best sci-fi novel ever; nevertheless I hold a few small reservations on certain parts of the book. I believe that Herbert created possibly the most important works of science fiction (rivaling famous works such as The Forbidden Planet) and its influence will continue to be felt in future works for years to come."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"There has always been writings of science fiction, but the novel Dune, by Frank Herbert, sets a new standards. Dune does more than create a fantastic feudalistic universe, Herbert uses his characters to express key aspects of humans. The novel starts with a young boy, Paul, the son of a strong-willed Duke, who is about to move to a dangerous new planet. Along with this stress Paul has been visited by an old woman called a Reverend Mother who tests if he is a \\"real\\" human by seeing if he had control of his mind. After this quick but significant trial Paul is told that he is to become a great prophet (who can see the past through his ancestry and predict the future). The novel consists of his evolution from this boy pondering the aspects of human nature and what is means to be human to a leader with foresight in a world of chaos.Herbert does a great job of emphasising human behavior through the characters that value power, greed, honor and just water. The men plotting against Paul's father want to claim the emperor's place by killing Paul's father. Paul's father is a leader of men. He inspires intense honor and loyalty with his commanders and servants. The indigenous population of Dune called the Fremen who live in the desert value water more than anything else because there so little on the planet. Herbert comments on extremists by emphasizing the pure focus the Fremen have on water and how the religious dream of their planet maintaining a water cycle is enough for the Fremen to give up their lives. He also brings in the philosophy of harsh conditions create the strongest people, by having the feared warriors of the emperor come from a once prosperous planet turned into a slave planet, for the purpose of breeding superior warriors.Sometimes when reading this book the reader might feel that they are receiving a psychology lecture instead of an actual story. Especially in the beginning when Paul is receiving lessons from his mentors. \\"A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.\\" Also Paul, when he has the need to put aside his emotions to think clearly, has several insights into how to overcome emotion, \\"Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. ... Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.\\" These mini quotes of wisdom can sometimes make the story seem to be prolonged by the time Herbert spends integrating them with his story.Even though this book has a lot of philosophy it contains a mystical world much like the captivating epic Star Wars. Dune, however, came before Star Wars. Dune could be argued to be the novel that set the standard for current science fiction pieces. Dune uses its futuristic world to predict like Paul does, the future our own world could become. Dune is realistic, though, in that people act rationally and many aspects of the futuristic culture are explained with principles known today. Herbert uses rational thinking when he explains the purpose of his many imaginative mechanism, which he takes the time to explain rather than leaving the reader confused.Dune is appealing because even though it is futuristic, it is based off of basic systems of society. The Political structure is based off of a feudalistic kingdom with rulers and subjects but instead of having countries to rule and fight over, Herbert has planets. Herbert chooses to have the main struggle between these kingdoms to be over a simple spice (with the bonus of cognitive properties), instead of some futuristic object. In this way Dune has a deep connection to medieval and basic human nature.The book though can be hard to follow because of its sudden rush into the world of reason and political warfare. Herbert relates these tensions by writing from the perspective of several characters, including the antagonist. Also the sudden jumps in time can be annoying because Herbert will suddenly skip ahead in the story because Paul has an insight on how things are going to turn out, and then that insight suddenly happens. This could leave the reader feeling gypped out of storyline.Overall this is a novel that everyone with a taste for imaginative and ingenious writing should read and appreciate as a classic that is the heart of modern science fiction."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is truly in a class by itself. It grabs you right off the bat and you won't be able to put down. \\"Dune\\" has it all--gripping plot, rich characters and captivating style page after page. Herbert possesses a stunning intellect and an incredible imagination, and he demonstrates both here. This book is a truly epic jounrey, and it is required reading for all science fiction fans. So, if you have yet to experience \\"Dune,\\" treat yourself to one of science fiction's greatest masterpieces. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When I purchased this book, it was not available anywhere locally.

Probably the only difference being the \\"L\\" instead of our $ symbol. Who cares, right? It has the same exact story inside! Well, I care.

Global climate change,religous jihad, the threat of atomics. more chilling now than when i first read it twenty years ago. think of that....."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I would normally give a writer such as Frank Herbert higher marks, but \\"Messiah\\" is not the worthy successor to the ground-breaking \\"Dune\\" that one would expect or hope for. The text is overwrought with an unlimited omniscient narrative that leaves little for readers to discover or imagine for themselves. The story's flow drags due to excessive \\"telling\\" and not enough \\"showing.\\" Dialog is minimalized, and character interactions are infrequent and -- when finally given voice -- are overly philosophizing and ponderous. Add to this a so-so plot line and you have a sequel to a Megawork that just doesn't cut it. \\"Messiah\\" is Frank Herbert's thinly veiled views on world (or \\"off-world\\" in this case) religion, politics, governments, corruption, conspiracy, etc. The reframing of Paul Atredies as a galactic despot whose absolute power has absolutely corrupted him, and sister Alia who becomes a spiritual icon to the simple Freman, are clearly editorial statements on things much closer to this planet than to some far-away visionscape. Viewed in this light, \\"Messiah\\" is a philosophical \\"soap box\\" that I suppose is the right of every visionary writer at some point in their career. (C.S. Lewis comes to mind!) BUT, if you're looking for an action-packed sci-fi thriller, with all the impact and imagination of the original novel, don't expect to find it in this sequel. I came away from this read with the impression that Herbert threw \\"Messiah\\" together to pontificate a bit, to honor some publishing agreement, or perhaps both. Buy \\"Messiah\\" if just to keep Herbert's Dune Legacy alive and breathing, but be forewarned: this sequel has scarcely a \\"worm\\" in it, honestly."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book made me order the rest of the series, and even tempted me to buy the ones written by his son, despite the horrible reviews they've been given on here. You will lose yourself in the world Mr. Herbert spins. The 2 movies made from this book don't do it justice."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune Messiah was a fantastic read. Chronicling Paul's life as messiah on Arrakis, and Paul's inability (read as unwillingness) to accept his own Golden Path. Paul rules Dune and Spice production as only an Atreides could do...This book foreshadows so many of the wonderful happenings in future books, albeit it stands as a novel of it's own merit and splendor.If you liked the first novel, you'll love this short gem in Herbert's universe."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It may not be as good as the first book, but its still a far cry above a lot of the other works out there. If we had 100 stars, the first book would get a 98, and this one would get a 94.Frank Herbert is a brilliant writer and I thoroughly enjoyed all of the Dune books he wrote."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I must admit that I am not a huge fiction reader, much less a science fiction reader. It is not that I don't have the imagination, it is just that most works of science fiction seem...dry...to me. Yes I enjoyed the Foundation series, way long ago. And while I might have enjoyed the Star Wars movies (IV-VI), I really can't stand reading the novels. Yes I like Doctor Who, but I don't focus my every waking hour reading and watching the series. Then there's Dune. I've wanted to read Dune for a long time now. I've bought the book, usually a cheep used paper back, got through the first page and a half, then forgot about it. Maybe it just wasn't my time to read the work, you see. Now I am. And I am amazed. The work is one of the best fiction novels out there, by far. Now this isn't hard science fiction, you don't get pages after pages of science gobbledygook like you may with other writers, instead the setting is the future...yes...but the story itself is timeless in the sense of what Joseph Campbell would consider the \\"hero's quest\\" story. Thus the story is not just about a far future society, it is about mythology, politics, ecology, all wrapped together and expanded upon. What I find most interesting is, if you have actually looked at any of my other reviews, that this work has a very theological point of view expressed upon it. Not really Western theology nor Eastern philosophy, but an intrinsically woven together theology. While I may not agree with it per say as I am a Christian, within the story's context, I'm amazed and astounded at how well it works. I really suggest anyone and everyone who has half a brain should read this work. It will do wonders for you."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I'd read Dune three times before writing this review. The very fact that I still find Frank Herbert's complex plots and political intrigues a new experience every time is a testament to his masterful writing. Written in 1965, Dune marks the revival of the world-building genre of Sci-Fi/Fantasy that can't been so poetically written and artfully compiled by anyone, with the remotely possible exception of J.R.R. Tolkein.. The creation of complicated systems of Feudal Imperialism and intergalactic geography could be done by none other than Herbert himself.As we join the young Paul Atreides, the heir to the family sovereignty, he is about to take a journey to Arrakis. It is apparent early on that Arrakis controls a monopoly on the production of the universe's most necessary food item, the spice. The spice is a geriatric substance which allows for widespread space-travel and gives a specially trained group super-human powers. Arrakis was a rich gift left by the Atreides' arch enemy, the Harkonnen family. However, the reader knows early on that this acquisition is a trap. As Paul and his father starts to suspect the treachery, the complex web of conspiracies and double-crosses from every major political player soon paints a gigantic masterpiece of political intrigue and lies. The Harkonnen, with help from the elite imperial troops, invade Arrakis with overwhelming force. Also the Baron Harkonnen blackmails the Atreides' family doctor into lowering the force-shields of Arakeen, the planet's major city. The doctor himself, however, has a plot to kill the baron of the Harkonnen family. He allows Paul and his mother to escape and gives Paul's father a tooth filled with poison to kill the Harkonnen leader.After reading the first hundred pages, even the most astute reader must backtrack in order to follow the complex plots and sub-plots. This frustrating process is a testament to Herbert's genius in creating a symphony of conspiracy which ends with a major unraveling in the last ten pages. Paul goes into the desert and consumes massive amounts of spice to become a man of messianic proportions. This gives him the right to proclaim himself the savior to the local people. He regains Arrakis from his enemies and blackmails the emperor with the threat of revealing his hand in the treachery. In addition, he threatens to ruin the production of spice by killing the sand worms, the animals which make the spice, an event which would cripple the intergalactic economy. Though, at first, I wondered how the author would (or could) bring so many interwoven chains of events to a conclusion, the interest and conflicts only became more heated until the breaking-point at around the 300th page: The author then concluded the epic and left room open for the other five books he would go on to write. This is surely an excellent example of plot-heavy literature and will always be remembered as the masterpiece of science fiction literature. I personally recommend that every fan of science fiction literature read this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"let me just tell you all one thing... i loved this book... i have told (literally) hundreds of people about this book and much to my surprise they have read them all. i am floored by the imagination that this author had, this vision of a far off place that and an entire universe that relies heavily on the substane known as melange. yes the first installment is quite heafty and i do suggest reading continuously for this is not a book that can be read and then stopped and picked up later ( i know i did it and frequenlty caught myself going back to say where was i when that happened). this book has an incredible character development and in most books i would have a problem with how people can measure great distances and tell how much sand there is out there by making an educated guess, but with this book i came to understand that those guesses were not educated ones and they were the product of years of training and practice in the ways of the sister hood. i am not here to critique this book in any way , but merely offer my feelings about the book so that others can experience the adventure i had in the depths of my mind when everything in the world was silent and i was out on Arrakis, in those stillsuits right behind paul all the way to the last page ( sure some translation was needed, thank gaia for that damned encyclopedia/dictionary in the back of the book).i know that what i just said is so cliche, but i dont care, people dont need complex thoughts written down or very harsh words to say that a book was not good, or that the plot needs more work, but what they do need to know is whether or not the book was worth the read. i am here to tell you all it was. i swore i would never read a series of books in my life, but i renounce that claim and am here to say that i am now a dune junkie. hello sci fi sagas and series, my name is tyler durden (this is my alias)and i am here to stay. so for those who are afraid of the stigma that comes with being labled as a sci fi freak of nature, for all those people that are trekies and star war people who are apart of the extended universe (even though i may never fully understand you) keep on treken and may the force be with you and for those who speak the language of the freemen bi-la kaifa."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Arthur C. Clarke was right--Dune is only rivaled by the famous Lord of the Rings by Tolkien. Dune is, in fact, the LotR of science fiction--it has the deep universe, the flawless characters, the conflict, and the connection to our own universe that makes it all mean something. Many reviewers complain about the constant talk about the thoughts of characters, but that is necessary and adds depth. This is not a book for super-light reading, not a 'beach book.' This is a book for the thinking person who is willing to delve into the ultimate world of Science Fiction. If you have seen the films, do not let that deter you from the book--while the films are not horrible, they do the book no justice. This is THE must-read for the sci-fi fanatic."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Beginning with Dune and following the series through each subsequent novel was one of the most entertaining experiences I've ever had. The Dune series will always be one of my all time favorite reads! The series has everything, psychology, sociology, religion, adventure and engaging characters all woven together masterfully by Herbert's prose."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I found this book to be extremely intriguing. I had never bought science fiction and had never really cared for it. Frank Herbert did an excellent job of entrancing me into his work. This book is fast paced and keeps the readers attention well. Once started on this awesome adventure, Herbert takes the reader through politics, scandal, betrayal, religion, addiction, love, revenge, and of course the desert. The ending leaves you hanging and forces you to read the next one. This book is well worth the read a couple of times."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It seems the book has received many reviews on it's finer and lesser than finer points. All of them are valid and well made (but like everything in life - should be judged with a grain of salt).I would like to add only a couple of points -First, I thank Frank Herbert for the literary gift to humanity - for this book (and series) is not just attempting to be a SciFi book. It has many rich ideas about the flaws and beauties of humanity under a guise of another world created in 'science fiction'. Second, the best way to start this series is to delve into it with no precept of any kind - not even what you would expect from a Sci-Fi story. It gives you much more - a reflection of our universe through the eyes of an incredibly creative man.There are parts of the series where it gets a bit wordy. But I respect it nonetheless because if the book was any different, than it would not be the masterful piece of work it is. Besides, how many of us in the ENTIRE WORLD can give to us in literary form, a story of an entire universe full of such diverse beings carried through for generations with plots within plots, with truly unwavering ideologies and philosophies directly parallel to our own humanity and issues? Plus, with the scientific ground work which it was all laid upon?Considering when Herbert wrote this book and the immense research and work put into it by ONE man, TO SAY THIS IS ANYTHING LESS THAN GENIOUS &amp; BRILLIANT, WOULD BE ARROGANT.Lastly, this book is for people who have INSIGHT, VISION and a desire to be open-minded. I say a desire because if you are patient enough to read this series diligently, this book will be a good place for all those who desire open-mindedness. I have no judgment towards any of the characters or story plots. I think there is much to learn from all of it, even to the most trivial and the smallest."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a great book. It's one of those four or five books I've read that changed my outlook on things. I have an ecological bend, and the eco-mythos really grabbed me.That said, Dune is not a perfect book. Those who have criticized Herbert's style are correct. It's cliche, overwrought, overdone.But that's not important.What is important is the symbolic story, long though it may be, which takes the reader through a variety of fantastic settings and introduces he/she to a vibrant cast of characters. They're simple, with the exception of Paul, and that's good! This isn't drama. Herbert himself said the book was about ecology, primarily, and the dangers of thinking the environment is ours to control and manipulate. The Bene Gesseritt weave an intricate web, and it's torn to shreds by one act of disobedience. The political discourse has ingrained the idea that &quot;the tripod is the most unstable of governments&quot; (paraphrased) in my head forever. Look out, America.The book reminds me of Joseph Campbell's The Hero With a Thousand Faces. Paul is the hero, and he must grapple with the complexity of the concerns of a universe, like all of us. That universe has spawned numerous sequels, which I fear can never live up to the precedent of the original.I try not to praise lightly. Nevertheless, I think Dune is one of the &quot;great&quot; science fiction novels. It's a marvelous story, and that, above all, is why so many millions have heralded Herbert's Dune as the masterpiece of science fiction that it is."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"...Dune brings the imagination of Frank Herbert to ink and he did a great job at it.

Set in the future, this novel covers themes ranging from politics to economics, religion and philosphy to environmentalism. In other words, Herbert is a genius and you will be able to tell this within the first few pages.The central theme is that of messianic religions, and the effects of such. Because of the fact that Paul Attredies (the main character) is a messiah, we get to see his point of view on being one. Herbert deals extensively with the feelings such a person might feel about having a fate which is unaviodable.The characters Herbert created are outstanding. You'll hate the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and love Paul. You'll be intrigued by the guildsmen and in awe of the Bene Geseritt.If you like dense plots, this is the book for you. There are more layers to this novel than you can count on both hands. I should warn you that you will miss many many things after the first reading. I recently finished reading it for the third time and I was still discovering new themes,new ideas. IF you have not yet read it, Dune is a Masterpiece and should be a part of your collection."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"...I will not[spoil the book].

The book is beautifully written, though it is different in the start than Dune. Stick with the book, as by the end this book becomes everything one would hope it would be: filled with plots, conspiracy, adventure, tension, foreshadowing, and hope, like the first book. It takes place more in the city of Arrakeen than in the desert, and is less action than it is plotting. It has a wonderful conclusion; I would describe the end as \\"Perfect.\\" If you liked the first, you will like this if you stick with it.

There is no space travel, no robots, practially no aliens, ray guns, space ports or any advanced technology whatsoever. However, it's essentially the best story to fit into just one book I've been fortunate enough to encounter. The plot takes you to a distant world, far separated from us in both time and space, to the home of the Atreides family. They are nobles of some sort and have been comissioned by the Emperor to govern the planet of Arrakis, home of the mysterious spice, a substance with many miraculous traits. From here the book brings you right into the intricate plots surrounding the family Atreides and their adversaries, all surrounded by an environment that speaks more of the middle ages than the future.Well, I would be lying if I didn't admit that every now and then an ornithopter or a las-pistol enters the scene (alright, there _are_ ray guns), but this only serves as a backdrop to the vivid characters of the book, in my opinion the strongest side of the book. I grew attached to them from the first line they appeared and I felt close to them all the way through the story.If you havn't read this book already, I suggest you pick it up right away. I've yet so talk with any litterate person who didn't at least think it a fair read.

Out of all the pages of the three books in it, I only found 2 spelling errors! I like how the author put in words that are not real, and putting the dictionary of them in back. It was sort of hard to read, and my dad said it was suppose to be. It's so long that I even forgot my favorite character's name! It reminds me of The Martian Chronicles, except with war and it is not so confusing, and that they are on Arrakis, instead of Mars. It is about a boy who moves from the ocean planet, Caladan, to the desert planet, Arrakis, also called Dune. The author put in the unique idea of &quot;The Spice&quot; and the Giant Sand Worms. I would give this book 4 stars and 9/10 but I can't so I gave it five! The second book was kind of like everything is ruined. That is what made me take out 1/10 of a star.

This book immerses you into the venue of religion AND politics, leaving you with comparing our world at any time with the universe described in it's pages.

I read Dune (on paper of course) in about 1980, and thoroughly enjoyed it at the time; I've picked it up and re-read bits of it from time to time over the years--I still find I enjoy the writing and the world Herbert created, and can open this book to almost any page and just delight in re-reading for a few minutes. Of course, some of the themes seem to fit better in the 1960's than 2010's (e,g., drugs to access special mental powers), and some seem dated even for 40 years ago (e.g., gender roles and re-creation of a feudal social structure), but all in all I enjoy this work much more than other books that re-create an essentially feudal social structure in a high-tech future, and some bits I find more plausible than most modern SF (like the explanation of why there is no significant computer technology, which is a bit of a leap. But it is consistent with human nature and, unlike a lot of SF, not actively inconsistent with computing technology, information theory, etc.). I never really enjoyed the many other books set in the universe of Dune, though I did read the two that were available about 1980. But the 535 pages of paper that were the original \\"Dune\\"--those were great.Review of the eBook and art of publishing:Returning to the subject of the e-book edition, I was initially put off by the \\"Kindle Version Review\\"; but (as that reviewer pointed out) Amazon does not seem to attach reviews to specific editions, so I couldn't really tell if this review still applied to the current ebook. I got the free sample, and found almost none of the errors that others have reported; I spent the money to buy the full thing, and so far (35%, up to page 184 of 474) I've noticed very few problems ... I had Kindle search for one of egregious typos pointed out by another reader (\\"stulsuit\\", I think it was) and did not find it. All in all, the errors are few and far between (see below).In case anyone cares, the errors I've found by page 184 are several joined words and two other minor issues:* Page 4, italics are missing (this was the same in the GoogleBooks edition, suggesting that the publisher gives the same file to all ebook providers)* Page 42, two cases of joined words: arevaluable and dealingwith* Page 71, \\"iong\\" should be \\"long\\" (an interesting error, as noted below)* Page 106, hypen should be an emdash (\\"heavily armed-slow-pellet stunners\\" should be \\"heavily armed--slow-pellet stunners\\") [Rats ... in the \\"preview your review\\", I can see that my unicode emdash has been turned into a pair of hyphens. Hopefully you get the idea]* Page 176, joined words \\"nosign\\".I actually checked some of these (and a few other things) against my old paperback and the printed 40th anniversary edition (I had to visit a bricks & mortar bookstore); the above are differences between the print and eBook (e.g. the mis-print of \\"Harkonne\\" for \\"Harkonnen\\" on Page 16 is there in both paper and eBook versions).The pattern of errors suggests an interesting theory about the creation of printed books and eBooks: on page 71 of the printed 40th anniversary edition, the word \\"long\\" has a slight gap in the ink of the first letter, making it look almost like an \\"i\\" (though to a human eye, clearly still an \\"l\\" with a gap). It looks very much as if the publisher (a) prints the books from physical type rather than e.g. a phototypesetter (I'm guessing this is cheaper; possibly the type set by a machine, based on a computer file), and then (b) *scans* the printed text to produce the eBook (which seems, to me, odd almost to the point of inexplicability).Overall Summary: I'm glad I got this, and look forward to giving it to my son."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune Messiah, the second volume in Frank Herbert's most famous science fiction series, is the shortest of the six published books and therefore is a quick read. It has the most intricate plot of them all, which some deem impenetrable. Quite a few other fans, however, have reported it to be their favorite in the series. Even if you are numbered with the majority in the former camp, you must read Dune Messiah if for no other reason than to pave the way into the rest of the series. Either way, a devotee of or an antagonist against Dune Messiah, your efforts will be repaid.Herbert pressed multiple agendas in Dune, one of the most important being to illustrate the psychology of the mythic hero. Paul Atreides was a charismatic character essentially marching in lockstep with the algorithmic formula for guaranteed superhero production delineated by Joseph Campbell in Hero With a Thousand Faces. We readers were virtual participants in the process, and so by the end of the book Paul's triumphs were our triumphs. We shared in his heroic victory and could readily dismiss his own misgivings about what he had done and what he foresaw would be done in his name in the future.But Herbert was always interested much more in historic cycles than in the myth of steady linear progress, and nowhere is this more evident than in the Dune series, where history is better conceived as an ever-expanding spiral set against the background of infinite spacetime. Herbert assumed that the universe must always escape any structured attempt to understand it and cage it, and that the infinite reality awaiting beyond our collective ken must always recoil to bite us every time we conclude we've got the world figured out. The very setup for Paul's successes in Dune, then, must be viewed with suspicion. Indeed, Herbert conceived of the myth of the hero as a doomed trap lurking within the murky basements of human consciousness alongside the rusty machinery of our wish-fulfilling hopes and expectations. Reality has a way of obliterating all conservative definitions and assumptions; a simpler way of putting it: what goes up must come down. Thus everything we'd been led to assume to be true in Dune must find its antithesis in Dune Messiah in order for Herbert to teach us his lesson that the collective subconscious adulation for the hero is a toxic recipe for disaster. This is the whip that instructs in Dune Messiah, Frank Herbert's version of a Shakespearian tragedy.I myself am less concerned with Herbert's upending the myth of his superhero in this novel than I am with the plot mechanics by which that upending is achieved.It's helpful to understand that Herbert had already written some sections of Dune Messiah and Children of Dune before Dune itself was published. He knew where he was going, but not necessarily how to get there. Dune Messiah was a difficult novel for Herbert to write. Not only did it have to stand on its own merits as an independent novel, but more importantly to the greater myth-structure that Herbert was designing, it had to serve as a sort of switching station between the first and third books, which were more interesting to him. Herbert knew that by tearing down the character of Paul Atreides he would seriously disappoint many of the readers of Dune, who yearned for a hero who would continue to perform nobly and heroically, advancing steadily up a progressive linear history. But to accommodate the as-yet-unwritten third book, his readers' expectations must be subverted. Herbert envisioned Dune Messiah as a sort of necessary evil, an unpleasant medicine that must be quaffed before he could arrive at the next phase of the story cycle. Perhaps by understanding it in this light we can judge this novel to be more successful than we have any right to expect.To accommodate all these complex, warring goals, in Dune Messiah Herbert creates not a single conspiracy to accomplish Paul's downfall, but a tangle of multiple, competing conspiracies whose players harbor conflicting goals and ambitions. Brilliantly, Herbert never openly reveals this to be the case: the reader alone is left to do the legwork in this detective story without a detective. This is another reason many never fully appreciate this novel: an endless diet of action-adventure stories tends to condition us to expect that the author of a novel will spoon-feed us all the appropriate whos and what-fors in precisely the way life never works at all. Herbert declines to pander to these banal expectations. The main competing factions are the Bene Gesserit, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Tleilaxu, and the Qizarate. I leave it to the reader to piece together how their competing motivations coalesce and harmonize into the drama of the book: I've given you the most important clue by pointing out that multiple simultaneous conspiracies exist, which is more than many readers ever successfully discern.If you like it, 'nuff said. If Dune Messiah isn't your cup of spice coffee, press on through, because the next two novels (at least) will blow your socks off.Bob R BogleAuthor of Frank Herbert: The Works"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert weaves an impressively complex tale set during a time of \\"stagnation\\" in the human race, who are now spread throughout the galaxy and governed under a harsh feudal system. Plot threads include paranoid politics, mystical religions, mind-expanding drugs, prophecies, ancient feuds, and plots within plots all centered on the inhospitable desert planet of Arrakis. Despite all its complexity and imagination, the book is not among my favorites. The paranoid, scheming world the characters live in made them all unsympathetic, merciless pragmatists who wielded (or even created) religion as a tool. I enjoyed it as kind of a dystopia, but felt no connection to any of the characters."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It's not possible to provide a real review of Dune. To review the story covers only half the novel: the other half is a philosophical meditation on everything that it means to be human. Every sentence in the book is important: Frank Herbert's beautiful, spare-yet-lyrical writing style leaves no room for a single wasted word or superfluous idea. Dune changed Science Fiction forever: it effectively ended John W. Campbell's \\"Golden Age\\" by elevating the genre to a level far higher than anyone had previously imagined possible. It will change the reader similarly."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dunes is a very interesting read. It has elements of Surprise, mystery and most definitely suspense. Dune well certainly make you think, trying to guess who and what exactly the freemen are and what the spice actually does. How exactly does Paul see the future.The kindle version is slightly messed up with messed up spelling and weird spaces in-between words. The author makes a very interesting mix of strategy politics religion and ecology. The planet is a mystery in of itself. With it's almost complete water conservation. Dune is set within a universe of strange forces and a iron-fisted government. Planets are bought and sold like plots of land for the Rich. I would defiantly rate this book five stars. However if you want to read the kindle version then I might recommend buying a different version of the book. An interesting read for anyone who like science fiction."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I was expecting to recieve a paperback edition of \\"Dune.\\" Imagone my surprise when lo and behold a full version soft cover edition of \\"Dune \\" arrives.\\"Dune\\" is in my opinion the best science fiction book ever written.Dune, 40th Anniversary Edition (Dune Chronicles, Book 1)"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I read this series a decde ago and it still lingers vividly in my mind and captivates my imagination. For Herbert to so fully realize a universe is truly astounding. To give it the branding of science fiction does it a disservice. Herbert\`s ability to incorporate the same mystical, religious, ecological, cultural, and political undertones that constitute our reality into a universe that is so completely abstract from our reality is, in my opinion, what makes this series timeless. As I have grown older and wiser, the sands of Arrakis and the god worms have tended to fade into the recesses of my memory but the intrigue between the Bene Gesserit, the Spacing Guild, the various Houses and other such clashes of belief and culture are what still remain in my mind as the foundation of this epic series. No offense to Tolkien fans but Dune is THE quintessential science fiction series and a great series regardless of genre."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I recently reread Dune, by Frank Herbert and was again struck by the grandeur of the novel. In spite of placing the novel thousands of years in the future Herbert created a deep mythology to his universe. History, religious practices, even languages hinted at and slowly revealed. This technique was later emulated by the popular Star Wars series among others, but I think Dune contains amore detailed tapestry than subsequent works.The character Paul Atreides embodies Dune's themes. He is the messiah to its imagined mythology, the prophet to its syncretic religions, and eventually ascends as emperor of its complex fictitious interplanetary government. The themes of the book are larger-than-life, as are its characters and none are as big as Paul. The first part of the book is mired in byzantine scheming and treachery, of which Paul adroitly maneuvers and overcomes. He is just fifteen at the start of the novel, but many characters comment on how adult and adroit he is despite his age. The later half presents Paul's harrowing trails as a religious leader (the \\"Lisan al-Gaib\\", the \\"Kwisatz Haderach\\") as he undergoes a ritual via poisoning that turns him into something more than human, granting prescience and other astonishing mental powers. It is fascinating to read about Paul's transformation into a sort of demigod/human supercomputer, yet it makes him less sympathetic of a character. In fact, his own mother recoils in horror at one point. He more resembles a conqueror like Alexander the Great than a pacifist prophet such as Jesus. Nevertheless it is Paul's heroism despite self-doubt and troubled conscience, and his mastery of political manipulation, grasp of both religious fervor and guerrilla warfare that make him one of science fiction's most influential characters.Dune's tropes of quasi-Islamic prophecy, environmentalism and ecology, anti-colonialism self-determination movements, and religious ecumenicalism made it a best-seller in the mid sixties and they still remain relevant and resonant forty years later."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Great book, read it when I was a teenager, about 40 years ago! However, I would not recommend reading the commentary first at the end of the book, by Herbert's son. It sort of ruined the book for me. If you're going to read it at all, wait until the end of the book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"What a masterpiece! Dune, officially known as Arrakis, is a desert planet with the most important natural resource in the universe. It is into this atmosphere that the ancient feud of the Harkonen and Atreides families is finally settled.Paul Atreides was the child who was not supposed to be. His mother is a member of a religious order who was ordered to give birth to a girl child, not a boy. This boy would change the course of the universe.This book is so well written, you can actually sense that you have walked through the sand, worn a stillsuit, and met Paul-Muad'Dib. In a genre that is often marked with less then steller character development, you feel that you know each and everyone of the characters and what they are feeling.This is but the first of a six book epic series of the Atreides Dynasty, this one ending with Paul's defeat of all of his enemies on Dune, including the emperor.Absolutely masterful."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is not the finest work of science-fiction ever written, nor is it even the best in the series it spawned. The former honor probably goes to Ender's Game or something by Asimov, and the latter goes to the sequel, \\"Dune: Messiah\\". However, this is the visionary beginning to an epic movement in science fiction as storytelling, if not as literature.Frank Herbert's writing is flawed, and lacks polish - his exposition is sometimes wince-inducing, and his characterization is characterized by a \\"tell don't show\\" policy that contradicts ordinary standards of good writing. However, the ideas he begins to discuss here are as groundbreaking and relevant now as they were forty years ago. This, in a very real way, is sci-fi as fantasy; rather than imagine our world in the future, Herbert chooses to imagine a different world entirely, free of computers and dominated by the enduring specter of the desert planet Dune. His tragic Messiah, Paul Atreides, is an awe-inspiring character devoid of predictability, and many of his statements about the future of mankind leave us wondering, as his followers wonder, what it is he sees before them.As I said before, this is not the best work Herbert produced in the Dune universe. It is, however, the beginning of something dramatic, the foundation for an enduring classic."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I think that a lot of readers were disappointed in this book because it is so different from Dune: rather than achieving power - a far more compelling plot - Paul is wielding it. This latter makes from a much more complex, even mundane, story, for it is about maintining political equilibrium, personal rumination, and the mechanics of fate.Thus, as a political junkie, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is written from the perspective of a profound grasp of human history, in particular from a religious point of view. Paul is seem as a messiah, an oracle who is shaping human destiny. While molding the next phase in the evolution of man, he feels trapped by the necessity of fate. Interestingly, he compares himself to Christ, but also Genghis Khan and Hitler. How many scifi books could ever boast such a scope? Very few. Only Asimov and Octavia Butler come to mind, the absolute top tier of scifi writers.This is a book for mature readers, not those seeking some swashbuckling shoot-em-uper. Paul's character matures, as humankind is on the brink of enormous change that is only alluded to.The additions to the Dune unverse are also fascinating. You get the Tleilaxu and their gholas as well as allusions to IX and the suborndinated guild and Bene Geserit. Very fun and complex.Warmly recomended."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is the SF \\"everything including the kitchen sink\\" classic. It is the rise of the hero. In \\"Messiah\\" we get the Greek tragic hero's fall.Once again, Herbert dealt with complex themes with far-reaching implications. Will a man detroy himself rather than become something which he is not? Will a hero allow himself to become a focal point for great evil? Great concept.Many who have read this book are disappointed--they wanted another sprawling space melodrama. Instead, we get a morality play. But every time I've read this novel, my opinion of it has gone up. Read it. Think about it. Herbert said he had this book in his head when he wrote Dune. Ask yourself what he's saying. Your opinion of it will improve too."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune Messiah would be much better off as book four of the original Dune. If that were the case, the combined opus would be a mythical success. As a stand-alone book, however, Dune Messiah is weak. If you have come to care for any of the characters of Dune, especially Paul Atreides and/or Chani, the conclusion of this book will be very emotional for you, and is worth reading on those grounds alone. Up until the end, however, Dune Messiah is slow going. Interesting, but slow. Bottom Line: If you liked Dune and have become interested in its characters, read this book. Ideally, read Dune and Dune Messiah back-to-back. The overall effect will be much greater. Don't read this book if you haven't read the original Dune, or if you read it and didn't like it or its characters."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book lacked the vision of the first story. Paul has grown into emperor and must set things into action for the future. The Bene Gesserit, the Tleilaxu, the Guild, and even some Fremen plot to wrestle control away from Paul. This story is really about politics and Frank Herbert's personal philosophy's on ruling. There is a good story there, but it drags and lacks the sense of discovery that you get from the first installment. It was a worthwhile read, and I do plan to read the third book in the series. I personally think that Herbert may have had the third book in mind first and wrote the second as only a segue to the third book. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"My first reaction to the book was that I liked it. I knew a little about the plot beforehand from seeing snippets of the movie and hearing other people talk. But the story genuinely drew me in. I wanted to finish the book; I wanted to know what would happen, how things would turn out. On the level of Story, this book works extremely well.The Setting is also intriguing. Though this book teeters dangerously toward the worldbuilding trap/no-no of having a whole planet with one ecology, Herbert isn't quite so amateurish about it. Dune is not all desert, just varying degrees of desert, and has a well-imagined ecology. I'm sure the concept is expanded upon in the later Dune books. Story and worldbuilding worked fine for me.It's when we get to character that I start to have problems. The main character, Paul Muad'dib, is interesting, yes, but I felt no connection to him. As I said, I was interested in the story, and only vaguely interested in what might happen to the characters. I don't feel for them or with them.This could be the product of the point of view Herbert employed. He uses omnipotent third, often changing viewpoints with each paragraph. I didn't find this particularly distracting, but I wondered if I might have felt more connection to any of the characters if I'd been allowed to spend more than a few moments at a time in their heads. But, perhaps not, because he sometimes spends an entire scene in one person's head, and yet I still didn't feel a connection.I rather disliked most of the characters as people. They did feel like real people to me, so I'm not questioning Herbert's characterization skills. And characters do not always have to be likeable. I would have liked them to be likeable, though. It might have added another dimension to my enjoyment of the story. I was interested in what was going on, but not to whom.Herbert's authorial voice was so strong, I don't think I ever completely immersed myself in this world. I felt that he might have had a quirky disdain for women from the way he characterized Jessica and the way Paul related to her. I also had mixed feelings about the Harkonnen Baron guy being evil and liking to rape young boys. It just felt a tad overdone to me. And offensive.My final call: High marks for Story, Setting, and Prose. Midgrade marks for Character."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"First of all, let me say that it is not hard to thoroughly enjoy reading Dune Messiah. It is a very good book despite certain flaws which I will attempt to pinpoint in this review. If you read Dune and loved it, you will definitely want to read this, even if this book is undoubtedly weaker than its predecessor.Dune Messiah is, as others have stated, much more personal than its predecessor. The book will introduce you to very few characters that have not already been introduced in Dune or at the beginning of this book. Indeed, Herbert goes to great lengths to provide us with thorough and insightful characterizations of the important characters, particularly Paul and Alia. Much of the novel is devoted to visions, as the visions he recieves dictates what course of action he takes (ironically, instead of trying to avoid the awful things in his visions, he continues to follow the path towards these awful things with the belief that anything else will be much worse). The long, drawn-out sections of the book devoted to Paul's visions and what he makes of them are both a strength and a weakness--these visions provide Herbert with a springboard with which he can launch into the profound philosophical themes (even more so than in Dune) that he explores, and yet also these passages are easily the slowest and most boring parts of the book. Especially in the latter half of the book, it is hard to comprehend these visions, but it is fascinating nevertheless because of the 'truths' that emerge from Paul's experiences. Thus, the personal nature of the story makes the story weaker in that it does not encompass the wide range of people and events (as in Dune), even while Herbert's characterizations are perhaps even better than in Dune. This also results in some confusion for the reader as to what the repercussions of this story is--vaguely we know that if anything goes really wrong, lots of people will die, but it is rather unclear beyond these guesses.Another thing I noticed while reading this book is that there are long periods of it during which a certain character is not mentioned at all. People who have read the book will know that Gurney Halleck is not mentioned until about pg.250 and Princess Irulan is utterly forgotten between pages 125 and 225 (about). Thus I was left wondering what happened to these characters during these times.At the end of the novel we find out what the nature of the conspiracy is. To me (and this might just be me), looking back on the basic plot, the conspiracy seems highly improbable. It is needlessly complicated, and I wonder how did they come up with something so complex. The bad guys planned for practically everything, yet what defeated them was, well, simple and easily avoided. (I'm being purposely vague for those of you who have not yet read it).We have already seen how parts of the middle and end suffer from a seeming lack of energy due to the introdpective musings and philosophical prospects that inhabit these pages. That said, the very end is a logical conclusion and a surprisingly satisfying one. Herbert both begins and ends the novel on a very good note. And this leaves us with a good feeling after reading it, and that is perhaps the most important thing a book can have.Dune Messiah pales in comparison to Dune, yet it is still a great science fiction novel. If you loved Dune, you will certainly like Dune Messiah. Cause even if it isn't Dune, it's still better than 90% of the science fiction crap they publish now a days."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune Messiah is an epilogue to Dune. Those who found the original masterpiece enthralling will find this work just a little less engaging. The freshness of ideas, together with some plausibility is lost - as it is in any sequel. We are, perhaps, a little to well prepared by the time we have finished the first book, to appreciate this one. And some creations, spring out - not naturally, but almost in an ad hoc manner, making whatever surprise they were meant to offer, look incredulous instead.Dune Messiah is not badly written. But because the light of its predecessor was so bright, it appears somewhat paler, by comparison. It is apparent, even to the casual reader that this book has far more subdued overtones. And perhaps, just barely, the hint of trying to stick to a formula.However, the saga of Dune itself is far from over. And to appreciate the latter books in this series, of which Dune Messiah is an integral part, no serious fan should skip reading this. It will be evident, much further down the road, of how some seemingly random creations fit into the overall scheme of things.No one has been able to lay down such controversial ideas - should I even call them Heretical? - into a more digestible form, than Frank Herbert. Unfortunately Dune Messiah makes is just a bit too easy in the digestion, and just a tad too close to orthodoxy!Perhaps, my review is not entirely free from personal bias. In Dune, Frank Herbert created a hero that I grew to love. In this book, I am forced to watch his career and life ebb slowly away. (This book is aptly named! A messiah cannot escape his personal doom.)All in all, it is still an astounding piece of fiction. Read it. But don't stop here. Go on to the next book. And the next! Profound ideas will arise yet again - when you meet The God Emperor!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I recently bought this particular edition (some 25th Anniv. special) of the book.

Want to know why I liked and didn't like it? Read on.I always like to start with the good - Dune is amazingly complex and the world is awesome and real. Herbert has a great political understanding of our own past and present, as well as a good grasp on what it takes to make a planet and people complete. Religion, custom, politics, enviroment, etc. There's a certian depth in the novel that makes it complicated and unexplained - but isn't that what the sequals are for?What everyone wants to hear: The Bad - The characters are as flat as looseleaf. Paul, the main character, is like, what, fifteen at the start of the novel? He acts like a thirty-year old with as much confidence as a child. Sure, he was trained for that, but...it just makes him seem so unreal. Paul's mother? No devolpment. Duke Leto? Leto, who? There's also the seriosness level of the novel. Everyone is very grim and complex, when really, not all people are like that. It just doesn't work that way. Though you do have to be fairly interesting to associate with Paul and the House Atreides.Looking for well devoloped characters and believable people? Throw the book in the trash. Want about a strong plot and amazingly complex world? Worth more money than the price. Dune is regarded a must-read science fiction - and for good reason. But there's a reason why people don't like it - there's not the edge of your seat suspense, or amazing characters that people can relate to.

When reading sci-fi, I often feel the author's insistence that I buy into his/her thoughts, and this prevents me from becoming involved in the story itself.

I first read this over 20 years ago, and have recently picked it up again. I've been reading it on the bus to work, at night when I get home - even though I already know the plot. It's simply good writing. I agree with other customer comments below, that the books following &quot;Dune&quot; fall a bit flat. Read slowly and enjoy- this one is the best!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is set in a harsh environment, not only ecologically, but politcally and socially, with a perfect dash of religion thrown in as well. It follows Paul Muad'dib through his route as a boy to his becoming of a great messiah -- the &quot;hand of God&quot;.With a great set of characters like the Baron Harkonnen, extremely to the side of sadism and sadistic thoughts, to the Fremen, a native people of loyalty and strength compared only by the way death accompanies life, to Duke Leto Atreides, an honorable man of strength and leadership. The characters, alone, are perfectly blended to make the novel of the century -- if not all time.Frank Herbert has defeated all chances of being beaten in writing skill, with his wonderful way of explaining various physical and mental items through the use of little words and much of the readers imagination, as well as a wonderfully bound together plot which will draw you further into the story as you go along.The first of six novels in the Dune Chronicles, it is also the best of them all, but not the best alone. If you read this novel, then you'd probably want to read the next five in the chronicles, as the experience, as good as it is in Dune, cannot be fully expressed without the completion of the series.I'd give this book a higher rating, if it were permitted."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If I say that Dune is like a James Clavell novel set in the outer reaches of the Galaxy, do folks understand that I mean that as a compliment? Like Clavell, the great strength of Herbert's novel is the way that he intertwines plots and schemes: everyone has their own agenda; alliances are temporary and purely expedient; loyalties are shifting; even kinship is no bar to treachery.The central story concerns Paul Atreides, the 15 year old son of Duke Leto and his Bene Gesserit concubine the Lady Jessica. Paul is the product of a millennia old Bene Gesserit breeding program and may be the Kwisatz Haderach, a hyper-evolved mental adept with extraordinary extrasensory powers. Even as Lady Jessica is training Paul in the ways of the Bene Gesserit, the Duke is training him to lead the embattled House Atreides. Emperor Shaddam IV has just turned over control of the desert planet Arrakis with its invaluable spice concession to the Atreides, but the Emperor recognizes that Duke Leto is a powerful rival and and the Imperium's invincible troopers, the Sardaukar, make the Emperor particularly dangerous. Likewise, the Atreides rising fortunes have caused jealousy and hatred among other families of the Landsraad, a sort of combine of the great trading houses. In particular, the vile Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, whose House Harkonnen has just lost control of Arrakis, also known as Dune, is bent on the destruction of the Atreides. As plots and counterplots explode, sometimes quite literally, Paul and the Lady Jessica are turned out into the desert of Dune where no humans can long survive exposure to the elements, but they are taken in by the mysterious Fremen, a fierce desert people who believe that Paul may be their Messiah. At this point, Herbert brings religious themes into the mix and the story really gets interesting.This book won both the Hugo and Nebula awards and is widely considered to be one of, if not the, best science fiction novels ever written. It is a grand space opera combining elements of Byzantine politics and an Islam-like religious movement. Ironically, the weakest strand of the story is also the most speculative. Melange, the spice of Dune, is so valuable because it is basically a mind-altering drug, which is used by the Spacing Guild to warp space and time and facilitate intergalactic travel. While the political and religious strands of the story have a familiar logic to them, whenever the story turns to Melange and its effects, the tale gets pretty sketchy. Unfortunately, in the sequels to the book this drug-induced storyline gained increasing prominence at the expense of coherence. But for this one novel, Frank Herbert masterfully wields his complex plot across a sweeping canvas and soaks the maximum tension out of a large scale political and religious conflict. The reputation of the novel is well deserved.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert's 1969 novel, &quot;Dune Messiah,&quot; like its predecessor novel, &quot;Dune,&quot; is really much less about action and adventure than it is about the personal effects of power. Actually, &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; has no real action, no real excitement - unless you find mental trauma, philosophical quandaries, and musings on the relationships between government and religion exciting; fortunately, I do. Even the novel's title is a mental excerise in irony - one of the questions that permeates this book, as it did toward the end of &quot;Dune&quot; is can one young man balance the unbelievable burdens of being a man of the people, an emperor, and a god while trying to be an individual and a husband? Can Paul Muad'dib, reputed savior, save even himself?From its beginnings, &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; really concerns a plot between the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, the Spacing Guild, and the Bene Tleilax, to find a way to compromise the theocracy of Muad'dib, whose Jihad and its adherents have been sweeping the universe during the 12 years since the overthrow of House Corrino's Emperor Shaddam IV depicted at the end of &quot;Dune.&quot; The Bene Gesserit want to regain control of Paul Muad'dib's bloodline for their breeding program, the Spacing Guild want easier access to Spice, produced only on Arrakis, and the Bene Tleilax want a piece of Muad'dib - literally - to clone and control their own Kwisatz Haderach. As in the first novel, there are plots within plots, and the conspiracy is only ever a loose confederacy, each party with their own competing interests. Further, these parties seek to manipulate an increasing sense of dissent amongst the native Fremen on Arrakis, many of whom feel left out or disenchanted by the changes in their lives since the beginning of the Jihad, particularly with their unsatisfying movement from the margins of the empire they helped depose, to the margins of an empire they helped to create. The Bene Tleilax initiate the action of the novel, goading the dissident Fremen and presenting Muad'dib with a clone, or ghola, of his slain teacher, Duncan Idaho, who at the appropriate moment, is to murder Muad'dib.Muad'dib, meanwhile, has his own problems - he remains, for good and ill, the melancholy, self-absorbed, confused young man that he was at the end of &quot;Dune.&quot; He is prepossessed, throughout the novel, with the feeling that his knowledge of the future utterly controls him. While he longs for a normal, secluded life with his concubine, Chani, and the chance to have and raise children, his daily involvement with the myth that has sprung up around him gives him an ever-increasing sense of isolation and alienation from his humanity. He has become almost unbearably fatalistic as he is forced to embrace as he shrinks from his role as deified Messiah and from his visions of the future. Indeed, the problem and potential of vision is a preoccupation of the novel - from the metal eyes of the ghola to Muad'dib's eventual physical blindness.As the novel progresses, it becomes clear that Muad'dib's journey is out of his own hands, and wisely, rather than subject the reader to hundreds of pages of Muad'dib lamenting his fate, Herbert turns his focus to other characters - specifically the ghola Duncan Idaho and Muad'dib's pre-born sister Alia - and their struggles. Indeed, the ghola is the most intriguing character in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; as he attempts to discover the latent memories of his former life and to fight against his own Tleilaxu programming. The Tleilaxu contingent overall form the most consistently interesting figures in the novel. From the conspirator Scytale, a Tleilaxu Face Dancer (shape-shifter) to the gholas - Hayt/Duncan Idaho, and the dwarf Bijaz - the Tleilaxu, with their use of technology to change themselves and to effect change in others is a sinister contrast to Muad'dib's Fremen efforts to alter the ecology of Arrakis and the structures of power in the universe.What &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; lacks is a sense of scope and urgency. &quot;Dune&quot; gave us a new universe, one which hinted at compelling connections to our own, but which &quot;Messiah&quot; does not take any pains to develop. The personal, internal struggles of Herbert's characters in &quot;Messiah&quot; are almost too self-involved - we lose touch to a great extent, with larger issues, with the epic feel of the original novel. Finally, Alia's degeneration into Abomination is not really chronicled in any satisfactory detail. These criticisms aside, &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; is a good, but not a really fitting sequel to &quot;Dune&quot; - worth reading certainly, but no match for the power, originality, and depth of its predecessor."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is old scifi with an excellent story line for its time. One might call it a classic of the genere. It has been reprinted many many times and one can find it used for minimal cost and most libraries have copies as well.Penguin publishing was previously one of my favorite publishers but now they are failing to adapt to the market conditions and alienating their customer base. While I don't say I'll never buy anything published by them again I do closely scrutinize and have to be moved from an initial not buying position. All publishers are really going to need to become lean product development houses that do not attempt to lock author's works or customers dollars in. Doing the opposite will cause authors to go around publishing houses all together and customers will just acquire the product in other ways.The price of this kindle product is rediculous and it is penguin's fault."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Is this book boring or what?

As a Sci-fi fanatic, I was disappointed in this book for a few reasons, the biggest being the boredom aspect. On page 229, I had to put the book down because I had no real desire to read on. The other bothersome aspect is that this book does not take you in on the same emotional level as a &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; You really pull for Tolkien's characters, whereas Dune folk felt like automatons going through another Matrix-lite plot."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Prose that would make a Dungeons and Dragon novel blush, boring , narcassistic characters, plot goes nowhere...1 star"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"After reading Ender's Game...well, to put it lightly, lets just say I got cabin fever.I admit--I have NOT finished the book yet (a side effect of cabin fever), and I WAS intrigued at first. 200 pages in...and nothing remotely exciting was happening.

It consistently tops the charts when readers are asked for the best SF novels. Being a SF reader myself it was almost heretic not to have read it before, so after more than 30 years I decided to give it a try. Awfull, is the word that best describes my experience. I couldn't find any sense of wonder or anything else for that matter that justified such high praises. To compare it to The Lord of the Rings is to commit a crime. This novel is a fraud, a naked king pretending to be wearing the finest clothes. Forget the hype, this is a complete waste of time."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is a chore.

When I tried to read Dune Messiah I couldn't, I found it boring, and felt that the main character was now too old.Recently, I reread Dune and continued on through to Dune Messiah, reading both in only two weeks.Dune Messiah is really just a continuation of the first, and it delivers a 'triumphant tragedy' that is makes a fitting end to the life of a Messiah.Paul is thirty now (not very old at all), and the Jihad he feared so much is serving the purpose it is supposed to, mingling the genes of humanity and ending the stagnation that existing under the old Imperial system. He has been made both an Emporer and a God, and Alia leads his religion. Pilgrims come in their thousands to Arrakis to experience his Holyness.However, there are many who plot against him. The Bene Gesserit wish to destroy Paul before he has the chance to establish an Atreides dynasty and regain the precious genes they worked so hard to create. The Fremen long for the old ways when water was precious and Arrakis was theirs. The Bene Tleilax want to gain a kwisatz haderach they can control, and the priests of Maud'Dib's own religion wish to make a martyr of him.And with his prescience, Paul sees disaster for all man kind unless he follows one set path of the future, but is he willing to pay the price that comes with that future?The plots that surround Paul are intriguing in their own right, but more intriguing is the development of Paul himself. Or rather, Paul's realisation that what he has created leads to its own stagnation. His powers also develop somewhat, making him an even more realistic Messiah, and finally, it ends in what is in many ways a tragedy, I certainly left this book feeling sad, but it is also in many ways a triumph.I do not feel that this revelation spoils the book, because it could be sumised because of the Messianic nature of Paul, and because from the very begining of this book, all paths lead to a tragedy in one form or another.Once I got over the initial depression, I realised that this book perfected the Messiah story begun in Dune, and together they make one of the best works of literature ever. I feel that the two must be considered as one story."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is an amazing journey, and anyone who has thought of reading definitely should. However, I want to know why the Kindle version is more expensive than any other version?! I'm starting to get REALLY sick of all this. Well, Amazon got their $189 out of the person who bought the Kindle itself for me, but they sure won't get any more money from me for books that are outrageously overpriced."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I don't mind paying a premium for a kindle version of a book. Well, I do a little. There is printing cost. That is not my problem with this book. It's the typos. Amazon needs to start hiring their own proofreaders or refusing to publish books with such a shoddy translation. I'm only about a quarter of the way through the book and I have seen lots of typos. If this were the bargain version of the book, I could accept it. I can't accept paying full price for an old book that the publisher didn't bother to reinvest enough in to make a decent version."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The epic story of the Atreides line is continued with Frank Herbert's Dune Messiah. Although the origional Dune was far better, this book still stands out as one of the greatest science fiction works of all time. Herbert creates a world so far advanced in the future that it boggles the mind. Dune Messiah places a slightly larger emphasis on the vast abilities of the mind, especially with Paul's ability to see through oracular vision after he was blinded by the stone burner. Herbert appears to become estranged from the action adventure themes of Dune and more involved with philosophy. This makes it harder to read, as opposed to the effortless flow of Dune. However this book is nessecary for anyone who read Dune, to satisfy their craving for the rest of the story. This is where most of Herbert's acclaims origionated. I beleive he saw this as an immediate reacction to the work, and decided to leave the reader in just as much suspense as before at the end of the book. This ending makes up for any of the flaws contained in this book when compared to Dune, and I am now on the third book in the series, Children of Dune. It's looking about the same."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune (1965) is the first SF novel in this series. Paul Atreides was born to Duke Leto Atreides and the Lady Jessica in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor Shaddim IV. For his first fifteen years, Paul lived on Caladan, the Atreides home planet. Then the Emperor exchanged Arrakis -- Dune -- for Caladan.In this novel, Duke Leto is a leader of men and sees Arrakis as an opportunity to expose the former possessors -- the Harkonnens -- as incompetents. Arrakis is the only planet that produces Melange, popularly known as Spice. The substance allows Guild Navigators to guide ships between the stars and extends the life of any who can afford it.Duke Leto also sees a great opportunity in the Fremen, the dwellers of the Arrakis desert. The Harkonnens have hunted the Fremen for sport and consider them to be native trash. But the Duke knows that the Fremen are potentially as deadly as the most elite force within the Empire, the Sardaukar.The Duke and his retainers are preparing for the move. Yet Paul is being prepared for something else. Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam has come to Caladan to test him with the gom jabbar.The Bene Gesserit have been breeding for a Kwisatz Haderach, a person with unusual talents and a strange destiny. The first step in testing for such a person is the gom jabbar, the test of pain. When Paul inserts his hand into the box, he fells as if his hand is being burned to a blackened stump.His mother Jessica knows that he will be subjected to extreme pain, but she doesn't question the need. She has been trained by the Bene Gesserit and accepts their goals. Yet she was ordered to produce a girl child and she is not quite certain why she had disobeyed.Baron Vladimir Harkonnen sees the turnover of Arrakis as an opportunity to destroy Duke Leto. He and Piter -- his Mentat -- brief his nephew Feyd-Rautha on the plan. But the Baron and his Mentat can't converse without bickering. Feyd-Rautha would rather be elsewhere than to witness their quarreling.Wellington Yueh is a Suk Doctor in the household of Duke Leto. The Baron Harkonnen has captured His wife Wanda and is pressing the doctor to kidnap Paul. The doctor has convenient access to Paul and is trusted by the Atreides.In this story, the Atreides take their household and possessions to Arrakis on a Guild freighter. Rather than occupying Carthage -- the former Harkonnen capitol -- the Atreides land in Arrakeen, which Thufir Hawat -- the Duke's Mentat -- has decided is more defensible. The Atreides family resides in the household of Count Hasimir Fenring.The Atreides contact the Fremen and learn of a Harkonnen force disguised as Fremen. Duncan Idaho and his men take the Harkonnens captive, but the Harkonnens severely wound the Fremen courier. He dies in transit to the Atreides medical facility.Stilgar -- chief of a Fremen sietch -- comes to Leto to evaluate him. He honors Leto enough to give him permission to unsheath a crysknife found near the courier. Duke Leto then gives Duncan Idaho leave to return to the sietch with Stilgar.This story tells of the death of Duke Leto and the transfer of loyalty of his men to Paul. It takes Paul to the Fremen and makes him one of them. It lays the foundations of the fall of the Empire and the rise of the God-King.This novel is only the first of a great series. It creates a very fascinating universe that is still being read and expanded. It may be the best of the author's works, if only for its great scope and backstory.Highly recommended for Herbert fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of exotic societies, political intrigue and strange powers.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The novel Dune is one of those works that you hear of by reputation as being a classic and which you always see in the bookstore but never seem to pick up to read. I had seen the David Lynch film when I was younger and was confused and bored by it. I borrowed a copy of the Dune tv mini-series recently, and after watching one episode I found the story intriguing but the special effects lacking. So I decided to read the book in order to experience a better effects company, my imagination.To me, one of the things that makes Dune unique is its glimpse of what the future holds for the human race. It isnt a future controlled by machines and dominated by technology as so many science fiction worlds are. The universe that Frank Herbert creates here is a humanistic one, almost a mideval renaissance world. Going along with that thought, this universe is filled with court intrigue. The known universe is loosely ruled by an emperor named Padashan IV who keeps his rule going with the threat of his imperial guard, elite fighting units called Sardaukar. He also keeps his noblemen in suspicion of each other and sometimes helps bring about actual wars between them if it suits his purpose.As the book opens, one of his most respected noblemen, Duke Atreides, is sent to the desert planet of Arrakis (Dune) to take over spice production. Spice is the most important product in the universe and whoever controls it, controls power, and brings danger on themselves. One of the sources of conflict is that the Atreides have replaced the House Harkonnen, their bitter enemies, on Arrakis, so the whole place smells like a trap waiting to spring. The Harkonnens have sworn eternal war, called \\"kanly\\" with the Atreides and it is only a question of when and how they will strike. In addition to this, there are mysterious native inhabitants on Dune, known as Fremen, whose allegience is unknown, and the Duke also has to deal with giant sandworms who can swallow ships whole.The main character of the book is Paul Atreides, son of the duke, a fifteen year old boy trained by the best fighters in the galaxy and also learned in the ways of his Bene Gesserit mother. The Bene Gesserits remind me of the Jedi in Star Wars. They are trained psychics who have strange powers feared and respected among the general populace, such as future vision, and can sometimes control weak minds and sorta steer the galaxy. Some say that Paul is destined for some terrible purpose that will lead the human race to a new destiny.This is a great book. Like the Lord of the Rings, you can tell that Herbert not only wrote this book, but in the process developed and shaped his world with legends and past histories that are only hinted at in this work. There is lots of action and adventure and also religious questions and philsophy, almost a little for every kind of ruler. It does have its dull moments, especially after Paul meets his destiny, but you have to expect that anytime you have a work that is an \\"epic\\". There's so much information that not all of it can be interesting. There is a large cast of characters, so I would maybe suggest watching the first episode of the tv series like I did because it gives you a visual reference for most of the main characters. I'm going to start the next book, Dune Messiah, today."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The present book is one of my all time favorites regardless of genre!I've read it more than a dozen times since the first time I did it in the late \`60s. Then I proceed to read every new book of the series as soon as published, treasuring the six original in my library.It was a sad day for me when I read Frank Herbert's obituary.Frank Herbert (1920-1986) wrote masterpiece \\"Dune\\" (1965), generating a recognizable turning point in sci-fi literature.The variety of themes he touched influenced many genre authors thereafter: ecology, political-religious interaction, genetic manipulation, longevity drugs and secret sisterhoods and brotherhoods.Dune's universe is fascinating not only as the backdrop to the present story but for all the other issues that are glimpsed in each chapter heading.This thematic richness allows Frank's son nowadays to produce prequel trilogies deploying those implied scenarios.The story is as follows.The Scenery.There is a Galactic Empire ruled by the Emperor. There are powerful Noble Houses that rule different planetary systems and confront each other in endless struggle, yet subject to strict rules. There is a Guild of interstellar Pilots. There is the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood following their eugenic plans and playing in backstage as advisors to all powers. Computers & AI are forbidden and replaced by human-computers called Mentat. Arrakis is Desert Planet inhabited by fanatical desert dwellers: the Fremen.The Conflict.Noble House Atreides is forced out of its Home system under Emperor's command and ordered to take care of the planet Arrakis. It is a two edged task in one hand Arrakis is the only galactic source of \\"M&eacute;lange\\" a drug that prolongs human life AND allows pilots of the Guild to conduct foldspace traveling ships. Controlling the planet is of supreme importance.In the other hand Noble House Harkonnen, Atreides' ancestral enemy, was in command of Arrakis and Duke Leto Atreides suspects a trap was laid by them to ruin his House.The Adventure.As soon as the Atreides set foot on Arrakis conflicts erupt. Paul, Duke Leto's son & heir, seems to immediately adapt to this planet conditions.After several issues that I will not disclose, Paul and his mother are left isolated in deep desert. There they will meet the Fremen and their Destiny.I recommend this book to sci-fi lovers and general public too. I will characterize \\"Dune\\" as unforgettable, outstanding and amazing. Do not let it pass by unnoticed!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I think the fact that there are over 480 reviews of this book on Amazon.com, almost all of them 5 stars, tells you something - this book is one of the best-loved sci-fi books in existence, inspiring an almost cult-like following. And no doubt Dune IS a fine work of epic fiction (\\"a cast of thousands\\"), but it is definitely not perfect, as many reviews would have you believe. Let's start with the many positives: in Dune, Frank Herbert has created a complex, richly-textured, fascinating, internally consistent (for the most part), other world. The world comes complete with it's own fascinating politics, economics, awareness of ecology (specifically, the importance of water), language (largely borrowed from Arabic), mythologies, good guys and bad guys (of course), heroes, traitors, etc. And it's a rip-roaring story which is almost impossible to put down!What you also get in Dune is a whole hodgepodge (sometimes confusing, sometimes ready to fly apart at the seams) of Zen-influenced philosophy, Machiavellian political intrigue (rival houses, the Emperor, CHOAM, the Bene Gesserit \\"witches\\", Mentats, spys, assassins, etc.), Arab-influenced desert culture and language, ecology, \\"planetology\\" (and Kynes, the Imperial planetologist) mysticism and religion aplenty, human psychology, a whole inter-galactic economic system (based on \\"spice\\"), and Star Wars-quality adventure. Whether or not this all manages to hold together is a good question, and I basically (with reservations) think it does, this book is really not comparable to any other that I know of, exactly. And things are not as \\"black and white\\" as they seem at first glance - although the Harkonnens ARE really nasty and the Atreides ARE really good (the Fremen and others tend to be far more ambiguous). And of course, there is possibly Herbert's greatest creation, the giant sandworms (\\"makers\\"), and the precious \\"spice\\" produced by them without which the whole empire would fall apart. Paul Atreides himself is a smart, likeable, charismatic character, and is basically an excellent example of a the somewhat cliched \\"boy comes of age and grows into a man\\" character. Actually, Paul's growth in this novel is not just from boy to man, but actually further, to something way beyond (almost superhuman), namely the Kwisatz Haderach - the man (can't be a woman, for somewhat obscure reasons which come awfully close to nonsensical psychobabble) who can see where others cannot, and who bridges space and time.I DO find the whole concept of being able to \\"see the future\\" fascinating the way Herbert presents it, not simplistically at all, but as a dynamic process whereby, like the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the very act of observing something changes it. In fact, Herbert's view of the future (and the past) is basically an incredibly complex set of possibilities converging at a nexus point (in Dune, it's mainly Paul Muad'Dib) and subject to change via the slightest move. How does Paul remain sane with such knowledge and such a \\"terrible burden\\"? How is he able to act and not remain paralyzed with fear when he knows that anything he does might unleash a galaxy-wide \\"jihad\\"? That's all really interesting stuff, and Herbert generally handles it well.Now here are the main problems (far fewer than the positives, and if you are one of the &quot;cult&quot; people, you might not want to read this!) with \\"Dune\\": 1) sometimes Herbert gets carried away with all the mystical/philosophical mumbo-jumbo and jargon (seems brilliant when you're 16, sort of like \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", but give it a couple of decades and see what you think then!); 2) Herbert sometimes forgets that his characters are just people, not superbeings, which I think makes them less believable and harder to relate to (unlike, let's say, Frodo in the Lord of the Rings); 3) all of the plot twists -- the \\"feints within feints within feints\\" can at times get a little confusing/tedious, even after multiple readings; 4) all this \\"terrible purpose\\" stuff can get annoying and a little over-the-top and silly at times (sometimes I feel like saying &quot;c'mon Frank, lighten up a little bit!&quot;); and 5) Herbert is an adequate, but certainly not a great prose stylist.But, all that said (cultists can start to read again now), Dune is still an excellent book and well worth reading, probably several times, each time on a different level (there are many here in this multi-layered book). Definitely DON'T waste your time on the awful movie (unless you're a big Sting fan), and also I would say avoid the sequels as well (I've read most of them). Frank Herbert had one first-rate (despite its flaws) book in him, and this is the one! Essential reading for any sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The book is a masterpiece, if you haven't read it yet do yourself a favor and buy it. The paperback edition, that is.As for the people at Penguin Publishing charging 14.99 for the Kindle edition, you have to wonder what they're smoking."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The year is 1981 and my father is reading Dune aloud to my mother in their bedroom. The door is open, and even though I'm supposed to be in bed, I keep creeping out of my room to hear the story. Since I have just learned how to read, my ambitious father has tried to get me to read the Hobbit--and failed--due to my childish dislike of tea parties. (Don't worry, I will eventually read the Hobbit on my own and love it. I will also eventually love tea parties. The world continues in its course.) Little does Dad know that he is unleashing science fiction with all its transformative ideas on his four year old daughter. I eventually get tired of waiting for my parents to read Dune at night and start sneaking it out during the day. Granted, my first reviews of Dune (exposited to my patient mother) run along extremely limited lines like: \\"And then Paul runs into the desert and lives in the caves and wears a stilsuit and rides giant worms!\\" But with each successive reading the world of Arrakis opened up further and further, with new implications to consider. This was science fiction as I imprinted on it.Dune is an epic and densely plotted science fiction novel. Herbert was obviously exploring ideas about ecology, evolution, biology, inheritance, colonialism, war, drugs, and most especially, religion, as he tracks the journey of Paul Atreides from promising ducal heir to guerilla fighter to religious figure. We are introduced to Paul and his mother, on the departure from Paul's birthworld, Caladan, a water-rich planet much like Earth. The departure is inevitable, as Paul's father, Duke Leto has been maneuvered into a switch of planetary fiefs for political reasons. Paul, adolescent, on the cusp of early manhood, will be tested by the Bene Gesserit, a religious order founded in eugenics theory, dedicated to providing mankind with their ultimate saviour. They believe Paul has a chance to be that saviour, the Kwisatz Haderach, but are not completely sure. They can not afford to have a potential Messiah haring off to the arse-end of the universe without examining his potential. Paul passes their test, and is declared human, although the Bene Gesserit reserve their judgement on his full potential. They warn him of the political trap set for his family, but more or less, consign he and his mother to the vagaries of fate.Arrakis, aka Dune, while a desert planet, is not entirely barren. For one thing, it is the sole location in the known universe where spice (the wonder drug of the 11,000s) can be produced via complicated biological processes involving giant sandworms. Space-faring navigators require this drug to perform their role, the wealthy of the galaxy live and die by the production of spice, and the major religions and science/technological orders use spice as well to enhance prescience or mental faculties. The previous rulers of Arrakis, the Harkonnens, are also life-long enemies of Paul's family, the Atreides. The Harkonnen, as one might imagine, are pretty pissed (outwardly) about being forced to give up their motherlode of wealth and power, and have already set in motion plans to seize what they once held and overthrow the Atreides once and for all. (Nifty writer trick that Herbert pulls off here: He doesn't try to conceal the big horrible plan or the main bad guys or the betrayer. He tells you. In the second chapter! And it works, because while we know, the Atreides do not fully know how to evade the trap that is being set for them.)When the jaws of the Harkonnen trap finally close around the Atreides family, Paul and his mother are forced to take to the harsh desert of Arrakis to escape. It is out in the desert that Paul meets up with the indigenous people of Arrakis, the Fremen. He and Jessica agree to teach the Fremen their Bene Genesserit ways in exchange for the Fremen knowledge about the desert. The Fremen also believe that Paul might be the prophesied Kwisatz Haderach, something which Paul and Jessica duly exploit as Paul grows to adulthood. As he grows in power, he works to overthrow the Harkonnen.This is pretty much my go-to book for science fiction virtuosity. It sits next to Enders Game and Foundation on my shelves as the classics from my childhood. Frank Herbert does an excellent job of seemingly effortless world building. He doesn't try to clumsily exposit the mythical references upon which the bedrock of Dune's religious ambience is built. (Unlike the clumsily written prequels offered up by his son and Kevin J. Anderson, who decide inexplicably to shuffle half the mythos out and replace with things like \\"feng shui\\" in the Bene Gesserit birthing rooms. Give the prequels a pass, as the two I read made only the most cursory attempt to align with Herbert's original vision.) He doesn't bang you over the head with science, although one character Kynes is prone to philosophical musings about biology. There's a wonderful balance of court intrigue, military politics, ecological concerns, questions of morality, explorations of religion, and Machiavellian ruler-princes deciding how to best run the universe. For the action-starved, tense scenes with killer storms and giant sandworms larger than buildings will keep you turning the pages. Arrakis is rendered with gritty, textured harshness, and the struggle of humans to transform their world and their universe is set in strong relief against this."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This first Dune novel, along with the second one one of the series (Dune Messiah) is my all time favorite novel of any kind. I first read it as a teenager and have read it at least once a decade since. I am currently re-reading this edition on my brand, spanking new Kindle and it is every bit as good as I remember it. I am amazed that each time I read it, as I pass through different periods of my life, I find different things to enjoy about the story and pick up something new every time. I cannot recommend this book highly enough! This is why it's my first Amazon book review. I couldn't come up with a better first book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The making of a man and the future of a planet are intertwined in this Science Fiction classic. Paul Atreides is the heir to his Father's Dukedom on th Planet Arrakis. The planet is the key to intergalatic commerece because of its large supply of spice. As Paul completes the rite of passage from child to man a new generation make their mark and it all begins in Dune.Rarely, does a story capture me from the beginning like Herbert does here. The characters leave an indelible mark on the reader and move the story at a brisk pace. This is not an average sci-fi story. It has many levels of religious, political and ecological overtones that still hold significant meaning in today' world. I highly reccomend this brilliant Hugo and Nebula Award winning novel."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert created simply the most brilliant piece of science fiction/fantasy ever written. Arrakis is to me what Middle Earth is to others. If you're debating whether or not you want to purchase a copy,you should stop debating and buy it ASAP. If you're even remotely a science fiction/fantasy fan then you will love it and most likely go on to read the entire amazing series.(Just wait till you get to God Emperor of Dune!It will blow you away!) Once maybe every generation we're blessed with a writer with an incredible imagination like Tolkien or JK Rowling and Frank Herbert is such a giant. Forget about the awful movie made by that hack David Lynch, do yourself a favor and read this book!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"What Herbert creates with Dune is truly unique in the world of sci-fi. If you are bored with the usual sci-fi fare that seems derivative and predictable, Dune may just be the refresher you are looking for. Conflicted heroes, depraved villains, and a gripping style that pulls you into his world, Dune is a masterpiece and a must read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Having read this book nearly 20 years ago (right before I got married), I was recently thrilled to see it being reissued and propped up on a shelf at my local bookstore.The story of a desert planet without any viable source of water that held an empire together was sheer genius, and author Frank Herbert is to be commended for his insights into the human condition, including those associated with politics, geology, genetics, environmentalism, religion, and many other subtle aspects.Paul Atreides as the main character was fascinating to read about as he turns from boy to man to god (in the eyes of the fremen, the natives on Dune/Arrakis), and takes control of the most precious item in the universe: the spice melange. The spice extends life, consciousness, but comes at a terrible price: addiction.The great worms of Arrakis are a vital part of the ecosystem on Dune as they protect their areas of sand and are instrumental in the cycle of spice production.The feudal system was also an ingenious way to portray a futuristic society that has fallen back onto a path that could lead to stagnation and, ultimately, to the end of humankind.There's a lot more than this within these pages, too; something for just about everyone, and not just those with a predisposition for science fiction.This is my all-time favorite novel, and I'd forgotten how much I'd enjoyed it so long ago. Thanks to whomever is responsible for this reissue.Memories..."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune Messiah is the second book from Frank Herbert in the Dune Series. Paul Atreides is now the Emperor/Duke of Arrakis with his Fremen wife Chani and his Imperial concubine, Irulan. In Dune Messiah, the reader starts to see the internal struggle that Paul battles throughout the book. A battle between trying to prevent the jihad from his fremen followers that he sees so much in his future vision and trying to be a husband to Chani and protecting Alia (his sister) at the same time. As with any Emperor with such a following, there are those out to make Paul's life miserable at every turn. I felt this was a much more personal book than Dune itself. It gives you a glimpse at how life is for an Emperor in such a position and the reader gets to see that Paul is infact a human being that struggles with being the possible messiah that his people and all those around him need.Overall, an outstanding book in the Dune series and every bit as enjoyable as Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The present book is one of my all time favorites regardless of genre!I've read it more than a dozen times since the first time I did it in the late \`60s. Then I proceed to read every new book of the series as soon as published, treasuring the six original in my library.It was a sad day for me when I read Frank Herbert's obituary.Frank Herbert (1920-1986) wrote masterpiece \\"Dune\\" (1965), generating a recognizable turning point in sci-fi literature.The variety of themes he touched influenced many genre authors thereafter: ecology, political-religious interaction, genetic manipulation, longevity drugs and secret sisterhoods and brotherhoods.Dune's universe is fascinating not only as the backdrop to the present story but for all the other issues that are glimpsed in each chapter heading.This thematic richness allows Frank's son nowadays to produce prequel trilogies deploying those implied scenarios and also extend his father uncompleted saga.The story is as follows.The Scenery.There is a Galactic Empire ruled by the Emperor. There are powerful Noble Houses that rule different planetary systems and confront each other in endless struggle, yet subject to strict rules. There is a Guild of interstellar Pilots. There is the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood following their eugenic plans and playing in backstage as advisors to all powers. Computers & AI are forbidden and replaced by human-computers called Mentat. Arrakis is Desert Planet inhabited by fanatical desert dwellers: the Fremen.The Conflict.Noble House Atreides is forced out of its Home system under Emperor's command and ordered to take care of the planet Arrakis. It is a two edged task in one hand Arrakis is the only galactic source of \\"M&eacute;lange\\" a drug that prolongs human life AND allows pilots of the Guild to conduct foldspace traveling ships. Controlling the planet is of supreme importance.In the other hand Noble House Harkonnen, Atreides' ancestral enemy, was in command of Arrakis and Duke Leto Atreides suspects a trap was laid by them to ruin his House.The Adventure.As soon as the Atreides set foot on Arrakis conflicts erupt. Paul, Duke Leto's son & heir, seems to immediately adapt to this planet conditions.After several issues that I will not disclose, Paul and his mother are left isolated in deep desert.There the will meet the Fremen and their Destiny!I recommend this book to sci-fi lovers and general public too. I will characterize \\"Dune\\" as unforgettable, outstanding and amazing. Do not let it pass by unnoticed!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Forgive the bad pun. But this book is a bit dark compared to the original. Dune was a sweeping epic. Dune Messiah is a singular story focusing on the darkness implied in Dune. Although Dune ended in a very triumphant fasion...there were unresolved tensions about the coming Jihad and what would happed when Paul Atreides became Emperor/Messiah. Those tensions are explored here. Yes...the writing style is different...and no this is nothing like the original...however I still enjoyed reading this book and had a hard time putting it down.I love the way the book kicks off giving you the details of the conspiracy. Similar to how Dune laid out the Harkonnen plot within the first few chapters. I also really enjoyed the introduction to the Bene Tleilax. Scytale and Hayt were great characters. I wish Scytale had been fleshed out a bit more. While all the talk about prescience and Religion/Government went on a little too much, I still find it to be intriguing. I think Frank Herbert could have been a philosopher. Other than the ending I thought the coolest aspect was how when Paul loses his eyesight he can still see everything around him because it was part of his vision. The ending of course was the best part of all. Especially when little Leto makes contact with Paul and Paul has a true 'Kwisatz Haderach' moment when he sees all of the male perspectives in his line. Frank Herbert was an incredible writer and did not intend for this book to stack up to the first. I see it more as an exploration of 'The Other Side of the Coin' when it comes to seeing the future and well...being a Messiah."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"To add a review for the CD...this was my first experience of any Dune novel on audio and for the most part I was very impressed and felt that the (relatively high) price was reflected in the quality of the recording. This isn't my favourite Dune story, so that may have clouded my enjoyment of this CD a little, there's just something about the story-telling style in 'Messiah' that for me doesn't quite lend itself to the immediacy of either the original 'Dune' story, or of 'Children of Dune'. But when the material is as well delivered as this that seems like an unfair criticism.There are four narrators on this audio-book, which isn't unheard of for an audio recording and which is easily adapted to even if you're accustomed to a single reader (as I had been). Indeed, their individual vocal quirks and unique interpretations of the material and characters in the story add substance, depth and a pleasing sense of multiple character perspectives. But I was surprised that three of these readers contributed so little in comparison to the fourth reader, whose voice bespoke the greatest maturity and experience of audio narration. So perhaps rightly he is given the lion's share of the material, but I found myself disappointed that the other readers were given very little material to bring to life in comparison, especially as they're clearly just as talented in their own right- each possessing seductive tones combined with a great verbal dexterity. There didn't appear to be any pattern to the allocation of scenes to the lesser narrators. At first I presumed that Alia would be read by the female narrator, but after one scene she was never heard of again, which I found unbalancing. So to be critical, I'd say that I personally would have preferred a little more equality in the dissection of the story among the narrators.Despite that it's a gorgeous dramatisation. It's on 7 CD's, so it is long, but it's never a chore and with every CD that came to an end I grew a little more saddened that the story was gradually drawing to a close. On the evidence of this CD I would certainly buy the others in audio form and I'm eagerly anticipating the release of 'Children of Dune' in February."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert's science fiction epic Dune is considered the definitive science fiction/fantasy novel. After reading it, I felt the same. It has everything you've ever wanted in a sci-fi story and more. This book has plenty of characters, of whom nearly all are described in great detail or play major roles in the book. This book uses lots of very descriptive writing to describe alien environments and other cosmic locales, which are also quite abundant as well. This book has a simple name that can be shortened easily when writing book reports and not sound awkward in the least, unlike The House of Seven Gables or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Dune contains many fascinating aspects that present the book in a much more serious perspective than would had they not been used. For example, Herbert employs a type of narration that serves as a more strategic use of standard plot hopping. Herbert's writing style is one in which a writer will switch the plot over to different characters after nearly every other chapter. Whenever the plot line involving certain characters becomes tense, the reader will become anxious. The writer will then take this segment of the plot and continue on with it for a few chapters or so until the reader becomes so excited that he or she cannot hold the book steady any longer. As soon as the peak in these most gripping chapters is reached, the writer completely terminates your connection to that specific plot branch, and moves on to a different one. The writer will stay on this separate plot line and others until your interest in the previous one disappears, so by the time the writer gets back around to it, you won't care what happens to the characters in it. Although this writing style has been notorious for deterring readers the world over, Herbert's characters and environments are so unique and interesting that you'll want to continue reading despite the fidgety plot. Another one of Dune's trademark characteristics is Herbert's use of philosophy, which is used quite frequently in character dialogue. Because two of the major organizations in the Dune universe are intellectual schools, the people that act as representatives from these schools speak intellectually, using words as a weapon and making statements with hidden meanings. The members of the royal houses use these philosophical ideas and methods of speech as well, but they are much easier to understand, because Herbert wants to give you the idea that these people are distinguished. The philosophical dialogue used in Dune may be difficult to read at first, but by the end of the book, the language becomes tolerable, if not understandable. If you choose to read the rest of the books in the series, beware. Philosophical speech is used in all of the Dune books. The most important aspects of Dune are its characters and its setting. For the most part, the story takes place on a dry desert planet named Arrakis, also referred to as Dune by its inhabitants, and the main characters are Paul Atreides and his mother, the Lady Jessica. Dune represents desolation and desertion, and also stresses the fact that Paul and his mother are like fish out of water, because they came from a lush, earthlike planet, and are now on a planet where water equals power. Later in the novel, Paul and Jessica are given shelter by Stilgar, a Fremen. Fremen, by the way, are the people native to Arrakis. They have strict rules governing water distribution, and treat the desert-dwelling sandworm like a deity, among other things. Over a period of several years, Paul and his mother become Fremen. They adopt Fremen customs, act like Fremen, dress like Fremen, and obey all Fremen rules. They both go through a complete change of character. While they change, others remain the same. The Baron Harkonnen, for example, continues to live a gluttonous, decadent, and otherwise repellent lifestyle. But then again, that's just his character. Dune is very hard not to take seriously. People die, kill, betray, execute, plot, scheme, and ruin other people in an accurate representation of what life and human relations may be like in the future, eight thousand years from now. Situations like this are what attracts people to read Dune, and keeps fans coming back for more."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"After reading Dune I was hesitant to get myself caught in a commitment to read the whole series. I know.... I'm just another male who has trouble with commitment. But after reading Dune Messiah I have to admit, i'm hooked. Although many might disagree with me i actually feel that this one was better. This book involved deeper philosophy while incorporating character history that was pre established in the first novel. It's hard to describe the differences without giving anything away. Before reading this book a decided to read some of the reviews to get a better feel for what i was in for. .... and allow me to forewarn you, some of these reviews give away the ending. thoughout the book i thought i'd be disappointed knowing what was going to happen. But as it turns out there are more twists then i thought and the ending was truly appropriate. I look foreward to reading the rest of Herbert's books, now that i'm stuck in the lives of the Atrieds."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"There is something about Dune that keeps me coming back for more. I've read the novel three times, and three times I've learned something new, and my appreciation has grown in accordance. Paul Maud'dib, or Paul Atreides, is easily the noblest figure in contemporary sci-fi. From his early training with the colorful Duncan Idaho, to the Gom Jabbar, to the desert sands of Arrakis with his beautiful Bene Gesserit mother Jessica and finally his fateful entrance into the Fremen culture, the story of Paul Atreides becomes the story of Dune. Dune becomes bigger than all of us. If there is magic in this world, it belongs to Frank Herbert."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is by far the best book I have ever read. I can't recommend it highly enough. I have never found myself so immersed in a fictional world. Words can't describe the beauty of it. Reading Dune is one of the few things I still vividly remember from my childhood...the experience was that intense."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. Not only is it the most complete work of imagination ever written since the first story ever, but it tells the greatest story: The story apon which two of the 3 great Monotheistic religions, and therefore a great deal of Western culture is based: Messiah. I am not making a statement of religion, but simply saying that the issues dealt with in this book are more important than anything else to more that a billion people world over. This was a universal theme put into science fiction extremely well. This is possibly the most important novel ever. Anyone who says this book was bad is out of his got- dang mind."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Occasionally a person attains a moment of great clarity of vision and thought; much more rarely, this vision can be communicated to others. 'Dune' is such a vision clearly seen and expertly told.As with most epics, 'Dune' can be appreciated on many levels. It is a story about the rite of passage of Paul Atreides from boy to man. It is a tale of the end of an age-old feud between two major Houses. It contains morals and warnings, politics and religion, loyalty and betrayal, and all of the things which have become the staple of truly great Science Fiction.But the one thing that makes this book stand out is its clarity. Herbert had a story to tell, one he fully grasped, and he told it without extraneous details, without excessive dialog or inane side-plots. He revealed the secrets of Dune in a deliberate, timely manner, making every word count.There are few works in Science Fiction that come close to what Herbert has written here. If you want to see the best of what Science Fiction has to offer, read this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"All opinions aside about the plot or quality of writing of this story, the build quality of this book itself is horrible. The copy I have has strange spacing on many pages, offset sometimes, different sized fonts on other pages. I recommend buying another paperback, not this one."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a colossal work. Dune Messiah is a disappointing work. I don't understand how the same man could have written both books. Dune has strong characterization and a strong plot; Dune Messiah has neither. Dune Messiah substitutes characterization with psycho-babble. Half the dialogue in this book doesn't make any sense and doesn't further the plot. The ending is strong, but it doesn't make up for all the nonsense that Herbert subjected me to. (Don't let anyone try to tell you that this book is &quot;deeper&quot; than Dune because of all the confusing things the characters say. &quot;Deep&quot; only equals &quot;confusing&quot; for people who can't read.) All that said, Dune Messiah made me feel like I was reading Fanfic. It was mildly entertaining, but please don't confuse it with the real thing."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is one of those sci-fi epics with legions of fanatical adherents, so it's a little daunting to play the role of the heretic...but...it's kind of overrated (there, I've said it). Herbert has certainly done a great job of what is commonly called &quot;world building.&quot; That is, he's created an nicely detailed setting for his story, centering on the desert planet of the title. His rendering of the political and geographical milieu is certainly impressive, however, he has the unfortunate habit of using five words where one will do. This imperial universe is populated by a Byzantine cast of players, all belonging to various factions, with hidden motives, allegiances and so forth. It's kind of a utopia for Machiavellians. Unfortunately, these characters are so bound by adhering to &quot;the form&quot; (i.e. codes of proper address, conduct and comportment), that much of the dialogue is ponderous and borderline silly. When he leaves the scheming aristocracy and concerns himself with the natives of Dune, things improve somewhat. Their desert culture is based somewhat on elements of traditional desert Arab culture, with a some elements of Islam, and more interestingly, post-holocaust Israeli world view. The story is, at its core, a fairly basic one of a good family done an injustice, and a boy becoming a man (and much more) as he seeks his revenge. Around this is built a rather overly convoluted and tedious narrative spanning about 5 years in which many things come to pass, but basically we are waiting for the climax. The book's action and battle sequences are quite good, but there's far too much time spent setting the stage, especially dealing with some of the more mystical aspects. The five sequels are apparently even more tedious than this (and that's according to people who love this!), making it certain this will be only foray into Herbert's world. If you love the lengthy epics, this might be your cup of tea, but if you're like me and like your prose a little cripser, there is much better sci-fi out there (I'd suggest Orson Scott Card's brilliant &quot;Ender's Game&quot; or maybe something by Robert Heinlein or Philip K. Dick)."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is commonly cited as the world's bestselling sci-fi novel. Many also argue that it is the greatest. While I myself will not make that claim (I've read far too many excellent novels to ever even consider picking just one) I find myself disinclined to argue with that statement. I will say that Frank Herbert's masterpiece is by far the most imaginative work of sci-fi I've ever picked up.Good science fiction walks a tightrope between making things too familiar and making them relateable. Dune somehow manages both. The world of Dune is a human empire that stretches across the stars, yet functions in a very feudalistic manner. It's somewhere abouts the year 10,000 and everything has changed, from science to technology to religion, and all of it described so that if you're vigilant you can really learn a lot about this world. At the same time, for the most part Herbert avoids the dreaded \\"people telling each other things they should already know\\" pitfall.The novel begins on Caladan, a watery planet ruled by Duke Leto Atreides and his family, the concubine Lady Jessica and their son Paul Atreides. You quickly learn that a.) things are not as they seem with House Atreides' move from their traditional home on Caladan to be \\"rewarded\\" with control of Arrakis, a desert planet where moisture is so precious its natives (and anyone venturing outside the cities) are forced to wear \\"stillsuits\\" that reclaim the body's otherwise-lost moisture, a planet where workers harvesting the precious melange spice have to dodge the gigantic sandworms that roam the desert and will swallow a mining facility whole. And b.) you learn that there are some mighty strange inhabitants of this future society we are being shown. There are the Fremen, the native inhabitants of the deserts of Arrakis and a force not to be underestimated. There are the Bene Gesserit, an order that mostly resembles the Aes Sedai of Robert Jordan'sWheel Of Time series (Anyone? No? Okay, they're an all-female Jedi Order. Better?) and have been manipulating the various noble houses' lineages in hopes of creating their (for lack of a better word) messiah-an aim they may or may not have achieved with the birth of young Paul. There are the Harkonnens, another noble House locked in an age-old feud with House Atreides and the previous rulers of Arrakis. There is the Guild, the organization that controls all space travel and answers to no one but themselves, not even the Padishah Emperor himself. There are the Mentats, men trained to be intensely logical reasoning machines (for all mechanical intelligences such as computers are taboo after an ill-defined war in the distant past) who are nevertheless still governed by the most basic rule of computing-garbage in, garbage out.I cannot say much more without giving away plot details. What I will say is that the novel is meticulously plotted, an intricate weave of political maneuvering in a system that doesn't actually exist outside of the imagination. The complexity is astounding, and leads to my one real caution about the book-its not for the faint of heart. The book requires your complete concentration or you will get completely lost and have to go back to find what details you missed. As such, and to facilitate such intricate interactions between the characters, Herbert ditches the literary convention of having a single POV character for any given scene. You may find yourself, in the course of a seemingly meaningless coversation between six or seven people over dinner, in the head of every person present in order to more clearly understand what is going on and where their minds are going with the multiple layers of subtext. It's done well, but it makes the book a bit more challenging than it would otherwise be. Additionally, there is a lot of new vocabulary you will have to learn. Fortunately, Herbert does a good job of defining things in the text without being annoying-I actually found the glossary in the back distracting after a while for anything but going back to double-check meanings I was already supposed to have learned.There is a good deal of violence throughout the book, though I didn't find it gratuitous. Likewise sexual innuendo. Its there, it just isn't necessarily stuck in your face or played for obscenity. There may have been some language, I really don't recall. If you're old enough to make it through Dune in all other regards, I doubt you'll find it problematic.So yeah. Dune is technically the first work in a series, though I've had conflicting reports on how far through the series I should read. Some reccomend stopping here. Others say that Dune Messiah and Children of Dune are also worthwhile, completing Herbert's originally-conceived trilogy. I'll probably pause there for a while before moving on to the other sequels and prequels done in the ages since, if only because the initial trilogy was all I found at that garage sale last year. I haven't read any but the initial work yet, but thus far I can heartily recommend!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It is, without a doubt, one of the greatest feats in science fiction. Frank Herbert created one of the most detailed, most fascinating worlds in the history of SF. He didn't only create of single world, but an entire intergalactic empire, of which the world of Arakis (Dune) is the lynchpin.The characters are well rounded, with even minor characters having believable motives and some with histories that are obviously well thought out and full understood by the author even if he only hints at them within the book.Dune is a massive tome, but it takes that many pages to tell the epic tale that Herbert has set out upon. Definitely not to be missed. The only reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of five were (1) The books that follow are actually better than the first and (2) Herbert's foreshadowing is a little heavy handed...at times he tells us EXACTLY what will dozens of pages before it does."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"DUNE is the seminal work in science fiction.

The others, I think, bring it down, but Dune is amazing. Paul Atreides of House Atreides is forced into the desert after House Atreides arch-enemy, House Harkonnen, aided by the Emperor, attacks the household. With his mother, he joins the mysterious Fremen, who, despite pompous Dukes who feel it's theirs, control the valuable resource known as Spice which makes it possible for Space travel. Paul is part of the prophecy and is the Kwisatz Haderach, which is what the Bene Gesserit have been trying to accomplish in their breeding programs. However, due to a glitch, he's come one generation too early, and the Sisterhood (known as witches to many) aren't ready for him.This book was spectacular. I've read it so many times it's falling apart. It may be confusing at times, but that just makes it more interesting."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Considered one of the best science fiction novels ever written, Dune includes all of the elements which earned it that title. A world shaped through all facets of life - politics, religion, interpersonal relationships, environment - Dune reveals itself not with long descriptive passages explaining the culture, but by depositing you within that culture and leaving you, as the reader, to make sense of it through scattered hints and immersion.For this, I commend the novel. Most science fiction authors get caught up explaining to the reader the world in which the story takes place - to the detriment of the story itself. Herbert does not fall into this trap, and the story is strong because of it.Dune is not an easy read, mainly due to the above mentioned immersion approach to introducing the reader to the landscape of the novel. It requires concentration to sort out the different elements of the story. Several story lines radiate from the central arc, and it can be disconcerting trying to piece them together into one cohesive timeline. I can see where slower readers might become frustrated with the novel to the point of putting it down. However the patient will be rewarded with a thoughtful story, which although reaches no concrete conclusion (I can only assume that the sequels provide the &quot;end&quot; of the story) weaves a compelling adventure well worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"You may want to wait to read this book towards the end of your life because there is no better. Oh yeah, and there probably never will be. It's that good.The complex and intricate world created by Frank Herbert will blow your mind with its creativity and uniqueness. I can only think of one other book that exceeds it for the detailed creation of another world's political and social structure, and that is the fantasy novel Maia by Richard Adams (Watership Down).While the entire series is interesting, Dune is by far the best. A rich, compelling and thrilling story of House Atreides and its struggles with House Harkonnen for control of the desert planet Arrakis.

Basically, you're not going to be buying this book if you haven't read Dune, and if you haven't read Dune, then go read it and then read this one.-- JJ Timmins"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Hebert wrote Dune, only to be denied by at least twelve publishers before he connected to a publisher of technical manuals, who took a gamble and published Dune.It was panned and trashed by almost all the critics who initially read it. But the first printing sold out anyway, and the second printing did too. People were picking up on the quality of this amazing book. Hebert starting mail from fans describing their fascination with Dune. Then he got a call from a reporter asking him if he was trying to start a cult. His answer was \\"God no!\\"It's amazing that this book almost never existed, because this is one of the best books ever written. The novel is flawlessly conceived and visualized. The characters are very convincing. I don't think this book was a metaphor for the world situation. The Fremen borrow heavily from the Arab world, but look at the Arab world, much of it is desert. If Europeans who fight in the desert end up using Bedouin techniques and use Arab words like wadi and hammadas, then anyone living and fighting in a desert environment would naturally use the techniques and vocabulary of the world's best desert dwellers, who happen to be Arabs.Dune does an amazing job of combining love, hate, economics, politics, and destiny. There are so many good storylines in this book that an average author could have derived at least five books from it. The concept of the Kwisatz Haderach alone, the ultimate being, is handled expertly here. What would an ultimate being, a living, breathing man who is worshipped as God, be like? How could you make the ultimate being, and how could you prepare the masses for their messiah?Describing this book in a short review is nearly impossible. However, I do have to talk about the spice melange. I'm not sure what psychoactives Herbert ever tried in his life, or even if he ever did anything, but the effects of melange are like the effects of a popular but illegal herb that most Americans have tried at least once, only multiplied a thousand-fold. Anyone who's read the book knows spice is the cornerstone of the Empire, as its mind-expanding powers allow the human mind to manipulate space and time. The spice also has the power to unlock genetic memories, extend longevity, and is used recreationally. In a very subtle and engaging way, Herbert explicitly prescribes the use of mind-expanding drugs. Mua'dib definitely follows William Blakes advice when he says \\"The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom,\\" as Mua'dib completes his development as the Kwizatz Haderach by ingesting a toxic overdose of spice, and then experienes a 'trip' in which the deepest mysteries of life are revealed to him, and he becomes nearly omniscient.The love stories and relationships within this book are as compelling as in it.As far as the bad guys in the book go, the Emperor Shaddam the IV, and his tool the Baron Harkonnen are excellent. The Baron is truly terrifying, and he makes a horrible image. When telling his nephew, Rabban, how to govern Arrakis, he says \\"You must be always hungry, always thirsty. Like me.\\" He then lovingly strokes his rolls of fat. The Baron's sexual tastes and appetite are also sickening, yet they are described implicitly, unlike in the recent \\"prequel\\" books by Herbert's son. At the same time, the Baron never falls into the cliches of most bad guys, and the scene in which Jessica and Paul are able to excape his cluthes is done in a very convincing way. They didn't escape through the palace air shafts or because the Baron designed an overly complex spectacle death for them.All in all, buy this book, since it's most likely the best sci-fi you'll ever have the pleasure of reading.-- JJ Timmins"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Since its publication, Dune has recieved an impressive reputation in the SF community. If you expect this work to be the greatest novel ever, you'll probably just be dissappointed. On the other hand, if you just expect it to be above-average science fiction, you'll get what you're looking far.Dune is set in the far distant future, when a single emperor rules all of humanity and various Houses govern individual planets. The main character is Paul of the House Atreides, which has recently been sent to govern the planet known as Dune. Dune is important for political and economic reasons because it produces a special spice that is necessary for interstellar travel. As others have already stated, Dune is one of the most remarkable and original worlds ever created by an SF author, featuring a parched and hostile landscape populated only by rugged &quot;Freemen&quot; and gigantic sandworms. However, I should also warn that Herbert's explanation about the relationship between the spice, the sandworms, and Dune's climate is a bit cryptic (as a matter of fact, a lot of this book is tough to comprehend), and you may need to reread some passages many times before you understand what is being said.The plotline of the novel is very intricate and suspenseful, and you will want to keep reading to find the outcome of the battle between Paul, the Freemen, and a rival house. However, Herbert cannot right a decent battle scene, and the numerous fight sequences lack any suspense. Also, the strange dreams and premonitions that Paul experiences throughtout the book are poorly written and overdone; most of them should have been left out. Still, Dune is overall an engrossing read, and you won't regret buying it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"&quot;Brilliant&quot; from the editors. &quot;Awesome&quot; from the readers world-wide.Frank Herbert's &quot;Dune&quot; poossesses every element of a bestselling science fiction of all time.

But Frank Herbert has succeeded at this. With flying colors. Not only is Dune Messiah one of the most static and lifeless works I have ever read by any author. There is tons of badly written science fiction out there of the commercial dumb character dumb plot type but at least they breath, they live, even in their patheticness. Dune Messiah is still-born, oxygen deprived.Set twelve years after Dune, Paul Atreides is now Emperor of the galaxy after legions of Fremen troops have conducted a holy jihad in his name. Even though his rule extends over many lightyears, we are still claustrophobically stuck on Arrakis with much the same power struggles. As in Dune, he who controls the spice also brings much danger to themselves because it is so important that others would kill to control it. A conspiracy composed of his greatest enemies arises to overthrow Paul.This book is set up more as \\"literature\\" than science fiction, with there being very little plot but a lot of soul searching and characterization. Unfortunately for us, the characters are not interesting enough to warrant this treatment. The characters are uninteresting because they all seem to be locked into their destiny and can do nothing about it. There is no surpise. No spontaneity. That leads me to another fact. This book is missing an element of adventure. By that, I mean the physical type and also the mental. The jacket says this is the \\"pivotal novel\\" of the Dune series. Well, if it's pivotal, the house has collapsed.This novel is more an epilogue to Dune than a novel in its own right. To me, it should've just been tacked onto the first book. The conspiracy goes on and on and on and everybody talks and talks and talks and nothing ever happens until maybe the last 50 pages or so... It's boring. It's dull. It frightens me from reading the next book... I don't know if I will go on with this series. It doesn't get one star simply because I've read some books worse than this. Not a lot, but some."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Will not pay $17 for a Kindle of a 46 year old book! This is just a trumped marketing scheme.

Finally to top it all off, numerous typographical errors throughout the eBook. More evidence of a poor attempt to simply pull some more money from saps."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I will be honest; I've known about this book's existence for years, but never had any interest in reading it. In fact, I have gone out of my way not to read it because I'm generally not a big fan of straight science fiction. However, when author Sarwat Chadda told me in a tongue in cheek way to read this book else our friendship would be in jeopardy, I decided to give it a try. Generally when I get a challenge like that, I follow through on it.So what were my thoughts on this book upon finishing it? Well it was an interesting read. While I liked various parts of it, other parts were just boring. And yes, perhaps my dislike of straight science fiction clouded my feelings and made it impossible to read with an unbiased eye, but in the long run, the book just simply didn't do much for me.The ideas behind the Bene Gesserit teachings and the Fremen way of life I found immensely intriguing. The Litany against Fear especially caught my eye and left me thinking. In truth it was the thoughtful, intellectual moments in the book that were the most enjoyable for me. Herbert poses some truly deep philosophical ideas within this novel and those ideas held my interest far more than the actual plot of the story. Try as I might, I just didn't care what happened to the characters or the power struggle between political houses. And once Paul became the \\"messiah\\", I lost what little respect I felt towards him.At the same time, I struggled with Herbert's writing style. To me it was dry and extremely confusing. The general pacing of events took far to long and often times I found myself wanting to scream, \\"Get on with it already!\\" Not that that would have done much good. In fact, by the time I finished with the story itself, I chose to completely skip the appendices and glossary. Plus, the inner monologues just killed me. Almost all of Herbert's characters engage in inner contemplation to the point where it was overkill.Yes, Herbert created a world that truly was unique, however the actual story just didn't work for me. I've heard that it has been compared to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, but if I had to choose between the two, I'd go with Tolkien long before I'd ever choose Herbert."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I really can see why this is such a popular science fiction book. There is a great story.... there is a ton of detail.... and a lot of interesting characters. The last 150 pages or so of this book is really good. The ending is a little predictable but still very good. My problem with this book is the writing.Frank Herbet's writing is very difficult to get through. He has multiple names for each character, he uses a lot of made up words that make you go.... huh..... what does that mean? You have to sit back and wonder what the word means by the context/situation it's being used in. That gets annoying real quick for the casual reader. The way he writes down every unspoken thought of every character bogs down some of the dialogue. This isn't a book you can just casually read; if you don't pay REAL close attention to every detail it's easy to get lost with what's going on.I also thought the main character, Paul, was also a little robotic and too perfect (his mom, Lady Jessica is as well); he never makes a mistake in the entire book. That gets old after awhile.The book overall is mostly clean... some violence and death but nothing too graphic and not much, if any, language either.There is a good story here. It just would have been better if it was written by somebody else."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book takes you to the outer reaches of your imagination creating planets galaxies history and religion and politics all in a world of Herbert's creation.

A complete work of art. It must be as relevant now as it ever was.Peace,Jacques Paisner, Author of Albuquerque Blues"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It's been a month since I read this book. I'm not sure what that says about the book overall but take it for what it's worth. I debated for a bit about whether I liked it or not. It was a good enough read, which is not exactly a thrilling testimonial. But it didn't make my pulse quicken with excitement.I thought the first third of the book was very good and it had me eager to read the remainder of the book. But after that, it was slow, methodical, and generally boring. I wasn't waking up every day looking forward to reading it. To me, that's the ultimate non-vote of confidence for a book. A book needs to be calling your name for it to be read. This one was not.In the science fiction genre, I think Assimov has a lot more interesting material out there. Even though this is considered a classic, I don't see it as worthy of such a lofty distinction. I think his aims at religion and philosophy were too grand for what he was capable of.I agree with some people who said the buildup to many scenes was anti-climatic. Many words were poured out for events that would go nowhere. And the events that did generate action were often times written as if the main character was taking out the laundry. There was no fire to many of the characters and scenes.I note 2 things about the Amazon listing of this book. The first is that it's been reviewed 814 times. The second is that it has an average rating of 4.5 stars. At the end of the day, my review isn't going to change many people's minds out there. But I feel obligated to write it anyway.Having said that, proceed as you will. This review isn't going to change many opinions and most will think I'm probably out to lunch with this review. Fair enough, I suppose. Maybe I just didn't see the brilliance on the pages. Or maybe my expectations are higher.If you must, you must.

I thought the plot was good, and the characters were solid, and I was always interested to find out what happened. But the plot never really grabbed me, I never had to keep reading to find out what happened, so it went a litt;e slow for me. But I think that may just be a personal preference more than any shortcoming of the story. I thought it got a little too involved in the ritual and the customs of the Fremen, but what I was more interested in were the characters of Maud'dib and Jessica and the Atriedes and Harkonnen families.I'll probably at leat read the next book to see if I get any more interested, but if I don't I probably won't go any farther with the series. Overall, though, I thought this book was interesting and well-written if not the best thing for me personally."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"\\"We're going to test you to see if you're a human or an animal, Paul,\\" says the nun.\\"Why?\\"\\"Because man relied too much on machines.\\"Wait. What?Oh, I'm paraphrasing, all right... but that's exactly the way it looks. So begins Dune, a disjointed, pretentious, poorly written piece of dreck.I am not certain why or how this book has attained the status it has, so let's look at the pluses and go from there. Is the world of Dune fascinating? Yes. Are you going to find something quite like it anywhere else? No. The planet Arrakis is really cool. The way people live, obviously well thought out and interesting. The sandworms and spice, very unique and attractive. I also happen to love stories dealing with special children with amazing destinies -- I wanted to know about Paul's rise to importance. I'm sure most people find these elements fascinating; likewise, I wanted to read and like this story... badly.Unfortunately, the way this story is written absolutely kills it. I felt like I was reading a first draft half of the time; the rest of the time I was reading and re-reading parts to see what the heck Herbert was trying to imply.I read the first chapter three times, trying to see how an \\"animal\\" was like a \\"machine\\" and how this had anything to do with breeding perfect humans or relying overmuch on machines. This part never made sense and I finally decided to go on, hoping he would clarify later (he doesn't). It also started to make me hate Paul, who was a little brat who seemed to have all the answers. Oh, I am fine with above-average characters... but generally, only the ones with hearts. Think Ender from Ender's Game for the ideal.Which brings me to the characters. They are mostly unlikable -- they are either insufferable know-it-alls or downright arrogant. I found myself only liking a few secondary and tertiary characters for the most part -- Duke Atreides, Thufir Hawat, Duncan Idaho, and Gurney Halleck, for example. Jessica, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother, all the Harkonnens, and (most especially) Paul and Kynes made me want to punt kittens. (As an added note, it's hilarious to see this host of alien names and two major characters named Paul and Jessica.)The prose is awkward at best and downright unreadable and purple at worst. It's all tell and no show; Herbert is constantly showing us the characters' thoughts. Generally, this is fine with me... except those thoughts end up becoming the only way you can really understand what's going on. In short, their thoughts are crutches, and the story never speaks for itself. Interspersed within are supposed \\"wise sayings\\" and unintentionally humorous \\"philosophical nuggets\\" and some really awful poetry. Yuck.Herbert's dialogue was past poor -- a stilted, disjointed mess. Good dialogue fits together like the rungs on a ladder; Dune's dialogue is the ladder from hell, with rungs completely missing or spaced too far apart. It often seems to shift from subject to subject at random and has little or no connection to what previous speakers said. For example: Yueh speaks to Jessica for a paragraph about the wonders of spice. Then Jessica breaks in and says, \\"I think our house should go renegade.\\" Huh? On the positive side, at least the dialogue improves as the book goes on. It doesn't improve much, mind you, but at least you won't be frustrated out of your mind.Even worse, and most certainly the nail in the coffin for me, Herbert's conclusions often made no sense at all. In one scene, Duke Atreides gives his men a big plan. \\"Yeah!\\" I thought. \\"Go Atreides!\\" But the men don't like the plan for some reason. Paul (super-wise little git that he is) is over thinking in the corner how much his father is bombing. \\"But what's wrong with the plan?!\\" I said to the book. The book refused to tell me. As this was its job, I was rather irritated with it.\\"Then read the appendix,\\" you might say. The appendix! Am I reading a fun sci-fi adventure or an encyclopedia? In fact, the fact this book HAS an appendix (and a glossary, for that matter) is a major \\"con\\" for me. It is not a sign of depth, it is a sign that Herbert failed at writing. What it looks like is that he could not relate background and history for his story in the actual \\"meat\\" of the writing like every other competent writer.\\"So read between the lines,\\" you may say. Oh, easy for you to say. If you are a Dune fan who lives and breathes Dune lore, you would know what's going on because you have been immersed in it. However, if you're a new reader like me, good freaking luck. Reading between the lines is an impossible task. You just can't do it. Characters are often making illogical decisions or basing their knowledge on some as-yet undefined process that Herbert apparently expects you to read from his mind. Even better, as you're reading and making conclusions from people's actions and words, suddenly Herbert writes what they're thinking and you realize your conclusions are absolutely wrong.Which brings me to yet another problem -- sometimes, you're waiting and waiting for Herbert to explain some alien process, kind of people, world, or person, and he chooses to describe it... with another undescribed facet of his universe! Oh, the agony!The result is that you must rely on what everyone tells you... and that's just maddening, because you end up becoming a passive reader. It's like coming up against a brick wall over and over, and there's some ocean of meaning on the other side. You can't find a key to open the way into this meaning, though, because the mean trick is that the key is tied up in ol' Herbert's head, and there's no getting to it. You can only get a superficial, hazy feeling for every element of this universe.I honestly don't know why this book is supposed to be the best sci-fi book ever written; I can't fathom it. It reads like it was written by a precocious high school student at best. Maybe someone can enlighten me. In any case, it's a frustrating read... very frustrating.It's too bad that a better writer couldn't have thought of this great idea and made this book sing."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"As an avid fan of the fantasy/sci-fi genre, I had often been told about the sheer brilliance of Frank Herbert's classic novel \\"Dune.\\" I finally read it, and was surprised by how much of a let-down it was. While I can understand why it was so popular THEN, when the genre was new, it doesn't quite have the appeal NOW. The biblical/religious allegory in it was incredibly obvious, the writing was unbearably slow, and there were things that didn't quite work out in a satisfactory way. Throughout the whole book, the main character keeps harping on this \\"terrible purpose\\" he has, this thing that he's dreading, but NOTHING ever comes of it! It's this tension that keeps building up but never comes to fruition, and that always really annoys me.I didn't like the little blurbs from the books written by the princess, either. They didn't serve any real purpose, other than to introduce a character we really never see. They had nothing to do with the plot.On the good side, I did like the way Herbert defined his characters so well --- with the exception of our main hero with his undefined \\"terrible purpose\\". Most of the characters were well thought-out and believable. As is typical in real life, the characters were not just black-and-white, pure evil and pure good. Good characters made bad decisions and faced rock-and-hard-place choices. And bad characters had noble characteristics and even had noble --- if often misguided --- intentions which fired their eventual actions.In spite of its interesting aspects, however, I am still surprised that Dune can still hold its own against the superior science-fiction we can now pick up on our bookstore shelves."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I had several close friends recommend Dune to me, all proclaiming how amazing it was as a novel, only to hear later that not one of them finished it for the same reason: \\"it was kinda boring.\\" If you're asking yourself why someone would praise and recommend a book that they find to be boring then you're just as mystified as I am. I have yet to meet anyone who has read Dune who liked it or ever finished it.The books major problem is it has too many minor characters and very poor character development. The lead character, Paul, is a good example, as he has no personality, or any interesting qualities whatsoever. Sadly, all the characters are this way.I did finish this book, after forcing myself to keep reading for six months, and I will say that it eventually does get more interesting, but only in the last two chapters."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is my favourite sci-fi book of all time.

There is no other book that has ever been written that even comes close to Dune.Dune makes you think. It opens your eyes. All the reality and pain of today (and yesterday) is translated into a unique and fantastic world...possibly the future, possibly not.The breadth of Dune is enormous. Every little detail about this world is there, if you look for it. It encompasses everything from popular religious ideas to the abuse of drugs and power (&quot;Power corrupts the weak, but absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot;). Frank Herbert created a masterpiece that entraps the reader and makes him think that all these wonderful places exist - the realism is just incredible - his imagination is just unmatched.While there are a few slow-feeling moments in a few of the sequels (I challenge you to do better) there are underlying messages that negate the possibility of editing, and if you re-read that part that seems slow the realization of the great story beneath will unfold. Dune is addicting, and has caused quite a few sleepless nights, just because I couldn't put it down.I believe that one of the most beautiful parts of Dune is the immense history that Frank Herbert gives it. Each chapter is preceeded by a quote from some foreign source. Not many are from the actual books (I searched for many of them), but all have to do with something somewhere in the series. These books are so well planned that the first book has quotes from someone who does not even exist until the third in the series!Dune is meant to be a lesson to us all. He wanted to tell us that conservation of natural resources is a must. He also wanted us to think about what we do before we do it. So many catastrophes are begun because no one thought about the consequences beforehand. Religions should not be followed blindly - not that you shouldn't believe, just that you should KNOW what that religion is a! ll about.Frank Herbert saw a vision, and his vision was superb. This is the best book, Sci-Fi or otherwise, ever written. The series has re-inforced my beliefs and given me something solid to stand upon. Do not read just one book just one time, and most of all, think about what the book is really saying. Chances are it is saying more than you think"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"No more needs to be said about the Dune Chronicles - the continuous string of 10's on this ratings page are enough.

On the top of the plot, there is the drama of a galatic struggle fighting over Sprice, a precious commodity only found on Dune. Intertwined in this are themes on politics, love, religeon, addiction and family values. (One could say the scope is almost biblical in it's breadth) Similar to Tolkein, you are still left feeling that there is much unsaid. Perhaps this depth is what marks Dune as a masterpiece instead of escapist fiction.If you've seen the movie, you will get much more out of the written form than you did in the movie theater. There's only so much than can be displayed in a few hours. The Hollywood vision will contain plot spoilers, but really misses much of what is going on underneath. (Dune is about much more than action and a fight over a scarce resource)When I purchased the book, I really didn't know what I was getting myself into. I was doing a lot of flying, and preferred thick books - 1000+ pages or more were best. I was most pleasantly surprised at the experience these pages provided. Much more than just filler for several long plane trips. Also a novel where it isn't enough to just \\"seem the movie\\""},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune took Herbert a long time to write and it shows in the craftsmanship. I love the vastness of the universe he's created. Dune even though it is a desert planet is still complex in its descriptions and native peoples. My favorite character continues to be Duncan Idaho even though he's not one of the main characters."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Herbert, in a way that so few else have, has crafted a new world full of life and detail. mMore than just a work of science fistion, Dune articulates several resonating stories of humanity intertwined in a single (though complex) plot. The writting is superb and provides a beautiful portrait of Dune and it's characters. Everyone should at least try to read this book, though I understand it may not be for everyone given it's themes and subject matter."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I read this book because it had on its cover, sci fi's supreme masterpiece. I however am a really harsh critics of both books and movies, so i had to read it to prove to myself that it wasn't. I hate sci fi, but this book had me up all night. The good thing was, it didn't seem sci fi, which has its robots, talking computers, light travel, and vulcan grips. it seemed more like an action/intrigue filled history book. the author makes the reader believe that even the most absurd notions are historical fact. If you like history, and some action, read this book, i look forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"On the surface, Dune seems to be a science fiction novel. However it is truly about the political games played out by various factions. Even the religions are run by political motives.This book has so many layers and beautiful imagery."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is possibly the best science fiction novel ever written. Most importantly, the story is engrossing; it's a page turner, a book that you stay up reading into the wee hours. The characters are well developed, and the future worlds created are entirely believable. I've worked in politics and the political machinations in Dune ring so very true. Many of the insights into human philosophy and psychology are extraordinary; importantly they occur in the course of the story, and don't slow the pace of the story - they're not laboured. I first read Dune when I was about 14 and last read it when I was 36, and I read it 2 or 3 times in the intervening years. These days I find much science fiction trite and tedious, but Dune continues to entertain and intrigue me.The first 3 books in the now over-extended series are by far the best."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It's hard to follow up a novel so superb, so flawless, so damn good as Frank Herbert's classic sci-fi epic DUNE. But in my opinion, Herbert succeeded in writing an excellent sequel - DUNE MESSIAH. DUNE MESSIAH is actually more of a continuation than a sequel, picking up 12 years after the original novel. Emperor Paul Atreides rules over Arrakis - and the universe, for that matter - with an iron fist. Known as Muad'dib to his many worshippers, Paul is disgusted with himself and his reign as emperor. Religious groups commit violence in his name, worshipping him without a concept of what he is (or isn't) capable of. Meanwhile, a secret group plots his downfall ... the first step of which involves the resurrection of one of Paul's most beloved friends - Duncan Idaho.DUNE MESSIAH focuses a little more on the fantastic and a little less on the political, unlike its predecessor. This is hardly a bad thing - it makes the novel more interesting. DUNE MESSIAH is also darker, more dramatic, more romantic, and more sexual. It's filled with intriguing twists and is rarely - if ever - predictable. It's a far more complex novel than DUNE, and all the more fun for it. While reading it, I never once thought, \\"This is sure ain't DUNE.\\" True, DUNE MESSIAH isn't DUNE - and, in a wise move by Frank Herbert, it never tries to be.DUNE MESSIAH is an outstanding continuation of what I believe to be the greatest sci-fi series ever written. It's complexity is intriguing, while its differences from DUNE make it seem entirely fresh and new. Though many consider DUNE MESSIAH to be a lesser novel than DUNE, I found it to be very nearly as good as its predecessor. I commend Mr. Herbert on writing an excellent continuation of a magnificent epic."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is without a doubt my favorite novel. On this, his single greatest achievement, Frank Herbert weaves an incredible plot filled with the best aspects of science fiction, political intrigue, religious/philosophical exploration, and ecology to create one of the most dynamic and fascinating worlds in literary history. In my experience, the only world so richly imaginative and well described is Tolkiens Middle Earth from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".This is the story of Paul Muad'Dib Atreides, a young noble born into a bitter feud between warring great houses, and the culmination of generations of breeding to produce a super-being, the Kwisatz Haderach. At the center of the story is the desert planet of Arrakis, harsh and unyielding, it is the only source in the galaxy of the precious melange as well as the home of the Fremen . . . and of course, the magnificent worms.Herbert combs the depths of psychology and philosophy like no other author before him. He brings into question the as yet untapped vastness of human potential, while always exploring what exactly it means to be human. This mixture of imagination and storytelling is a feast for the mind, and each reading will provide further insight into Herbert's brilliance."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When I picked up Dune I couldn't put it down. The world Herbet has created is just so immersive and so grand that one cannot help but be pulled in. Even if you are not a fan of Sci-Fi you will most likely enjoy this book. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a great book, the problem however is with this edition. There are several obvious spelling errors, and at least twice i've seen whole lines repeated twice in a row. Try a different editon."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Great book! Great story and author. If you played the Dune game series, this book is a must have."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Engaging to the point where it is hard to stop reading, with wife already asleep on your side while you are trying to keep on reading in silence!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Read Dune originally in 1972 or so, was mesmerized by it's concept, depth, and also the action. Read Dune Messiah sometime later..and was bored: none of the sweeping action, and was mostly talk. Was too young to appreciate it. Reread Dune again recently, what a classic. Am now halfway through Dune Messiah. As a older somewhat mature individual I can now understand the personal complexities explored in depth by this book. It is to be slowly savored and a source of much consideration. Herbert was an intelligent and wise person, who could craft an exceptional story to explore themes and also delight our yearning for a good yarn. Dune's complexity elevates itself to a myth-like status. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert's remarkable achievement stands the test of time. The 40th anniversary edition of his classic scifi novel Dune is still the compelling read that the book has been ever since its creation. Not easy to get into because of Herbert's short scenes and arcane and esoteric terminology, the story soon gets hold of the reader, even so, and refuses to let go. Try it, and you'll see."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune was so hard for me to get into. The first hundred pages dragged on and I often thought of just giving up on the book completely. Luckily I'm stubborn and kept with it because once I got into it, I really got into it. The last 400 pages flew and I began to understand why Dune is one of the most beloved science fiction classics."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"As an avid reader since childhood, I've been a temporary resident of diverse worlds, but few are as memorable as Arrakis. The world Herbert created is full of opposed viewpoints, the water rich seat of government and the desolate sands or the tribal wildness of the Fremen compared to the Old World grandeur of the ruling Houses.Herbert weaves together religion, technology, and politics among other things into an entirely original tapestry that still resonates with the real world. I first read this book as a 12 year old, and although I couldn't understand a lot of it, I was still taken in, and I've read it at least once a year since. And everytime, I notice something new, or understand something that semeed too convoluted before.That being said, it is a book that should be read with an open mind and a avid curiousity, as there is a lot to learn about how the world works. There are some shortcomings, especially dialouge, which does end up being unwieldy at times. But Herbert also uses it to great effect at time also, managing to convey the verbal fencing the character go through in their encounters. I would also advise anyone considering reading to put aside for a moment all the tie ins and sequels and form your opinion of the franchise on the book that started it. After you read Dune, then form your opinion. I'm not particularly a fan of the movies and sequels, but many are, and they definately would be better enjoyed after reading this book first. I have, and will continue to recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Well I really liked the novel. I was transformed into a fan after watching the movie. However the novel is far more complex and satisfying. The interplay of religion and politics was very clearly and cleverly dealt with. Paul's inner turmoil of starting something so big that he would not be able to control it himself mirrors our present day societies. I really want to talk more but it would be giving out too much. Read it and have a blast..."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It's been said - THE sentinel work by one of the great masters of science fiction, and will be forever an enduring classic, of any genre. It's unfortunate it was so abused by Hollywood, but perhaps there really will be a fitting movie made someday....And yes, forget the sequels...."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Quite possibly the greatest book I've ever read! I absolutely loved it and can't get enough of Dune now. I've already ripped through Dune Messiah (which I enjoyed just as much) and I'm half way through Children of Dune. I'm loving Dune...."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A definite worthy successor to Dune, Dune Messiah could be seen as part of the original Dune story, just as Heretics and Chapterhouse go together. In Dune, we saw Paul's struggle to learn and survive and eventually take over Arrakis. Dume Messiah concentrates on the consequences of Paul's Jihad and serves as a warning to hero-worship. A wonderful book by a talented author. Bravo, Mr. Herbert!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a deep, interesting, detailed, exciting, thought-provoking book which is manditory for all SF enthusiasts. Herbert elegantly constructs and reveals a unique universe filled with political intrigue, religious manipulation, philosophy, and ecological realism (not environmentalism)."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Its hard to imagine that this book was written in the 60s. Dune's technology, from the stillsuits which retain body moisture in the desert to the terraforming effort, was far ahead of its time. Dune is a blend of both science fiction and politics. It is a must read and not just for the sci-fi aficiando."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"An incredible book. I have approximately 50 pages left to read and I have no qualms about saying this is one of the best books I have ever read. It's that simple.A story of a man becoming. Poor Paul didn't really want to go to Arrakis but not yet having the power of prescience how could he know what kind of man or more accurately what kind of messiah he would become.This is a story of a man realizing his potential. This is a story of religion. This is a story of humanity's need for religion. This is a story of humanity's adaptiveness.The world Herbert creates is incredibly detailed. It really seems like you are on Arrakis. The water, or rather moisture, conservation techniques at first seem so outlandish, then become commonplace as begin you think of yourself as a Fremen living in the deep desert.Several times, while reading this book, I would stop to quench the thirst that results from the land of Arrakis as it is portrayed. This is not a joke. ! Walking outside to get in my car after a few chapters and I found myself stepping without rhythm. Read the book and you'll understand that.What else can I say? It's trite, I know, but this is an EPIC. I can't even begin to imagine how the rest of the series will represent itself. :) I simply cannot wait."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Between the power of this book and the your soul's quest, enlightenment is sure to come. Frank Herbert successfully creates a whole new universe, complete with worlds, cultures, religions, and languages. Following Muad'dib is a journey of the heart, body, and mind as one tastes new civilizations as ancient as time itself. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone as it has become to be my favourite book of all time."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Wonderful characters and worlds. Although it has probably been 15 years since I read it, I still vividly recall the scenes I imagined as I read and became immersed in Frank Herbert's world. Reading the reviews here makes me want to read the book again.( I can't believe the number of people who read the book and still liked the movie. The movie is awful, substituting flash in place of character and plot development as attempts at sci-fi classics often do. I can just picture the studio executive shouting, &quot;Where are the Rayguns? It can't be Sci-fi if it doesn't have rayguns! How can we get kids into the theater without light-sabers or rayguns? It says here Paul can use his voice as a weapon. Make it a voice raygun! Drop the religious stuff. We don't want to offend anybody...And get me some kind of Raygun!&quot;"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This whole series, starting with Dune, is an influence and inspiration to philosophy, art, and sf writing. Through an idealistic vision of an entirely plausible universe, Herbert lays down the profound truths over and over again, while bombarding the reader with grandiose schemes and plots (a feint within a feint within a feint). I particularly like the insight into governmental 'power theories' and controlling a populace through 'proper' leadership. It will always be a timely piece of literature. It will give the reader a higher awareness and perspective (no melange needed!) on the governments/religions of the world, past and present."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book makes you thristy and after reading it you don't want to waste a drop of water. One of the best science fictions books I've read in a long time. If you saw the movie, GET THE BOOK! Much better. Herbert delivers. His knowledge of politics and science is masterfully shown. A must read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Although I wholeheartedley agree with most of the reviews I think that to dismiss the sequels out of hand is a mistake. &quot;Heretics&quot; is the best of the sequels because it introduced new characters and events whilst still leaving you with Duncan Idaho as the connection to that time so long ago when his master (Paul) was still alive. Also it has the Bashar Mile Teg who is one of my favourite characters in any sci-fi story.As to &quot;Dune&quot; itself, it has just about everything a reader could ever want in a book including the guide/glossary at the back which I have not seen in any other book .Please do not judge the book by the film, although Herbert was consulted during the making of the film and was happy with the end result, I feel that fans of the book were quite correct in their criticism of it. For me it created more questions than it answered. Give the book a chance, you will not be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I've never understood why so many people thought this novel (and the movie adaptation) were hard to follow; the base story is very simple. This is a very good read, and it's one of the most detailed, &quot;real&quot; and accessible SF universes ever conceived."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A protean achievement of the highest order. Not only one of the greatest science fiction stories ever written but a novel destined to be considered one of mankinds greatest literary achievements. It is not hyperbole to compare &quot;Dune&quot; to the greatest works of any writer in history, including Shakespeare. Herbert breathes life into his characters and their surroundings making them vivid and unforgettable, effortlessly transporting the reader into another world. You will feel the hot sand beneath your feet and see the majesty of the sand worms as you read the pages of this work of genius."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If by fast-paced you mean a Star Trek novel you can read in a couple of hours, no this isn't fast-paced. This is rich, challenging stuff, but you'll remember it for a long long time (and you'll be able to watch the David Lynch movie and know what the hell is going on)."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book was awesome! It kept me compelled from the moment I started reading it. At first I was not inspired to read this book at all. I saw the movie with Sting which was really boring and not moving at all. Therefore it colored my pereception of the book. HOWEVER, this book is tremendous. It has compelling characters, a great story line and the world created is rich, alive and believable. I was hooked until the end. At then I ran out to get &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have now decided only to do book reviews. I have now 50 reviews, and I don't like at least 30 of them. Now, I will only do book reviews.Anyway, I finished Dune in about 6 days. Wow, this book is a astounishing story about Paul Mua'dib Atriedies, who brings down the Harkonennes and becomes the greatest Duke of Atriedies of all time.Good job keeping the story together. It got a little confusing near the end of book 2, but I managed to know what was happening. I saw the Mini-series before the book, so I'm not that fond with it. I think the Mini-series made up some parts to keep the viewer intrested. Just a little warning before you see the mini-series.The book is just great, and the 1984 movie is just terrible. I can't believe I watched it! My favorite charecter in the book were Stilgar and the Fremen.

The Harkonnens don't want to give up their privilege so they launch a secret attack with the emperor against the Atreides. Despite this attempt the young Paul Atreides manages to escape to the Fremin (the Fremin are a desert people) with his mother.

When I got done reading Dune it made me want to go read all his other books. I recomend you read Frank Herberts Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"In my science fiction/fantasy class, we read Dune. I haven't ever really taken the time to read SF books. That is the main reason i took the class. Of the very few Science Fiction books I have read, I would have to say that Dune is the best. It is very hard to believe that an author can keep himself inline, with such a complicated plot. This book in my opinion is very good, and it really keeps you interested and is full of action that keeps your attention. This is a very good book, and I recommend it everyone. Whether or not you enjoy SF books."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I thought that the book Dune was a great science fiction book. The book had many new ideas to add to science fiction. I thought that the book was great because it had so much information. You have to be fairly intellegent to understand this book. The book was really deep in explaining the whole world of Arakis. The characters were used well in so that you could understand each of their personalitys."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The Book Dune, was in my opinion a very detailled book. It made you think about what the world could be like in a few million years. Dune was a very good book and it had lots of good detail. The book was written very throughly and it made me think about space for some reason. You get to witness the destruction of a city and then they make a new world for their people to live in."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"this book is an exelant book it has twist and turns that are unexpected. The auther is cunning and layers and layers of diffrent plots aginst each other. The worst thing about the book it is a slow read becuase you are getting some much differnt twist and turns in just one page."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert's amazing Dune Chronicles continue here in the second book of the epic series, Dune Messiah. Dune was one of the best, if the not greatest, science-fiction book I have ever read, and for good reasons. Dune had an incredible sense of scope, tasteful dialogue, engrossing action sequences, and a powerful plot of leadership under strain. After reading such a powerful novel, I had extremely high expectations for Dune Messiah. Although most parts of this book are as good, if not better than that in the original (espescially character development), some parts fell a bit short of what I had hoped for. For example, most of this book concentrates on a scheme to overthrow Emperor Maud'dib and the Emperor's dark vision that he has resigned himself into believing. With the impressive amount of detail given to character development, one could only agree that some other parts of what made Dune so great, particularly Dune Messiah's lack of scope in comparison to its predecessor. Also, this book spent a bit too much time focusing on Maud'dib's religion. The people worshiping Alia (Paul's sister) sometimes got downright nauseating. Also, Lady Jessica barely gets much more than a brief cameo in this novel.All in all, Dune Messiah is a worthy successor to Dune, but falls just short of Science Fiction's Supreme Masterpiece's overall excellence."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a masterpiece in itself, not even looking at the sequels you still get introduced into a very rich and detailed world. The book starts a bit slow but by the end your thirsty for more, luckily there is. Hard to compare to anything else, for its in a league of its own."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"For one reason or another, I put off reading this \\"classic\\" for years. What can I say? If you haven't read it... read it. It's wonderful storytelling. The tale incorporates recognizable political and religious references without being trapped in specifics of previous or current historical events. A grand tour indeed."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"See my other reviews to what is the best. Don't get me wrong, this one is second out of hundreds and possibly thousands of sci-fi books that I've read.Frank Herbert manages to write an unbelievably cool story, creating the most interesting characters that I've ever read about in fiction. He, even, manages to carry on the story, writing excellent follow ups (books 2 and 3 OK, but 4 and 5 are just as solid as this one).The book starts out with a planet swap between two royal families, the Atreides and the Harkonnens. The swap turns out to be a double cross, with the emprorer in cahoots with the Baron Harkonnen (the emporer thinks House Atreides is too powerful). All the Atreides gets wiped out, with the exception of Paul, Duke Atreides son, and the Duke's widow, Lady Jessica.The Atreides took over Arrakis (Dune), a desert planet that is the only place in the universe where the spice exists, making it the most important planet. No one knows too much about the spice since Dune is such a hostile planet, but it is harvested whenever possible.Lady Jessica and Paul escape into the deep desert and are thought dead, but the Fremen, Dune natives, rescue them. They find that the Fremens have harnessed the power of the spice and know its secret (how it's created). The drug works as a geriatric drug making a person live longer and if used properly produces serious psychologic enhancements.Lady Jessica becomes a high priestess among the Fremens due the change wrought by the spice. For Paul, the spice changes him into a near god. After two years of exile, he becomes the undisputed leader of the Fremens and marches on the Harkonnens and the rest of the universe with the formidable Fremen army.Highly recommend this book to any reader, even those not interested in science fiction."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is every bit as good as the first one and, for the life in me, I have absolutely no idea as to why there is less of a fanbase for this book. Every book in the Dune series is absolutely amazing and if people liked Dune so much then why don't they bother to read anything more that the author has supplied?"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The book Dune, by Frank Herbert kept my interest throughout the 489 pages. Although the book was in times very confusing to me mainly because of all of the new words and things that Herbert created. I did though like the story and enjoyed reading the book. I got attached to many characters but mostly enjoyed reading about Paul; the main character, which is expected, but I also loathed more than I liked. I thought that the bad guy Baron Harkonnen was a very evil, somewhat pathetic man in some ways but I also did not like some of the good characters. I did not like Paul's mother Jessica mainly because I disliked the Bene Gesserit who are a group of women that think that they control everything. When I read a book I do not like certain people or groups of people that try to control everything. Even with these things that bother me I thought that the book was very entertaining and well written. How Frank Herbert thought of this incredible world amazes me. He created many characters with different personalities and goals. The world of Dune is very well thought up and I got a very clear picture of it, going beyond seeing a giant desert. The fact that Herbert can think of a series of planets that have very detailed descriptions, and then create a whole new civilization on each one, especially one as complex as the Fremen, is incredible. The others are made to seem as a futuristic us, but the Fremen are completely different. They are what we would become if we were trapped in the desert, and I think they are really cool. Since most events in this novel are somewhat difficult to comprehend, I would say this is not a book for children under thirteen. For everyone else who has an imagination and enjoys reading a good science fiction, I would definitely recommend this book, it was one of the better books I have read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book and the first three Foundations are the zenith of science fiction. But Dune is more. I've never read a book that delves so deeply into the psychological and inner thoughts of the main characters. Simply put, this book creates a new universe, a new metaphysical reality that no other book can touch. I recommend that you read this book; not once, but over and over again. The whole series allows you to feel the immensity of both the universe and the human mind. Please read this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"That all sci-fi readers have struggled to meet with his classic tale of Arrakis. Don't read this book unless you're willing to read the others, because it's addictive!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"i must admit that i started to read Dune on three seperate occassions before i was able to finish it completely. its very hard to get through and for most &quot;star wars&quot; type sci-fi fans it will be a chore. but once you've gotten through some of the more drawn out sections you'll be surprised at what you've just read. Dune is one of the most elaborate and realistically written books ever produced in science fiction. if you were to take out all of the science fiction portions you would still be left with a very real political intrigue story. its easy to relate the spice struggle to our present war concerns over oil, but sadly i find this aspect the hardest part to get through. the politics of it may begin to bore you and Herbert at times is rather long winded when explaining certain points. this is one of many hurdles to jump but once you get over them you'll be much better off for having read it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If you love stories full of political controversy, treachery, love, action, and survival, you will love this book. It is the story of a Great House, House Atreides, forced to move to rule a desert planet where the native people have to wear suits to reclaim the body's moisture, and are shocked to hear of falling water from the sky and the such. A large group of the natives are Fremen, people who live in the deep desert whose population and culture is unknown to the Imperium. The rival House, House Harkonnen, sets up a betrayal by the Atreides doctor and takes over the planet. The Duke's son and concubine escape to live with the Fremen in the deep deseert, waiting for a chance to reclaim their planet.I could find absolutely nothing wrong with this book. I am interested to see how the movies do it, since there are so many things in this book that can't be conveyed in images. You must read this book!!!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is one of the finest works of science fiction ever crafted, containing some of the most memorable phrases ever invented. I will leave it to the reader to enjoy the litany that includes the famous phrase, &quot;Fear is the Mind Killer.&quot;Herbert successfully weaves an epic tale of rebellion and religion. It is the tale of a man who becomes a messiah, and discovers many things about himself, the Empire he lives in, and the world of Dune.Herbert paints a world in which man can travel between stars, yet no longer uses computers; a place where fencing skills are often more useful than energy weapons; a land of soldiers, assassins, prophets, mystics, nobles, monsters. It is about love, passion, resistance--and the effect that the appearance of a messiah has on a culture.Sadly, much of Herbert's sequels don't live up to this first book. However, it is an entirely satisfying epic in its own right--if you never read the other books, this one will still live on in your memory forever."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I read the whole Dune series I thought this was the weakest. It was still a good novel, but nothing compared to Dune, God Emperor, or Chapterhouse. If you want to get the full impact of the series, read it. But if you are just looking for a good book skip this one"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When I first read DUNE in Russian I thought it was a very unusual book. But when I managed to get it in English it was absolutely new. I thought (by the title and the setting) that it'll be a simple description of the Future (as I judged by the DUNE film), but it was the description of our reality, the demonstration of the things that might happen (and do happen nowadays) in Arabic countries where religion influences TOO much the thoughts of people."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Thank you, Frank Herbert. Thank you, thank you, thank you.I first attempted to read DUNE when I was 13. I didn't understand it. I was bored by it. I decided all the hype around it was undeserved, and I cast it off.The more fool, me. This is without doubt the best sci-fi book ever written, and perhaps the best book, period. It's changed the way I look at everything. When I was 17, I just decided to pick it up again for no reason--and I was in love. I've never been the same since. Paul, Jessica, Stilgar, Alia, even old Baron Harkonnen--the characters all found their way into my mind and heart. DUNE is a novel of incredible scope and power, ranging from musings on ecological themes to an exploration of the messianic desire that has always pervaded society. The time Herbert must have invested to research and create such a detailed universe took my breath away. I was riveted from the Introduction all the way through the Appendices. I'm still finishing the rest of the series, and while none of the other books have left the same impression on me, they are excellent books--especially CHILDREN OF DUNE. I advise all fans of great literature to pick up this book at once; you'll never really put it down."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When I started off reading Dune 3-4 years ago, I gave up about 200 pages in just because it seemed too complex to me at the time. Years later, I came back to it again because the summertime is quite boring with no job/school.Suffice to say, not only did I understand what was going on a lot better, I actually loved the book in the end.Dune is set on a planet known as Arrakis, which happens to be the gem of the interstellar empire that House Atreides and Harkonnen are in. As it turns out, Arrakis is the sole source of spice/melange that is vital for traveling the galaxy as it helps to sharpen psychic powers and vision for pilots.Recently, the control of Arrakis has been shifted from House Harkonnen to House Atreides. House Harkonnen does not want to give up its source of wealth and power quietly and plots to make matters very turbulent for House Atreides on Arrakis.The Baron, head of House Harkonnen, plots to rid Arrakis of the Atreides anyway he can and eventually sends the young heir to the throne (Paul) into the hostile desert sands. Paul meets the Fremen (sand-people) during his time in the deserts and ends up, no thanks to the Baron, surviving and goes about biding his time until he can somehow convince these people to fight with him to get his rightful throne back on Arrakis.A sub-plot to this book is the fact that Paul Atreides is much more than a mere overthrown duke. He is the product of a plan by the Bene Gesserits, a class of humans highly trained in the psychic arts, to breed one of their own that can see into depths of the future and mind far better than any of their typically female members can.This book was a real joy to read. Sometimes it was tough getting bogged down in all of the characters and places, etc. However, it was not as difficult to read the second time around and I thoroughly look forward to the reading of the second installment in Dune Messiah."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"You can read Dune as both a philosophical novel about the natures of Messianic dreams and as an adventure story with a large dose of Machiavellian machination thrown in for good measure. When I was in high school, I read Dune as an adventure. Later on, I appreciated it for wrestling with these questions of social change, messianic beliefs and religious tyranny as an antidote for corruption.With Dune Messiah, you have no such luxury. The adventure narrative is gone from this book (as it disappears from most of the books in the series - especially God Emperor that consists of 400 pages of a big worm talking and 4 pages of action.) and the conspiracies have some good points, but the conspirators are going up against Paul Atreides who KNOWS what's happening before it happens.What you have instead is a narrative of doubt. Paul Atreides is the Kwitzach Haderech, the messiah, the Maudi. So now what? Instead of the \\"dancing in the rain storm to Toto\\" scene from the Lynch movie, we have a world at odds with itself. The old imperial armies are beaten. The Fremen have obtained the resources and the power to export their religious fanaticism to the rest of the world. Water has become less scarce on Dune and many of the water sellers must change. Paul must deal with plots from within and without and mostly he's got to wrestle with the knowledge that his crusade has exacted a terrible price. At the heart of the book is a conversation in which Paul Atreides compares himself to Hitler and Genghis Khan and calls them amateurs in comparison to him. The doubts that he wrestled with in the first book come out and while he knows that he followed the path laid out for him and knows the alternatives, he cannot shut his eyes to the horrors of his path.This is a much deeper and more philosophical book than science fiction normally handles. The characters are well drawn and the questions it raises rival Dostoyevsky for resonance. If you want the Dune adventure, read the prequels (which I do like), but if you want the essence of the Dune series, read this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I can't help but think about the vast work J.R.R. Tolkien put into creating the world of LoTR when I read this book. Like Tolkien, Herbert's world, or rather universes, come from a deeply considered and rich background history that is only suggested at in Dune. Herbert doesn't fall into the trap of spending pages explaining how the Space Guild, Bene Geserit breeding program, and the empire itself affected what is going on in the book at hand. He just leaves facts here and there for the reader to figure out, much as the primary character of Paul does.Honestly, I didn't read the book until after the David Lynch movie, which apparently most people didn't understand but made perfect sense to me. I read Dune: Messiah and then lost momentum halfway through children of Dune, where genetic memory gets so intertwined you need a scorecard and a psychologist on hand. Having watched part of Sci-Fi Channels two Dune miniseries and the release of Lynch's uber-Dune inspired me to begin reading the series again.What can you say about a 14-year-old Duke's son who is potentially a christlike figure in two separate prophecies, particularly when the end means of both prophecies are polar opposites? Unlike the various movies portraying Paul as an adult, the fact that he is a child when his father is killed by treachery arranged by not only their enemy house but by the emperor himself.Being taught the ways of his Bene Geserit mother, not to mention a Mentat (think of a human computer) training, basic warfare, and a new type of warfare his father and advisors were creating; Paul has a great deal of survival skills, enough to not only save himself but his pregnant mother. He wins his way into the Fremen society with a fight to the death that he doesn't want to participate in. In winning the fight, he inherits the dead man's wife, children, and water. His mother earns her way in by becoming a reverend mother to the Fremen, at the cost of her daughter, Alia, being born premature and all knowing.And as I said, this is just when Paul, now Maub-dib, is 14, so you can imagine what sort of a man he becomes. I'll stop here to avoid spoilers.I'd give this a 4 1/2 stars, simply because you really have to want to read the book at times. The politics are rampant and therefore there are times you feel like you are watching an election year. It's worth slugging through it, though, and despite yourself you will learn things rather than reading for escapism. There are universal truths within it that can apply to any person at anytime."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have been watching the TV mini-series on this for some time, and decided to go back to the novel to re-visit my perceptions and interpretation. It is so strange to picture my younger self reading this with such awe and fascination to the person of today. My love for this was strong and unchanged.All I can say is that this is one of the most dense and deliciously well written scifi novels that I have ever read. From virtually any standpoint, the reader can ponder science (ecology, genetic evolution, anthropology), politics (the organization of the great houses and empire, the Bene Gesserit, the jihad), religion, and even human destiny (collective and individual). Indeed, the book is like a handbook of academic disciplines that culminated in the 20C.This adds up to a fecundity of the story as an adventure of the imagination that is unparalelled in scifi and that pushes this into the realm of a great novel of any genre. Even the characters are wonderfully full-lived and subtle. Look at the evolution of Paul and his cryptic utterances late in the book. Of course, you have history and luck, but then there is the unpredictable X-factor, the spice and its effect on humans, which will change human evolution. It evoked the same sense of wonder at human possibility and unpredictability that I felt as a youth.What is so much fun is that Herbert does not explain the whole thing, but gives the reader enough clues to interpret it while also creating the seeds of future possibilities. Though I have read all the books, I saw so much more at this re-reading to know that I will read this yet again, perhaps in 20 years. Now I will have to go all the way back through the 6-novel cycle!One of the very best. Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Let's talk, for just a moment---here, in the shadow of the Citadel, in the instants before the space above us folds in on itself, tears open and disgorges a Harkonnen battle fleet, hopped up on cruelty, girded for war, and ready to blast down the shield wall and unleash carnage.Nah, don't get up: Doctor Yueh says the Shield Wall should hold, and he *can't* lie---he's got the Imperial conditioning, after all.Let's talk of space, and time-shifting, and ferociously deadly assassins, of Dukes and Padishah Emperors and plots within plots, wheels within wheels; but most of all, best of all certainly, of Spice and Giant Worms.Let us speak, for a time, of Dune, of Arrakis, Desert Planet.Dune is as simple, or as complex, as you want to make it: certainly Frank Herbert has created an epic, which literally spans galaxies and, ultimately, centuries, but it is a curiously, deliciously intimate epic. At first blush Herbert created a classic space opera, the desert world Dune serving as both backdrop and battleground for a vicious, bloody rivalry between two of the Empire's great noble Houses, the Atreides and the Harkonnens.In THIS corner, the bantam-weight challenge, House Atreides: helmed by Duke Leto, daddy to young, naive Paul, whose mother Lady Jessica is a Bene Gesserit witch. Well, OK, former-witch, or anyway a witch who stopped shaving her head and paying her witch-dues. Atreides hails from homeworld Calidan, a planet of woods and water and decent aesthetics. I hear they even recycle.And in THIS corner, former heavyweight champ-EE-uhn going out again for the title, House Harkonnen! Headed up by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, who brings new meaning to the phrase \\"all up in the air\\", its homeworld is planet Giedi Prime, whose Three-Mile-Island nuclear disaster ambience is all just part of its charm. House Harkonnen has its hands full ripping out its lackeys' heart plugs and throttling whores, but nonetheless finds time to carry out assassinations and conduct interstellar warfare! Talk about productivity!So on the surface, yeah, \\"Dune\\" is all about this colossal blood-feud between two houses, with the Padishah Emperor Shadam and his masters from the Spice Guild pulling the strings in the shadows.But you know what hooked me on \\"Dune\\", back years ago when I happened upon it at the age of 12? It's all about this wild-eyes, prodigious, utterly self-absorbed little kid coming of age in a truly alien environment.Back then, I could relate.I was in the middle of a pretty wild and woolly transition, myself: spirited away from my own homeworld of Oregon, land of woods and water (and recycling, come to think of it), as the result of my dad being transferred by the unimaginably vast, uncaring multinational he worked for (the transfer itself fraught with worries, and machinations, and potential backstabbing). Destination: Utah.Since my family were to live at the base of the mountains, I initially thought of Utah in Lord of the Rings terms: I would now be encamped at the base of the Misty Mountains.But having seen my new home from the plane, it was decided: Utah, Deseret, Desert Planet. So naturally, as a wide-eyed transplanted child trying to acclimate to a strange, and fairly hostile, new environment, I *got* \\"Dune\\" completely.The Princess Irulan was right: a beginning is a *most* dangerous time. With that in mind, Frank Herbert carried out a stroke of genius by framing his War of the Worlds from the viewpoint of a young Prince, a young prince who might be human---who would grow up to be a Rebel lord---and who might, just possibly, be the prophesied Messiah, the One who would unshackle the spice melange from the machinations of the Empire and its vassals, and set the Fremen---well, Free.And ride gigantic sandworms, to boot. Can't leave out the really good stuff.As to the political implications of \\"Dune\\"---a book about a clash of the Great Powers over a vast, arid desert rich with oil---oops, I mean MELANGE!---well, the veil here is flimsy at best. And in our post-9/11 age, some might get a case of the giggles or even the quease over \\"Dune\\"'s fixation with messianic warrior-saviors, and oppressed desert rebels, and the prominence of Jihad---getting back control over the vital worm poop that helps the Galaxy keep on truckin'. Maybe it's best to keep this one out of the hands of Osama bin Laden.But that's all secondary: Herbert has crafted a masterwork of pulpy space opera that nonetheless bores into the deeply intimate and mystical: his is a universe of high deviltry and massive betrayal, of nefarious plots, demonically wicked villains, and impossibly loyal heroes.Herbert has been chastised for his beefy prose style which some have castigated as ungainly, but I disagree---Herbert was a consummate craftsman with his words, and has a rich, pulpy style that keeps the deviltry moving and never fails to draw you in.And the little hints of a far larger universe---the sayings of the Prophet, Irulan's own musings on the affairs of her Age, the verses from the Orange Catholic Bible, the origins and shadow-haunted practices of the Bene Gesserit, or the Bene Tleilax (the shape-shifting assassins of Herbert's universe)---all of these prime the hunger for more glimpses of the world beyond the shifting sands of the titular Desert Planet.For those of you utterly new to \\"Dune\\"---its bloodthirsty familial rivalry, its moments of high holy insanity, its monstrous betrayals, its intricate, unforgettable characters---well, I envy you deeply.The Spice must flow. So will the pages.JSG"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is one of the best Sci-Fi novels available. This novel delves into the world and surface of the planet Arrakis..a desert planet that contains the most precious spice in the known universe..'Melange'. This spice allows for visions, longer life and space travel. The Spacing Guild navigators uses this spice to fold space and travel to any part of the universe without moving. Control of this planet is vital and whomever holds this place..rules. The Fremen live on this desolate planet and have a prophecy that a man would come..a messiah..to lead them on to freedom.Frank Herbert created a masterpiece of science fiction. This is the world of Paul Atreides, heir apparent to the House of Atreides. Filled with court intrigue, politics, mystical religious overtones, and technology, this novel flows in many different directions. The main focus is that the House of Atreides has been chosen to rule Arrakis and there they are pitted against the House of Harkonnen for control of the planet..with the Fremen caught in the middle. Hidden in the back of this..and carrying alot of power and control..is the secretive female order called the Bene Gesserit.For those interested in Sci-Fi, this is a highly recommended read. The part where Paul's younger sister Alia faces down Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Leader of the House of Harkonnen) with her..poison needle 'Gom Jabber' was particularly satisfying.His other Dune series books are good, but they don't measure up to this first book. Well worth getting."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"\\"Dune\\" is the first novel in the \\"Dune Chronicles\\". The detailed writing style is superb with inventive explanations behind the science fiction physics and the imaginative items plus a fine mixture of politics, warfare, and individual introspection. The cycle of life on desert planet Arrakis contains well thought out processes from the overall planetary scale to the biological.Aside from fifteen-year-old Paul Atreides, I found one of his mentors Gurney Halleck to be a great character to follow during the story and wish there had been more regarding his background. The Fremen desert culture has been tempered in the harsh planetary environment, forging a hard society. The primary attraction to the hostile planet is the spice melange, a poison yet a potent drug to its users and the inhabitants of Arrakis (it even permeates the very air people breathe). The spices' negative side effects are not completely discussed, leaving me to question whether it is even considered a drug or poison if it doesn't significantly impair a person other than a lifetime addiction to its benefits.At the end of the book, there are excellent appendixes including ecology, religion, and terminology. As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movies thereby leaving the series entirely to the imagination.I highly recommend the series to any fan of the science fiction genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is one of perhaps 8 books that I would give a 10 toand would be my unhesitating answer to the question, &quot;Whatis the best sci-fi novel of all time?&quot;Herbert has achieved what very very few sci-fi writers do:he has created a complex and utterly believable &quot;universe&quot;that is almost wholly alien to our own. Yet despite thisyawning gulf, Herbert spells nothing out; we learn about theuniverse by seeing it through the eyes of theextraordinarily compelling characters who inhabit it.This is not an easy read, and it takes more than a singlereading to really appreciate it. NB: do NOT make any assumptions based on the movie. It simplydoesn't compare."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Constrained by his own oracular vision, Muad'Dib becomes increasingly resigned to his godhead status and fanatic followers. Can he escape from this position and still preserve those he loves? The powerplay of Dune continues as the grim realities of religious empire are explored"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"For me, &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; is clearly the weakest book in Frank Herbert's &quot;Dune&quot; series. The problem from my perspective is a significant and radical shift in the character of Paul Muad'Dib. One of the things that particularly struck me in &quot;Dune&quot; was the sense in which Paul was similar to the Messiah awaited by the Jews: King David reincarnated to use the sword to sweep away the oppressors of his people. However, in &quot;Dune Messiah,&quot; Paul becomes more of a traditional Christ figure, down to the symbolic crucifixion that makes up the climax of the book. For me that was too much of a shift to accept, because I felt it undid one of the principle strengths of the original novel and all you have to do is put the two volumes side by side to see that this is not another epic novel.However, this does not mean that you should skip &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; as you work your way through the series, because it does set up several new elements that are ultimately more important than much of which was originally established (i.e, Duncan Idaho as a ghola, the twins, etc.). My strong recommendation has always been that you need to let time pass between each of Herbert's novels, because each one goes off in a new direction. I think that if you read them one after the other you simply cannot appreciate the strong points of each shift. So if you let time pass and then have a hankering to go back to Arrakis, I really believe you will be more open to the changes. Maybe the shock of the first change of direction has stayed with me, or the fact that the epic heights of the original &quot;Dune&quot; can never be equaled, but others have struggled through this second novel as well. However, everyone who has worked their way through the entire series has found it well worthwhile and we all would trade all the prequels for just one more volume from Frank Herbert."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Don't get me wrong, i LOVE love love DUNE, but this is a review for this edition. As a rather thick soft cover book i have to manually hold the book open while i'm reading. Sounds like a dumb complaint, except that when you put your fingers on the text the ink smears. The pages are some kind of smooth newsprint-like paper. This isn't a big problem if you only read the book once i guess (although once you get to the right hand page there might be a big ol' thumb print on it) but i think that you will want to read it again and again.Maybe my hands are extra sweaty or i just had a bum copy or something but i have NEVER had this problem before, and i've read the next five books in the series as well, the paper is different.I've read this book three times, and after noticing the problem the first time i have to hold the book open at the teeny little borders at the edge of the page, which really isn't fun. When i'm reading this book i want to be able to concentrate on the spectacular world that is created for me in my mind and not on avoiding the text.I suggest trying a different edition if you don't want thumb cramps and smeared words!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If you're reading this, than you probably have already read Dune by now. You may be expecting another mind-blowing book. I'm sorry to say that Dune Messiah is not quite what you might have hoped for.Dune Messiah is a remarkable story nontheless. Were it not a sequel, however, its seemingly confusing content would hardly be passable. Unlike Dune, Dune Messiah does not have that action oriented style which complimented Dune. Instead, a more sophysticated, dialogue-high approach was presented. I also detected a large portion of romance, oddly, and yet fittingly.As you may know, Dune Messiah carries on the story of the legendary, Kwizats Haderach, Muad'Dib. The book starts out with four conspiriters discussing their plans for killing Muad'Dib. Two of them, a face changer named Scytale, and a spice addicted Guild Navigator named Edric, are extremely interesting to learn about. The other two came into play in Dune, of which you can know only by reading Dune Messiah. Basically the story goes on with the Guild presenting Paul-Muad'Dib with a special gift. That \\"gift\\" was a ghola (a sort of reanimated person) aptly named Hayt. He was the ghola of the Duncan Idaho who initially died in Dune. The ghola truthfully tells Muad'Dib of his being a device to kill him. Muad'Dib thinks he can avoid/change that and decides to keep Hayt.As the plot to be rid of Muad'Dib continues, Paul's younger sister, Alia, 15, begins to realize that she needs a mate. She unknowingly falls in love with a \\"very peculiar person.\\"By the way, since Muad'Dib has no living children or heirs, he and his concubine, Chani, try the most guaranteed ways to have children. (No, it does NOT describe this in detail.) However, it is found that Muad'Dib's past ticket to the emperor's throne and wife, Irulan, had been putting anti fertility drugs into Chani's food. Mixed with fertility inducing things, this adds up to Chani having to eat about four times as much as normal to sustain the children in her womb.More events occur, which all inevitably lead to the fate of Muad'Dib. If you want to learn the conclusion of Muad'Dib's life or want to continue on with the Dune Chronicles, than Dune Messiah is a must-have. Let me tell you that Dune Messiah's ending is one of, if not THE best ending in any book I have yet read!(And I've read a lot! No, I didn't review everything I've ever read.)"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The story is supposed to take place in the distant future, on a dessert planet called Arrakis. People travel in inter-galactic transports, they ride some bird-like aircraft (\\"ornithopters\\"), use \\"lasguns\\" and some sort of energy shields to protect themselves ..But, underneath this thin veneer of machinery and gadgetry, the story is a very old one -- emperors, dukes and barons, witches and assassins, conflicts among imperial and aristocratic houses, palatial intrigues, quotations from the \\"O.C. Bible\\", even sword fights in a Colosseum-like arena ... and of course there is the Messiah, the one to save the world. This is supposed to be a sci-fi masterpiece, but I find the imagination lacking: besides what I listed above, there are very few imagined technological advances or scientific curiosities; most of the battles are fought with knifes and swords, and the most prized substance is a cinnamon-scented narcotic which turns your eyes blue and is essential for space travel (hard to imagine in the distant future people cannot manufacture a synthetic substitute for this). The political and social institutions, if anything, evolved even more backwards -- the societies are most feudal or slavery, and there is a band of nomads whose culture is very primitive with some funny (and manipulated) religion.The book is praised for the construction of a world with vivid details. But I find even that not very satisfactory. The plants are what exactly you find on earth, even their names: saguaro, creosote, sage bushes. Indeed, if you strip off the sci-fi veneer, this could very well take place in Arizona. Or in the Sahara -- actually, that would be more like it. The Freman people talk about \\"Jihad\\" and \\"Ramadhan\\" (although their religion is clearly not what you recognize as one of any real-world religions and these terms have somewhat different meanings than their orthodox definitions), you could easily imagine them being a band of Moorish people in the Sahara. And with all the witchcraft, telepathy, bloodline determining everything, feuds among baronial and ducal houses, you can easily place the setting in Medieval Europe and North Africa.Some of the elements in the book are not very believable (in a scientific context), such as passing one's own memory and experience through a drug-induced telepathic communication, and that one can see the future, etc. This is supposed to be science fiction; as such it should be based (at least mostly) on science. These things should be found in mythology or fantasy.Maybe we shouldn't be so strict about the boundary of genres. Now let me turn to the writing style. This is not an easy book to read. The writing is very baroque and quite repetitive (the characters constantly \\"swallow their dry throat\\"). Almost all the characters are with such a sense of destiny that they become very mechanical and have very little compassion (with perhaps the exception of Chani). Then at the end, there is an epic battle, but, alas, there is not much description of it at all and we skip right to the surrender. That is a bit of a letdown.I know there are many books in this series, and I really wanted to like it, but I think this will be the first and last book I will read in the series."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is a must for any science fiction fan who appreciates good writing! 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"OVERALL COMMENTS: Science fiction of the highest quality. A classic masterpiece that stands the test of time.PLOT: Dune is set in the distant future on a planet called Arrakis - the only planet known to contain an addictive mineral, referred to as spice, that prolongs human life.

As these battles rage on, victory awaits those that seek to understand the environment and ecology of this strange and hostile planet.

A high-born son must learn his true potential as a leader and mental superior in order to save his royal bloodline and the future good of Arrakis.PROS: Excellent writing. Touches on environmental issues. Intricate plot. Creative futuristic visions. Convincingly explores the concepts of highly advanced mental abilities.CONS: At times, fate and prophesy way heavily on the story making it seem more of a mystical fantasy world than a hard-core sci-fi book.PERSONAL NOTE: As someone who saw the movie first, it took me a while to get around to reading the book, since the movie was confusing and creepy (at least for me as a kid).

If I were to recommend someone (especially someone who doesn't read Science Fiction) a Science Fiction novel, Frank Herbert's Dune is what I would primarily recommend. Frank Herbert adds myriad, quite verbose and hard to read details to intensify the condition of this story. While these details may be considered unneeded to some people, without them many people would probably be reading Arabian Nights even though these two books are scarcely similar.Frank Herbert creates a nearly uninhabitable landscape for the moisture-lacking desert planet of Arrakis for the Atreides family including Paul, the main character, to live on. However, Arrakis was once inhabited by House Atreides' archenemy, House Harkonnen and is also currently inhabited by Arrakis natives called Fremen during the story. The Fremen are an intelligent race that do everything they can to survive on the planet which includes wearing special suits called stillsuits to preserve the \\"body's water.\\"Adding yet another variable to the living conditions on Arrakis are the colossal sandworms; many are larger than whales. They reside under the sand and can hear movements on the sand's surface. They hunt down travelers and spice factories alike, completely consuming anything moving on the surface of the sand. Fremen have adapted to this way of life but people like the Atreides have much to learn.There are two things that are valuable on Arrakis. One is water and the other is m&eacute;lange spice. Spice is the only reason why people other than Fremen inhabit Arrakis. It is the major export and profit maker of Arrakis. It is addictive like a drug to and is prized among the wealthy outside Arrakis. Atreides make portable spice factories to mine this spice despite their high vulnerability to sandworms.15 year-old Paul Atreides has intelligence beyond perceptibility in this novel. He is the son of the Duke Leto Atreides, leader of the Great House Atreides. Much of his intelligence comes from special training, but it is easy to doubt this is where he gets all of his superhuman adeptness. He is burdened by a self-founded \\"terrible purpose.\\"I really enjoyed this book. It isn't a book that I couldn't put down. It's too much of a mind-draining book to read it continuously for hours. I wouldn't recommend trying to read this book all at once. Dune gives you an idea of how good your present living situations are compared to the characters in this book. This is a book that I would have regretted not reading."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The introduction I had to 'Dune Messiah' was from a friend of mine, &quot;It's atrocious...don't read it...there's no mindless blood and guts(if you want that, read Lord of the Rings)...it's nothing like the rest of the series.&quot; Well, I would completely dissagree with the blatantly shallow comment that Dune Messiah is atrocious. But, I would not dissagree with the notion that it is completely different from the rest of the series...and that is a good thing. Often times, I grow weary of series' that drone on with the same stylistic format, especially in sci-fi/fantasy. Take for instance, Lord of the Rings. I love the story, the plot, etc. But because of the style and the fact that the three books are actually one single book, it causes one of the sections to lag. That particular section is 'The Two Towers.' Sure, it has plenty of action and blood, but there is absolutely no thought or depth in it. It, literally, is just a bridge from one good book to the last, nothing more. This is where 'Dune Messiah' succeeds. It's not simply a continuation of 'Dune.' The book is a thought-provoking analysis of Paul and his religious Jihad. As 'Dune' concludes that Paul is a Jesus figure, 'Dune Messiah' concludes that one should decide objectively whether Paul is Jesus or Adolf Hilter.The book has an extremely thorough explanation of the inner-struggle of Paul's character that is only hinted at in 'Dune.' But, this book also gives the objective look at the opinions of priests, family members, heretics, newly-reiterated characters, and historians on Paul and his Imperial Jihad. Is what Paul is doing morally just? Or is it tyranny? The book leaves the reader with his/her own thoughts, but not without making the reader fully understand Paul.I never thought that a Science Fiction book could have such enthrawling character developement. But Frank Herbert truly has revealed that he can do it as well as any literary figure in history....and the plot's not too shabby either!! The only thing it lacks is Lady Jessica. Well, luckily, we haven't seen the end of her..."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Presently, I write this review. Presently, Dune is a solid piece of SF, but not without its flaws. Presently, Herbert saw it necessary to use the word presently at least once every other page. I also find the idea of some futuristic fiefdom a little unlikely, and remained unconvinced by the end. Better than Star Wars. Not that that is any great feat. Can anyone direct me to a good stillsuit manufacturer? I am planning on moving to Arizona."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Let me start with the praise: Dune is an incredibley complicated and entertaining view of the future. Dune clearly sets Herbert in the pantheon with Verne, Welles, Bradbury and Asimov. His characters -- Paul, the hero, the villainous Baron and the mysterious Fremen, are all well drawn, complete and interesting. He is especially adept at creating supporting characters -- Thufir Hawat, Gurney, and Piter. What was most amazing about this book was its ability to create an entire world, with its own culture, language, etc. This is a feat which few have been able to accomplish, and left me waiting for information about Herbert's world, rather than the story. However, the book is a bit complicated. I read it first when I was 14 -- have read it about 6 times since then (I'm 20 now), and I still find things that I didn't get or understand the first time around. The Guild, CHOAM, etc -- these are all things which Herbert leaves a bit too ambigious and would make the reader's time a bit easier to explain them. The dialogue is also a bit stilted, and the writing is not Nobel-prize material. However, it should be read more for its vision, its story and its characters -- as well as for an appreciation of the world which Herbert creates. Recommended, but it involves a good deal of concentration and patience."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is a review of the Kindle Version.Dune is arguably the best science fiction series of all time.

It is flawless, an exact clean copy. (I have the original Dune in paperback, and have read it several times). This Kindle version is perfect, down to the same misspellings in the original paper book. The fonts are even similar, including the slightly different font in the preludes to each chapter. This may seem trivial, but it the number of errors in Kindle versions of books like this is astounding.Some might quibble over the pricing, because if you really wanted to, you could get a paperback version cheaper than the Kindle version. However, to me, the value of having all of the Dune books in a nice thin package of the Kindle more than makes it worth the extra buck.There is a interesting point in the book in which Paul Atriedes gets a tiny little scroll-like reader of the O.C. Bible as a gift. He had to use some type of magnifying device to read it. This was, ironically, one of the only future technology concepts that Frank Herbert \\"guessed wrong\\" about. Funny - even the most forward-looking science fiction writers could not foresee the magic of the Kindle!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Everybody else has already grokked \\"Dune\\" to the high heavens, and it definitely deserves all such praise. Here I just want to mention a few thoughts I have about \\"Dune\\" that should add to its lustre and help explain (but not explain away) its runaway success.1) \\"Dune\\" is extraordinarily well-written on a literary level. Most sentences have the look of having been polished to a high sheen. Not that they necessarily were... point is, there's no \\"filler\\" here at all. Every word is in its place. The richness of detail is overwhelming, especially sensory detail. The narrative is well constructed, there is masterful use of 3rd-person omniscient narrator, and the plot unfolds at exactly the right pace.2) Frank Herbert never wrote anything as good before or since. Not even close. The \\"Dune\\" sequels? No way. They don't even feel like they take place in the same universe, although the same terms, organizations, characters, etc... are still there. Why? Because starting with \\"Dune Messiah\\", Herbert's writing lost that hallucinogenic vividness. Speaking of which...3) \\"Dune\\" is the only fiction book I've ever read that has the power to raise my awareness every time I read it. This comes from two sources. The first is something I mentioned above - the extraordinary sensual richness of the writing. The second is that Herbert is describing human beings with extraordinary powers of perception. Somehow, Herbert hit on a manner of describing human beings with psychedelic levels of awareness which is vivid, authentic, and subjectively-congruent enough to actually bring this level of consciousness out of the person who is reading his work. To read any part of \\"Dune\\" is to have your senses immediately sharpened. You don't just read about the Bene Gesserit \\"voice\\" -- you actually sense its power within you. You don't just read about the psychedelic power of the \\"spice\\" -- you actually consume the spice yourself as you read, and feel its power. You don't just read about \\"plans within plans\\" and intricate Machiavellian strategies -- you actually gain access to this level of strategic intuition within yourself. You don't just read about the knife-fights -- you actually feel your muscles and nerves becoming more subtly attuned and your reflexes sharpen as you read.I don't know quite how Herbert managed to pull this off... but pull it off he did, and it's wonderful."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Not much more can be said about this book than has already been said. I finally read it after countless recommendations and putting it off for years. I was skeptical that it would be as good as everyone said it is, but it is. Frank Herbert shows himself to be a keen observer of human nature, political intrigue and conspiracy, religion, and the depths and variations of human emotion. His characters are believable and range from psychopathic and ruthless, to morally weak and conformist, to courageous and authentic. Complex, expansive, moving, and exceedingly well written. I can't wait to finish the series."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Nothing overrated about the most perfectly realized universe in science fiction. To paraphrase the great Arthur Clarke, \\"nothing compares to it except THE LORD OF THE RINGS.\\" While the series eventually peters out toward the end of the six book cycle, the first three are masterpieces and the original is a classic. Where else will you find a great feminist religious conspiracy, giant \\"sandworms\\" or fanatical desert tribal warriors? And then there are the heroes (Atreides), the villains (Harkonnen scum) and a vast dramatis personae that no novel (SF or otherwise) can match (save, of course, LOTR). Why settle for later and lesser ripoffs? Want to know where George Lucas got \\"Tatooine?\\" And learn how religious dogma and messianism can raise up and then throw down a great desert people. Did I mention there are GIANT SANDWORMS -?? If you only read one SF novel, read this one. If you want to become a fanatical follower of a fictional universe and can't stand elves, this is the book for you! Highest possible recommendation."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Undoubtly, Frank Herbert's DUNE is an undisputed science fiction classic. A masterly crafted tale of adventure combining romance, politics, religion, ecology, intrigue, and space opera into a grand epic. At 22 hours on 18 discs, it might seem a bit long, but you owe it to youself to get this if you like the book. Excellant narrators, accompanied by an accomplished cast transport the listener to the exotic world of Arrakis and all the adventure within. Besides...ever tried to read a book on a bicycle?"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a sci-fi classic, mainstay and linchpin. The book that went on to beget follow-up chronicles, prequels, sequels and a maligned film is a complex and lengthy tour-de-force reader in the annals of science fiction although, much like its contemporary Robert A. Heinlein's Stranger In A Strange Land, it is objectively more of the latter than the former. Dune utilizes sociology, anthropology, psychology and of interest within the arena of ecology.Frank Herbert has created a complex universe that is alive with machinations, manoeuvring, religion, commerce and opportunity. The planet Arrakis, now bestowed to Duke Atreides of Caladan who is a cousin to the emperor, is the source for the spice drug melange which is an invaluable and a rare resource allowing interstellar navigators to fold space and travel instantaneously anywhere in the galaxy. Not unexpectedly, all is not well. The guild that controls the spice is mysterious and holds interstellar travel and melange as above mere empire matters or politics, Dune was previously ruled harshly by the Harkonnens whose Baron Vladimir has a taste for suppression of the locals (the Fremen) and brutality and is not about to abdicate his control and the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV of the house Corrino has other things in mind than generosity towards his cousin. Ultimately, it is Paul Atreides, the son of the murdered Duke Leto, who forms the centre of gravity for the book.Treachery, witchery, spirituality and mastery of the mysterious arts form the basis for much of what ensues on Dune where the rich and indeed deep cast of characters whips up a sandstorm in the ethos of Arrakis.Frank Herbert draws from many influences and cultures such as Arabic (the use of nomenclature like 'Shaddam', 'jihad' or 'Mahdi' among many others), Persian ('Padishah'), Zen (the mind opening concepts embedded in the spice, the methods employed by the Bene Gesserit or the blatant mention of the Zensunni religion) and others. The desert planet though is the scene of much action and even on a strictly superficial level Dune is never lacking in stimulation.Dune is a book, and the unfolding of a universe, on par with the likes of The Lord Of The Rings or Brave New World albeit with many more millennia behind it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"\\"Dune, Arrakis, desert planet.\\" A phrase used more than once in Frank Herbert\`s legendary first glimpse into his future-looking mythos. The phrase can be viewed as a microcosm for descriptions of nearly every character, place, custom, and internal monologue in \\"Dune\\". No character is single-dimensional, no location is used as backdrop only, and no discourse represents one interpretation.*introductory plot information below*The universe of Dune is set in an almost impossibly distant future, some 20,000 years from now, and is a time when guided human perfection is used as replacement for machines, when amorphous political entities hold galaxy-changing power, and when one man and one planet hold the destiny of the universe under their linked influences. Paul Atreides is a young nobleman, son of Duke Leto Atreides, head of the House Atreides, a major galactic power. We are introduced to Paul just prior to his testing by the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, a matriarch of the Bene Gesserit. The test's purpose is to determine whether or not Paul is \\"human\\" by determining his capacity to ignore pain for a higher purpose: preservation of his life. Paul triumphs in this test, administered by a pain amplifier known as a gom jobbar--but the test's true purpose, to determine whether or not he is the long-awaited Kwisatz Haderach, the male Bene Gesserit, is at yet hidden from him. The Bene Gesserit, via selective breeding programs spanning centuries into the past, have long labored to combine just the right genes to produce a prescient male, capable of seeing past, present, and future simultaneously. Paul's destiny, or \\"terrible purpose\\" as the character himself interprets it, is intractably linked with that of the galaxy.*some tiny spoilers below*Frank Herbert's masterpiece succeeds on so many levels because it is many things to many different people. For those who prefer intellectual prose and erudite dialogue, please refer to the many interweaving schemes which bind the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen to the Emperor Shaddam IV, the doctor Yueh to the Duke Leto, and the lore of the Missionaria Protectiva to the destiny of Paul Muad'dib. For the more viscerally-inclined, you need only turn to Frank's stunning depictions of the duels between knife-masters, where each move and countermove is discussed without the reader becoming separated from the true desperation manifested in these struggles. Perhaps your tastes meander towards treatises discussing environmental concerns? Look no further then the activities of the \\"Imperial planetologist\\" of Dune, Liet-Kynes, who has crafted himself into an almost godlike figure, worthy of absolute devotion by the native people of Arrakis, the Fremen. Through the teachings and guidance of Liet, an Imperial representative who has \\"gone native\\", the Fremen use ecological principles to... Well, you will have to read the book to find out. Are you a devotee of cryptozoology, that pseudoscience which infects the brain with enticing possibilities regarding monsters living amongst us? Consider the sand-worm of Arrakis, a monster of such stunning size that dimensions of hundreds of meters are yet insufficient to truly describe the sheer immensity of the largest specimens. The internal monologues, brief historical quotations prefacing each chapter, and \\"thrust-parry\\" dialogues provide a rich backdrop of philosophy and psychology for the thinking reader to gnaw on. Last, any fan of mysticism, the mystery of consciousness, or the question of limits of the human mind will enjoy reading about the \\"weapons from the past\\" that a tested Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit has at her disposal.Any discussion of \\"Dune\\" will likely lack true objectivity, and I confess that I, too, do not have an impartial viewpoint. In my time, I have read \\"Dune\\" perhaps four times, and have listened to George Guidall's momentous audiobook reading at least ten times. Past the desire to inspire another person to read this book with semi-adept word-combination assembly, let me say that Frank's writing allows me to actually taste spice-coffee, witness Duncan's drunken ramblings, and hear Piter's death throes. Herbert is simply an author unparalleled at weaving the reader's perceptions with the experiences depicted in his masterpiece. Five stars for content, depth, suspension of disbelief, total reader-world immersion, and sublime writing. George Guidall's performance tacks an extra half-star to the audiobook version.Science fiction fans: Never too late to read Frank's masterpiece. Continue up to \\"Chapterhouse: Dune\\" should you possess deep wells of patience, but PLEASE stop there (\\"Hunter's of Dune\\" is a travesty).Non-science fiction fans: As I said, this book appeals on many levels. Highly recommended, but I would stop with this book, as the sequels are substantially more reliant on sci-fi standards.All: This is not a book to read in one sitting--you owe it to yourself to read this classic minus excess alacrity."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune represents what Science Fiction is all about. Herbert presents us with a universe of infinite possibilities within a wonderous universe. His entire universe is exceedingly well thought out. The way his characters interact with it show that he really wants them to be products of that universe, not ours. Top notch writing all around."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Hungrily my mind devours the writings of Science Fiction writers in an never ending quest for my reading satisfaction. Alas &quot;Dune&quot; does not quench my thirst, Herbert's vivid imagery and the depths of his plots within plots only intensified my thirst for MORE! While a pleasing and enjoyable experience &quot;Dune&quot; has left me stranded in a desert void empty as the southern hemisphere of Arakkis itself. Such is the reading experience of &quot;Dune&quot; I have yet to find another Sci-Fi novel as good as this one, &quot;Dune&quot; is like the precious waters on Arakkis , the very essence of life. Long Live Maud'Dib!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I was not planning to write a review for Dune, as I did not think I could sufficiently use words to display the majesty of this work, instead, I was going to scan the ratings and rebuke anyone who dared give the book a low rating. Happily, their were five ratings of a 9 and nothing else but 10's. I am satisfied that the world is not as bad of as I might have thought now, now that I see that there are none so misled as to give possibly the greatest novel ever written a low rating. I urge those 9's to re-review and put the 10's where they belong. Nothing has ever come close to Dune, except Tolkien, and that was to different to be compared. Herbert, if you can hear me, my most heart-felt thanks for the most influential book in my life to this point. Everyone else, read and be changed!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is one of the all time greats. It ranks right up there with &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, or &quot;War and Peace&quot;. This is not just Sci-Fi, it is Real-Fi. There is a great lesson to be learned from this book, and the ones that follow it. It tells you of our own past present and future, and the traps, twist, and plotting that goes on all around us. I will have a copy forever, and will pass its legacy on to my children. It is simply outstanding!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The book &quot;Dune&quot; could have been written in any time period. The general plot of good versus evil takes on new meaning when you end up not being sure just exactly who was good and who was bad. The development of the characters in this book place Herbert in the same league as Dickens. I have read the book several times and each time I read it, it almost seems new because I find a greater insight into its' plot. I have been reading science fiction for more years than I care to admit, and would place this book among the top ten ever written."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I ve choosen a quation of the LetoII for the subject if you noticed.

This book has everything:- a medieval feudal society with an emperor in nominal control(reminiscent of the Holy Roman Empire), a desert society based on early Islam and a heavy emphasis on character, religious fervour and drug abuse. The references to early Islam are rather blatant.It is clear the author drew on the real-life Ishmaeli Order of Assassins in 13th century Persia, for his description of the secret societies of the Bene Gesserit;Tleilaxu et al. The author also appears to be a neo-luddite(he is clearly antagonistic to the Ixians(who produce machines).But what I admire most about the author is his insertion of quotations at the beginning of each chapter. This creates a feeling of history behind his novel, which is something I have rarely seen in other science fiction novels which are too one-dimensional. One exception to this is the Moon-Moth by Jack Vance, a short story that I would highly recommend to any self-respecting science-fiction reader."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Quite frankly, Frank Herbert has done me a serious disservice.

A little more should hve been added to his rather unoticeable character, and it is a bit difficult to believe that this character metamorphoses into the Prophet and Messiah. It is equally difficult to believe that paul could be the father of Leon II the tryant, However it is good, undoubtebly excellent with the Bene Gesserit, the Baron and all in action.

And it is with words that Herbert delights the reader, whether it be his playful mixing of Latin and Arabic roots, the &quot;Words&quot; of Christianity and Islam, or his at times poetic description of alien landscapes, which become so real to the reader. His characters, the vile (or perhaps simply antagonistic) Harkonnens; the noble Atreides; the mysterious Bene Gesserit; the powerful Mentats; the fervent Fremen -- all are developed fully and take on their own personalities.

The rest of the Dune series never quite lived up to this seminal masterpiece, a peerless visionary novel that is as readable and masterly as any piece of literature in any category. It is the story of a young man born to be the spiritual and military leader of a mystical band of desert nomads who survive in the wastelands of the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. The battle occurs in the very distant future against the backdrop of complicated Universal politics and intrigue.

Other reveiwers have commented on the supreme tension and intrigue he weaves, but to me the lasting excellence of this book is to be found in the carefully crafted characters.Each of Herbert's characters evolves as a real person; the flaws of his heroes are not hidden or glossed over and even the villians are not without their strengths. Each time I reread this classic, I learn more about the wonderful men and women crafted by Herbert.&quot;Dune&quot; is a must-read, which is as timely today as it was three decades ago when it was written.

But the priests of the Hierarchy weren't really priests, at least not in the old timeless sense. In fact, the first thing a young initiate was taught was that the Great God did not exist- it was just a false idol and technological trick used to control the commoners. For the priests were really composed of all the privileged classes of the old age- the scientists, engineers, managers, doctors, and psychologists. They had banded together to rule the world by fear and superstition. They used the technology that they controlled to force and frighten the common people into serfdom and slavery. Indeed, they had used the Dark Ages as their inspiration and pattern in social organization, costumes, architecture- they even allowed witches to exist and operate as a means to help terrorize the masses. Unfortunately for the priests of the Hierarchy, the Witchcraft was far more than it seemed....It is absolutely incredible that this tight little novel was written in 1943. Just the use of the term &quot;Atomic Age&quot; two years before Hiroshima is remarkable. Then combine that with the fact that Leiber accurately describes atomic power, genetic engineering, cloning, holograms, scientific brainwashing, psychological warfare, and mutually impenetrable force beams that sound exactly like light sabers. This novel was far ahead of its time and holds up as a gripping read even today. In fact, the oppressive elitism that it describes is more plausible today than it would have been in the freer decade of the 40's."},{"Title":"Gather, Darkness!","review":"\\"Gather, Darkness\\" was one of two dystopian novels written by Fritz Leiber (The other was \\"A Specter Is Haunting Texas\\".). Without question this splendid little novel still remains one of his most impressive literary achievements. It is also one of the best conceived, best written novels of a dismal future for humanity.Three hundred years after a nuclear holocaust, humanity is ruled by a secretive religious brotherhood, the Hierarchy of the Great God, which uses science as the supernatural means of ensuring its control over an impoverished, predominantly illiterate population. Opposing this brotherhood is a secret society of witches, the followers of Sathanas, seeking to use science to overthrow the brotherhood's tyrannical theocracy. A young Hierarchy priest, Brother Armon Jarles, skeptical of his beliefs and the Hierarchy's orthodoxy, soon finds himself caught in the bitter struggle between both groups. A struggle that is meant to gather darkness against the Hierarchy's grip on power."},{"Title":"Gather, Darkness!","review":"In this post world war three novel, the class system has been re-enacted on earth and God has taken a new role over the poor public. The book brings together the uninformed technological public with the advanced brotherhood of God. But one brother has a different take on things and deffects from the order to join the witches of the dark underground. IN the end, the oppresive brotherhood is overrun by the witches in a spectacular show of technology power. The book took a new approach to the sometimes dull sci-fi books. The dark world was unlike any other and many times the reader felt like the book didn't have any point. But in any case it made you think about the setting and a new world of the mind. A good read for the sci-fi fan who wants something a bit different."},{"Title":"Gather, Darkness!","review":"Over thirty years ago this novel grabbed me with its themes of technology, politics, and religion. Naturally, over the years it has lost its initial impact on my imagination, but retains interest with a fascinating and imaginative description of a world struggling with issues of political and religious freedom. Sci-fi/fantasy fans will enjoy the intermingling of supernatural and technological phenomena."},{"Title":"Gather, Darkness!","review":"Imagine a world where the church ran everything. Sound good? Well, it's not. Just like in the middle ages, this church rules with an iron hand. Since God must be with the church, then opposition to the church is considered witchcraft, and it seemingly comes from Satan. A wonderful view of the negative possibilities should one single religion ever really take over the world. Lieber is a master writer, and this is one of his very best novels."},{"Title":"Gather, Darkness!","review":"This is the first book of Leiber's that I have read and I am very impressed. Though the book was written in the 1950's it is able to transend 40 odd years and still be relevent in todays thinking. The most interesting twist is how Leiber moved away from science explaining the supernatural to science using the supernatural to maintain control on an ignorant society of peasents. Another impressive twist to the book was Leiber's ability to move the focus of the novel from between three different, yet important characters, without any interuption. I can not wait to read more of his books."},{"Title":"Gather, Darkness!","review":"I was skeptical of a \`science fiction' book which read on the cover, \`An epic struggle between science and magic' and had an illustration of an old lady, a cat and a monkey. If it wasn't for my prior research into the book, I never would have even touched the book. Thankfully, for once, my regards to this book is in line with others.I'm allergic to fantasy, so I have a most difficult time swallowing magic, witches and spells. One book which repressed my gag reflex was Trapped by James Alan Gardner. In his novel, the characters exhibit their magic in the form of manipulating nanites which are specific to each owns brain chemistry (or whatever- anyway, it was readable). Now when I pick up a classic like Gather Darkness which includes elements of magic AND religion, I was suspicious. Fritz weaves a decent tale though without causing me to spew.In the era the novel takes place, an Hierarchy has been long established which uses masqueraded high technology to mimic miracles of God and powers granted to the priests. The commoners are draconian yokels left in the dark about the secret affairs of the church. Yet, there is a secret resistance invoking Witchcraft (so says the Church, but it is in fact technology which the Church doesn't have). The story follows the resistance of the Witches and heretics, the escalating war between the two and friction which spills over into the populous city.Considering the later-combined were penned in 1943, a number of remarkable technologies make their appearance. One could say that Fritz was, perhaps, visionary in his technological apparatuses and memes. His ideas were also original, something which is hard to sift through when going over pulp 40s and 50s science fiction. Even now, the novel stands as a one-of-a-kind science fiction novel which only touches base with very few other novels combing scientific magic and religion."},{"Title":"Gather, Darkness!","review":"I'm pretty sure George Lucas read this one as a kid. This book elegantly portrays how a government can control the masses via religious emotions and fear. The chaos unveiled once the curtains are down, exposing the influential special effects, is quite stunning. The resulting revolt is dramatic.

Encyclopedia\\" without an Index ?!?!?! That's the first flaw that caught me when I received the book. It dawned on me I spent (which later I realised it was wasted rather than spent)25$ on an unprofessional almost useless book.For years I have thought of the Grateful Dead as the MOST overrated band in the rock scene.Only recently have I realised how wrong I was. Once realised that I turned to Ammazon for help - purchasing a whole bunch of Cds and books.I orders \\"The American Book of THE DEAD - The Definitive Grateful Dead Encyclopedia\\" hoping it will help me get the basic knowledge fast and compensate for my lost time. Was I disappointed (not to say shocked) to see there was no intex to help me navigate around. Encyclopedia is a very demanding term which the writer chose to ignore completely.OK, I started to navigate the \\"Encyclopedia\\" myself according the ABC and was prety disappointed by the writing style and the info given.I've read in other reviews there are some missing terms, let me add one which really pissed me off - Fillmore. You got to be kidding me.Another missing item that was mentioned is - Wall of Sound. Let me guide you to the W section of this book - 2 poor pages (no Z btw in this encyclopedia) with no mention of Working Man's Dead, NO KIDDIN'!So, to sum this up:* The book is outdated - 1997 (13 years ago). Dick's Pick is stuck at volume 7, and all last years issues are ofcourse abssent. I'd think a serious encyclopedia gets updated from time to time.* No INDEX makes this book prety useless.* Poor presentation and grafix - well, that's a matter of taste. IMHO, thinking of the amazing posters, light shows and tye-die shirts connected to the Grateful Dead I think the poor B&W; photos do not match the expected standards.* Some lists like Discography is a MUST. And a defenetive source MUST have a thouruogh one; A band family tree is essential;Seems not much inovation and thought was put into this book, and it is defenetly not defenetive. Can someone PLEASE recommand a real good defenetive source?"},{"Title":"The American Book of the Dead","review":"This is basically just an encyclopedia of Dead information. No setlists, but a description of every song the dead played, along with recommended versions of each song are included. Signifigant personalities are also listed with appropriate descriptions.

It is a good book, but the encyclopedia format gives no continuity, so toilet style, quick reading is the best way to enjoy this book.

I got it about a year ago and I read it cover to cover over the course of a month. It makes great bathroom reading! The thing that's really great about this book is that you get the story behind all of the songs. Reading the backstory for all of my favorite tunes gave them a new life and made me want to go listen to them again -- to see them in that new light. Another interesting aspect is that even the covers are given some backstory -- including extensive information about the orig. artists. Then there's the in-depth information about the Dead themselves. Want to know more about Tom Constantine? It's there. Interested in Bruce Hornsby's connection to the Dead? It's there too.

Being the encapsulated view of life by W.C. Fields in his own words","review":"W. C. Fields starred in many movies with many co-stars, both math and female. Most of the movies are of dubious quality, a great deal of which is due to the fact that the art of filmmaking was still a work in progress. However, there is no mistaking his distinct voice and his screen persona is unforgettable. This book has some text explaining the personal and screen life of W. C. Fields but the bulk consists of images from his films with associated commentary.If you have seen some films starring Fields, then looking through the images will conjure up the sound of his voice and intonation in your mind. It is a look at one of the best of the early stars and a man that pushed the limits of censorship as far as he possibly could. Fields also spoke candidly of his love of alcoholic beverages, which is a common theme here as well.The introduction by Ed McMahon sets the proper tone for the images, it gives us some background on Fields' early career as a professional drowner and then at the end Fields gives an encapsulation of his early career in entertainment. Fields was one of the great early entertainers, his voice and bulbous nose defining characteristics of his personality and lifestyle. Hopefully, reading this book will convince people to view his films, with a little work on the part of the viewer, they are entertaining."},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"of if this is a ripoff from another story this is such an obvious attempt to make money off the stephen king name, whether or not it was written by him or someone else it's only half a story albeit a somewhat decent one but you're still paying normal price for what adds up to be an advertisement for the show Kingdom Hospital.

The friend, Madeleine Kruger, was admitted after a attempted suicide and there is no family available for the hospital to contact. Against her son's wish she drives to kingdom hospital in the middle of the blizzard only to find that something terrible has happened. The incident is so frightening that Sally passes out and has her first encounter with the mysterious little girl that cries in terror and rings her bell, always seeming to be on the run from someone or something. After waking up and also having her first encounter with her nemesis , Doctor Stegman, she continues to investigate what drove her friend to attempt to kill herself and finds that her and her friend had a long ago connection with the original kingdom hospital that burned down. One that she will find links her to a family that became notorious for \\"practicing\\" new medical procedures on the innocent and the unwilling. She also finds that the ground the hospital was built on was the site of another terrible tragedy involving a mill fire. Unknown to Sally and the occupants of Kingdom Hospital, the past and the present have begun to collide. The line between good and evil has been drawn, the players in the coming battle have been called, and the stage has been set in the form of a hospital that lies on uneasy ground.---------------------------------------------------This is actually a pretty good book considering it is just a \\"background\\" book for the Kingdom Hospital mini-series that ran on ABC a couple of years ago. The only thing I wish is that the author had kept on writing and actually wrote out the whole mini series in the form of a extra book or two. I would recommend this to anyone who liked kingdom hospital and wanted to know a little more about the background of the characters and those who would like to know a little more about the background of the characters before watching the miniseries, which in my opinion was also good. Also a good book if you like steven king no matter what name he is writing under.

Nicole (angelx) author of rainy day poems and more 1 and 2"},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"Like the reviewer socrates 17, I am waiting for ABC/Stephen King to credit Lars von Trier as the source of this new mini-series. Unfortunately, judging from the promotions for the series (which include this book, published by an arm of ABC network), it doesn't seem that they will. Instead, they seem to be trying to pass this book off as the truth when, in fact, there isn't even a Kingdom Hospital in Maine - (CMCC hospital is the one utilized in this series). Yes, this story is simply the thinly (VERY thinly) changed story of Riget (i.e., the Kingdom) and Riget II, brilliantly written and directed by Lars von Trier in 1994 and 1997 respectively. When I contacted Zentropa studios with my concern, they said that the rights to Riget and Riget II had been sold to the television series, but not the accreditation. They, too, are obviously waiting for ABC to make the proper acknowledgement.Given this, I would pass on the book and, instead, see the wonderful von Trier originals. As socrates 17 says,it is possible to find Riget in PAL format from Amazon UK although in my case, I was lucky enough to find it in a now defunct video store in NTSC format. Riget II is occasionally shown on tv - IFC showed it about a year ago and one of the pay channels (STARZ, I think) showed it this past fall. Definately check these von Trier films out; they are uniquely plotted, wonderfully shot and acted and I still have the images of Udo Kier (as the monstrous baby) in my mind."},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"While it is the suspicion of many readers that Stephen King actually wrote this companion to \\"The Kingdom\\" mini-series, it was really written by Richard Dooling (per audio interview at http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/episodes/11212003). It's marketed as being by one \\"Eleanor Druse,\\" a character in the series. As many will recall, this is the same marketing tactic that preceded \\"Rose Red,\\" another ABC mini-series about a haunted house. The book companion in that case was \\"Diary of Ellen Rimbauer\\" edited by \\"Dr. Joyce Reardon\\" who is also a character in that work of fiction. The actual writer, it was later announced, is Ridley Pearson.Dooling must be familiar with King's works, especially the Dark Tower series. The tie-ins with product placement from other worlds, as well as the mention of an artist being rushed to the hospital after being hit by a car on a leisurely walk are reminiscent of the links King likes to make between his works and with his own experiences. They are treats to us \\"constant readers\\" that won't be caught by just anyone.After reading this short book, I am more excited for the upcoming mini-series. I'm counting down the weeks and days. I highly recommend this book to any King fan and to anyone that intends to watch the mini-series. It provides good background into the story while it pulls you in, leaving you to feel like you're there, in Kingdom Hospital with Eleanor Druse.Eleanor Druse is a self-proclaimed psychic. It all begins when she gets a call that a childhood friend has been calling for her after an attempted suicide. Eleanor rushes to the hospital to find her friend dead. The same night, Eleanor has a near-death experience.While doctors try to find what caused Eleanor to fall and hit her head, a series of events begins to unlock memories from Eleanor's experiences as a child in The Kingdom hospital. Eleanor tries to unravel the mystery behind a doctor she keeps seeing that nobody else sees. This doctor seems to be present whenever a great tragedy occurs at the hospital, as does a ghostly little girl. What do these ghosts imply and how can Eleanor help the little girl?\\"The Kingdom\\" will be aired beginning March 3rd. Before that, ABC will be airing a film on the making of \\"The Kingdom\\" by the same name as this book. Some people are accusing King of stealing the concept but he's not claiming it to be his original work. In fact, everything I've read points to ABC making a deal with King to bring this impressive story to American audiences. I did try to watch the original with subtitles, while I can tell it's a good story, it loses something in the translation.It's funny how screenwriters rework other people's writings all the time, but when King does it, he is accused of plagiarism. I'd like to take this opportunity to point out that the advertisement for \\"Secret Window\\" gives credit only to the screenwriter (\\"from the writer of 'Panic Room') and not to King so as not to taint the viewers' opinion by letting them know that King actually wrote the original, but that's another story."},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"Of course, this is not one of Stephen King's masterpieces; it is designed mainly to promote the Kingdom Hospital tv series. (I would rather read the rest of the story than watch it, but only this journal has been published so far.)Initially I found the Sally/Eleanor Druse character un-engaging, however midway through the story I became fully fascinated. The story is one worth reading and seems to work on different levels: the current hospital bureaucracy, the strange suicide attempts, an evil spirit, and lobotomies on children. It ends abruptly and unresolved, but sets up the tv show nicely."},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"Save your money - this isn't a complete story, just a printed trailer for the TV series.

The story, written by Richard Dooling (not Stephen King), starts off slowly. It does take a little while to get warmed up to it, thus the reason for 4.5 stars instead of 5. But about 1/3 of the way through, you feel a sense of eerieness surrounding you, and the suspense builds to the point you can't put it down. There is one aspect that bugs me and is unrealistic: Without giving away any of the story, there are earthquakes that happen in Boston. What bugs me is that no one seems to realize that earthquakes in Boston are hugely unusual. Why not toss in a scene where someone is watching a news broadcast about the unusual earthquakes -- or anything that would convey that yes, this is a rare event.

A career spiritualist, Eleanor Druse, lives in Maine (as does Stephen King whose &quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot; will be on TV) and spent considerable time organizing the journals she has kept regarding her experiences with Kingdom Hospital.After surviving a near death experience when she visited a friend at that hospital, Druse spends some time at Boston General Hospital suffering from an unknown illness. Upon returning home she hears rumors about strange happenings at Kingdom Hospital and determines that she must investigate. She begins after soliciting the help of her son, Bobby, who is an orderly there.Among her discoveries is the fact that the Hospital is built on the site of a textile mill that was destroyed by fire after the Civil War. This conflagration also took the lives of many workers, child laborers included.Druse becomes convinced that the spirit of one child, Mary Jensen is imprisoned within the Hospital. She also senses that there are other evil spirits lurking among the corridors.&quot;The Journals of Eleanor Druse&quot; is a &quot;Kingly&quot; reading sure to chill and intrigue."},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"I loved the book, and I love the series.

This hospital was built over old bleaching pools (rather than a textile mill) responsible for the death of this child and others (continual exposure to chlorine gas). In the film, one of the main characters is an older psychic lady who continually feigns illness to be admitted to the hospital to investigate the haunting. Responding to a ghostly child's cry, she gathers other patients and hospital workers together for seances as part of her investigation. Coincidence? This Diary of Eleanor Druse is a work of fiction, as noted in the wee letters on the cover, and is obviously based on King's reworking of the earlier movie, if not written by King himself under a pseudonym, changing the location to his usual Maine settings. Heaven knows who the Eleanor Druse that reads the book on tape is. Von Trier's movie (which may have originally been a TV series in itself, it's never been clear) is a quirky and sometimes very creepy piece of work. Highly recommended to anyone that doesn't mind a four-hour film in Danish, crossing ER with Twin Peaks. I'd be very surprised if the US television remake will be anywhere as atmospheric or original. As for the book - probably an adaptation of a screenplay which itself is the adaptation of another screenplay."},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"I wouldn't have bothered to read this if I had realized that it's just a teaser for King's new TV show. The &quot;story&quot; ends abruptly with no resolution, presumably to make one sure to tune in to get one, which makes me feel cheap and used. I'd probably be more disgruntled but I didn't actually purchase the book.Other than that, it's not an abysmally bad story, but it's not great or ground-breaking either. The plotline seemed a little too generic for King, which makes more sense now that I have read that it's a re-interpretation of a work by Von Trier.I think some of King's work is really excellent, but I would rank this towards the bottom of his writings. That said, being ranked low for King is better than some author's best, especially in the &quot;horror&quot; genre."},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"Unlike a lot of people giving reviews here, I really like the show, though it definitely took me awhile to get hooked. You definitely won't be able to figure out what is going on by watching only the first episode. When I heard from others who have read this book that you can find some additional background information on Kingdom Hospital and its characters in its pages, I decided to pick it up. I have not been disappointed. I haven't had the problem of not knowing where I left off, but I guess I just find it more interesting than other reviewers have. And yes, King is the author, just as he authored &quot;My Life at Rose Red&quot;, the supposed diary of Ellen Rimbauer for the Rose Red mini-series.Simply put, if you like the series, you'll probably like this book. If you can't stand the series, why would you read this book in the first place?"},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"The poster boy for underachiever (not the school grade child type as he almost forty years old) Bobby Druse works as an orderly at Kingdom Hospital in Lewiston, Maine. In December 2002, Bobby calls his mother Eleanor to inform her that a patient Madeline Kruger nee Jensen tried to commit suicide while she keeps insisting that it is 1939 and she needs to know what happened to her friend Sally Druse. Finally Bobby mentions the long note that Madeline penned referencing the little girl is coming.Eleanor has a deep interest in the paranormal and thinks the drugged out Madeline is referring the deceased Mary Jensen. With the help of her son, Eleanor begins to investigate strange phenomena at Kingston and soon learns that the hospital was built over land where a textile mill burned to the ground in the late nineteenth century; many workers including numerous children died in that blaze. Eleanor wonders if these poor souls and others including Mary have become trapped here because they cannot find solace or if something evil is holding them prisoner. She hopes at least to free Mary.Though in some ways this journal sounds like an amateur sleuth starring in the movie Poltergeist, fans will appreciate the lead character as she investigates the unknown. The plot is exciting especially for ghost story fans. The support cast seems two dimensional though those who work at Boston General know how to \\"treat\\" a patient, just ask Eleanor. Overall this is a fun solid ghost tale just not as kingly as fans of the supernatural in Maine expect.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"From the mouths of babes?

I am not saying one Kingdom is better than the other, I only wish viewers to educate themselves by watching Von Trier's version too and not making such sweeping judgements that Americans are too stupid to read subtitles or enjoy a TV series from another country!Having said this, I am sure King's fans will enjoy it if it is read as a fiction. Maybe some of Lars Von Trier fans will like it too. I just higly recommend seeing both and then deciding which you like more. And yes, Kingdom 2 aired a few months ago on IFC, so it is accessible...you can also get a copy of Kingdom 1 on VHS."},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"Journals is nothing more than a teaser for the upcoming ABC movie. The story is not original and, frankly, much of it doesn't even make sense. I have been a King fan since Salem's Lot when I was only in high school. I have always looked forward to his new releases. After the Ellen Rimbauer dud and now this one, I wonder if King has lost his spark. His writings have, in the past, always had an edge that made you wonder what was going on in his head. This book and the Ellen Rimbauer Diary are like warmed up leftovers. My advice is don't waste your time on this book."},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"I loved the television series, so I thought I'd check out the book.Huge Mistake!!This novel went absolutely no where. I hated it!Come to think of it, the book doesnt even deserve the time its taken me to reveiw it."},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"I thought this book was just another run of the mill ghost story. It is getting a tremendous amount of hype because of the TV Show, but I think it is overrated. My biggest question is who is the author? For some reviewers information Stephen King did not write The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer, Ridley Pearson did. What King done was produce the Mini Series Rose Red, which was based on Pearson's fine novel. But it would not suprise me if King hatched the ideas of both these books in his brilliant mind. If anyone knows who wrote The Journals of Eleanor Druse could they please post it?"},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"To add to the essentially identical plot and transplanted location of this book to a major arc in Lars von Trier's TV mini-series The Kingdom (&quot;Riget&quot; - followed by The Kingdom 2,) the final nail in the coffin of originality is that the elderly spiratualist in the original Danish work is named Mrs. Druse.While his writing doesn't really click with me (just a matter of taste, not a criticism,) I have a great deal of faith in Mr. King's integrity and am sure that the original will be credited in the miniseries. I will watch it out of interest, but the originals were so wonderful and so bizarre that it seems highly unlikely that anyone could top von Trier's work. There was originally a final mini-series planned (and The Kingdom 2 ended with cliff-hangers in many plot arcs) and I sincerely hope that Lars has not lost interest. Maybe the U.S. interpretation will revive it if he has.The Kingdom (but not Kingdom 2) is available at Amazon UK if you have a multi-region system which will play PAL.(I also respect, btw, King's taste in music. An interview introduced me to the greatest unknown U.S. band of the 80s - The Rainmakers. Try searching, but I doubt that there is anything still in print.)"},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"I should have known better after the &quot;Rose Red&quot; trash. This is a cheap ploy to sucker you in to watching the series.

But not everyone."},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"The white lettering on the front cover of The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident cover glows ominously in the dark. The unexpected effect is eerie and a little unsettling. The tiny word &quot;Fiction&quot; in faint red text on the back cover stands out less clearly and is the only thing that indicates the book is a novel.Its predecessor, The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer , tied in to the Rose Red miniseries, was a bestseller partly because many believed King wrote it (it was actually written by Ridley Pearson) and partly because some people thought the book was based on a real supernatural investigation.The Journals opens with a letter to King by Eleanor (Sally to her friends) Druse, asking for help in carrying out her research into the events at Kingdom Hospital in Maine, where she has uncovered an otherworldly crisis. She wants King to have her journals, recorded between late 2002 and 2003, in case something happens to her.The septuagenarian is a volunteer and regular patient at Kingdom Hospital, well known by staff and patients alike. One of her oldest friends, Madeline Kruger, is hospitalized on a stormy winter night after attempting suicide. In 1939, Sally and Maddy were both admitted to the old Kingdom Hospital, suffering from whooping cough, shortly before the hospital burned to the ground.Maddy leaves behind a message indicating that something happened to them sixty years ago that Sally has successfully banished from her memory. Perhaps something related to the mysterious lesion that appears on a brain scan taken after Sally collapses and strikes her head when she witnesses something horrible after Maddy dies.Sally is a believer in mystical events and often conducts siances with her fellow patients at the hospital. She carries healing crystals and meditates to try to communicate with those who have passed on before her. After Maddy's deathbed revelation, Sally becomes aware that the tormented spirit of a young girl haunts Kingdom Hospital, struggling to convey another message.Sally's badgers her unambitious, beleaguered son Bobby into acquiring Maddy's old records and papers to help her uncover what she has been repressing for six decades while she simultaneously deals with persistent spirits at the hospital - among them a sinister shade she calls Dr. Rat - and the various levels of incompetence exhibited by the hospital's staff, including scalpel-happy Dr. Stegman, in exile from Boston General, who has left a trail of surgical horror stories on his record.The Journals overlaps some of the events to be played out during the fifteen-hour series, which debuts on ABC on March 3rd, but it also provides backstory only available to readers of this book. The anonymous author knows his or her medicine, especially neuroscience, and the volume makes for interesting reading on its own, though it ends with Sally's mission only partly complete.To discover more about the mysteries being played out in Kingdom Hospital, readers will have to turn on the television and see what Stephen King has in store for them this spring."},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"When Eleanor Druse is called to the hospital deathbed of an old childhood friend who has attempted suicide, she experiences gruesome hallucinations, both visual and auditory, and then blacks out. These events leads doctors to conclude that Eleanor has a brain abnormality and epilectic seizures. Eleanor believes no such thing. Instead she is certain that her extrasensory abilities have allowed her to view ghosts that haunt Kingdom Hospital.Reminiscent of The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer and its tie-in to the TV miniseries Rose Red, this novel disguised as nonfiction is a tie-in to the Stephen King TV series Kingdom Hospital. It consists of Eleanor's journals of her investigation into the paranormal occurrences at the hospital, the identity of a child whose phantom cries only she can hear, and the secrets of her own past. The novel reveals an explanation for only part of the mysteries Eleanor is investigating. Her introduction to the journal, a cover letter to Stephen King, warns &quot;Please read these pages as an introduction only to what I believe will one day be a complete scientific assessment of the remarkable occurrences witnessed by myself and others at Kingdom Hospital...&quot; Although this book sets the scene for the TV series that follows, it can stand alone on its own merits.I recommend this novel as a well-crafted blend of the factual and the fictional. You will learn something about neurological diseases and their treatment as the doctors deal with Eleanor's hallucinations. You will shiver at the spookiest of supernatural events as Eleanor attempts to bridge the gap between the past and the present, and between life and the first state of the afterlife.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"This is just a really fun read. Once you are hooked in bt Eleanor's loser son telling her what is going on, you turn page after page as she uncovers creepy and ultimately unspeakable things going on at the veerable Kingdom Hospital. The book does a nice job setting out that Eleanor is &quot;special&quot; in her ability to sniff out the paranormal and that despite everyones protestations that there is something terribly wrong at the hospital. It is troubling that through most of the book we are never quite sure whether things are really twisted or whether she is crazy and imagining things due to electrochemical malfunctions in her brain The medical professionals will cringe at the prima donna's showcased in this creepy book. I miss the Stephen King who formerly wrote books of a readable length that I could run through in a few nights of diligent reading. This book is a return to form that seems to have a little more of a rock and roll beat. I hate TV but I can't wait for the show."},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"In 1996, Stephen King was in Estes Park, Colorado, where filming of \\"Stephen King's The Shining\\" TV-mini series was taking place. In a video rental store, he saw a copy of Lars Von Trier's Kingdom Hospital, and he rented it and watched it in the very same town (Estes Park) where, nearly twenty years earlier, he was inspired to write The Shining. (see[...] for a wonderful interview with Kingdom Hospital's director Mark Carliner that explains these origins in detail).No one was able to secure the rights nor much interest in what Stephen King initially saw as a potential hit-TV show, until fate intervened three years later, and King was struck by a van and nearly died. While recovering from the accident, Stephen King spent a lot of time in hospitals, and Von Trier's idea recurred to him. He wrote 15 hours of television scripts for a new TV show, Kingdom Hospital. Based largely on those scripts, ABC secured the rights to Von Trier's original idea, and preproduction began on the show.The Journals of Eleanor Druse is a 244-page fictional account of a woman who visits that hospital in Lewiston, Maine, only to discover that the hospital has a sordid history and may be haunted. The story is told in the 1st-person point of view of this old lady who most people think is more than a little daffy. Eleanor claims to hear a young girl crying in the hospital's elevator, and the story takes on a conspiracy tone wherein the doctors do not believe Eleanor (or are trying to cover up what she knows). Keep in mind all of this is told from Eleanor's perspective, and as such the credibility of the narrator itself becomes suspect, which is also part of the fun of the novel.To me, the most interesting idea King develops in The Journals of Eleanor Druse is the conflict that occurs when someone believes they've experienced a religious event, and scientists tell them that what happened was only the result of chemicals in their brain. In Eleanor's case, she is thought to be epileptic. Some of our very best writers (see Connie Willis's \\"Passage\\" and to some degree Carl Sagan's \\"Contact\\") in the past few years seem to be exploring that division between what constitutes a religious experience and what is merely a result of too much serotonin in the temporal lobe. Is humanity's belief in God some mass delusion caused by a species with highly evolved imaginative faculties? It's a hell of a question, and one (as a young fiction writer myself) I will probably explore in several novels during the next decade.The Journals of Eleanor Druse only offers glancing shots at this very profound question, and with blurbs like \\"Watch Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital on ABC-TV\\" on the cover of the book, it's tempting to write this book off as an extended ad to help build hype for a TV show. There are very few books that Stephen King has written in the past decade that have genuinely captured my interest, and I only wish the so-called \\"Master of Horror Fiction\\" would act more like a Master than the witty used-car salesman he seems content to be.Stacey CochranAuthor of CLAWS available for 80 cents"},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"If you don't like King's adaptation of \\"The Kingdom\\", then that's fine. Each to his own. But I am absolutely fed up with this \\"King stole it\\" crap. First off, go to King's own website. It clearly cites \\"The Kingdom\\" as the original source for the ABC series. The Time magazine article (Feb. 24th, 2004) also credits von Trier.If ABC only wants to credit von Trier in the opening or closing credits of the episodes, that is their right. Most likely they are not including von Trier's name in the TV spots that are currently advertising the serires because MOST AMERICANS HAVE NEVER HEARD OF VON TRIER!They have, however, heard of Stephen King and King's fans are exactly the demographic that this show is going to be targeting. A handful of von Trier fans (most of which are probably going to stop watching early on claiming the original is better) are not going to keep this show's ratings up enough to remain on the air.So do your homework before you start making baseless claims.Overall, this book is very well written. The character of Sally Druse is very likeable. Also, be on the lookout for several literary jokes made throughout, which, refreshingly, the author didn't feel the need to explain to the audience. You either get them, and they enhance your reading of the book, or they are over your head. Nice to see an author with faith in his/her audience. I read it in one sitting yesterday in preparation for the premiere tonight. Personally, I felt the book was worth the money even though it ends abruptly and waits for the show to pick up the story."},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"Those with an interest in or penchant for the paranormal will be riveted to this reading by the author. A career spiritualist, Eleanor Druse, lives in Maine (as does Stephen King whose &quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot; will be on TV) and spent considerable time organizing the journals she has kept regarding her experiences with Kingdom Hospital.After surviving a near death experience when she visited a friend at that hospital, Druse spends some time at Boston General Hospital suffering from an unknown illness. Upon returning home she hears rumors about strange happenings at Kingdom Hospital and determines that she must investigate. She begins after soliciting the help of her son, Bobby, who is an orderly there.Among her discoveries is the fact that the Hospital is built on the site of a textile mill that was destroyed by fire after the Civil War. This conflagration also took the lives of many workers, child laborers included.Druse becomes convinced that the spirit of one child, Mary Jensen is imprisoned within the Hospital. She also senses that there are other evil spirits lurking among the corridors.&quot;The Journals of Eleanor Druse&quot; is a &quot;Kingly&quot; reading sure to chill and intrigue.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation of the Kingdom Hospital Incident","review":"I listened to the unabridged audiobook version of \\"The Journals of Eleanor Druse.\\" It was a wonderful, riveting read that went by quickly! More than once I found myself driving a little bit out of the way, or just sitting in my car once I arrived at my destination so I could hear just a little bit more of this story.Other reviewers have given the plot set-up and a few details. They mention Eleanor \\"Sally\\" Druse, her health issues, and her investigation of a possible haunting of Kingdom Hospital. All of this is accurate. I think it is important to make it clear that there's so much more in this book--layers of story! There's the question of whether Sally is having seizures or actual paranormal experiences. Her struggle to maintain control of her own healthcare as she ages, is fascinating. There's the mystery of the life and death of her childhood friend, Madeline Kruger (sp.?) ... there's the mystery of the little girl, and her history with Kingdom Hospital. And, there's simply Kingdom and its story.What I liked: I loved getting to know Sally, and witnessing her revelations. This was a truly wonderful character sketch--not just of Sally, but of her son, Bobby, and the other supporting characters. I thought Sally was a particularly interesting character because of her interest in meditation and the metaphysical. She brought just the right mix of belief and skepticism to the story. I picked this one up with some hesitance--I wasn't up for an extremely scary story. I was very happy to find that this book had just the right amount of spookiness. The tension and mystery in the atmosphere made for a very exciting read. There was so much interesting stuff to explore--especially the history in the walls of the new Kingdom Hospital. I wish this book had been longer!What I would change: The end. I think it cut off before a really satisfying conclusion to the storylines had been reached. Sometimes this can work, in this instance, it felt unnatural and forced. I would still recommend this book to others as a worthy read--but, be prepared for a very abrupt ending. On a very basic level, all storylines are resolved, but really, it felt like a bit of a cliffhanger ... I don't know if the TV series resolves the story.

While visiting a friend at Kingdom Hospital, she has a near-death experience and discovers that humans aren't the only inhabitants of Kingdom. The story starts out a bit slowly, but by the second chapter, I was completely hooked. The pace never lessens and the characters are believeable, especially vain neurosurgeon Stegman.

The prose is deceptively simple, the language clear and evocative. I appreciate that clarity in this novel. Though that simplicity is never dull, nor does it ever insult the intelligence of the reader. It seems to share the cripsness and careful wordchoice of really good poetry (think Ted Kooser) While reading through it I never got stuck on a sentence, found any particularly bad grammer, turns of phrase, cliches etc. The dialogue/setting/action/ and images are in nice balance.

Now he must rescue the children, and avoid becoming emotionally attached to the woman he left nearly a year ago.The fates intercede, as Grayson gets another girl in his life, a young orphan named Magda. She quickly becomes a unwitting cupid between the two, and slowly Lori and Grayson begin to realize that the spark they felt over a year ago is still strong.

She was dynamic, enthusiastic, generous, and dedicated. In Grayson's Surrender, it is clear those qualities transfer to her writing.Grayson's Surrender is a fabulous book that is so full of heart it is easy to forget you are not reading about real events or flesh-and-blood people. The plot is exciting, thrusting the reader into a normally closed world (military). The characters are so identifiable and compelling.Major Grayson Clark is a hero and a hunk. Of course, being married to a real-life AF pilot makes me biased. But there's something more here than a babe-magnet in a flight suit and Ray-bans.

As the wife of a career air force officer, Catherine Mann brings a fresh, authentic voice to Grayson's Surrender, \\"Book One\\" in the chronicles of C-17 Squadron, whose motto is \\"Anything. Anywhere. Anytime.\\"Doctor/pilot Grayson Clark gets a second chance at love with social worker Lori Rutledge when they take part in a mission to evacuate orphans from a war zone, and end up bonding with one little girl who needs them almost as desperately as they need each other. Gray is a sexy charmer whose committment-phobia is poignantly fuelled by his father's traumatic POW experiences and their effect on his family.Because of their past failed relationship, the sexual tension between Gray and Lori starts high and never lets up. Their journey to Happily Ever After is as beliveable as it is heart wrenching, when three wounded hearts risk reaching out in love to find mutual healing.A strong supporting cast will make readers eager to read more about the men and women of Squadron C-17. Fortunately, two more Wingmen Warrior books are in production with a fourth in the works. Be sure you don't miss out on this first one.

His father had served in Viet Nam as his mother struggled with the challenges as the wife of career officer. Those experiences left an indelible mark on Gray, defining his goals, his fears and his needs. Consequently, Gray vows that he will never marry or have children. Even when he fell in love with Lori Rutledge, he let her walk away rather than risk the pain his family had known. A year later they are thrown together in a mission to rescue orphans from a war torn country, risking life and limb to save seventy children.The moment Lori scoops little Magda into her arms, her heart goes out to the child. Later, when Magda's adoptive parents withdraw their petition, Lori opts to adopt the child herself. That decision sweeps Gray back into her life as well, as they oscillate between the pain of the past and the demands of the present. The daughter of gypsy parents, Lori craves the stability and security of home and family, things Gray refuses to provide. Despite impossibly conflicting goals and values, however, neither Gray nor Lori seem to be able to simply walk away and stay away.Author Catherine Mann brings the reality of her own experiences as a military wife to GRAYSON'S SURRENDER. Lori's struggle with her fear for Gray's safety, her need for stability, and her longing for family encapsulate the very essence of the challenges faced by military wives. Her determination to adopt Magda cannot help but touch reader's hearts. Gray's determination to remain aloof from his emotions even as he struggles with his desire for Lori and his growing concern for Magda culminate in a poignant scene when this huge service man plays Barbie dolls with this tiny, vulnerable child. Such profound moments lend GRAYSON'S SURRENDER an endearing, evocative undertone even as Lori and Gray's wills seem to violently clash. A powerfully told tale that all readers will treasure, GRAYSON'S SURRENDER comes very highly recommended.

This classical education I find evident in the mental images she creates - Her characters actually &quot;move&quot; within the reader's mind with the vibrancy and speed of a Shakespearean drama. For readers who enjoy romantic fiction, I recommend this well constructed and fast paced book. It weaves not only a unique plot, but also leaves the reader with personal questions, &quot;Am I in a box?&quot; &quot;When did I crawl into this box?&quot; The writer offers, not just a glib romance story, but a more profound statement on what it takes to live &quot;happily ever after.&quot; A &quot;To be or not to be&quot; questioning at the end, resolves quite nicely, but not without personal examination, a sacrifice of false pride, and a commitment to move forward.

Take the example of the female dabbler whose spell-casting backfired and she ended up possessed by a sex demon. She came to Bob the investigator already possessed and left the case still possessed! Absolutely no positive change in the afflicted situations! Case still left open and unsolved - unless \\"closure\\" means mere satisfaction of curiosity of whether or not she was actually possessed when all the signs were already there. Bob, PLEASE go back and retrieve your files on unsolved cases. Find that possessed woman and send her for a Roman Catholic exorcism. Same goes for the case on that haunted computer which channeled the works and spirit of a dead occultist. The story ended in this book with a child being possessed, so what and where are the solutions to this case? Cases left unsolved are problems unsolved.While Bob is an expert in his own right, a non-religious approach to cases involving demonic entities doesn't seem to work for long and the affected people and areas are left not much better than their original state. However, Bob and his sexy female ghost-buster associate did successfully resolve other cases of hauntings.

One could not even classify this as a mystery or suspense. It is really utter nonsense. It is insulting for the author to claim that he is a trained investigator in any sense.

Even so ultimately this book is really all that came of it as Tod Hartje's hockey career went nowhere really as a pro.I did love that Harvard grad Hartje was able to survive the season and plopping him in Kiev gave him further insights into Russian/Ukrainian hockey and everyday culture. The analysis of the 1980 USA gold medal run at Lake Placid was spot on. Hartje points out, as many are want to forget, the blunders of coach Viktor Tikhonov of pulling Hall of Fame goalie Vladislav Tretiak after just one period of action vs. the USA.Sadly, I should have picked up this book back in 1992 as it would have helped me avoid picking Dmitri Khristich in any hockey pool (as well as steered me away from most Russians who seem less than able to adapt to the sudden freedoms of the West--Vladimir Krutov, your burgers are ready!).Combine this with ex-Canadian national team coach Dave King's King of Russia and you have a good peek into Soviet/Russian society and its hockey culture that goes beyond the Boris Mikhailov robotic stereotypes."},{"Title":"From Behind the Red Line: An American Hockey Player in Russia","review":"This is a fabulous book for hockey fans of all ages and even for non-hockey fans just interested in some Soviet history.

Further, history must be based upon the historians thoughts not upon his or her feelings. He or she is obliged to present all the evidence, and to address any significant contradictory data to his or her interpretation. He or she is also obliged to acknowledge and respond to contrary interpretations. If he or she does not do this, he or she is not writing history but is writing a political tract or something even less centered upon the historical truth (like out and out propaganda).Brinkley fails to meet this standard period, and consequently, Tour of Duty is NOT a \\"piece\\" of history. The fact that is an election year actually only made it more incumbent upon him to have admitted his limitations and prejudices which should have been followed by an even more determined effort at objectivity because, after all, he is supposedly writing for the historical record (not of course to get Kerry elected). If Brinkley has political views that inhibited a balanced account, he simply should not have published this book as a work of history. We must never forget that tyrants (Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Castro, Pol Pot, Saddam, you name it)ALWAYS attempt to have history rewritten to make it more flattering or to comform to their own selfish interests, and even in inclusive societies such as ours, there are those who surrender to this temptation, a point Tour of Duty only makes too well!"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"There can be no question that this work is politically motivated. How else does one explain its convenient release during primary season? The author, who (surprise surprise)is a \\"liberal\\" historian and academic, had to know that Kerry was planning a run before beginning his research at least a year or more ago. This fact together with the entire tone of the work illustrate that, yes Virginia, it is a campaign book. Missing in action is the probable role that Kerry's privileged position as a friend of the Kennedy Klan played in his \\"war service\\" and\\"decorations\\" (PT-109 indeed). Also largely absent is a honest assessment of his subsequent efforts to undermind his country while it was at war (opposing a position was one thing during Viet Nam, actively supporting your country's enemies was something else entirely).What emerges here if one actually knows something about Kerry's life and career before starting, is a fairly masterful piece of propaganda, which is why I give it two stars. But let's remember that lots of men (including U.S. Grant, Douglas MacArthur, and Adolf Hitler) have been more geniunely war heroes than John Kerry, and most certainly would not or did not made good presidents. This is especially true for a man, like Kerry, who has done everthing inside and outside of office he can to undercut his country's defense. The good news is that if you want to see the President defeated for re-election, you will find enough illusion here to assuage your conscious in voting for a shallow opportunist like Kerry. But don't fool yourself that this book has anything to do with historical truth."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Okay, please allow me to point a few things things out: it is not only hypocritical but dishonest (and typical of the studied irrationality of the left) for those who have supported Bill Clinton (like almost all those who now applaud Kerry and this book), a man who ran away from any military service during Viet Nam, who participated in demonstrations against his country overseas, who is a personal physical coward, and who is on the record as &quot;hating the military&quot;, to now turn around and try somehow to imply that service in the Texas National Guard (whether that included a stint in Alabama or not, who really cares?) by our President was somehow dishonorable. They also conveniently ignore that fact that he is now among the most successful war time commanders-in-chief in our history, certainly far more successful than the last Democrat to find himself in that position, Lyndon Johnson.Nor is it especially impressive that they feel empowered to attack the President because he and his family have been successful financially, especially as their &quot;hero&quot; John Kerry has never had a real job in his life and has only become hugely weathly by leaching off of lonely rich women. If you study Tour of Duty closely, it is clear that John Kerry is just another Massachusett's rich guy and opportunist, who enjoyed a privileged military service during which he gave himself purple hearts, and had his rich connections arrange for a higher decoration for a minimal accomplishment. Equally clear is that his life and world view has had nothing to do with those of the &quot;people&quot; he pretends to want to lead, a fact only underscored by his propensity to change his position with every variation of the political winds.No amount of verbage, even that by a skilled writer like Brinkley, or vituperation by those who write here, is going to change the truth. Hopefully after November we can look forward to John Kerry at last achieving something geniunely substantial by his assumption of the mantle of that other Massachusetts champion, Michael Dukakis."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This book was both exciting and educational, Kerry has some brilliant ideas, and the backgroud of service to back them up. An inspiration for anyone who loves America."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This is my second review, and it is inspired by the startling naivet&eacute; demonstrated by the reviewer who insists that since Brinkley is a professional historian he could not, therefore, be politically motivated in his composition of this \\"biography\\" of John Kerry. I, too, am a professional historian, and while I cannot claim that my books match the popularity of Brinkley's, I have a professional understanding of the process of writing works in history. The reality is this: John Kerry as just a senator is not a subject of sufficient stature to merit such an explication of his life. Aside from his recent presidential efforts, he is but one of hundreds of men and women alive and dead who have served or who are serving in the Senate. He has no major legislation associated with his name; he has not been a real leader of the Democratic side of the upper chamber; and he was, until recently, not even much of a household name outside of Massachusetts. Historians choose their subjects with great care not only because good historical works require tremendous time, concentration, and luck in researching but also because publishers demand that they be at least reasonably marketable. Someone of Brinkley's status certainly would not bother to begin the arduous task of researching a biography of say Senator Mikulski of Maryland without the certain knowledge that such a work would be a greater public interest in the future - occasioned by, say, a run for the presidency. It is simply not reasonable to believe, therefore, that Brinkley did not know Kerry was going to make a presidential run in '04, and wrote Tour of Duty accordingly; it is even possible that he was approached directly or indirectly by Kerry's people or those of his mentor Ted Kennedy to write the work because that, children, is often how life works.Further, let us have a reality check about academia and historians. It is a rare scholar indeed who is employed as a professional historian either within or without universities and colleges who is not at least a strong liberal or socialists (at one major Big Ten school, the chair of the history department at one time was an open and passionate communist, who was saddened by the fall of the Soviet Union). This is not my opinion, it is objective fact well known within the profession. Scholars who do not conform can be and are denied tenure and promotion. Therefore, it is not only possible, but also probable that Brinkley is indeed a \\"knee-jerk\\" liberal, and certainly the content Tour of Duty only buttresses this contention. It is, I repeat, a rather skillful campaign book designed to attract votes for John Kerry. It is neither history nor historical biography, but is instead, like Kerry's public image, a clever manipulation of the truth."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I love politics and make a point of reading as much as I can about all the players - positive-negative-unbiased-etc. Because of this &quot;hobby&quot; I picked up Tour of Duty a few months ago (shortly after it was released, I believe) and on my shelf it collected dust until a trip.I had to partake a couple of plane trips within a months time for work, one in which I was going to be able to visit the Viet Nam wall and touch my cousin's name, so I decided to pick up Tour of Duty and even though I am not into &quot;war&quot; stories I was captivated.Again, I have read tons of political books from all sides and am very aware of &quot;propoganda&quot; both positive and negative and this one does not read as such (propoganda) and is a great adventure story...recalling that it is true - takes my breath away.I also find it interesting that I was finishing the book, during a week when J. Kerry was on the NBC Sunday morning show and pundits from the rep. party were decrying his military record for about a day and a half (the obviously had not read this book, or anything about this war) and by Monday evening those same pundits were saying in effect &quot;okay, he is a hero but this doesn't really matter.&quot; I found it so interesting to have watched these political events, while having the background of facts that this book produces.Whether you want to read about the Viet Nam war, John Kerry, a great adventure story or all of the above, I recommend heartily Tour of Duty. Let us just say that my opinion about the man, who is the subject of this book, was raised tremendously."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"1. Factcheck.org looked into the Swift Boat Vet controversy and summarized their ad like this: \\"[It] features vets who claim Kerry \`lied' to get Vietnam medals. But other witnesses disagree-and so do Navy records.\\"Factcheck.org notes that one of the key vets who signed a statement against Kerry wound up retracting it, saying to The Boston Globe: \\"It was a terrible mistake probably for me to sign the affidavit with those words. I'm the one in trouble here.... I knew it was wrong... In a hurry I signed it and faxed it back. That was a mistake.\\"2. Jim Rassman, the army lieutenant saved by Kerry during a firefight, directly contradicted many of the claims made by the Swift Boat Vets. Rassman supported Kerry's Bronze Star and has always backed up Kerry's version of the story.3. The Swift Boat Vets are politically funded by a major GOP donor, and are going after Kerry decades after the action in order to help their candidate-George W. Bush-retain control of the White House.4. Nightline went to Vietnam to research the facts of Kerry's Silver Star firefight disputed by the Swift Boat Vets, talking to local villagers who had witnessed the battle. Nightline discovered that Kerry's version of the story was correct.Present author has admitted he has some corrections to make and is working on a revision; no such comment from O'Neil who is proven to be false on many accounts. Brinkley is a professional who tries to get it right."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Let's establish a couple of things first: 1) Douglas Brinkley is a professional historian and director of the Eisenhower Center, the mission of which is to preserve and honor the stories and sacrifices of American servicemen from World War II through Vietnam and beyond. No one can reasonably accuse Brinkley of being a knee-jerk \\"liberal historian\\" who only wrote this book to flack John Kerry's presidential candidacy. 2) Brinkley began his research for this book in 2002, before Kerry ever decided to run. To the extent that Brinkley became an admirer of Kerry--and clearly he did--I would suggest that this was a RESULT of researching and writing this book, not a CAUSE of it.That said, this volume is without question an eye-opener. Regardless of one's political persuasion and what one may think of John Kerry's presidential candidacy, this book is an education. Brinkley reminds us of how divisive the conflict in Vietnam was for Americans and how ambivalent many young men of Kerry's generation were about serving. He also accomplishes one of his primary goals with this book, which is to enlighten readers about the largely overlooked riverine war in southeast Asia, and how dangerous it was for the men involved. John Kerry and many others served bravely and well in this battle, despite its often unclear or contradictory goals. It was as a direct result of his experience in combat in Vietnam, and his belief that we were clearly not winning the \\"war for hearts and minds\\" that Kerry came to oppose American involvement in the conflict and the way our political leaders were conducting it. Additionally, we learn that Kerry's current campaign to honor servicemen through proper funding of veterans' hospitals and services is not an election-year gimmick; this is a cause he has supported and fought for throughout his career. As a leader of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, Kerry's focus was to bring an end to American casulties AND to see that proper attention was paid to those who had already given so much. He constantly visited with disabled veterans and railed against the \\"shabby treatment\\" they too often received.Finally, given the current political climate, it is impossible--it was for me anyway--to read this book and not constantly reflect on the comparison between John Kerry and our current president. Again, regardless of where one stands politically, the intellectual and moral depth of these two men seems remarkably different. Here is 25-year old John Kerry writing in anguish to his girlfriend upon learning of the battlefield death of one of his best friends: \\"Right now everything that is superficial and emotional wants to give up and just feel sorry but I can't. I am involved in something that keeps pushing on regardless of the individual and which even with what has happpened must, I know deep, deep down iside me be coped with rationally and with strength. I do feel strong and despite emptiness and waste, I still have hope and confidence...Judy, if I do nothing else in my life I will never stop trying to bring to people the conviction of how wasteful and asinine is a human expenditure of this kind. I don't mean this in an all-consuming world saving fashion. I just mean that my own effort must be entire and thorough and that it must do what it can to help make this a better world to live in.\\"Can anyone even remotely imagine George W. Bush writing something like this when he was 25--or today?"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"In Tour of Duty, author Douglas Brinkley presents a thoroughly researched account of Senator John Kerry's years as a Naval Lieutenant in Vietnam. From the authors interviews with people who were actually there, we are led to the indubitable conclusion that Kerry, one of the most highly decorated swift boat officers during the Vietnam War, deserved his accolades. The book puts to rest the politically motivated revisionist spoutings of the so-called 'Swiftboat Veterans for Truth'. Also explored with great detail are Kerry's antiwar activities following his Vietnam service. It is interesting to find that the vast bulk of Kerry's work during this period was aimed at fighting for improved medical care and VA funding for injured and war-torn vets, demands that the Nixon administration ignored outright. Also notable is the fact that Kerry, when he senced that Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) was turning radical, resigned from the group in protest. This is something the SBVT and other Bush front groups certainly don't want the public to know about during this election cycle. Finally, we learn that the tactic of going back and attempting to discredit the service of honorable veterans is a remnant of a deplorable tactic used by the Nixon administration and Republican operatives some thirty years ago. Some things never change."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"John Kerry served bravely and with honors in Vietnam. He risked his life to save others. During a mission to insert troops on a riverbank, a Vietcong soldier fired a rocket at his boat. Lt. Kerry beached his boat, ran into the jungle, took out the enemy and returned with the rocket launcher, earning a silver star for gallantry in action.During another mission Lt. Kerry turned his boat around and headed back into the same enemy fire he had just escaped from to rescue a Navy Seal from certain death. While wounded in the right shoulder, Kerry pulled the Seal into the boat before leaving the scene. Kerry didn't even know the Navy Seal. He wasn't part of Kerry's crew, just a passenger but John Kerry brought him back alive.When John Kerry returned from Vietnam he protested to end the war, to save the lives of the soldiers that were still in a mistaken war. He risked his own future and fought the political establishment to save lives.In comparison, George Bush disappeared from duty when the air war heated up in Vietnam. On April 10-14, 1972 Richard Nixon began carpet bombing North Vietnam. Fighter planes were used as a slow moving screen to protect the B-52 bombers. Pictures of captured US fighter pilots appeared on the front pages by April 15. George W. Bush's last paid day as a fighter pilot with the Texas Air National Guard was the very next day, April 16, 1972 (according to records released by the White House).Bush stayed in Alabama for FIVE months before he received authorization to transfer there. In Alabama, Bush stopped flying, failed to take a required physical exam and allowed his flying status to lapse. He never went back to Texas until he received his discharge six months before his required end of service date."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"For anyone that is interested in knowing what makes John Kerry tick, this is a book that must be read. John Kerry's extraordinary devotion to public service can be explained by reading of his experiences, as detailed by Douglas Brinkley.

This book proves that John Kerry is indeed \\"America's Greatest Hero\\", and should be our next president of the United States.I was utterly enthralled as I read about Kerry and his \\"Band of Brothers\\" bravely raping and pillaging, on a daily basis, and burning down villages in the fashion of Ghengis Kahn. The section where Kerry witnessed the beheading of an innocent Vietnamese peasant by American troops is particularly rivoting! Of course, included is the suspense and intrigue of Kerry's fateful secret mission to Cambodia on Christmas Eve of 1968 at the direction of future-president Richard Nixon, a pivotal moment that Kerry says is \\"seared... seared\\" in his memory.John Kerry should be commended for this thorough, brave, and honest account of all aspects of his military service. Incredible!"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"A normal Tour of Duty lasts 1 year. For Kerry, it only lasted 4 months. And in those four months, Kerry collected a record three Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars and a Bronz Star? C'mon! If this were legitimate, Kerry would be a bigger hero than Audie Murphy!I know it's old news now. This book was intended to be and was a political tool to help Kerry become president in 2004. Kerry lost decisively. It's over. But for Kerry to say that he did all of these things is absolute nonsense. For Douglas Brinkley to claim this as history as like a movie producer claiming a fiction movie of a action hero (perhaps played by Chuck Norris) is history and reality too! C'mon! And there are still people giving this book five stars?PT Barnum would be proud of the efforts of Kerry and Douglas Brinkley.HURRY, HURRY, HURRY. COME SEE THE COMMUNIST TRAITOR JOHN KERRY WHO FINKED ONHIS COUNTRY AND HIS COMRADES. HURRY, HURRY, HURRY.

I was able to breeze through this book with much speed. It was almost comical how the author built into fact so many disassociated items of fiction. I wanted to challenge them as I read but there were so many. If this were a film, the critics would pan it as too unbelievable to be credible. One must approach this book in the context that what one reads is totally fabricated."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"It was just a little over 13 months ago that Americans flushed this john and voted for leadership. We didn't buy into the lies or false claims of heroism perpetrated by Kerry and writers like Brinkley who rely on their subject for facts (fat chance)The economy is moving well. Iraq is moving well regardless what Kerry says. This Kerry promotional piece did not work and thank God for that.HAPPY ANNIVERSARY AMERICANS!

The longest section of this book on Vietnam is excellent, based on Kerry's diaries. The second half does read like a campaign bio, with a uncritical look at Kerry's time w/ Vietnam Vets Against the War and Mass. politics. It wasdifficult to read, with Kerry constantly in the news on the attack against Dean. No politican is at his best when attaching someone else time and time again; the contrast between the Kerry in the book and TV is too great."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This book along with the book by George Butler is so full of crap and hype about Kerry that it makes me laugh. Should be listed as fiction and would make for a great novel. Everybody who really knows Kerry laughs whenever mention of this book is brought up.Those who knew Kerry back in 1966-67 knew how much he wanted to prevent being drafted and stay out of the service. Kerry claiming to be a war hero is like Michael Moore claiming to be an athlete. Give me a break!"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Just one of the many lies i n this book overlooked (????) by Douglas Brinkley was Kerry supposedly in Cambodia in 1968 and havinga telephone conversation with Pres. Nixon. HINT: Johnson was the president in 1968, not Nixon.To read this book 'TOUR OF DUTY', you'd swaer that Kerry was a real life Rambo when in fact, Kerry was more concerned with carrying around 8mm cameras and old fashioned and heavy Smith-Corona typewritters layingt he foundation for his future presidential campaign.In another regard, what happened to that BIG DRAFT KERRY said was goingt o happen in January 2005? And the reduced social security benefits? And the Herbert Hoover economy? These were just some of the lies that Kerry repeated over and over and over during his failed presidential campaign in 2004.But what really happened? There was no draft and 2005 is nearly over. Our seniors got a raise, not a cut in social security benefits and all economic factors show that the economy is doing just great thank you.Are you all glad that Kerry got whipped last year? Say yes.[...]"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Propaganda piece to make John Kerry look presidential. Doesn't do enough in covering John Kerry's radical extremism in slandering US GI's in Vietnam as war criminals and the bad guys. Kerry served a total of 4 months and this book makes it out like he is a regular Audie Murphy, do all for your brothers in arms. Kerry sought to get out after getting a third Purple Heart(due to very minor 'injuries') and got out after those 4 months, leaving those 'brothers in arms' to come back and join the pro-Hanoi, Fonda sponsored Vietnam Veterans against the War, a very radical, communist loving group that slandered the US and our troops still over there(The North Vietnamese used Kerry's supportive rhetoric as propaganda with our POWs) as the one committing the wrongs and this book attempts to sugar coat it. Kerry is a phony. This book is a phony."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"As a daughter of a army veteran and a true \\"indenpent\\". Many of those who died for the USA consider Kerry a traitor. Our family were there Nothing in this book changes that my opinion."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I read the excerpts from this book in the December, 2003 issue of the ATLANTIC magazine and was immediately impressed by the letters from the young, thoughtul John Kerry. As he described and synthesized his experiences in Viet Nam, he never stooped to simple-minded extremes. Following up by getting the entire book, I continued to be delighted by the depth of thought, intellect, and insight Kerry has shown throughout his life. Kerry has been wrongly trashed for his ability to see and try to interpret all the ambiguities that life offers; actually to read his writing should help doubters to see the expansive scope of his mind.I grew up in New Haven, CT and was a girl in &quot;junior high&quot; when Kerry volunteered for his tour of duty. I wonder if one of the reasons he volunteered was that the New Haven Register regularly had reports on the young men of the community--not the Yale community, but the New Haven community--who were injured or killed in Viet Nam. New Haven was (and perhaps still is) a schizy town: full of Italian and African Americans who did not have a lot of money watching the contrast of all the rich guys at Yale. One of them, George W. Bush, was arrested for stealing a Christmas wreath from a local home. Such were the shenanigans of the typical Yalie at the time. Yet John Kerry clearly must have been impressed by the disparity between New Haven regular citizens and the sons of privilege. He did what any brave person with a social conscience would do: he denied himself the undoubted privilege he might have had of ignoring the war, or doing a mysterious stint in the Natnl. Guard.Read his letters in this book and you will be impressed with the heart and soul of a young thinker. His promise has been fulfilled by the person he has become over the past 40 years."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"The truth has finally come out. The Swift Boat Veterans finally got it in the open.John Kerry is a liar, nothing more, nothing less"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This is a very well written story about a very brave person and a very turbulent time in our history."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I started reading it, but couldn't continue when I found out that the \\"Facts\\" were being altered by Kerry and Brinkley. In the meantime, read \\"Unfit for Command\\". It gives several excerpts from this book anyway. Then maybe when the new version of the NON fiction comes out I'll read it. Although, I thought NON fiction was truth and truth couldn't be changed... I guess it depends on whose truth it is. I gave it one star because it's pretty thick and I think it probably took a lot of imagination to come up with that much."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I purchased this book to try and learn a little more about the man who would be the Democratic nominee, and frankly I didn't feel I learned anything that his sound-bytes harp on me over and over. The book is a long and dry book that's quite slow of a read. Kerry strikes the reader throughout the book to continue to be a condescending bag of hot air aimed at ruining this country via his hypocracy."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I'm dissapointed to see such &quot;reviews&quot; as the reader from Chagrin Falls, OH - who decided to use what is usually a valuable resource when trying to decide whether or not to purchase a book to espouse his political opinions. Unfortunately, by doing so, he isn't held to the truth. Most of his so-called facts about Kerry have been proven to be false. I did appreciate the honest reviews provided by others, though (good and bad). Based on those, I am buying the book. I gave this five stars because I was required to in order to submit this &quot;review&quot; - even though I have not yet read the book. Maybe they will offset the one star given by our friend in Chagrin Falls and provide a more balanced overall rating."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"When in doubt change the subject, call people names, or make an appeal to emotion, right? Come on! Tour of Duty has nothing to do with the events of World War II (and certainly not Pearl Harbor). It has nothing to do with Max Cleland, other than the fact that like John Kerry he received a purple heart in Viet Nam - only in his case he suffered geniune wounds and became actually incapable of duty (unlike Kerry). If John Kerry is a hero, Tour of Duty fails to prove it, that is unless one's definition is so general and faith-based as to be objectively meaningless.You can run from the truth but you cannot hide, Tour of Duty is just a a campaign book glossing over the truth to create a false image of man who has no apparent ideals other than his own self advancement (\\"I oppose gay marriage, I also oppose any effort to ban it\\"), no apparent leadership skills skills other than following whatever he thinks will serve his political ambition (\\"I support the removal of the evil dictator Saddam, I oppose the president's poor judgement in invading Iraq\\"), and certainly not much value as a soldier, expense-paid-for-by-Jane-Fonda anti-war \\"activist,\\" or as an United States Senator - what has he ever actually done in that capacity that matters? Even this campaign biography, if read with some skepticism, can only confirms these sad truth about the liberal junior senator from Massachusetts."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I think the book is a well written and informative book about a man and his bravery, both in the war and his protesting of it. Those who belittle his accomplishments obviously are politically motivated and cannot compare their hero, G. W. Bush, with Kerry, other than say that they both went to Yale. Deliberately putting oneself in harm's way and deliberately avoiding harm's way are rather obvious distinctions to those of even small intellect, thus one might commend Brinkley for not stooping to conquer and just relying on facts."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This book is more a work of fiction than reality. As a historian Brinkley's book contributes nothing to the history of Vietnam and it is inaccurate in it's portrayal of Kerry's exploits. It relies too much on Kerry's diary and not enough on the recollections of the 200 plus men who served with Kerry. As a retired naval officer and a collector of navy medals for over 40 years, I found major holes in Kerry's records indicating conflict between the book and reality. Regretfully, Kerry has not released numerous pages of his record thus the truth of the matter will not be resolved. One would expect that if the records indeed supported Kerry, that he would have proudly shown them to the world. In the end, Brinkley's scholarship is lacking through a failure to pursue readily available sources. The result is an unbalanced view of Kerry and his service in the Navy."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I never got past the chapters of Kerry's experiences on the USS GRIDLEY. Since I served with him the entire year, I can assure readers that it is filled with exaggeration and fantasy. Kerry makes himself out to be Master and Commander when he was just a goofy boot Ensign. There are a number of things that are just plain not true and lots of exaggeration. It is not a serious work but clearly a piece of campaign fluff.Don't waste your money unless you are Democratic to the core and need some fluff to get you excited!"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Anyone curious as to how John Kerry surged to the front of the Democratic presidential race need only read this tremendously well-written and -researched account of his gallant tours of duty in Vietnam and beyond. Historian Douglas Brinkley does a terrific job of telling Kerry's heroic story, along the way tracing the compelling path of a thoughtful and highly principled politician. It hardly seems a coincidence that this book came out right before Kerry's leap to the top of the Democratic pack--anyone who reads it will see just how much this brave onetime Navy lieutenant could bring to the presidency. And whether one agrees with Kerry's politics or not, Brinkley's book not only offers a fascinating assessment of a crucial era in recent American history but is also just a darn good read."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I find it absoultely incredible that someone believes everything that is shoved down their throats. Just because some historian says that he is a hero does not mean that he is. I tried to read this book, but couldn't finish, it was that bad. Kerry's &quot;purple hearts&quot; shouldn't even count. I mean, look at the guy. He has NO visible injuries and he got out of vietnam with Purple Hearts???All three purple hearts were signed on the SAME DAY. John Kerry does not deserve to even be called a veteran, much less a hero."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Having already proven himself to be one of our best biographers today, with his books on Dean Acheson, JFK, FDR, Jean Monnet, James Forrestal, Henry Ford, Rosa Parks, and others, Douglas Brinkley has done it again with a terrific look at the truth behind an American veteran, politician and lifelong public servant.Only the ignorant and openly biased will dismiss this highly-detailed examination of John Kerry's war experience, from growing up in Denver and his education at Yale through to his trials, triumphs, and ultimate disgust with the Vietnam War. Any questions you have about Kerry's character or his military service - especially those invented by political opponents who instead backed a corrupt coward named W - you'll find the answers right here.If you value truth over hype and courage over self-serving cronyism, you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I can hardly believe that this book is being distributed as factual and historical. A respected author has written a political essay of propaganda. The mighty \\"hero\\" John Kerry is nothing but a liar and someone who has attempted to shame and hurt the image of a generation of brave American's who did what their country asked of them. His flagrant charges which are totally false were nothing but an attack on our country. How anyone could believe he is a hero is so mistakenly foolish to believe this nonsense. Do your own research. The truth isn't found in the pages of this trash. There were NONE of the atrocities written in the book. Where did Douglas Brinkley get his information? The truth is there are many respected Naval officers who were there as well as enlisted men who served WITH John F. Kerry LT (jg) USN who vouch for none of his charges. God help our great country if Senator Kerry becomes our Commander-in-Chief."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This is a well written and informative book. I've noticed that some of the reviews of the book do not review the book but advance a political outlook. Undoubtly the same reviewers rated books by Ann Coulter and others as great works even though they are poorly written and poorly researched. I severed 18 months in Viet Nam and when I returned in 1970 I also joined VVAW because it was an unjust, unwarrented war. Many of the reasons I chose to oppose this present war is bacause it is as assinine as Vier Nam. I am not opposed to war if the cause is just and the reasons clear, but any war based on lies and misinformation is wrong and does nothing but undermine the Nation."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Hopefully America has come to her senses and will restore honor and dignity to the White House. The current occupant is a disgrace to the flag, to the country, and everything Kerry bravely fought for."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Kerry is a pumpedup little windbag who has never done anything of substance in his life - that is the real story between the lines of this book. He is a multimillionaire thanks to his wives, has been the handpicked &quot;boy&quot; of the Kennedy clan, while all along having no real beliefs at all (as illustrated recently by his newly announced &quot;conviction&quot; that a fetus is a human being, which the polls show might be the more popular stance, but, of course, he is also on record as promising to appoint if he ever gets the chance &quot;pro-choice&quot; justices to the Supreme Court.) He has shown less leadership than the secretary of the local PTA, and the charisma of a sick bulldog (and a not dissimilar appearance).This book needs to be understood as part of the effort to coverup these truths. However, it has value because they are there; if you look past the &quot;gee whiz&quot; rhetoric of its obviously biased author, John Kerry emerges as the absolutely least suitable candidate the Democrat party has thrown up EVER, and that includes such lumnaries as George McGovern (who was at least a man of integrity),Michael Dukakus. Jimmy Carter.Among other things this book amply answers the question as to why the terrorists and the French want Kerry to win. Have you ever wondered why? Well, if you were at war with United States, who better as president than a guy who has based his career upon subverting one American war effort and then has consistently voted against every major upgrade of his country's military efficiency (M1 tank, Apache helicopter, you name it)? So if you are geniunely interested in the truth about John Kerry the pacifist, trophy husband, and militant opponent of America's ability to defend itself, get this book and try to read it objectively!!"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Much of what we hear about John Kerry - good and bad - is exposed in this fascinating tale of Senator Kerry's life through the early 1970's.Kerry's arrogance is apparent in numerous incidents during his school days, in Vietnam and with the Vietnam Veterans Against the War.However, his bravery, intelligence, and commitment to his country also come through loud and clear.Douglas Brinkley is an great historian and an even better story-teller."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I'm still reading this book but had to post some comments. Sad how the Vietnam War and service in it is still so devisive.I knew of Kerry's service and post war activities but the fact that he volunteered while harboring doubts about the War was a revelation to me. That took guts. For those that see some conspiracy or plan in Kerry's service, I fail to see it. When he asked to command a Swift boat, they were not involved in much action-merely patroling the coast. How could this been aimed at some false heroism and a political future? These boats were sitting ducks once they did enter the rivers and had high casualty rates. That's how Sen. Kerry could get wounded and recieve the medals in such a short time. Hard to see how one could be in harm's way with an eye toward a career in politics when by that very act, you endanger your future.As a young man, Kerry had no great fortune or political connections. If he had, he'd have used them to avoid serving like many others.I didn't start out a Kerry fan but I have been converted."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"When excerpts from Douglas Brinkley's forthcoming book on John Kerry and the Vietnam War appeared in The Atlantic in December 2003, I couldn't help feeling sorry for the author. Obviously he had spent a lot of time researching and writing a book that would be forgotten before the ink was even dry. Of course, at that time Senator Kerry's campaign for the presidency was dead in the water, while the supposedly smart money was accumulating around Howard Dean.Now Douglas Brinkley has the last laugh. His time spent on \\"Tour of Duty\\" looks like a shrewd bet. Not only has Kerry locked up the Democratic nomination to challenge George W. Bush--his experiences in the Vietnam War have become central to the campaign in a way few could have predicted.Anyone hoping to gain a better understanding of the veteran senator who would be president should start here. Brinkley shows Kerry's growth from youth to manhood through the harrowing crucible of the Vietnam War. Anyone who doubts the genuine courage and skill that Kerry showed as a Navy lieutenant in that conflict must contend with the evidence that Brinkley has amassed. With the cooperation of his subject, he has also produced a highly intimate portrait of Kerry's thoughts and writings at the time. Brinkley thereby succeeds in warmly humanizing a public figure often criticized for aloofness.Brinkley's Kerry is a compelling Renaissance Man: brave soldier, compassionate friend, charismatic politician, agile intellectual, avid sportsman. In short, he's a little too good to be true. And that's where one begins to have some doubts about this book. An associate of the late Stephen Ambrose, Brinkley seems to be a serious historian. And one might expect him to be broadly sympathetic to his subject--if he weren't, I doubt that Senator Kerry would have offered him access to his private papers.Still, Brinkley seems reluctant to criticize Kerry or even raise questions about his motives or judgment. This becomes more apparent when the narrative shifts from Mekong Delta war stories to antiwar protests and political campaigns. The final chapter, a glowing description of Kerry's presidential announcement in September 2003 (an event which seemed to fall flat at the time), reads like a ghostwritten hack campaign biography.It's too bad, because Brinkley was ideally situated to place the strengths and weaknesses of Kerry's candidacy in the context of his past. (A first-class example of this type of book is David Maraniss' biography of the young Bill Clinton, \\"First in His Class\\".)Brinkley's book also seems to have been rushed a bit into publication. Editors of political books ought to be able to spell Rep. John Dingell's name right, for example, and to know that Chuck Hagel is a Republican Senator from Nebraska, not a Democrat.That being said, Brinkley has produced a truly useful piece of work. Both Republicans and Democrats will be studying it carefully--the former probing for weaknesses, the latter looking for reassurance. But if John Kerry is half the man Doug Brinkley seems to think he is, the Republicans should be worried, and the Democrats should be proud."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I saw Doug Brinkley interviewed on the Today Show about this book and, although I don't know much about John Kerry, I thought &quot;Tour of Duty&quot; sounded interesting so I got a copy. Regardless of one's political views, this is an extraordinary book about the life and experiences of a young soldier in Vietnam grappling with what it's like to kill, survive emotionally and physically in a hellish environment (Kerry was wounded several times), and come to terms with a conflict he ultimately thought to be unwinnable--even thought he was right in the middle of it. This is not a Kerry campaign book, but a phenomenal, unbiased work of history on Professor Brinkley's part and, without question, one of the best and most riveting war books I've read. And I read a lot of them."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Douglas Brinkley, a respected historian and biographer, has put together an extensively researched, well-written portrait of a young John Kerry as well as a fascinating account of an important period of American history.Whether you like Kerry the candidate or not, this book will provide insight to the man. Kerry, by the way, gave Brinkley unrestricted access to his letters, journals, and personal papers, and exercised no editorial control over the end result. (And yes, Brinkley interviewed dozens of vets who served with Kerry.)It is telling of Brinkley's professionalism that in almost every subsequent article or commentary about Kerry, \\"Tour of Duty\\" is used as a point of reference. The book is cited line and page to settle points about Kerry's life and times. It is also a mark of Brinkley's journalistic integrity that the paperback edition contains clarifications suggested by readers and interviewees.When you scan the O'Neill/Corsi hit piece, compare the quality of the writing, research, and tone to Brinkley's. Like comparing Rush Limbaugh to Edward R. Murrow.(An aside to a prior reviewer - even the FR site has exposed the old \\"Giap thanks Kerry\\" bit as an urban legend. Get with it.)"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I had no plans to read this book, but after receiving it as a gift, I gave it a whirl. I am glad that I did. While Brinkley deserves some chiding for only bringing campaign biography analytical rigor to the subject, he does a fine job of describing John Kerry's life during the Vietnam era, and more generally, presenting the difficult choices that Americans of Kerry's generation faced. Kerry comes off as an admirable (though certainly not faultless) young man making his way through difficult time with intelligence and integrity."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"How to deal with the actual, living experience of war, then and now, is the underlying topic of Douglas Brinkley's troubling book. Troubling because in John Kerry's experience of Vietnam as a young soldier, there were no easy answers or solutions, even when it was clear that the war was wrong. How to behave? What decisions to make? How to maintain loyalty to one's comrades and decency to one's enemy? How to think about the experience years later, and apply it to the radically different environment created by the interplay of George W. Bush's insistence on invading Iraq and Saddam Hussein's efforts to disguise his own weakness, in a period when the CIA was warning he had the ability to kill millions with biological and chemical weapons, and was still seeking nuclears. No simple answers here, only the guidance that one has to do one's level best with the struggle to do the right thing. A powerful book, but not a happy one. What it does suggest that John Kerry has been through a crucible that would make him more cautious and serious than the people who got us into Iraq, and the compassion and empathy for others that might make him more capable of helping us find solutions for where we are now with Iraq and with the world."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Brinkley's text helps explain why every one of Kerry's crew members in Vietnam, regardless of party affiliation, are supporting him in his quest for the presidency. Brinkley's account describes an especially mature, serious, and thoughtful young man, trying to do what he feels is right for the country. Kerry's enormous courage, integrity, patriotism, and strength of character are on full display here. If you want to get a sense of what type of person John Kerry is, read this book."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I really expected nothing but rah-rah, Kerry boosterism from this book but was surprised at the candor of the material. I was particularly interested in the Swift Boat era. According to this, John Kerry signed up for a second Viet Nam tour as a Swift Boat commander not because he wanted to be in the thick of the action but rather to have his own command. Only after he arrived in Viet Nam did he discover that he got more than he bargined for. Roy Hoffman (who now is now a critic) was the one who came up with the dubious use of Swift Boats in the Mekong Delta. In other words it appears that Kerry saw all the action he did because of circumstances not rabid heroism.The \\"Winter Soldier\\" hearings and the subsequent Senate Foriegn Relations Committee testimony is also viewed with candor. If people would bother to read it they might have very different views of Kerry's role at that very difficult time.An enjoyable read with some gingerbread and some warts to spice things up. Refreshingly positive overall."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Kerry's biggest crime is, of course, that he is everything their hero is not. Kerry served in Vietnam, honourably in both senses. He got wounded three times - which meant his tour of duty was over, and he got a medal for bravery. However, he also served honourably in that he questioned the actions of his fellow soldiers. Just this story about how they were supposed to treat local fishermen; Kerry was disgusted. Does that show a flip-flopper? Kerry's even greater moment of bravery came when he stood up against the establishment and spoke out. This book is more than an ordinary biography, it also covers the brown water corps, and it is also a story about an intelligent young man that learns that life is more complex than he was tought.Contrary to what the detractors of the book claims there are plenty of sources, not just Kerry's war diaries. The writing is actually quite riveting, Brinkley can write, but still sober. A far cry from the somewhat shrill and desperate tone of Unfit for Commmand."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I had hoped for an insightful biography of John Kerry. This is just a whitewashed story of his life. Everything is bathed in positive rays of sunshine. People who did not like John Kerry are described as being part of a &quot;cult of envy&quot;. It's hard to believe this book is not satire; Kerry is the Doc Savage of his generation. The stories of the war years were more interesting and kept me from rating the book lower. I will still be searching for a true, objective biography of the man."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This book was well-written and well-researched, regardless of how I may feel about Kerry's political stance. My husband is retired Navy, a veteran of the riverine war in Vietnam. My husband read this book and recommended it to me, not on the basis of the character (or lack thereof) of John Kerry but because the descriptions and history of the riverine war were accurate. For those who want to disparage the book, there are numberless accounts of Vietnam veterans whose time in-country lasted a day or lasted five years. My husband reads every one he can get his hands on, so I know they are out there. That he recommended this to me above so many others he has read is because, in his words, &quot;this one is accurate.&quot; Forget that John Kerry happens to be the sailer in question and study the Vietnam War."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I enjoyed this book. John Kerry seems to get more interesting the more you look into him. The portrait given is a moralist, a thinker, who struggled with the great questions of his age. I hope more people will read about Kerry's life, not just judge him by the sound bites and attack ads. Brinkley does a good job of humanizing the man behind the political persona."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"If as an undecided voter one takes one's responsibility AS a voter seriously, and if one can see past the jingoistic flag waving and fact-free, supremely childish and shameful attacks on this man's service record, this book is well worth the read. At the very least you're left with a man who isn't afraid to face combat but clearly understands that a)it should only happen when all other options have been exhausted, and b)when it happens the US government has a solemn responsibility to its troops. I'm convinced that Kerry won't ever send US troops into harm's way so poorly equipped that they have to have their parents send them flak jackets. (Think I'm making that up? Do your research.) This book is admittedly not a fully balanced critique of the man, a senator flawed just like the rest of us. It has a point of view, like all books, but presumably someone with a mind can come to their own conclusions and this book is simply a tool to assist us in making a very important decision. To regard this man as a traitor, especially after one reads the book, is simply infantile beyond measure and intellectually lazy. The guy's carrying shrapnel around in his body, he saved a man's life, he beached his craft and went after the enemy on his own, he got shot after VOLUNTEERING FOR COMBAT DUTY, in a war that he easily could have avoided. I guess that just doesn't add up to an unelected president who protected the skies over Houston, but only when he felt like it. If you're a fair minded person, read the book."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"After I bought this book and started reading it, I discovered that the author, Douglas Brinkley is doing a rewrite because some of the information provided by Senator Kerry has turned out to be false and misleading. And as I understand it, the changes are still coming. Perhaps Mr. Brinkley should have done himself a favor, and written this book in pencil. It's a lot easier to clean up the errors that way. Are they going to issue free addendums of the new rewrites, or am I going to have to buy a whole new book to get the newest version of Kerry's story?"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This book is nothing but lies and propaganda.

Nothing but \\"Walter Mitty\\"."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Only John Kerry would allow a book like this to be printed about himself. John Kerry, the guy who tried to get out of going into the service on a deferrment and when that was denied pulled every lowdown, dirty trick he could come up with including applying for fake Purple Hearts so he could get out early, go home, run a phony anti-war campaign and then run for President.The biggest insult of all was at the DNC back on July, 2004 when Kerry made that phony salute and said \\"I'm John Kerry reporting for duty.\\" 34 years earlier, Kerry was singing quite a different tune. More like \\"I'm John Kerry trying to get out of the service on a deferrment.\\" OR \\"I'm John Kerry trying to rack up phony Purple Hearts from self inflicted and minor scrapes so I can get the heck out of here and go home.\\"As if Kerry's military background was not a myth, we now all know that his supposed academic prowess was also a myth. While Kerry claimed to be an A student, in fact he was a D student. And that great speech that he made in 1971, supposedly prepared by Kerry in the wee morning hours with little preparation was in fact written for him by Robert Kennedy's speechwriter who had been coaching Kerry for months. But why be surprised? Has Kerry ever told us the truth about anything? Answer: No!What happened to that big draft Kerry said was coming for sure in January 2005? And how about those reduced social security benefits for our seniors that republicans were supposed to install according to inside information that Kerry had? Looks like the only draft is between Kerry's ears and just last week our seniors got the second biggest raise on their social security benefits since Bush I was president and raised benefits back in 1991.So is Kerry misinformed or just a flat out liar? Check out the heroic military image that he created for himself. Does that tell you something? It's not rocket science."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Tour of Duty was just another example of the ineptitude of the Kerry people and how they underestimated the survivors, the real heroes of Vietnam. Perhaps Kerry, Brinkley and company thought that these brave heroes would forget or would not come forward or were dead.Perhaps Kerry and his minions thought that nobody would check and let Kerry get away with his flagrant lies about heroism. NOT ON OUR WATCH!The title of t his book is also just another example of how Kerry tries to align himself with hollywood. In this case, taking a title that was a popular tv show. Sorry, but the actors in that tv show were better. The only comparison is that in both cases, it is all ficion. In the case of this book, the fiction part has been taken to an extreme.Nice try, but this pr campaign to try to land Kerry a seat in the oval office didn't work. Too many people know the facts about Kerry.I also recommend that you check out wintersoldier.com for more info on Kerry. The real John Kerry."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Sorry, but if the vote were today, I'd have to go with Nader, with Kerry my reluctant, weak second choice. Brinkley was USED in writing this book but only because he allowed himself to be used. He has revised its anecdotes since publication, in order to assist Kerry, only to find both his original tales AND his revisions contradicted by Kerry, through Kerry's \\"people\\". The result is that it is dangerous to cite this book or rely on it for quotes. It is insanity for Kerry to build his candidacy around his service in southeast Asia. Brinkley must be quite enamored of Kerry in order to put up with this destruction of his credibility. It's a pity."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"If you believe the picture painted in this book about Kerry, I have a bridge for sale.

I'm not a big fan of war stories but this was very well researched using stories of the men on the ground as well as providing the historical context of what was going on during the time period. I found this book thought provoking and very well written. This was the first book I read by Brinkley and I look forward to reading more of Brinkley's works.I am stunned by the partinsin comments in the other reviews here. It's not that I'm shocked people have opinions but that their voices are filled with venom."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I find it really interesting that Kerry's political enemies find it necessary to write a review of this book on Kerry and they did not even read it. They also invent supposed letters from people who served with him during the war to attack him. Now they are attacking a historian who has published around forty books. Half of them have been reviewed by readers. All but two have scored at least 4 stars, usually 4.5 stars. Why do they do this? Are they afraid that Bush can't beat Kerry on the issues or his record? Why can't they write opposing views on this positions using facts or against his previous votes? But, don't distort those votes. Remember when Dick Cheney was Defense Secretary he started cutting funding for the military and for the current weapons that helped us in Afghanistan. Check out the congressional record for the proof. Why can't we have a civilized political discussion instead of attacks of personal destruction? I believe this is what they call the right wing attack machine."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"A memo to:Jack in Toronto,I have a suggestion for you. Pick up John Plaster's book -- &quot;SOG&quot; or Hal Moore's book, &quot;We Were Soldiers Once and Young&quot; then expound on how heroic John &quot;Kahn&quot; Kerry was in his 4 month tour of Vietnam in comparison to the real men who fought, received Medals of Honor, were wounded and were killed in the Vietnam war from which John &quot;Kahn&quot; Kerry deros'ed home early, to accuse of disgusting and untrue acts, to further his own narcissistic ambitions.Brinkley's book to me was a waste of time, although the truth of Kerry's egotism, arrogance and unscrupulous ambition is there for all but the blind to see.Kerry ranks even lower in the eyes of millions of we Canadians than all of the deserters and draft dodgers who found refuge from serving their country in Trudeau's socialist Canada and that's about as low on the scale of cowardice as one could be. This may come as a revelation to you but there were upwards of 20,000 to 40,000 (never an accurate statistic) Canadians who crossed the border to join the forces and fought in Vietnam. John &quot;Kahn&quot; Kerry included them in his anti-war accusations of 'baby killers and murderers' which many will never forgive."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Can anyone expect an unbiased treatment of this subject matter during an election year? I have only one response. You can't expect an honest answer from an open hand. Furthermore, what is really being reviewed here. Is it John Kerry's bid for the presidency or Douglas Brinckley's merits as a historian. The two are not inextricably linked. This is a piece of scholarship to be added to the historical record. It is an excellent book. How dare anyone bring anything else into a review of the book. (Somethings Fishy). This book is about war and not the 2004 presidential election."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Brinkley often refers to Kerry's service on board Navy ships cruising in the Eastern Pacific, showing that he is directionally challenged, and also demonstrating that he had no experienced navy people read the manuscript before publication.All sailors and naval officers know the word \\"Westpac\\" as being that ocean area close to Asia and its many exotic ports. If Kerry was gaining his naval experience cruising the Eastern Pacific, he was very close to his San Diego apartment, far, far from Nam. An inexcusable error showing sloppiness on the part of the author.Then there is PCF-94's mission 91 0n Feb 28,1969, when Kerry abandoned his Swift boat, M-16 in hand, to chase down an enemy combatant in the forest, a clear violation of the rules of engagement. \\"We had been taught at Coronado (in training) that we weren't supposed to become jungle fighters,\\" his crewman, Sandusky, said. (Page291)In so acting, Kerry left his craft unattended, hazarding boat and crew. Lucky for him, his superiors did not decide to court-martial him. His audacious, albeit improper, conduct got him a silver star instead.The Silver Star is normally given for \\"Gallentry in Action\\" and is the nations third highest award for Valor, but it is sometimes given for political purposes. Look up the Silver Star given to LBJ in WWII to see what I mean."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"The book reads very well, but the analysis is pure political puff. As a Vietnam Vet, I can tell you that atrocities were few and far between. Brinkley ignored most of the Swift Boat charges against Kerry. He presented most of the Winter Soldier \\"Investigation\\" as fact when much of it has been discredited.It is interesting to read this book in conjunction with Unfit for Command. You get a totally different interpretation of what went on. And it appears to me the numerous officers who contributed to Unfit for Command have it right.One of the interesting things is that Brinkley never even bothered to delve into Kerry's admission on the Cavette and Russert shows that he committed war crimes, including the burning of civilian homes. Hard to believe he did not ask that question. A glaring ommission."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This book makes for very worthwhile reading in light of the current controversy generated by the anti-Kerry SBVT campaign currently being waged (and seemingly unraveling as the credibility of the funding and some of the witnesses is being called into question.) The book provides descriptive accounts of the incidents that led to Kerry's military honors, as well as the official reasons given for the medals, as signed for by the commanding officers responsible. This seems conclusive enough as far as I'm concerned. But the strength of the book is in the way it portrays the murkiness of war, the concessions made by those responsible for managing it, and the effect it had on John Kerry, who comes across as a reflective, insightful citizen, determined to get involved in shaping society and applying the lessons learned from his wartime experience. There are extensive quotes from his journals that give ample evidence of his ability to see the big picture (I could never imagine G.W. Bush articulating his thoughts and impressions so effectively) and numerous interviews with men who fought and served side by side with him in Vietnam and elsewhere. This book helps me understand what drives John Kerry and what he and others in his generation went through during the entire span of the Vietnam war era. People should read this for themselves, *especially* if they've chosen to read \\"Unfit for Command.\\""},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Douglas Brinkley has done it again in writing a cohesive vision of the Viet Nam War as seen through the eyes of John Kerry. I read as many books as possible about this era in American history, mainly due to the personal interest I have because of family members who served, and some who died. Those who return are seldom willing to talk about their experiences in any depth, and no wonder.I have to admit my rating of \\"5\\" was influenced also by the venomous rankings I saw here, which largely seem done by people who are against Mr. Kerry personally, rather than by anyone who read the book.

BUT, do NOT bother to read the following FACTS (verus SPIN) unless youre 'really' interested in thee TRUTH !!! ====================================================== But 1st, altho I'm not going to dwell on the suspicion of 3 Purple Hearts (from seperate events) within only 4 months. (But, I am REALLY curious as to why kerry still refuses to sign \\"form #180\\"...and release his combat medical records for public observation...WHY?!). ====================================================== Now, as to FACTS about what kerry has really said and done since VietNam...that everyone should be aware of!: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - --- His liberal record is clear: from his anti-Vietnam war activities (based upon exaggerated anti-American claims); To his support of the brutal Sandinista regime in Nicaragua (as he openly underminded Reagens attempts to confront them); And also his participation in the Soviet created and supported \\"nuclear freeze\\" movement...allalong John kerry has most always been on the 'other side'...vigorously campaigning for anti-American causes! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - --- Indeed, had he succeeded in his various attacks on the interests of his/our country, a defenseless U.S. would have faced a grim future of living under Soviet nuclear blackmail! Plus, the people of Nicaragua would still be captives of communist dictatorship...(Just as the people of South VietNam have had to suffer under Communism, mostly due to a devided America as a result of all the anti-war protests here at home!). --- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Maybe ypou just dont want to believe the above...so, lets proceed with thee FACTS (you can research for yourself!).====================================================== Tragically, kerry succeeded brilliantly in one of his signature campaigns, helping to condemn the people of South Vietnam to the horrors of life under a communist dictatorship...which today still honors kerry as one of 'THEIR' war heroes! As he preens himself in the glow of misplaced admiration for his 'alleged' heroism during his (ONLY) four months in combat in Vietnam, he carefully shies away from any real discussion of his sordid anti-American activities. He doesn't like to discuss how he 'slandered' his comrades still fighting in the jungles of Vietnam, calling them war criminals and baby killers. (Nor will he sign form #180 that exposes FACTS related to his so many medals in such a short period of time... that reqiured little IF any hospitilizatin!). --------------------------------------------------------- For kerry's valiant service on behalf of the Communist Vietnamese government, Kerry was awarded a special commendation as a \\"Hero of communist victory in 1983\\"... (while he was Lt. Governor of Massachusetts)! Kerry's contribution towards THEIR victory over 'us' was cited by General Vo Nguyen Giap, (the military commander of North Vietnamese forces); when in his 1985 memoir Gen. Giap wrote that: \\"IF it were NOT for the disunity created by stateside protests, Hanoi would have ultimately surrendered.\\" Earlier, the N. VietNam military leader also said that: \\"We were losing and demoralized...But; then our political leaders advised that America was NOW devided, and thus with patience and persistance we could eventually prevail!\\". (Well, hanoi kerry was 'THEIR' field general back here in America...helping to devide America which lead to our Defeat! For lets NOT forget that America never lost any major battles during the war...which we should of won!). Thus, kerry earned THEIR award, having aided and abetted OUR enemy, as he actually helped to prolong the war which lead to even more American casualties! Today, a photo of Kerry being greeted by Do Muoi, General Secretary of VietNams Communist Party, is displayed in a room dedicated to his anti-war protesters in the Vietnamese Communist War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City. ====================================================== Next, during the Reagan administration, Kerry got another chance to turn on his country. In the fall of 1983 the KGB launched an all-out \\"peace offensive\\" via a welter of front organizations in the U.S. and Europe. A nuclear freeze at that moment would have meant permanently freezing the Soviet ADVANTAGE in troops and weapons... precisely the Kremlin's main objective! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- So, as Kenneth Timmerman wrote in \\"The French Betrayal of America: \\"...in the United States \\"the nuclear freeze movement won the support of key (liberal) Democrats in Congress as well as that of political gadfly Jesse Jackson. Jackson's Operation PUSH joined forces with the Communist Party USA AND the 'Soviet-backed' U.S. Peace Council...in demanding nothing less than the unilateral dismantling of the U.S. Military!\\" ---------------------------------------------- - - -----For those to young to remember, the entire nuclear freeze moment was a Soviet initiated and financed attempt to undermine President Reagan's nuclear strategy, which even then was beginning to drive the Soviet Union into an arms race that it could NOT win, and would eventually bankrupt them! UN-fortunately, kerry also reported for duty in that movement...(once again undermining American efforts to confront a brutal enemy!). - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Then in 1985, after elected to the Senate (with the help of the nuclear freeze PAC), kerry spoke at a nuclear freeze conference in Geneva. There he pandered to European pacifists with the absurd claim that: \\"IF it were not for the freeze movement, I'm confident that America would not be in Geneva today talking with the Soviets\\"...(clearly undermining Reagens efforts!). Well, as an early backer of the nuclear freeze movement, kerry had climbed into bed with European leftists who (wrongly) denounced Reagan as a 'reckless cowboy' for daring to counter Soviet SS-20 missile emplacements in Eastern Europe with U.S. Pershing IIs...(which helped us WIN the Cold War...despite kerry's misguided efforts!). --- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Thus, true to his liberal based Appeasement nature..... In 1985 Kerry introduced the Comprehensive Nuclear Freeze Bill, and, also sponsored two amendments to freeze the Strategic Defense Initiative (related to our nuclear development). All of this was in complete opposition to the sucessful policies of the Reagan White House, which was trying to pursue an aggressive strategy of 'keeping up the pressure' on the Evil Soviet Empire. But, History shows that Reagen's strategy ultimately succeeded, despite Kerry's, And, the KGB's efforts to derail it! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - So, IF kerry's liberal based Appeasement legislation had passed, it would have completely undermined the valid policies being pursued by Reagens White House, and thus prolonged the Cold War (very likely to this very day!)! Thus, had kerry been in charge of fighting the Cold War against Communism, the Soviet Union would still exist. Once again kerry backed the \\"other side\\" at one of the most crucial moments in the Cold War! ====================================================== So, this is the man whom the American people should allow to conduct the War on Terrorism?!. --------------------------------------------------------- Throughout his career Kerry's attitude towards communism has been as NAIVE as his current approach to Terrorism. (Plus, lets not so quickly forget the absurd statement kerry made before the senate in 1971: \\"that we can NOT confront Communism all around the world!\\". Well, kerry's judgrement was wrong then...just as it's wrong now!). Thus, it seasy to see why that this man now backed by the Communist Party in America (as well as abroad) ! ====================================================== Thus, is it any wonder that Communist terrorists, (such as the Sandinistas in Nicaragua), could always count on his liberal gullibility...as when Daniel Ortega met with Kerry in Managua. Back then Ortega promised to obey the Contadora Act for Peace and in Central America; But, just a few days after meeting with kerry he flew off to Moscow to get a check for $200 Mil from his Soviet masters. Yet, incredibly, even as Ortega was pocketing his Soviet check kerry was on the Senate floor telling congress that they didn't need to support the Contras since Nicaragua was now free of Soviet influence (based upon just a false promise)! -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - For a full account of Kerry's shameful conduct see Dave Eberhart's May 20, 2004 story in NewsMax.com! See thee FACTS yourself about how kerry took Extreme efforts helping the Communist Ortega, and thus Undermining Reagens proper (and successful) efforts trying to confront Communism! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Well, it's no wonder that Kerry has been endorsed by T&oacute;mas Borge, the terrorist-friendly Sandinista leader, (notorious for his brutality when his old communist regime still ruled Nicaragua)?! ====================================================== UN-fortunately, kerry reminds one of the naive Neville Chmaberleign whom lulled the world into a FALSE sense of security based upon his FAILED policy of Appeasement; as he paraded around Europe hailing \\"Peace in OUR time\\" , after every (FAILED) meeting with Hitler...(which only allowed him to grow stronger during thee time that Hitler's rise could of been PRE-Empted!)! ====================================================== Well, like Neville, kerry's naive Appeasement based 'Liberal' attitude was WRONG before...just as it is Wrong NOW ! --------------------------------------------------------- So, this is the man whom the American people should allow to conduct the War on Terrorism?!."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Too bad Brinkley missed the boat with this pack of lies.

Kerry seems to have spent vast amounts of time writing in his journals. The book seems to be surprisingly synchphantic, I lost count of how many \\"spellbinding speeches\\" Kerry gave to save the day. He is vague when he wants to be and glosses over, or even omits certain facts, such as the trips he took to Paris to meet with the representatives of the Viet Cong. His campaign has been forced to admit that he did in fact go to Paris just after his honeymoon in 1970, but refuses to divy up what Kerry talked about, other than it was a \\"fact-finding mission.\\" The book also says of John being at the Detroit Winter Soldier Hearings, that he was there to listen, on a \\"fact-finding\\" mission, and to make vague suggestions to the participants aboutwhat \\"atrocities\\" they were going to confess too. He sugar coatsjust about everything, his explaination of how he got his threepurple hearts is interesting. He admits that earlier in the dayhe got \\"tiny bits of grenade shrapnel and rice pellets blown inhis ass\\" after someone blew up a rice hootch. There were no enemy in the area at the time. Later the same day comes the famous saving of Rassman, where Kerry claims Rassman fell off another boat,(in his Bronze Star Citation) Rassman falls of his. Kerry knocks his forearm against the boat. That night he goes for medical treatment of the arm, a slight concussion and the (...)shrapnel. The Casualty Report says the contusion was \\"very minor\\"but evidently enough for another Purple Heart.Four days later he gets his third Purple Heart, the very sameday, at 7:42 in the morning his commander puts in the Thrice-Wounded reassignment request, this is in the book. Kerryis then again vague as to the exact day he leaves Vietnam, yethe can remember seeing Rassman in the water, several hundred yardsaway, with bullets flying all around him. Kerry says that\\"since he got shrapnel three different times in action\\" he qualified to leave his one year tour of duty eights months early.I am comparing Kerry's book against the official Navy documents on his website, there seems to be some that should be there that aren't, especially the Thrice-Wounded request. The book hasseveral glaring inconsistencies. He spends one sentence on hisNavy Reserve duty that he was obligated to do in the early seventies while at the same time involved in the VVAW, meeting with the enemy in Paris, ect.The other part of the book is how fantastic an orator Kerry is, spellbinding audiences and evidently biographers everywhere, this book is too funny in it's glorification of Kerry. If you are interested in the book, buy it used."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"O starts. The book fails to mention how Kerry smeared Vietnam Vets by calling them all &quot;babykillers&quot; in front of the Senate.Much of Kerry's speech before Congress painted his fellow GIs as so brutal that, today, they could easily be mistaken for Saddam Hussein's Fedayeen killers.He reported to Congress that U.S. soldiers had &quot;personally raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power, cut off limbs, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians, razed villages, shot cattle and dogs for fun, poisoned food stocks, and generally ravaged the countryside of South Vietnam.&quot;C. Stewart Forbes, Chief Executive Officer of Colliers International (Kerry's cousin), was awarded a contract worth billions designating Colliers International as the exclusive real estate agent representing Vietnam.Kerry's group, The Vietnam Veterans Against the War Organization, was funded by Jane Fonda.Jane Fonda personally sought out returning American soldiers from Vietnam to solicit them to publicly speak out against American atrocities against Vietnamese women and children during her broadcasts. North Vietnamese officials based in Canada allegedly coordinated her broadcasts.In 1972 Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden and others traveled to North Vietnam to give their support to the North Vietnamese's Government. When she returned to the United States, she advised the news media that all of the American Prisoners of War were being well treated and were not being tortured.As the American POWs returned home in 1973, they spoke out about the inhumane treatment and torture they had suffered as prisoners of war. Their stories directly contradicted Jane Fonda's earlier statements of 1972. Some of the American POWs such as Senator John McCain, a former Presidential candidate, stated that he was tortured by his guards for refusing to meet with Jane Fonda and her group. Jane Fonda, in her response to these new allegations, referred to the returning POWs as being &quot;hypocrites and liars.&quot;The Wall Street Journal (August 3, 1995) published an interview with Bui Tin who served on the General Staff of the North Vietnam Army and received the unconditional surrender of South Vietnam on April 30, 1975. During the interview Mr. Tin was asked if the American antiwar movement was important to Hanoi's victory. Mr. Tin responded &quot;It was essential to our strategy&quot; referring to the war being fought on two fronts, the Vietnam battlefield and back home in America through the antiwar movement on college campuses and in the city streets. He further stated the North Vietnamese leadership listened to the American evening news broadcasts &quot;to follow the growth of the American antiwar movement.&quot; Visits to Hanoi made by persons such as Jane Fonda, former Attorney General Ramsey Clark and various church ministers &quot;gave us confidence that we should hold on in the face of battlefield reverses.&quot; Mr. Tin surmised that &quot;America lost because of its democracy; through dissent and protest it lost the ability to mobilize a will to win.&quot; Mr. Tin further advised that General Vo Nguyen Giap (Commanding General of the North Vietnam Army) said the 1968 Tet Offensive was a defeat.

I'm sure Kerry stayed up late every night and dreamed up what would sound good for a person with political aspirations before he wrote up the days 'After Action Reports'. I just wonder why the author didn't talk about Kerry's three deferments he applied for and received. When he applied for his fourth to study in France he was turned down so he rushed down to join the Navy where he thought he would be far from action. What a shock it must've been when after a few months he was assigned to somewhere where there was real danger. This is probably when he dreamed up his plan to get three purple hearts so he could leave after only four months.

And Brinkely is an alleged \\"historian?\\" Give me a break. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts. Brinkley has no problem making up his own facts to benefit Kerry.Mr. Brinkley's fascination (and obvious political support for) John Kerry clouds his views. Whatever Kerry did in four months in country in Vietnam (which is questionable) was wiped away by his actions when he got home. Apparently Kerry wants to forget his book \\"The New Soldier\\" and his leadership of \\"Vietnam Veterans Against the War,\\" who did nothing but spit on and slander the heroic soldiers who fought in Vietnam for freedom, now that he's essentially the Democratic Presidential nominee. But, as John Adams once wrote -- facts are stubborn things.Vietnam service is popular and attracts votes -- so Kerry will play it to the hilt, this time with Douglas Brinkely as his willing accomplice. However, Kerry didn't think so in 1970 when the war was unpopular, especially among left-wing activists -- he testified before Congress that he was \\"ashamed\\" of what he did in Vietnam and of his service; that he committed \\"war crimes,\\" and charged his fellow veterans with doing the same. Well, there was no evidence for that then OR now. It's all a matter of historical record that you can read for yourself -- don't allow Brinkley to color it for you. Kerry was simply out to make a political name for himself on the backs of his dead comrades.

How else does one explain its convenient release during primary season? The author, who (surprise surprise)is a &quot;liberal&quot; historian and academic, had to know that Kerry was planning a run before beginning his research at least a year or more ago. This fact together with the entire tone of the work illustrate that, yes Virginia, it is a campaign book. Missing in action is the probable role that Kerry's privileged position as a friend of the Kennedy Klan played in his &quot;war service&quot; and&quot;decorations&quot; (PT-109 indeed). Also largely absent is a honest assessment of his subsequent efforts to undermind his country while it was at war (opposing a position was one thing during Viet Nam, actively supporting your country's enemies was something else entirely).What emerges here if one actually knows something about Kerry's life and career before starting, is a fairly masterful piece of propaganda, which is why I give it two stars. But let's remember that lots of men (including U.S. Grant, Douglas MacArthur, and Oliver North) have been more geniunely war heroes than John Kerry, and most certainly would not or did not make a good president. This is especially true for a man, like Kerry, who has done everthing inside and outside of office he can to undercut his country's defense (except where absolutely politically necessary). The good news is that if you want to see the President defeated for re-election, you will find enough illusion here to assuage your conscious in voting for a shallow opportunist like Kerry. But don't fool yourself that this book has anything to do with historical truth."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"To call this book an unbiased look at Kerry's life is extremely naive.

When was it (during Nixon's administration, Clinton's?) that we collectively left behind any sense of proportion and prudence in our political passions and returned to the nineteenth century practice of just calling people names? Today individuals running for office are not allowed to be simply human beings but must either be &quot;saviors of the nation&quot; or plain &quot;evil,&quot; depending upon one's political agenda.As a &quot;swing-voter&quot; who regularly votes a split ticket, and as one who tries to maintain some semblance of objectivity, I purchased Brinkley's book in the fond expectation that the pattern above would not be followed, and that instead I would learn something of the truth about an emerging political figure. Sadly I was disappointed, but I did learn some things; I learned that Kerry is indeed a &quot;savior of the nation&quot; who always brushes his teeth, is good to the little people, and stands like a valiant sentinel for truth and justice. In short, I was &quot;treated&quot; to two-dimensional characterization designed to draw votes during a campaign. There is no good explanation here of how such a sterling &quot;hero&quot; could then turn around and shamelessly attack and demean his own country while also engaging in such blatant self-promotion - even a scholar of Brinkley's skill cannot reconcile the two very different images - and does anyone really believe that it proves anything that Senator Kerry's war buddies like and support him, eveybody, even a crack dealer, has friends! I wish, too, like the reviewer below, that there was more about the connection to the Kennedy family, but in most regards that is probably outside the scope of this book.Brinkley is a very skilled writer, and that is evident here in the highly readable style. Nonetheless, this is &quot;spin&quot; written to promote Kerry's candidacy, a fact illustrated by its unusually low price. It will convince no one who does not wish to be convinced, and it will only evoke ridicule from those who do not. Surely good history or biography should do more than that? If Kerry becomes president, much better books will be written, if he does not, Tour of Duty will probably not even qualify to be cited."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This book is a waste of valuable paper.

He spent approximately one year active in the leadership of the Vistnam Veterans Against the War. Janus-like he has spent the last thirty years exploiting these two different personas -- war hero/anti-war hero -- in his life-long quest for the presidency of the United Sates. Brinkley is only the latest in the long line of people, friends, family members and comrades, whom Kerry has used to exercise the will to power. Brinkley, in 2002, was given access to Kerry and his memoirs, personal letters, and previous half-heartred tries to write his own biography provided he, Brinkley, publish prior to the 2004 presidential campaign. As a result his fawning biograph totally lacks objectivity. What Brinkley passes off as a personal &quot;War Odyssey&quot; of John Kerry is nothing more that the &quot;Walter Middy&quot; adventures of a self-aggrandizing imitator of John Kennedy, his school boy hero.

This seems a little too much for Kerry to have \\"forgotten\\" and then to have \\"remembered\\" as a trip to Cambodia. Another suprise was that any mention of Kerry's trip (trips?) to meet with the North Vietnamese in Paris while a peace activist was omitted. But overall I found the book fairly well written and more interesting then I had expected, except for the strong political bias to be found in any campaign book.

How true, how true, and how applicable to the choice the American electorate will soon have. As noted historian Douglas Brinkley so vividly shows in \\"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War\\", Senator Kerry is a courageous man, both physically and morally. He went from being-literally-waist deep in the Big Muddy to rescue a wounded comrade under fire to coming home and assuming a leadership role in the Vietnam Veterans Against the War because he knew the war was wrong and must be stopped. He had been wounded three times. Ponder that for a minute. Three separate times he had been hit by enemy fire. Three Purple Hearts. Three more Purple Hearts than are possessed by the entire student deferred, 4F, national guard weekenders in the Bush administration. Siver Star. Bronze Star. These medals are not given away lightly; they aren't just pieces of tin hanging from a brightly colored ribbon. They represent personal valor and are earned with blood.Mr. Brinkley details how this bloodied warrior had the moral courage to speak out against an immoral war (and to later join his friend Senator John McCain in leading the fight to normalize relations with Vietnam, their old foe) and incurred the wrath of the Nixon administration; they went after him and branded this legitimate hero a fraud. This was always done from the shadows, a hallmark of our most corrupt president. No doubt history will repeat itself during the 2004 presidential campaign as Karl Rove and his henchmen try to make their man's flimsy service record appear better than it is. Fat chance, since there is no there there. John Kerry is a hero many time over; our war president is not.So back to \\"Braveheart\\". Recall that William Wallace was a battered, muddy fighter who inspired immense loyalty from his men because he was out there on the battlefield with them, leading them, sword in hand. The lords they fought for were above the fray, never dirty, never bloodied, but my they sure looked pretty sitting on their fancy steeds high on a hill wearing their fancy armor and clutching their fancy, pristine weapons, just like a certain war president who rented a fancy flight suit and bounded out of a fancy fighter jet onto deck of a fancy aircraft carrier. He looked very pretty, too.\\"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War\\" is well-documented and well written.

It's so sad the way some of these far right people writing reviews believe all of the propaganda by their \\"party\\". Discrediting his service is a joke. I mean sure, he wasn't the best soldier our country has ever seen, but just compare him to Bush and it makes him look extremely good. Bush can hardly form a sentence (at his age) and Kerry was performing great anti war speeches at a much younger age. As for one of his purple hearts being earned by a self inflicted injury, thats just preposterous, that is not how it works and I think people know that but choose to to believe it. Bottom line is Kerry wouldn't have been the greatest president we have ever seen, but it would have been nice to see someone holding office that actually had served in a war. He might actually have thought twice about sending kids to die. The swift boat vets for \\"truth\\" were only one side of the story, and even if some of the things they said were true, obviously the people the Brinkley interviewed with would know better than most of the \\"truth vets\\" as they had actually served WITH Kerry, which is different than serving in the same general area."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"I get the distinct impression that some of the so-called &quot;reviewers&quot; who trash this book here have never read it.

My knowledge of him was limited to bits and pieces of news picked up over the years. Since he had voted for the most recent war in Iraq, I had been a Dean supporter. As I read the book I came to feel as though I knew the man John Kerry. I could place my own life along side his remembering how the Vietnam war tore America apart. Kerry's own words in 35 year old letters provide insight into the heart and soul of a truely honest and admirable man. The book sheds light on his own personal struggle with doing what he believes to be right while fighting a war he knew to be wrong. It chronicles not only the war he experienced but also his/our fight to end that war. Like his fellow crewmates, who campaign by his side today, I would trust him with my life.

He has my vote!"},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Though the subtitle of this book is &quot;John Kerry and the Vietnam War,&quot; it is much more than that. Brinkley's main purpose is to chronicle Kerry's early years, covering his life up to his failed race for a House seat in 1972. Brinkley is obviously a fan of Kerry's, though after reading this book it's easy to see why; the portrait he paints of the young man earnestly leading his men into battle on the rivers of South Vietnam is certainly more appealing than the aloof presidential candidate currently being depicted by the media. Readers seeking to learn more about the Democratic nominee and potential president will find much to ponder here.This book is also worth reading for another reason, though - its account of the &quot;brown water navy&quot;, the riverine craft deployed on the rivers of South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Brinkley uses the material Kerry carefully preserved during his service in Vietnam (which includes diaries, letters to his family back home, and audiotape recordings) as a lens through which to examine the broader war that he was a part of. While Kerry's materials are the foundation of this examination, Brinkley also utilizes interviews with other Swift boat operators and other histories of the conflict to provide what is likely to be the most detailed examination of riverine operations during the war ever published. This gives the book an enduring value, regardless of the outcome of the presidential election."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"This book makes for a great promotional piece and that is about all. For the true story, the whole story on John Kerry's \\"Tour of Duty\\" check out Unfit for Duty coming out next week. A book written by people who really knew the REAL John Kerry-The RAW Deal."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"What kind of reporter is Brinkley that he didn't check all the facts before writing this book? Kerry himself admits now that he wasn't in Cambodia that Christmas,1968. I really have a problem with many things that John Kerry did ,especially after coming home from Viet Nam. Of all the Marines and soldiers that I personally knew who went to Viet Nam,some to die, I don't recall anyone coming home so fast as John Kerry. Doesn't Mr. Brinkley have a problem with the anti-military stance that Kerry took at the Congressional hearing? Kerry was not just anti-war,that is forgivable, but anti-military is another story. Mr. Brinkley should have covered more of Kerry's inconsistencies. That would have made a better book."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Tour of Duty is well written and entertaining. It does a good job of giving one a sense of Kerry's childhood and a reasonably good account of his actions in Vietnam. The post-Vietnam details are a bit thinner though. Also missing is any analysis or comparision of Kerry's actions with any facts. Thus one is left with a very one-sided view of John Kerry but an interesting view nonetheless. The book is worth reading for some general background but a more authoritative biography will probably have to wait until after (and if) he gets elected."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"If you want to read a true and fascinating story of a real hero--both during and after the War--this book is for you. If you want to rant mindlessly against Kerry, like a lot of wackos who reviewed this book have done here, then skip it. Perhaps they'd prefer to be led by an overprivileged bozo who slid into the Champagne Corps of the National Guard--the unit where all the rich boys hid out--and then went AWOL even from that, to work on a pro-war Senate candidate's campaign.As for me, I'll stick with the real heroes."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"On D-Day, 6 June 1944, American soldiers were accidentally drowned in the English Channel because their inflatable life preservers were worn incorrectly. Nearly a quarter century later, during a helicopter evacuation on a hill near Khe Sanh, 8 April 1968, U.S. combatant Max Cleland picked up a grenade - thinking it was his own with the pin intact. The twenty-five-year-old Army captain had his right arm and both legs blown off. Decades after the war in Vietnam, Republican columnist Ann Coulter criticized triple-amputee Cleland for \\"allowing Democrats to portray him as a war hero,\\" because his injuries were a result of an accident rather than enemy fire.Growing up in the 1950s, it was not uncommon for children to be asked, \\"What did your daddy do during WWII?\\" Ike became President and most Americans took pride in their contribution to that war effort. Today's youth have a curiosity about the war in Southeast Asia, but veterans and citizens on either side of the peace issue seem understandably reluctant when talking about it. Children of veterans who want to learn more about war and politics in the late 1960s and 1970s should read Tour of Duty by Douglas Brinkley. Although a sad chapter in American history, the politics of the war in Vietnam is described through the eyes of one combat sailor who was there. Historian Brinkley claims that John Kerry \\"exerted no editorial control on the manuscript.\\"The politics of war is not unique to the Vietnam era. On Normandy D-Day, a glorious day for the Allies and FDR's administration, and a day of gratitude and thanksgiving throughout our nation, politicking continued in Washington, D.C. With the November 1944 election approaching, in an attempt to embarrass President Roosevelt, the House of Representatives directed the Secretary of War and the Navy to begin court-martial proceedings against Admiral Husband E. Kimmell and General Walter C. Short for negligence over the 1941 Pearl Harbor attack.The naval service of Lieutenant Kerry and sacrifice of Captain Cleland should not be trivialized for political gain. As the son of a D-Day naval officer and grateful citizen of this nation, I honor and salute the sacrifice of all Vietnam combat veterans, both Republicans and Democrats on either side of the peace issue. One of every ten Americans who served in Vietnam became casualties with amputations and crippling wounds 300% higher than in WWII. Our nation owes a debt of gratitude and special care for the 75,000 Vietnam veterans who are severely disabled. This book is not about pity for Max Cleland, for he courageously plays the hand he was dealt in Vietnam. Tour of Duty gets five stars because the book is an exceptionally well written biography of Senator John F. Kerry, Captain Max Cleland's friend and hero."},{"Title":"Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War","review":"Whether you like John Kerry or not he is a genuine war hero and a man of profound courage and all the petty reviews here most likely done by Republicans can't change that reality. Face facts.I am an Edwards supporter but I can't deny that John Kerry is a good man with an honorable record of public service. He should be proud.This book is an honest assessment of his Vietnam experienes which are told warts and all. What comes through is a brutal honesty that is rare in politics these days. And a good overview of a dark period in our U.S. history. However, this book should be read to understand Kerry's greatness and to learn lessons from this ugly war.The Bush/Cheney war record is nonexistent. So far, the sketchy evidence of the Bush war record is that he was proven to have shopped at the base company store a few times and that he had his hair cut on the base on occasion (kidding). Truthfully, Bush's guard experience is difficult to assess and shaky to measure. This is not the case with Kerry. He actually fought in a war and was wounded.Read the book and learn what a great man John Kerry is."},{"Title":"Right from the Heart: The ABC's of Reality in America","review":"A Masterpiece!Reviewer: A reader from New York, United StatesTo say that this is an informative easy read is to grossly understate thefacts.

It's called abstinence.&quot;),I knew I was in for a no-holds-barred book that would refuse to skirt any of the sacred cows of the day. Phil Valentine pulls no punches while mercilessly debunking liberalism and its terribly flawed ideology with a veritable myriad of salient talking points. I found this book to be a keeper and a great reference for winning oratory war with my liberal friends.For starters, Valentine denounces the Carter and Clinton peace accord with North Korea for what it was - &quot;a colossal failure.&quot; Valentine masterfully refutes the global warming paranoia for what it is - &quot;junk science.&quot; &quot;One volcanic eruption alone can spew forth more so-called greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than this country has produced in its entire history, yet Mother Nature seems to absorb them without batting an eye.&quot;Valentine writes a truly deserving chapter on The Great Communicator and his triumph over communism. Contrary to liberal popular opinion, Valentine writes, communism did not just arbitrarily &quot;find the ash heap of history.&quot; Trust but verify and peace through strength are more than empty phrases that liberals abhor; they're powerful rallying cries and words to live by. Valentine pillories affirmative action for what it is - quotas that discriminate by race. Valentine states, &quot;You don't right the wrongs of the past by wronging the people of the present.&quot; Also in Valentine's sights are the fatuous liberal cornerstones of political correctness, higher taxes, union collectivism, lax immigration standards(or lack thereof), atheism, welfare, gun banning, abortion, a weak military, and apathetic national security - just to name a few. Valentine writes a winner that every conservative(and liberal for that matter) should read. It may even change a liberal's inane thinking process. Wait - I forgot. Liberals are categorically devoid of logic.&quot;The only thing that deters aggression by your enemies is a strong military. Churchill and Reagan understood that. Chamberlain and Clinton didn't.&quot;"},{"Title":"Right from the Heart: The ABC's of Reality in America","review":"Phil Valentine has a wonderful writing style and explains everything so clearly.

Much discouragement must be faced and laid aside in any persistent, virtuous effort in the service of mankind. At the close of the letter, my friend imparted this universal truth as he quoted Voltaire by saying, &quot;[Brian] Nothing can withstand the assault of sustained thinking.&quot;That is the essence of Phil Valentine's book, Right from the Heart. Phils thinking is sustained by correct Constitutional and moral principles. He successfully, precisely asserts the necessity of maintaining the foundational standards upon which these 50 United States were built following the American Revolutionary War and separation from the tyrannical empire of Great Britain.Anyone who knows Phil personally or faithfully listens to his talk radio program on 1510 WLAC AM, Nashville (See www.philvalentine.com and www.wlac.com) knows he is honest, straightforward and substantially well informed about the moral and political issues that face modern Americans. He correctly and with sound documentation refutes the Marxist economic and secular humanist theories and social sophistries espoused by modern liberals, honestly and directly confronts the root causes of unrest and civil strife in the United States, and accurately and nobly defends the right of decent, hardworking Americans to live in a country that is friendly to liberty, centered in morality and wholesome family life, and respectful of the Constitutional limits that ought to be observed by contemporary political parties, activist organizations, and individual citizens.He boldly refutes the lies of the agnostic and atheist secular humanists and fringe fanatics in the various socialist special interest groups and yet is humble enough to admit his mistakes, unlike many liberal idealogues who offer no sense of hope or optimism to the average citizen. He offers suggested solutions to societal ills that have been proven to work throughout history and reminds all of us that none of us are so intelligent that we can outwit GOD with our elitist intellectual subterfuge.His book is written in simple, cogent language, and is backed up by irrefutable evidence which he gathered over years in the service of the audience and fellow citizens that he so dearly loves.Mr. Valentine has renewed my hope in the American Dream and bravely stood with those of us who still labor and imagine in the mainstream of moral decency and personal responsibility that has always been the defining character of the blessed people so privileged to live in the greatest republic in world hitory, The United States of America!His critics teeth gnashing and hollow tongue gnawing, or emotional reasoning, melts like frost exposed the bright white light of factual truths enwrapped in eternal, indestructible principles of truth and virtue.With cheerful resolve,Brian K.

This book serves as a bible of current conservative thought and addresses most of the significant social, political, and philosophical issues of our time in a clear, easy to understand manner. This book is for all who have outgrown the &quot;If you're young and not a liberal, you don't have a heart&quot; stage and have, or want to move into the &quot;If you're older and not a conservative, you don't have a brain&quot; stage of their lives."},{"Title":"Right from the Heart: The ABC's of Reality in America","review":"Phil Valentine pulls no punches in addressing the issues facing our society. In a refreshing non-PC style, Valentine reveals the facts of life in politics, religion, and society. Facts and common sense intertwined with a conversational style make this book a winner. Even the most liberal reader will be forced to contemplate Valentine's offerings. From the Republican passage of the 1964 Civil Rights act to Jefferson's actual wording of &quot;church and state&quot; to the true identity of many anti-war actvists, Valentine exposes facts that many have never known or acknowledged."},{"Title":"Right from the Heart: The ABC's of Reality in America","review":"This is an excellent book that clearly defines the difference between the thinking,action,desires,motivation and principles of Liberals and Concervatives. The differences are clear and not debatable since the actions of people on the opposite sides of these approaches,have proved it over and over again.The real point of this book is that it does not take a stand,but it is up to each individual to learn the facts and then to do their own thinking;and make their own choice in what you think is the best approach to take in your decisions in dealing with the issues which confront you on a daily basis.In other words,there are clear differences and you must make your own choices.You are going to find a lot of things in this book that may surprise you;but if you doubt some of the things said;there are ample references given for you to follow up and see if the facts are correct or otherwise.If you have done any amount of living,you will,or at least should,have learned by now that there are no \\"Free Lunches\\" and anyone who promises them,any system that offers them,etc;is simply stringing you a line. The one and only one who is going to have your interest at heart is you and nobody else.What you must do is decide to take responsibility for your own well being,motivate yourself to educate yourself and set a course on the lifestyle that will suit yourself and your aspirations.To buy into the idea that the government,politicians,the company,or any other organization is better equiped,and have any intent of taking care of you is an approach that will serve them---but not you.Valentine makes no doubt about it that he has chosen the conservative values to build upon.He has shown why.He also shows the liberal choices with the same issues.What one must do is make their own choice.However;that choice must be made based on an understanding of the differences;not what the media,your school,politicians,or even friends or family tell you.There is an old saying ,\\"God helps those who help themselves\\".This is always the case ,be it in times of prosperity or times if adversity.

In other words, they're scared to death of this book and all they can do is call names. As Valentine says in the book, it's the equivalent to running out of bullets and throwing your gun at the other guy.The truth is, AIDS IS a behavioral disease. God IS the cornerstone of our republic. Quotas ARE wrong and Reagan WAS right. He also points out that liberalism is an ideology doomed to failure. This book covers all that and much more and that's why the liberals are having a hissy fit over it.Instead wasting their time trashing this book they should actually be reading it. If they do that, they might become enlightened and change their views and we can't have that, now can we?

Steve Gill is the attorney, not Phil Valentine. Please refer to Phil's bio at http://philvalentine.com/bio.htm. Before one attacks, one should have one's facts straight.I thoroughly enjoyed the thought-provoking nature of this book. I agreed with much, disagreed with some, but found that even with the items I disagreed with, I was forced to consider angles that I hadn't considered before. The layout of the book made it easy to skip around to topics of interest.Much like Phil's show, there was a lot of common sense, facts, and humor throughout. Many who don't listen to him wtite him off as a mean-spirited blowhard conservative (much like they do every other conservative host who they disagree with). Nothing could be further from the truth."},{"Title":"Right from the Heart: The ABC's of Reality in America","review":"Unlike some other books on politics from both the left and the right, Valentine's book is well organized and well researched. While the &quot;A,B,C&quot; organization is a bit hokey and in some cases gives the book a choppy feel, dividing the book into chapters that address a single issue at a time (multiculturalism, gun ownership, etc.) was a unique approach that allows the reader to concentrate on the issue and fully evaluate it without digressing to other subjects. Yeah, he's somewhat conceited, but his logic is usually flawless.Valentine's book is also thoroughly researched--much more so than most other political books I've read. It doesn't rely on only one or two sources to discuss a single issue. The bibliography is complete and well done. I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone who's interested in politics, whether liberal or conservative."},{"Title":"Right from the Heart: The ABC's of Reality in America","review":"This book is a gem. It fills in a lot of blanks, and explains why and how our traditional principles have worked and why we need to keep fighting for them. Valentine also goes out of his way to explain the unrevised history and the context in which they wrote laws through the times and situations that befell the founding fathers.On God and Government, Valentine makes the case that Jefferson talked about a wall of seperation between church and state, yet when it comes to the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land does not always look to the constitution, but rather looks upon past rulings to determine their decisions.I also found it interesting that Valentine brings up the fact that the first school system was first started in this country so that kids could learn how to read the Bible.This is only a flake of the iceberg. This is a must-read for anyone who cares about this country and it's ideals. Valentine also addresses political correctness, guns, Ronald Reagan, abortion, labor unions, and many many more issues that confront our lives every single day.Speaking of issues that confront us every single day, please visit by board and read or debate the articles at...http://makingsense.proboards27.com"},{"Title":"Right from the Heart: The ABC's of Reality in America","review":"Phil Valentine, in this book &quot;Right From the Heart, the ABC's of Reality in America&quot; does what most conservative writers haven't done.

You won't be able to put this one down!!"},{"Title":"Right from the Heart: The ABC's of Reality in America","review":"Phil Valentine&#8217;s &#8220;Right from the Heart&#8221; is a fascinating book.He writes in a way to meet the intellectual needs and address the frustration and anger that exist in the citizenry because of what we see going on in our cities, communities, schools and legal system around the country and in the world.I particularly enjoyed the way this book is set out and the idea of just going through the alphabet the way he did. Although I am sure he limited himself and his issues by doing so; because one could get four or five of these books out and address a completely different set of important alphabetical issues each time.To be honest I had a few disagreements with some of his assertions, for instance I believe strongly and completely in the implementation of the death penalty in a timely fashion, not as a deterrent but as a necessary, beneficial and justifiable punishment for anyone who commits crimes against the well being of society. He seems to think life imprisonment is the cure all. I do not, under &#8220;Ledbetter&#8217;s Law&#8221; you would get two chances on your first adult crime you would get rehabilitation, under the second you would spend time in jail or prison, but on your third conviction it would be the &#8220;end of the road jack.&#8221;You see I believe that every citizen has a right to those basic assumptions and assurances indicated in the preamble to the Constitution of the United States of America. Anyone who twice takes them away from another citizen has thereby forfeited his protection under that same constitution.Anyone who uses a weapon in the commission of a crime or sells drugs to our kids or kidnaps or murders or abuses anyone in the commission of a criminal act has likewise deprived a deserving citizen of those same assurances; and regardless of their ridiculously invented sociological or hereditary excuse they deserve punishment for it. Naturally the Good Samaritan and one who does so in self-defense or for the protection of property would be exempted.As a matter of fact I would have to sit down with Phil and address several of his immigration assertions, education ideals, union theories and quite a few other comments and rebuttals.Yet he is on the right track to identify the issues he does and he has put voice to the concerns of the true &#8220;grass roots&#8221; American and the &#8220;Average American&#8221; who rarely sees their concerns and fears addressed in today&#8217;s political arena where it is simply attack, attack and attack, again and again everyone else on a personal level.Most of these politicos have no idea of how average Americans feel, what they need and want and even if they do it is still their way or the highway. They sit in their rich homes, live their protected lives, with servants and pompous luxury and pretend to feel our pain, but they do not see that they and their faltering philosophies and policies are the cause of it.All in all I found Mr. Valentine to have made good use of the alphabet to address the many pressing issues of our present unique American social situation and conditions. I comment him on writing an easily readable, to the point, informative book without a lot of needless verbiage attached.Highly recommend it to the brave of heart who want to know what &#8220;most intelligent, ethical and patriotic American&#8217;s&#8221; are thinking about these days.571"},{"Title":"Right from the Heart: The ABC's of Reality in America","review":"Hmmmm. \\"Conservatives\\" continue to applaud this sort of rhetoric as \\"facts.\\" I continue to get e-mail from those who resent my characterization of Ann Coulter as a psychopath (\\"if she really believes the stuff she says, she's not taking her meds\\") as if Coulter is a logician, not a hyperemotional media figure with a \\"JD\\" after her name.Well, this isn't quite as volatile as Coulter, but it's no more \\"fact\\" oriented.

I checked it out from the library. It is not worth the sales price.Valentine is a flash-in-the-pan, a Rush Limbaugh wannabe and his only real claim to fame is starting riots in front of the state Capitol in Nashville to get motorists to honk down the legislature while it was considering a state income tax proposed by the Republican Governor whom Valentine pushed for election, the reelection.Valentine is a rich lawyer who lives in the best area of Nashville, and of course doesn't want Tennessee to be an income tax state.As a consequence of rioting motorists, we in Tennessee pay 8.75% sales tax everything, even food.Valentine could not get more money from WLAC so he's moving on now.

However, it still presents the same old black &amp; white world of &quot;conservative good,liberal bad,&quot; &quot;Reagan is God, Clinton is the devil&quot; you've heard a million times before. Take a pass on this one, unless you just have to have EVERY conservative book in print."},{"Title":"Right from the Heart: The ABC's of Reality in America","review":"If conservatives rely on the facts and liberals on emotion, one would expect this to be a supremely liberal book. Characterizing Clinton as weak on the military or liberalism is one good example. The simple fact is that the US brushed away Iraq with a military force that had been trained and armed by the Clinton administration; yet Clinton was characterized as weak and anti-military. The Bush administration's failure to follow up on warnings issued by the Clinton administration about Al Qaeda and its plans to use aircraft in terrorist acts against the US are ignored. And so on. We could all benefit from a considered debate on this issues with the basic assumption that we are all in this together.

The CG movement, in terms of movement and facial expression and other things is lousy, and even though Lord Fear's staff looks like a frog holding a crystal-ball on a stick, the characters in the show drescribe him as a rat, when actually that's SOMEBODY ELSE, and he always acts so smug and bossy, more so than Lord Fear himself! Also, when I saw the \\"final\\" episode of series 2, there was a blooper-shot that had a studio set in the background instead of the carnival, and I really hated it how Lord Fear was laughing even in his defeat - SICK!! I was so glad when this finished, until I found out that ABC started showing series 3, and the comic adapation of episode 1 wasn't illustrated very well, and even a few of the human characters are STUPID and ANNOYING, like the Science Teacher/Principal, the Cooking Lady - who cooks scary-looking food and is mean to everybody except Mark's friend Chuck, who is also annoying by being hungry enough to eat what Mark has, like Chocolates Mark wanted to give Samantha as a present and what was in Mark's fridge. Mark Reiley has wasted his voice in being cast as Ace Lightning - he should've gone for something more enjoyable. And the other enemies aren't that good either - with a skeleton dressed up as an english man and his 'loyal' staff, a fat pig in clothes who eats a lot, a muscle-bound rhino with an anvil for a hand, a big rat with wings who's dressed up as a clown and a Jester-like porcupine creature who 2 evil sock-hand puppets. 25 minutes on ABC have been wasted on \\"Ace Lightning\\", when it could've been used for something much better, like playing the new \\"Astro Boy\\" series Monday-Friday instead of just Thursdays, or replaying old/recent shows like \\"The New Adventures of Captain Planet\\", \\"The Zack Files\\" or making a NEW rendition of \\"Mighty Mouse\\".The only characters I do like are Mark, Sparks, Lady Illusion, Samantha and the girl Chuck really likes. (Samantha's best appearance is in \\"The Zack Files\\" and her best friend - the red head - also appears as Fortuna/Una in \\"Parallax\\" on Channel 9 at 4:00 pm)Sorry to dissapoint those of you who are fans of Ace Lightning, and I know I'll regret seeing this in my list of reviews, but I had to express how I feel."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"As Turgenev preceded Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, I always assumed that he belonged to a stuffier time; picking up \\"Fathers and Sons\\" in the bookstore, the first few pages seemed to confirm this assumption. Unlike Dostoevsky's prose, which I've always found compulsively readable, Turgenev's style seemed dense and somewhat stilted. Thankfully, the writing gets much more fluid and engaging as the story progresses.Turgenev is in fact a wonderful stylist: economical, precise, lyrical when it befits his characters, yet never wordy. Whereas Dostoevsky's characters sometimes seem to be acting in a vacuum, and Tolstoy occassionally digresses into paeans on the wonders of nature, Turgenev straddles the happy medium. There are many brief but vivid descriptions of atmosphere, times of day--a horses hooves flashing at dusk, Arcady and Eugene reclining on recently mown hay--yet they are alway in service to the story and not overly symbolic.Turgenev's approach to his characters is similarly nimble and balanced; sometimes he adopts a more distant tone, sometimes he's in a particular character's head, sometimes he gives a brief description of a character's backgound, at others a character will relate another's history from his point of view.In fact everything in the novel testifies to Turgenev's faith in humanity, without ever seeming didactic or boring. All of the characters are sympathetic, and I could imagine actually traveling with them or engaging in conversation with them. Nobody beats Dostoevsky when it comes to penetrating psychological insight and dark humor, but his characters are always on some level types, intended to personify philosophical extremes. Tolstoy always seems to be hiding a profound but nonetheless conservative morality up his sleeve. Turgenev's characters, though, are somehow more believable than either of these author's. Eugene Bazarov and Anna Sergeyevna Odintzov are extreme, intense, and difficult people, but they are not caricatures, and they are no more the center of attention than Arcady, his relatives, or Bazarov's parents. Everone is held in equal regard, but everyone is distinct. In reminds me of Ibsen, who seems to regard his characters with the same sort of passionate, humane equanimity.In a way, Turgenev is the anti-Dostoevsky (intending no disrespect to the master); at every opportunity where he might stage a cathartic \\"pathetic scene\\"--the duel, the climactic encounter over the deathbed of one of the main characters--he stays true to the fundamentally disjointed nature of life. The characters don't kiss and make up, nor do they hurl themselves under trains, yet somehow it remains gripping and illuminating. And Turgenev doesn't succumb to the opposite temptation, namely to undermine the gravity of real feelings by interrupting these scenes with trivial details, as Flaubert does so often in \\"Madame Bovary\\" for example.What else can I say? There's no reason not to give this book a try if you like character driven stories that seem full of the essence of real life. Unlike other great Russian novels, this one is short, so if it's not to your taste, at least it's brief. However, I can almost guarantee that you'll wish it lasted longer, and that it'll leave you with a warm feeling inside."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"With Fathers and Sons, Turganev shocked the Russian literati with his portrayal of Bazarov, the self-described 'nihilist'. Rejecting everything and recognising no single authority, Bazarov was a kick in the teeth of the aristocracy's grand old men, a rebellion of the son against the father.Evgeny Bazarov is a young man, with ideas that he believes are the only rational, reasonable way to live and behave. He is contemptuous of love, of sentimentality, of tradition and of the aristocracy. Yet he is intelligent and capable, and believes the way he does not through a sense of hostility and outrage, but because it seems right to him. His younger friend, Arkady, considers Bazarov his 'mentor', and though the two disagree with the depth of nihilism that is necessary for accurate living, they are for the most part in agreement.Bazarov's nihilism is argued amongst the characters at several different stages of the novel. Turganev chose not to make the hero an unassailable target - both the negatives and the positives of such an outlook are admirably explained, discussed and dissected. The characters are intelligent in their own field or experiences, and all are willing to add to the argument. Obviously, the title should reveal to all that it is the father's of the two main characters, Arkady and Bazarov, who have problems with the younger generations ideas, though the 'fathers' of the story do try to understand Bazarov's thinking, rather than merely stamping him down with their experience and wisdom.The characters are very well realised. Pavel Petrovich is the typical Russian aristocrat, unable to fully understand the scope of change that the emancipation of the serfs will bring. Arkady is the eager student, a man who wishes to embrace the concepts of nihilism, but who finds himself drawn into sentimentality towards his family, and who falls in love. Katya, Arkady's love, is one of the shallowest characters, but even she works on a level beyond being merely a foil to Arkady's belief. Anna Sergeevna, Katya's sister, is a tremendous character, being both passionate and intelligent, and able to duel equally - and sometimes better - against Bazarov's wit.A word on the translation by Richard Freeborn. For the most part it is good, and the dialogue is very good, but there are moments that feel awkward or amateurish. An odd turn of phrase or - more common - an inexplicably placed colloquial term of slang phrase lessens the impact of a scene. Bazarov referring to his 'mates' in conversation tends to decrease the impact of the ideas set forth, and while would not have been so noticeable if the entire novel was constructed in such a matter, the rest of the writing is quite formal, and as it is, the narrative structure suffers somewhat. Regardless, Fathers and Sons is a very interesting examination of the conflict of ideas that parents and their children necessarily experience, and has the admirable quality of being fair and honest to both sides, with very little in the way of bias on either side, even considering that Bazarov is the main thrust of the narrative."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"\\"Fathers and Sons\\" comes very close to perfection. At times, Turgenev's use of the language borders on poetry. The characters are intriguing and sympathetic. The novel deals beautifully with man's inability to live without holding something sacred, and its tragic \\"hero\\" goes to the grave realizing that he has been trying to fill that void with \\"straw\\" instead of something more meaningful--like faith, or family, or true love.Some critics have said that Turgenev supported the \\"nihilists,\\" the young men who scoffed at all things sacred. They say Bazarov is the hero of the novel, intended to be idolized. But I consider it impossible to read \\"Fathers and Sons\\" and not be moved by a deep need to hold something--anything--sacred."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"I have just finished reading this wonderful book, \\"Fathers and sons\\", and I wanted to share my impressions with you. Oh, what a superb novel! I will never forget Bazarov and his constant questioning, his revulsion against nothingness, his moodiness, his noble demeanor.Turgueniev places in Bazarov the almost unbearable burden of nihilism. Nihilism as a philosophical posture, a methodic negation of systems of belief; nihilism as a continuous quest for the truth. Bazarov's nihilism derives in action and not in an empty criticism of reality that may end up in mere discouragement. As Ortega y Gasset once said: nihilism as a result of having wondered about every ideological creation, every philosophical stance.Family ties and the confrontation among generations of fathers and sons are also masterly depicted throughout the book. Turgueniev portrays the perplexity of the father when faced with the reality of time ticking inexorably away as well as unconditional love for the son that comes home after a long absence.I will never forgive Turgueniev for denying Bazarov the possibility of happiness. But I am no one of importance to say what the author should or should have not written. Anyhow, Bazarov's stance before death is as unforgettable as that of Camus' Meursault in \\"L'etranger\\" or the anonymous character condemned to capital punishment in Victor Hugo's \\"Le dernier jour d'un condamn&eacute;\\". And here, dear friend, I must make a confession: I have still tears in my eyes, something that Bazarov would have never approved of. If he saw me right now, he would certainly accuse me of being romantic. He would consider my behavior as that of a foolish waif, a weakness proper of a bourgeois woman. Yet, my friend, I don't complain about it: he may be right, but I can't conceal emotion. I hope you will understand me.What shall I add? You know this novel better than I do. Far from Dostoievsky's books whose characters are constantly dwelling on the brink of madness, this is still a Russian novel, full of sadness and melancholy, where the eternal brooding over social justice in a country that remained feudal until the XXth century taints the story form the first page to the last..."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"If you're intimidated by Tolstoy or Dostoevsky's long masterpieces, consider starting instead with Turgenev's \\"Fathers and Sons.\\" This book is of course a masterpiece of Russian literature. It's characters and themes are timeless and absolutely relatable to our modern culture. This is a story of family relationships, romance, and philosophy. Highly recommended.p.s. When you're done here, try \\"War and Peace\\" or at least \\"Crime and Punishment.\\""},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"'Fathers and Sons' is arguably Turgenev's greatest work. It is very accessible to the reader, and excellently written. Turgenev is renowned for his masterful ability to construct realistic dialogues and this novel does not disappoint in this respect. But 'Fathers and Sons' is also a novel of ideas and Turgenev analyses some of the ideas and sentiments which were later to have such an important influence on Russian society.This novel follows Bazarov, a self-proclaimed nihilist, and his friend and pupil Arkady Nikolayevich Kirsanov as they return from their studies in Petersburg to the province in which their fathers reside. The tale is tangled with arguments and discussions about politics and philosophy, and of course it is also complicated by a heavy dose of love. As another reviewer has mentioned, the author's treatment of nihilism as a philosophy is particularly interesting and enlightening.Turgenev is adept, as other reviewers have noted, at accurately describing different emotions and even at evoking those emotions in his readers; something of which precious few writers are capable. The subject of love, both romantic and mat/paternal, is dealt with extremely skilfully by the author and betrays the understanding of someone who has undoubtedly been exposed to those feelings himself.'Fathers and Sons' then, leaves the reader with the sense that he/she has participated as a quiet observer in Bazarov and Arkady's journeys, and that Turgenev has enabled one to better appreciate love and the relationship between father and son, amongst other things. This is a book that deserves to be read, appreciated, and pondered over long after it has been closed. It's core relevance has not been diminished by the century-and-a-half since it was written."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"A few months ago, after beating around the bush, and reading a little of Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov, I plunged headfirst into 19th Century Russian Literature, the Golden age of Russian Literature. Obviously, I knew just a little about Tolstoy, that nutty cool guy with the even cooler beard who wrote War and Peace and Anna Karenina, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, the even nuttier cool guy with a less cool beard but arguably better works than the latter (although these two great men are shoulder to shoulder and forever will be) who wrote Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov. I also learned of an even nuttier guy named Nikolai Gogol who wrote the great epic in prose Dead Souls and The Overcoat. I already knew of the greatness of Pushkin and his Shakespeare presence over Russian Literature.I then came to Ivan Turgenev and was warned against his, what some people on this very site call \\"slow\\" writing from a \\"stuffier time,\\" since Turgenev preceded Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. After participating in the incredible bliss which we humans call \\"reading Fathers and Sons,\\" I was fully convinced that Ivan Turgenev is definately underrated and is up there with Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Pushkin and Gogol.The novel, probably the first modern novel in Russian Literature, remember that, concerns the social gap between young and old, radicals and conservatives. Imediately, the novel is not \\"outdated\\" or \\"stuffy.\\" Turgenev was, actually the man who introduced the word \\"Nihilist\\" and disected it thouroughly through the memorable character Eugene Vassilich Bazarov, a young medical student who, along with his friend, Arcady Nikolaevich Kirsanov, claims to respect no institution, man or anything and sneers at Arcady's father and uncle who disagree with Bazarov and Arcady.The novel received a mixed response in Russia, with both radicals and conservatives disagreing with the charactarization with their representatives but it was an international success and Turgenev was the first to prove how great Russian Literature was and was the first respected Russian writer, gaining the friendship of Flaubert, Maupassant, and Henry James.This is the best and briefest proof of the greatness of the 19th Century Russian novel, proving Turgenev's greatness."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"All right, it's not that exciting. But this is a pretty good novel. The characters are interesting, though somewhat two-dimensional in places. It is a little obvious that they are supposed to be representing different ideas, but this is not particularly bothersome (to me, anyway). The descriptions of various places are amusing and to the point. The story is engaging and fairly quickly placed.The only reason I'm giving this novel three stars instead of four or five is because the translation is so painful. Generally, it is fairly serviceable, until you come to the conversation. Phrases such as \\"hanging around\\" and \\"So what?\\" pepper the dialogue, and Bazarov's speech in particular. Is this meant to show his irreverence? If so, it fails. Bazarov speaking habits do not seem irreverent, merely clunky. And these phrases took away from my enjoyment of the story. It's like going to the theater to see a movie, and then having the lights on through the whole show.All in all, it was a good novel. It is worth reading, especially if you can find a different translation."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"This novel is no less than an epic minus the length. The potency of the novel will stir even the most insipid soul. The story revolves around the character Bazarov, a nihilst, who stands in sharp contrast with the traditional values of Russian society. Bazarov views everything through his scientific lens, this draws a duel between him and other characters, mostly the elders. As the novel progresses the gaps between the characters widens but beneath it there is a torrent of emotions that binds them together.The characters are explored in detail which creates a sense of intimacy and a feeling of sympathy. Again, Turgenev is a master here with his impeccable narration.In short, 'Fathers and sons' captures the generational gap that exists and will continue to exist between the younger and the older generations."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"I bought this book on a whim - ... I read a few pages and liked the writing style, which seemed to me reminiscent of Dostoevsky and other writers of the period. When I finally picked it up again a few months later, though, I found myself instantly hooked, and still am.As the other reviewers mention, there isn't much of a plot. Although there are some political/philosophical discussions, Turgenev is never heavy-handed or didactic about them. In fact, he seems almost disinterested in the arguments per se (which at the time were highly controversial and often censored), preferring instead to examine the motives and personalities of the characters who espouse them. But I think it is these very qualities that make this novel so accessible and ageless, even to readers (like myself) who know very little about Russian history.Turgenev writes beautifully, with sharp, closely-observed details about the human condition that are timeless and often humorous. This is a novel not only about intergenerational conflict (via the two main characters' relationships with their parents), but also about the younger characters' interactions with each other. Arkady's essential optimism and Bazarov's misanthropy (despite that he's a doctor) play off each other beautifully, and give insight into their professed beliefs and even their different approaches to love.This novel isn't a page-turner and it doesn't have the usual plot devices or moral agendas typical of its contemporaries. You won't like it if you have a short attention span. But what a payoff: Turgenev's masterful use of language, gentle affection for his characters, and unsparing depiction of complex, sometimes conflicting motivations is awe-inspiring. Indeed, in my opinion the epilogue contains one of the most moving passages ever captured in literature.If you love great writers like Dostoevsky or Eliot, you'll be delighted to discover Turgenev. Also highly-recommended is the Everyman edition of First Love and Other Stories. (PS: It's pronounced Ter - GEN - yef; I was mispronouncing it for months!)"},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"I read this book back in January, but I remember it very well. It's interesting to see, during the course of the novel, how the characters evolve and act toward each other, and at times, it's an extremely interesting and exciting story. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"This novel is set against the backdrop of Russian nihilism of the 19th century. Russia was opening up to the West and the new Russian intelligentisa set out to relentlessly question received opinion through scientific and materialistic reasoning.The novel has little to narrate by the way of plot. The hero collapses without a struggle when his scientific rationalism and aggressive rejection of any explanation except materialistic ones leaves him helpless to deal with the emotion of love he finds within himself when he and a friend meet a intelligent lady in Moscow. He slowly loses out in the triangle, his friend come follower moves aways because of his self-interest and he himself contracts tuberculosis.Yet there is something about Bazarov - the hero - that makes him one of the eternal and powerful literary heroes ever created.It is as if the seed of tragedy is built in the rebel personality trying to challenge and change everything on grounds of reason. So strong and yet so vulnerable as to be unable to deal with simple human emotions and helpless against fate.This novel was Turgenev's argument against the Russian nihilists of his time, but ends up immortalizing the nihilist hero in his failed rebellion. This novel is sure to leave you a little disturbed even one and a half century after Russian nihilism has come and gone."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"Turgenev's strenght is his capacity to arouse genuine emotions in the reader. He is a master in portraiting human moods and psychological tensions, like frustration, disappointment, desperation, rebelliousness, haughtiness, respect, love or sorrow.Developments in conflictual relations between parents and children ('A son is like a lopped-off branch. As a falcon, he comes when he wills and goes where he lists.'), masters and serfs, conservatives and democrats, atheists and believers are pictured through actions, dialogues, duels (physical and oratory), acts, images, comparisons or thoughts.This book was vehemently criticized by the conservatives in Russia, who were frontally attacked by Turgenev through one of his main characters, the Nihilist Bazarow ('Down with the authorities'), who was 'free from aristocratic prejudice'.For Bazarow, a Slavophil was 'an upholder of patriarchal tyranny' and 'the moral ailments are induced by the wrong sort of education by all sorts of rubbish with which it has been the custom to stuff people's heads.'About the nobility: 'You may respect yourself and yet you sit doing nothing; of what use is that for the bien public?'.Ultimately, Turgenev's Russian society becomes enlightened: a landowner marries the mother of his child, even if she is a serf. The fundamental question: 'Why we still got all these castes?', is still a major, and sometimes deadly, problem today.Despite problems like laziness, pilfering and internecine property struggles, Turgenev defends land reforms, which is also a very actual problem.Although this book is sometimes too sentimental and partly dated, its conflicts are universal and its writing method a model for generations to come.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"Of what I call the \\"Russian Inklings\\" Turgenev is by far the most accessible, this book being the apogee of his career, much like B&K; with Dostoyevsky, and W&P; with Tolstoy.Fathers and Sons not only is a shorter read than the two masterpieces mentioned above, it is subsequently faster paced and less of a cerebral and psychological labyrinth.There seems to be two protagonists, something that Russian writers did fairly often in contrast to western literature which usually has only one hero, or protagonist. Turgenev's usage of two protagonists conveys two invaluable view to every circumstance, character, and event that transpires in this books 350 pages.The novel takes place during the \\"scientific enlightenment,\\" of Russia where romanticism currently, or perhaps already has been dethroned by the resident naturalistic sciences and breeds secular agnosticism, or Deductionary Atheism.**The book was received hilariously by critics. Many radical naturalistic atheists both loved and hated it. The critics that loved the book (in the late 1880's) were enamored with Turgenevs scientific objectivity, and humored pokes at both radical romanticism and radical nihilism. The critics who despised the book felt that their intellectual camp had been fraudulated, and required reconciliation.**I want to point out that many themes spoken of by these Russian authors, and explicitly Turgenev, are issues that are still at the forefront of political and philosophical debate. Nihilism is really the anthem of Hume's deductionary logical philosophy of indeterminism. It is the purest form of naturalistic sciences and often times is confused with empiricism. I wish to point out that governmental forms like socialism, that wish to divide any personal belief with public display, (similar to Socialist France) are displaying the very same traits and political referendums fought for by the youth in this book.**The youth of today, I would say as a majority (and being one of them), are not sympathetic towards selfish conservatism, which is represented in this book by Arkady's uncle, (Arkady being the Romantic protagonist). The emotional turmoil and intellectual struggle that the characters go through in the throngs of political debate are incredible.***MOST IMPORTANTLY: *** Bazarov (the 2nd of the two protagonists) represents the theoretical Jesus of nihilism. Turgenev constructs him faithfully and without bias, and allows the man to live and breathe and think so perfectly throughout the enirity of the work. For that reason alone the book is worth reading.**Bazarov may be my favorite character in any novel, only short of Alyosha in B.K. I say this because Bazarov represents the secular humanist who is self gratified in his scientific altruism, but (not to spoil anything) rounds with an ironic existence.Five stars, awesome, objective russian literature, that like most, is dynamically applicable to the modern political melting pot."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"This book has stood the test on time. I regard it as one of Turgenev's best work. Its story characterizes the generation gap between fathers and sons and the social and political unrest of its day which draws immediate parallels to current issues of today. An important volume for any collection of Russian literature."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"Bless him for keeping this one short, unlike his contemporaries in Russian literature. Unfortunately, the fact that this book is 200 pages is the best thing I can say about it. This is so clearly the case of an author who had a political statement to make and decided, unwisely, to couch it in a fictional as opposed to non-fictional format. This would have made for a great political or sociological treatise, but it is not good literature. The characters and plot are so obviously secondary to the message. The characters are one-dimensional, predictable, and transparent. The plot is forgettable and really almost seems to have been an afterthought. The only real merit of this book is that it captures the birth of an important social and political movement, at a very pivotal time in Russian history."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"Whilst a valuable insight to the nature of Russia in those changing days, this book is hardly a treat to read. Historically, Russia is behind the times compared to the rest of Europe, and you can see that clearly portrayed.However, my problem arises within the realm that without the proper framing and realisation of the proper bias that this book is coming from, this book stands to lose its impact.I felt Bazarov was a hypocritical, self-destructive prick, and throughout felt him abrasive and abusive on a whim. He's the supposed hero, but his end is that of anything but a matryr, leaving me wonder as to \\"why bother?\\"My sympathy went much more to the uncle with the European tendencies, Pavel, and I found myself vindicated in his survival and ability to return, in the end, to Europe where he felt at home and could be happy. If he was meant to the be the anti-hero, why bother letting him win, and the actual hero die such a foolish death? Arkady is a character that's enjoyable in a passive way, who, though he affiliates with Bazarov and considers him a friend, is parted and goes on to live a life seemingly contrary to what Bazarov was extolling. His is not a happy ending, per se, but a bittersweet one.This is a fair enough novel-- it's readable and crafted enough to not be accidentally good-- but if Turgenev wanted to weigh in on the state of current Russia, he should have written a non-fiction book and published that. It wouldn't have mattered-- in his time, authors of fictional works were as prosecuted as much as the non-fiction under the Tsar. Why frame the opinion in a story that leaves for more reader interpretation that goes beyond authorial intention?If this is a textbook for a class, beware the intentions of the author. Modern literary interpretation may lead you astray on this book, and away from what the professor is expecting; IE, the fictionalisation of Turgenev's Russia."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"This book by Ivan Turgenev was, all in all, a pretty good read. I myself favor Dostoevsky because I think that the other Russian others can't hit so true and honest a note than Dostoevsky can.Anyway, the book centers around Evgeny Bazarov and Arkady Kirsanov. Arkady is the young disciple of Bazarov, a nihilist.Bazarov lives a life of pride, insolence, and anger. He is abusive, harsh, and very critical. He has no idea what love really is, in fact he says \\" love is a contrived feeling, don't you think?\\" He is an empty individual with no real heart or soul. Unlike Raskolnikov of \\"Crime and Punishment\\", we really don't see that Bazarov has any redemptive qualities.The book is good as a work of art. The language flows very beautifully, and Turgenev's descriptions of nature are exquisite. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"I'll start out by saying that this was not the version I read. I read a different translation (the Signet Classics version), but as I do not speak Russian and have not read the original, I can't honestly say if the translation made a difference. I'm reviewing the content, and nothing else.I think the thing I enjoyed most about \\"Fathers and Sons\\" was that it was short. The great Russian classics we generally think of are \\"War and Peace\\", \\"Crime and Punishment\\", etc. These are all long, drawn out books. \\"Fathers and Sons\\", thankfully, is short(er), with fewer characters and less confusion as to which person is which, especially since few have similar last names. Confusion does arise between Nicholas Petrovich and Paul Petrovich, his brother. There it is important to remember who is who, but luckily, their personalities are very different and it becomes clear very soon.Another thing that is nice about \\"Fathers and Sons\\" is that it's different. It is not a book of great dramatic fighting (though there is one). It feels human and realistic. All the characters have both virtues and flaws that are easy to relate to. The ending is sad, but at the same time it is happy. It doesn't feel over-done, and I especially liked how the romance stuck in was sweet and not too out-there.The book also reflects the difficulties Russia had during that period of time. Things were changing and some didn't welcome the change as much as others. Things that had once been acceptable became strange, and the people who believed in the old things became outdated. This book shows the concept of a generation gap beautifully while maintaining an interesting plot and characters.I recommend it, partially because it's simply a good book, and partially because it shows that not all Russian classics must be long, drawn-out, and with lots of complicated names. Turgenev, who came before Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, will hopefully remain with them on the literary level for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"I really love the great Russian authors such as Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, and I had never really heard of Turgenev, but when I found a book by him I thought I should read it. Turgenev is a grand writer in his own right, and this particular book is the one that is his masterpiece. It is about fathers and sons, but it's also about the influences that other people have on impressionable young people. And it's about passion and love, but a love that actually harms a young man. It all takes place in Russia before the Revolution, but all of the social wrongs are depicted and we get a clear idea of why the Revolution happened. We also get a wonderful description of what life was like in the country in Russia during these troubled times. The plot is simply drawn and easy to follow, and the characters are straightforward and typecast to a point. I think his simple descriptions of the growing political anarchy in Russia during the nineteenth century are very effective and his portrayal of the troubled state of the peasantry is brilliant in its simplicity. I certainly would recommend this book if you are fond of nineteenth century Russian literature. It's certainly a little easier to read than you'd expect."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"Fathers and Sons has been hailed as a masterpiece of Russian literature, but I knew nothing about it before picking it up. I was certainly impressed.The book centers around Yevgeny Bazarov, a young radical who embraces the idea of nihilism. Bazarov rejects the old conventions of the past (religion, aristocracism, liberalism, essentially all \\"-isms\\") and believes that life is meaningless. During his travels with his friend, Arkady Kirsanov, he discusses and argues his beliefs with both parents and other characters. Despite his insistence that nothing in life has any meaning, Bazarov is a caring, loving man.What happens in the plot is of little importance compared to the progression of Bazarov and his beliefs over the course of the novel. The novel's ending comes suddenly, but is not surprising.What is more crucial to the novel's success is the way it captures the essence of people's relationships and feelings through Turganev's recounting of events. One always can tell where people stand in their opinions of each other simply by their basic actions.I was fascinated that in Bazarav, I could see feelings about tzars and social class in general which was reminiscent of the impending Soviet Communist Revolution. I also saw overtones of modern existentialism in a 19th century novel.Like many Russian novels, Fathers and Sons can be somewhat wordy and complex. I am not sure if the English translations are to blame or if the style of Russian writing is simply not what Americans are used to. Nonetheless, Fathers and Sons is a classic and should not be missed."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"I am a well read physician and yet I had not read Fathers and Sons until this week.

It's an excellent book heartily recommended, even though he goes a little too easy on the progressives, radicals, internationalists and nihilists."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"This book is an interesting look at Russia in a time of change. Nihilism was gaining favor, the serfs had been emancipated, and the old way of life had begun to die. In this work, Turgenev explores the nature of the conflict between old, traditional values of class and custom and the new way of thinking. The title, Fathers and Sons, is aptly named, for this novel examines the gap between two generations' way of thinking. On the one side, the sons represent a new way of thinking called nihilism. Bazarov, the main character in the nihilist camp, represents the new generation of thinkers, those who accept nothing on authority and question everything. He influences a young man named Arkady, who becomes a sort of disciple of his. On the other side, Nikolai and Pavel, Arkady's father and uncle, respectively, represent &quot;Old Russia.&quot; Nikolai is a landowner and, though he has emancipated his peasants and tries to be progressive, is stuck in the past. Pavel is the extreme traditionalist, representing everything that Russia was at the turn of the nineteenth century.Turgenev uses these characters to explore the strengths and weaknesses of each way of thinking. The book seems to make the statement that the old way of life is inadequate and needs to be replaced, though he does not provide a solution. At any rate, Turgenev does not seem confident that nihilism can provide the necessary change. In the end, Arkady drifts away from Bazarov's influence, and becomes a sort of compromise between Bazarov's way of thinking and Nikolai's, and in this there is, it seems, at least a partial solution. Though he does not propose to solve the problems he points out in this novel, Turgenev sheds some interesting light on the subject of nihilism vs. traditionalism at a time of social upheaval in Russia."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"A classic piece of literature is defined by its ability to transcend time. _Fathers and Sons_ is one such book. It is the story of a son, returning from college with a fellow student, and his father. It is also about the generation gap that exists within the family, the dynacmic of college friends, the marvelous magic of youth, and the strength of familial ties.I first read this in college, but, like good wine, the story has imporved with age. As I have gained experience and wisdom with years, so has my appreciation of the brilliance and wisdom of Turgenev's observations. All too often we think of ourselves as the first to see or experience things - from love, to ideas, to the exuberance and idealism that being young is all about. Turgenev shows us the folly in that line of thinking. And in so doing, gives us a glimpse of the universality of what it is to be human. _Fathers and Sons_ ranks as one of my favorite books for this reason. After a reading, I am sure you will agree."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"...Actually, some of my favorites are the Russian writers and true to form, Turgnev's is a novel of philosophy, love (both brotherly and romantic), and sprinkled with a little adventure and tension. Uncharactaristic of Russian novels though, is Turgnev's terse, economical form and (in my opinion) his neutrality to the chaaracters involved. Unlike Tolstoy, there are no seemingly irrelavent asides, and unlike Dostoevsky, Turgnev doesn't play favorites with the characters.The novel itself is about a young man (Arkady) returning home from college with a friend (Barazov). These two boys are nihilists (meaning they accept no tradition or general truth outside of the scientific). Arkady's father and uncle are traditionalists and the clash is interesting and as several reviewers mention, shockingly relevant to our current climate.Another point of departure from the Russian Novel... is that the characters change very much through out the novel. Instead of accentuating character traits and sticking with those, Turgnev cleverly weaves the characters through the ups and downs of love, travel, deuling and death. If you appreciate good characters as I do, you will find the growth of these multi-faceted characters thrilling. You might even want to keep a highliter handy for some of the authors amazing observations and lines (i.e., \\"After all, he didn't become a nihilist for nothing!\\") ..."},{"Title":"Fathers and Sons (Oxford World's Classics Hardcovers)","review":"One of the most eloquent works in Russian literature, Fathers and Sons has had a major influence on subsequent Russian writers. Turgenev weaves so much into this short novel. As the title suggests he is dealing principally with generational differences, but ultimately this is a book about finding yourself in the world. In Bazarov, we have the ultimate nihilist, someone who renounces all societal conventions, which his peers utterly fail to understand. As a young doctor he has turned his back on noble society. We see some of his old feelings briefly rise to the surface in a romance which he pursues, but Bazarov chooses to extinguish those feelings, and return to his paternal home, where he ultimately seals his fate.Turgenev is the bridge between the Russian writers of the early 19th century and the later 19th century. In many ways, Fathers and Sons reminded me of the theme which Lermontov explored in &quot;A Hero of Our Time,&quot; and Turgenev appears in Dostoevsky's work, even if deliberately as a caricature."},{"Title":"Are We Moving to Mars?","review":"As an elementary school media specialist, and a Summer School Space Camp Captain, I was introduced to this wonderful paperback in the Voyager Space Camp Kit. As an introduction to colonization of Mars, the book gave my summer &quot;astronauts&quot; inspiration to build their own colonies.

I taught Reading Recovery for ten years and have studied struggling readers for forty years, and I know these resources will work. I also like the authors she used to gather her research.

Yes, errors do occur in all texts, and that is regrettable. However, neither of the examples of the mistakes in Appendix M would keep students from locating the books mentioned. As a school librarian I constantly have kids asking me to help them locate books. Sometimes I am lucky if I get a clue such as \\"I think it had a blue cover\\" to go on. I certainly could show students how to use an OLCC to locate books by either author or by title or through other methods. Plus, I have a storehouse of knowledge as the librarian about good books and authors. Dr. Beers has provided some excellent titles, several hundred of them as I recall, to motivate reluctant readers.

And though I've had the best of intentions to try and help the students, I've always felt as though I've been taking stabs in the dark to try and successfully teach, despite all of my teacher certification classes (which all seemed to think that by the time a student hit middle school, the student should actually know how to read and comprehend).This book, however, has changed all of that. It explains what to do when, and why. It even goes beyond just \\"reading\\" with helpful ideas about spelling and classroom management. I can't fully explain how helpful this book has been, except that it should be required reading for all English teachers. I've flagged so many super-helpful pages to return to, and this will definitely be a book I reach toward often. With public schools increasingly populated with struggling readers, this is a must-read.My only criticism of the book is how some of the strategies are presented. Some of the strategies are given full coverage, with examples, explanations, potential pitfalls, etc. After covering about 3 strategies in depth (in a chapter), Beers will then do strategy \\"snapshots.\\" These snapshots are sufficient, but not nearly as illuminating as the full coverage she provides the others.

This is my reason for not loving this book.The information about different reading strategies including those to use before, during and after reading is very good, however, and the reason that I bought this book again after the class was finished and I was in the classroom.

I honestly don't remember the name of the other book for, I as looked through the two, it was clear which would be the more useful. I bought Kylene's book and have never looked back! Kylene explains a variety of reading strategies to help readers make meaning of text before they read, as they read, and after they read. Her ideas on vocabulary instruction are some of the most useful I have ever encountered. Kylene addresses how struggling readers also have difficulty with spelling and gives us concrete suggestions to help our readers improve their spelling skills. \\"Sound it out\\" does not often work for the struggling reader; a chapter on word recognition is very helpul. Most importantly, Kylene addresses the need for us to create confidence in our struggling readers and she offers suggestions as to how teachers can do this.

Oh, we're GREAT readers and love literature and know how to teach it (to avid and average readers). But throw a kid at us who struggles with reading (and we get them every year) and they're likely to fall through the cracks, because our solutions are rather simplistic. We say things like, \\"Read it again,\\" or \\"Sound the word out,\\" or \\"Look the word up.\\" When they hesitate before a strange word while reading aloud, we give them the word. When they don't do the reading assignment, we watch them flunk our quizzes and wonder why they are so lazy.Enter Kylene Beers, with easily the best book I've read on the subject of struggling readers who are NOT of elementary age, but of middle and high school age. Yes, elementary teachers have reading specialists to fall back on, but in secondary schools, it is often either the English teacher who must intervene or no one. For Beers, the inspiration for writing this book was the number of former students she had who were condemned to \\"or no one\\" because she simply did not know what to do. For me (and probably legions of other teachers) her story will sound chillingly familiar. Fortunately, WHEN KIDS CAN'T READ: WHAT TEACHERS CAN DO is the antidote to our problems.In this book, Beers identifies the myriad of types of students who struggle with reading, and why. She provides practical strategies on how to intervene if your students struggle with comprehension, vocabulary, spelling, and word recognition/fluency/automaticity. There's also advice on how to help kids in responding to literature, as well as how to help them find a book that will tap into their interests.Each chapter includes an introduction and thorough definition of the problem, a section called \\"Step Inside a Classroom\\" which details real-life transcripts of kids having this exact reading difficulty, and a list of various strategies you can try -- even if it means having different groups with scaffolding activities within your language arts classroom. At the end of the book are appendices that include such helpful reproducibles as bookmark templates, common roots/prefixes/and suffixes, Fry and Dolch word lists, common phonics generalizations, 175 most common syllables in the 5,000 most frequent English words, word sorts, easily confused words, common spelling rules, and booklists for every type of reader. Can you say goldmine? This is the end of the rainbow, folks.I can't recommend this book enough to my fellow 7-12 English teachers. Reach out to your weak readers. Don't condemn them to a life of mediocrity (or worse) in literacy by assuming either it's their problem or they are beyond help. It's not and they aren't. Buy this book and put it to good use. This is where theory meets the road (called \\"practicality\\"). Be not only an English teacher, but a READING teacher (in every sense of the word)."},{"Title":"When Kids Can't Read, What Teachers Can Do: A Guide For Teachers, 6-12 (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'm a Title 1 teacher in Oregon, and I work with the types of readers that Kylene Beers talks about in her book \\"When Kids Can't Read: What Teachers Can Do\\". I found her book to be loaded with practical, \\"use in your classroom the next day\\" ideas that are easy to implement.Now, my school is an elementary school, and initially I avoided this book due to the \\"Guide for Teachers 6-12\\" label on it. Boy, was I wrong. While the focus of her book is for middle and high school teachers, most of her techniques are excellent techniques for the younger learners as well, especially the fifth grade students that I'm working with. She has taken many of the concepts we use in elementary school and upgraded them for older kids; but good teaching is good teaching, no matter what you are trying to do.This book is so practical, on the inside front cover, you are given a simple chart that list reading problems that kids have, and the chapter that you can immediately turn to in order to get ideas! It can't get any friendlier than that.However, I also suggest a more thorough read through of this content. Beers talks throughout the book of a student named George that she taught early in her career, before she knew much about teaching. Sprinkled through the text, before and after each chapter, write writes lovingly to George about how she failed him time and time again, in direct relation to the content of the chapter. As a teacher, looking back on my own career, I can totally relate to that. If I knew then what I know now... the letters become Beers \\"mea culpa\\", and they are a beautiful addition to the text.I highly recommend this book for ANY teacher struggling to teach struggling readers reading. It's practical, easy to use, and loaded with great ideas."},{"Title":"When Kids Can't Read, What Teachers Can Do: A Guide For Teachers, 6-12 (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a great book for ESL teachers, new teachers and even seasoned teachers that need to help their kids think higher level and need help with comprehension.

If you have found a couple of geocaches you will probably not find much of interest here."},{"Title":"The Geocaching Handbook (Falcon Guide)","review":"I'd never heard of geocaching before so when I saw this interesting title I had to find out what it was about.The idea is simple and sounds like a lot of fun, though, because basically, it's a game where people leave secret stashes of goodies hidden in places all over the world that you use your GPS system to find. The stashes typically contain things like CDs, DVDs, books, non-perishable food items, maps, inexpensive gifts and trinkets, and so on. Enthusiasts sometimes follow a trail of clues like an old treasure hunt to find the cache, in addition to using their GPS system. They can be buried in the ground in remote wilderness areas or left under a park bench in a city. There are caches in every U.S. state and many countries around the world, from England to Estonia. The book gives the GPS coordinates of each cache.Since the game was invented a few years ago, it has rapidly evolved and many new variations have been invented, including geodashing, garmin games, geoteaming, hide and seek, just 4 openers, letterboxing, microcaching, minute war, multicaches, orienteering, poker run, project ape, tag, virtual caches, webcam caches, volksmarching, story cache, and something called the \\"stampin' fools game.\\"The book covers GPS basics as well as the history of the technology, and the chapters include GPS units, Creating Caches, Geo Games (which I just listed the names of above), Backcountry Safety and Etiquette, Geo Happenings, Clubs and Websites, and Cachinary 1.0.The book has a forward by Dave Ulmer, the inventer of the sport, including the dramatic story of his snowmobile crash on Mt. St. Helens back in the days when the civilian GPS system accuracy was only 1/10 of what it is now--which was the reason for his crash. Because of that positioning error, he'd gotten into the chute right next to the one he was supposed to be in, which led to his crash.Overall, this is an interesting, entertaining, and detailed introduction to the sport of geocaching that should be of interest to beginning and seasoned geocachers alike."},{"Title":"The Geocaching Handbook (Falcon Guide)","review":"This was an excellent book when it was first published, and still is.

In this book he tells the story of his days in France and with French troops as they collapse before the Germans. He attributes this not to the quality of the fighting men, who he regards as first class, but to the inferiority of their equipment and their strategy. Towards the end of the book he will speak with a young Free French officer Charles de Gaulle who had some years before written a book calling for the using of Armor in a new way. Unfortunately none of the French General Staff paid attention, while the German General Heinz Guderian did.Reynolds in the second part of the book shifts to reporting from England during the Blitz. He is a great admirer of the English character and determination. He notes that they all believe they will emerge triumphant from the War, even when they are being pounded from the air by the Germans.The book is incidental and anecdotal. It does not contain any real political or military analysis. It also does not provide any deep character description or analysis.It has a certain picaresque quality. And while it does have descriptions of what it is to be under fire, and the target of bombings it does not really provide descriptions of battle, or war- action.It is however an important document in showing what the English people were going through during the Blitz. And its historical role was I believe in arousing American sympathy for them.Today close to seventy years later it still reads well. A decent book by a decent person and very good reporter."},{"Title":"The wounded don't cry","review":"\\"The Wounded Don't Cry,\\" Quentin Reynolds; Crowell-Collier Publishing Co. (1941)\\"By Quentin Reynolds,\\" Q.R.; McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc. (1963)[The following was originally a letter & later served as the basis of this compound review of \\"The Wounded Don't Cry\\" (1941) & \\"By Quentin Reynolds\\" (1963), both written by a renowned World War II journalist & author (1902-1965)]\\"Who knew there was a publishing house in Lafayette, Louisiana?\\" amused you.But the major league U.S. publishers also get the well-deserved rakes in the face after carelessly stepping on them - while piously pretending all along that their standards are superior (see my review of \\"My Dearest Friend, Letters of Abigail & John Adams,\\" Belknap Press of Harvard University Press 2007).Just finished a Broadway theater reviewer's 1930s memoir, Ward Morehouse's \\"Forty-Five Minutes Past Eight\\" (the time of evening, decades ago, when the NYC theatre curtains rose & the shows began). Can't recommend it. Thin gruel. Literary grits.What also rankled was that if there was ever a book with the need for an index, this was it. In addition to the waves of pointless \\"laundry lists\\" (of actors, musicals, dramas, movies, etc.), WM also took it upon himself to type up the names of just about every American theatre & film critic.Again, dozens of names, in no particular order. Looked like the aftermath debris of an explosion at a pre-internet Yellow Pages print shop.[For a competent & humorous discussion of past Broadway critics, see \\"Opening Night On Broadway, A Critical Quotebook of the Golden Era of the Musical Theatre, Oklahoma! (1943) to Fiddler on the Roof (1964),\\" by Steven Suskin; Macmillan (1990). I hasten to add that, unfortunately, it was Steven who gave me the idea to buy FFMP8: \\"[These] are entertaining chronicles of early Broadway\\" (the other book is \\"Matinee Tomorrow,\\" which would probably sour me on Wednesdays for the rest of my life.]*****Onward, or maybe just sideways, to Quentin Reynolds' books.His 1963 memoir \\"By Quentin Reynolds\\" flat-out reveals him as a good-hearted, genial liar - since what he wrote in 1963 about his flight as a refugee to England in 1939, he had also detailed two years after the actual event, in his best-selling \\"The Wounded Don't Cry\\" (1941).The stories don't match.After fleeing the swift & victorious Nazi armies outside the gates of Paris, he then had a ton of trouble at dockside in England with the British authorities - simply trying to get off the Dutch freighter that had carried him & others refugees from France. Once off the boat, they were detained to an even further extent, despite the American ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy's request that they be released & allowed to return to London.All detailed, presumably in candor, in TWDC in 1941. Completely different story in 1963, in BQR.You'd think that the editor of BQR in 1963 would made it his business to read TWDC, which, in turn, would have enabled him to notice such a ridiculous discrepancy.And: No indexes!Reynolds's writing is competent, willing & entertaining - occasionally superb - but his credibility is in question.

It is not the best laymans guide to physics, and that is not the fault of Einstein.reading Einstein's own writing, he was great at knowing the audience and talking to that audience in a clever way. When talking to the layperson he had a very engaging and almost playful personality. And he could boil down the most complex concept into a clever metaphor or puzzle which anyone would understand and find entertaining. ( his academic stuff is clearly not written this way, but different audience ).All of that is lost in this book, and that is Infeld's fault. Had he been a layperson conversing with Einstein and scribbing, the text would probably be more reflective of Einstein. But Infeld does a great job of muting Einsteins personality in this book.

It is deceptively accessible because it is profound physical principles simply explained as Einstein and Infield saw it at the time, it is physics and not mathematics. The math used is basic and the book explains all of it very carefully. It is not a comprehensive book on physics.After reading this short book (perhaps many times over)the reader will gain a wonderful understanding of both classical and modern physics as Einstein saw itIt is deceptive because the physical principles are simple and also a profound part of Einstein's thinking about classical physics, modern physics, relativity and quantum physics, and Einstein's though processes in developing relativity and quantum physics from some seminal basic concepts in classical physics. It also explains what physics is all about, its philosophy, the scientific method, and the history of physics.It is fascinating to read of the evolution of Einstein's thinking in physics to his discovery of special and general relativity and quantum physics, told in his own words with the help of Infeld. This book is one of the all time classics of science.Excellent for both children and adults with an interest in science, physics, and Einstein. may be used as a suvey text, although it was not written to be a textbook. a scientific classic. extremely easy to understand explanation of Einstein's thinking on classical and modern physics. the math is explained, where it is used.It also includes Einstein's views of quantum physics and statistics, and it does not suggest that there was any conflict between Bohr and Einstein on this issue, although there were famous debates between them. This book suggests that Einstein had by the time the book was written accepted the statistical nature of quantum physics.I would also recommend Einstein's \\"Relativity and the General Theory\\" and also the classic paperback of reprints of the original works of Einstein and others on relativity (more advanced but of great value to see the original papers).In the Evolution of Physics are extremely clear explanations of what is science, physics the history of thought in physics, the evolution of classical thought in physics and how it led to relativity, and quantum physics. What we mean by modern and classical physics, relativity, the statistical nature of quantum physics as distinct to the use of statistics in everyday usage and in classical physics, the difference between between math and physics, theory and evidence, the contradiction between theory and evidence as the ultimate source of new theories which better explains the evidence, the philosophy of science.All of these topics are discussed clearly, simply and profoundly for both scientists and non scientists. The book is deceptively simple and actually requires probably at least more than one full reading to really understand it. After you have read it completely, a rereading will provide greater insights into the meaning of the earlier chapters. Many of us will find ourselves reading it many times for its beauty and clarity.This book is in summary a brilliant scientific classic, a survey of physics, wonderfully accessible to the general public, stemming from the collaboration of Einstein and his assistant Infield. Highly recommended. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The evolution of physics;: The growth of ideas from early concepts to relativity and quanta","review":"This is a wonderful book ultimately leading to a discussion of relativity. Even so, the style of exposition is unusually good. I suspect Professor Infield wrote the book, albeit in collaboration with Professor Einstein.

I bought this copy so I could re-read it. It was well worthwhilte.The authors have totally eliminated math from their presentation. As a result, the stickler may feel slighted, because there are no proofs in the scientific sense. However, they take you through 'thought experiments' which occur only in your head. If you take the time and make the effort, they will build in your mind a picture of how various broad ideas happen; ideas such as the complex interactions between electric and magnetic fields, and they even give you an appreciation for the four equations known as 'Maxwell's Equations', and do so without ever showing you the equations. They take on the duality of light (how it sometimes behaves as a wave and sometimes as corpuscles), and hint at a similar duality in the quantum world of sub-atomic particles.From those discussions, they go directly into special relativity.Who could ask for anything more.If you like trying to understand physical ideas, you should really like this book."},{"Title":"The evolution of physics;: The growth of ideas from early concepts to relativity and quanta","review":"This is an inspiring book. I know quite a bunch of people who decided to become physicists after reading it. Two interesting aspects should be mentioned. First, it was really written by Infeld, though thoroughly discussed, in a daily basis, with Einstein.(Infeld was a refugee under Einstein's protection, and thought he had to justify his temporary shelter at Princeton by writing something, which would also provide some income!). Another book by Infeld, &quot;Quest&quot;, an autobiography, is the source of this and of many other interesting things about that period. Second, this book introduces very clearly a revolutionary contribution of Einstein's which is rarely recognized: a new method in physics which consists in obtaining knowledge from the comparison of observations of the same physical system obtained by two different observers. Though this had been done before (by Mach, for instance), it was Einstein who transformed it into a new tool for science. Physics was transformed by that, and quantum mechanics could then go even further, in the role given to the observer. This story is wonderfully told in this book."},{"Title":"The evolution of physics;: The growth of ideas from early concepts to relativity and quanta","review":"While it would seem likely that one should go to another source to explain what Einstein's work really means and how it came about, this extraordinary book, coauthored by Einstein and Leopold Infeld, is perhaps the most cogent and interesting account of the origin and implications of relativity theory ever written. It offers the general reader - even those of us not steeped in Physics and physical theory - a fascinating glimpse of one of the most significant intellectual leaps of the last century. Much more comprehensive and engaging than such relativity 'primers' as Russell's ABC's of Relativity, it is both a very stimulating and readable account.Since Time Magazine recently selected Einstein as the Person of the Century, it seems timely to recommend this book as a fascinating introduction to the mind and work of someone who is normally thought to be beyond ordinary human comprehension. That he is an exceptional intellect is beyond question. What is remarkable is that he is able to communicate clearly to those of us less blessed with brillance. This is a wonderful book for any who have an active interest in how the universe works and how revolutionary new insights about the universe can be achieved with thought alone. An amazing book."},{"Title":"The evolution of physics;: The growth of ideas from early concepts to relativity and quanta","review":"Physics can be difficult to learn when theories and formulae are thrown at you with no historical context. You begin learning about motion, and then electricity and magnetism, and it's almost impossible to see a coherent connection between the ideas. Many people have heard of relativity and quantum theory, but do not have even a general notion of what they aim to explain.Like mathematics, you can learn physics without knowing about the people behind its development (though you will encounter many of their names in important expressions), but it never hurts to study how such ideas began, and how they came to be what they are today. Einstein and Infeld's book is aptly titled. They show how and why certain concepts came into being and what significance they hold. Beginning with \\"The Rise of the Mechanical View,\\" they describe vectors, motion, forces, and energy. With \\"The Decline of the Mechanical View,\\" they show how the behavior of electricity, magnetism, and light waves poses problems for the mechanical view.The next two (and most interesting) sections explore field, relativity, and quanta, and how they have proved more accurate in describing physical phenomena than what was previously known. Einstein and Infeld describe everything with a minimum of mathematics so that anyone with an interest in the development of physics can understand the contents. Although such math is necessary for a precise understanding of physics, the aim of the authors, which they frequently repeat throughout, is to give the reader a broad understanding of the general underlying principles. They have succeeded in giving an account of where the human construction of physics started, what has been covered since then, and where it is heading. It is a simply written book, suitable for readers who don't know physics and want to learn, but also helpful for students of physics who want to see a broader picture of its evolution."},{"Title":"The evolution of physics;: The growth of ideas from early concepts to relativity and quanta","review":"As the authors state, \\".. thought and ideas, not formulas, are the beginning of every physical theory\\". True to this statement, this book focuses on thoughts and ideas and does not use any formulas at all. This makes it good as an adjunct for standard texts that contain the formulas, but not as a substitute for such books. This book is divided into four sections: the rise of the mechanical view, the decline of the mechanical view, field and relativity, and quanta. It is thus about how the mechanical view of Newton evolved into the modern view of physics (relativity theory and quantum mechanics).I would like to focus on how this book might be perceived for three different classes of readers.(1) For those who have never taken a physics course (or did and tried to forget the experience as soon as possible) -- The lack of any mathematics may be comforting to this class of reader, but it will nonetheless not be an easy read for them. The basic concepts, such as inertia, may be difficult to grasp for those with no previous physics background, but the author's do a good job of describing things. (A task made more difficult without recourse to the shorthand of mathematics.) I would, however, recommend this book only to those who are motivated to go well beyond their comfort zone. However, if they focus on the concepts that are being described and are patient in following the lines of reasoning, they should be richly rewarded.(2) For those who have taken physics courses, but do not have advanced degrees in physics -- I put myself in this group and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I liked this book because it focuses on the why (the basic underlying theories of physics), rather than on the how (problem solving). In doing so, it provided a much better understanding of what is behind the equations than I found in physics texts. I got a very clear picture of the deficiencies of Newtonian mechanics and Maxwell's equations, and how this led to relativity theory. I found this very illuminating as it more clearly showed me Einstein's thought process. If found this even clearer than that presented in Einstein's book on relativity (prepared for a general readership). Of all the groups of readers, I think that people in this group will get the most from this book.(3) For those with advanced degrees in physics - People in this group may have already been exposed to the concepts described here, but this book will still be very helpful in that it shows clearly Einstein's logic in developing relativity theory and the quantum theory of light. Much of this may be old hat to this group, but the book will still be of interest from a historical perspective.I think that this book does an admirable job of appealing to and satisfying the needs of readers who approach the subject with diverse backgrounds."},{"Title":"The evolution of physics;: The growth of ideas from early concepts to relativity and quanta","review":"This book provides a still useful account, from 'the horses' mouths', of what Alfred Korzybski called the Newtonian and non-Newtonian views in physics. As Korzybski noted, all human beings form a view of so-called 'reality'. Understanding how scientists do this can have value for the rest of us. In this excellent book, the authors emphasize general formulations and a non-mathematical approach: \\"Most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple, and may, as a rule, be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone\\" (29). The book includes chapters on \\"The Rise of the Mechanical View,\\" \\"The Decline of the Mechanical View,\\" \\"Field, Relativity,\\" and \\"Quanta.\\" Readers will be rewarded with clear explanations of some potentially forbidding notions. These are interspersed with useful comments on physico-mathematical method, theory and the goals of science. Einstein's and Infeld's discussion demonstrates their view that \\"Science is not just a collection of laws, a catalogue of unrelated facts. It is a creation of the human mind, with its freely invented ideas and concepts. Physical theories try to form a picture of reality and to establish its connection with the wide world of sense impressions. Thus the only justification for our mental structures is whether and in what way our theories form such a link\\" (310)."},{"Title":"The evolution of physics;: The growth of ideas from early concepts to relativity and quanta","review":"This is the best short book that I know of on the history of physics--equally useful for the casual observer of science and the serious physics student. Einstein is capable of presenting the basic ideas of physics in a way that is succinct yet complete--and he never loses sight of the broad, revolutionary ideas that make the history of physics so exciting. This is undoubtedly because physics actually IS exciting for Einstein, and this excitement comes through in every page.This book reads as if Einstein thinks of physics as a really good story--complete with all characters and action of any good story--that he really wants to share with his reader."},{"Title":"The evolution of physics;: The growth of ideas from early concepts to relativity and quanta","review":"Written by Albet Einstein you would expect this book to be too complecated and boring, think agian.

Is it a substance, a wave, both? Another thing, is that the speed of light is a &quot;universal speed limit&quot;. As matter moves it shrinks and at the speed of light it disappears.

I purchased this textbook ten years after graduating from college, having read rave reviews and predictions of what it would mean for new generations of students freed from the long-outdated Keynesian textbook by Paul Samuelson, and indeed I was not disappointed. The book is not merely complete, comprehensive, and modern--it is designed to get knowledge into your head with maximum efficiency and enjoyment. A reviewer below called accused it of oversimplification, which I would call inaccurate even if it weren't an introductory text, in which space simply does not permit inclusion of the details of outmoded theories. Unless you are a student, you are unlikely to read it from start to finish, but you will find yourself skipping from one interesting topic or sidebar to the next that catches your eye.Samuelson once said, &quot;I don't care who writes a nation's laws, or crafts its advanced treaties, if I can write its economic textbooks,&quot; and Mankiw even slyly quotes him in his preface. Along with politics, the knowledge of economics is mandatory for being an informed voter. If more citizens were armed with this textbook, bonehead politicians would be a lot more respectful, and responsive to our real long-term needs."},{"Title":"Principles of Economics","review":"If you read only one book on economics, read this. It deals clearly and concisely with the substance of economics and with the economists' approach -- an approach that far too few people appreciate, and which this book will instil in you. Claims that the book does not have enough math and does not cover Keynesian macroeconomics are misguided.Regarding the supposed lack of math, one must remember that math is merely a tool that should be used to clarify and not confuse economics. If one can explain economics in English, so much the better. Economics needn't be hard. Mankiw's economics is at least as good as the best of the harder and more mathematical textbooks, and better than the rest. The need is for good economics to be explained well to a large audience, and this book does it superbly.Regarding the exclusion of Keynesian short run macroeconomics, all I can say is &quot;Whew! Finally! At last!&quot;. Keynesian short run macroeconomics taught at the undergraduate level is mindless, unintuitive curve pushing and generates neither understanding nor love for the subject. Teaching that (especially in a first course to a general audience!) is absolutely unforgivable. If anyone is married to Keynesian economics, they can use Mankiw's &quot;Macroeconomics&quot; which covers with exceptional clarity and brevity all the standard material in an intermediate macro course including the ugly Keynesian short run macroeconomics. However, I am against such an approach. The proper way would be to do Mankiw's &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; in the introductory course and then cover the market-clearing approach to macroeconomics of Barro's &quot;Macroeconomics&quot; in the intermediate macroeconomics course."},{"Title":"Principles of Economics","review":"Mankiw's textbook is a giant leap backwards in the teaching of economics to undergraduates. Naturally, it is always commendable to attempt to simplify complicated concepts to students, but there are limits - particularly in a principles textbook, perhaps the only economics that many people will ever encounter. In this case, it can be considered downright dangerous.Mankiw &quot;dumbs down&quot; economics, underestimating the average intelligence of a university student. The clearly anti-analytical tone of the book can be counterproductive at times. Several comments from my students noted that Mankiw's style makes it seem that, say, a particular argument is &quot;obvious&quot; when Mankiw explains it, but they could not produce it by themselves since the argument does not seem to use any of the tools which they are busily acquiring. In other words, what is &quot;obvious&quot; to Mankiw and to someone with more training in economics, is rarely &quot;obvious&quot; to the student. The student with analytical bent who has made the necessary investment into learning the tools will find them useless in a lot of the problems set out in the book.The irritating &quot;scientistic&quot; tone of the book makes it seem as if what Mankiw says is &quot;the truth&quot; and &quot;accepted&quot; by all economists. At least Barro's principles text was considerably more honest in its partisanship and announced loudly that there were other views. Mankiw does not do this. What makes this &quot;scientistic&quot; tone even more irritating is that it is used with particular verve in areas where current economic debate is most controversial - thus giving a misleading view of even the &quot;mainstream&quot; of economics. Furthermore, it makes a lot of economics boringly &quot;deadpan&quot; rather than a living and growing discipline.Most remarkable, given Mankiw's supposed specialty, is the incredibly compressed and poorly-written last few chapters on macroeconomics. He has singlehandedly decided to obliterate 70 years of research in macroeconomic analysis and leap back to the empirical platitudes of the 1910s and 1920s. It is one thing to be anti-Keynesian, it is quite another to pretend that the Keynesian Revolution never happened. Not even Barro did that. What is most dangerous is that Mankiw is now teaching thousands of students that unemployment is caused by labor market frictions and high wages, and never a word on effective aggregate demand (which, until Mankiw's textbook, was THE mainstay of macroeconomics).On style: Mankiw writes in a nice conversational tone, albeit a bit too elementary, and always with very carefully chosen words. His examples are not always well chosen and even disturbing at times (e.g. the initial discussion of the impact of seat-belt laws).I used this book to teach elements of macroeconomics this year. It was a terrible choice and I shall never do so again. Perhaps elements of microeconomics may be better served. Mankiw's textbook is not worth acquiring, assigning or reading. Barro or Colander are much, much, much better - and far more interesting."},{"Title":"Principles of Economics","review":"This is the ONLY textbook which I read for PLEASURE. After reading his famous &quot;Macroeconomics,&quot; I decided to pay 90 bucks for this book to read in my spare time. This book did not disappoint. Unlike most college professors, who beat their students with useless details that no one uses except economics professors, Mankiw delightfully teaches students to see the forest and THINK about economics instead of just memorizing boring details. I believe the quality of textbooks is measured by how much it makes students THINK and ANALYZE the subject than how much it shoves information down their throats. This book makes students WANT to think more about economics, not just force them to memorize facts, graphs, and figures."},{"Title":"Principles of Economics","review":"I used this text in my intro Econ course this year and (for the first time in my memory) heard unsolicited praise of the book from many of my students.

It seems more geared towards those people who want a general but accurate working knowledge of economic topics, especially since it shuns use of mathematics like the plague.

A recent meeting of a reading group of mine finally allowed me to make the time to read Howells' 1885 work, &quot;Silas Lapham&quot;. I am extraordinarily glad I did. From the start of the novel, we are drawn into the world of late 19th century Boston, post-Reconstruction America, where newly rich industrialists attempt to enter the society life of old money. Howells crafts an extraordinarily realistic look at the American Dream gone awry.&quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; begins with an interview that a local newspaperman is doing of Colonel Silas Lapham, a mineral paint tycoon. Lapham's account of his rise from the backwoods of Vermont to his marriage, to service in the Civil War, to his propagation of a successful mineral paint business is chronicled and gives us a taste of the effort and perseverance necessary for his rise, as well indicating the possibility of some potential failings, especially with regard to his one-time partner, Milton Rogers. We soon learn that Mrs. Persis Lapham aided a society woman in distress the year before, and the return of her son, Tom Corey, from Texas, signals another sort of ambition on the part of the Lapham daughters, Irene and her older sister Penelope. The rest of the novel plays out the ways in which the Laphams try to parley their financial success into social status - and how the Laphams are affected by the gambit.Howells explores a number of significant cultural issues in &quot;Silas Lapham&quot;: isolationism, social adaptability, economic solvency among all classes, personal integrity and familial ties, and the relationship between literature and life. The fact that the story is set about 20 or so years after the end of the American Civil War sets an important and subtle context that runs throughout the novel and inflects all of the thematic elements. The ways that the characters interact, the way that the society functions, even though the majority of the novel takes place in Boston, is importantly affected by the fact that Reconstruction is drawing to a close, Manifest Destiny is in full swing, and ultimately, America was at a point of still putting itself together and trying to view itself as the &quot;United&quot; States.Howells' treatment of the social interactions between the industrially rich Laphams and the old moneyed Coreys underscores the difficulty in creating and maintaining a national identity, especially when the people even in one northern city seem so essentially different. The romance story involving the Laphams and Tom Corey is obviously an important element of the story, and Howells does an amazing job of not allowing the romance plot to become as overblown and ludicrously sentimental as the works of fiction he critiques in discussions of novels throughout his own work. &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; questions the nature of relationships, how they begin, how they endure - the contrast between the married lives of the Coreys and the Laphams is worth noting, as is the family dynamic in both instances.I'm very pleased to have gotten a chance to read this novel. Generally when I say an author or a work has been neglected, I mean that it's been neglected primarily by me. Having turned an eye now to Howells, I am very impressed with the depth of his characterization, the ways he puts scenery and backdrop to work for him, the scope of his literary allusions, and his historical consciousness. This is certainly a great American novel that more people should read. It may not be exciting, but it is involving, and that is always an excellent recommendation."},{"Title":"The Rise of Silas Lapham","review":"William Dean Howells's &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; is one of the earliest American novels about a businessman, and that qualification alone makes it a literary curiosity, but what is most remarkable about it is what its title character is not, rather than what he is. Silas Lapham is not a ruthless, villainously greedy tycoon who bullies his employees and relishes destroying the careers of his competitors and enemies, but a conscientious, likeable man to whom misfortune happens because of his gullibility and sense of guilt rather than hubris.Lapham is a human emblem of the new American industrial economy of the 1870s. A self-made millionaire in the paint business, he is now one of the richest men in Boston and is radiantly proud of the fact that he has earned every dollar. Having grown up poor and undereducated in Vermont, he still speaks in a rustic vernacular and has yet to understand the rationale behind the rules of high society, let alone assimilate them. A simple, practical man with a sense of duty, he even put aside his business to serve in the Civil War, in which he was seriously wounded and achieved the rank of colonel. He can be boastful and garrulous, but he is not arrogant or overbearing.Lapham is dearly devoted to his wife Persis, who in turn has supported him through thick and thin, and his two daughters. Penelope, the older girl, is relatively plain but witty and sardonic and, at least in the first half of the novel, never seems to take anything seriously; her sister Irene is the more beautiful but vapid and superficial. Irene falls for Tom Corey, the young man who comes to work for her father as a foreign sales representative, but Tom and Penelope have a mutual attraction that, Penelope fears, could break Irene's heart. This romantic subplot allows Howells to contrast Tom's family, part of the old Boston aristocracy, with the even wealthier but socially crude Laphams with whose daughter Tom's mother has snobbish doubts about his possible union.The novel has almost the air of Greek tragedy in that Lapham is a man of stature who has fatal flaws that threaten to destroy him. He is a teetotaller, and when he does take the liberty of trying some wine at a dinner party, he embarrasses himself and his family by talking too much. He abstains from gambling, but, instigated by his former business partner and current gadfly Milton Rogers, he gets into financial trouble when he stakes money on bad property and bad stocks. And, to compensate for a traumatic event in his past, he is charitable almost to a fault to a pretty girl whom he employs as a typist in his office.The style of &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; is a dramatic realism similar to that found in the novels of Howells's contemporaries Frank Norris and Theodore Dreiser; the structure is straightforward, and the dialogue cuts to the core in laying bare the characters' sentiments and unfolding the plot. It may fall short of being a &quot;great&quot; novel, but for its candid portrayal of a specimen of the nouveau riche, it can be considered a minor monument of nineteenth century American literature."},{"Title":"The Rise of Silas Lapham","review":"These days Howells is usually overlooked in favor of the more overtly urbane Henry James or the grittier Stephen Crane or Theodore Dreiser. That's a shame, since Howells at his best is a more varied and thought-provoking author than any of them. The Rise of Silas Lapham is Howells at his best. The title is quite ironic, of course, but ultimately spot-on, as Howells' nouveau-riche bumpkin is redeemed only in losing it all. Lapham is keenly drawn, alternately frustrating in his bluster and affected pompousness and endearing in his genuine (if sometimes poorly expressed) love for his family. Other characters are not so fortunate; one of his daughters remains mostly a cipher, and both Mrs. Lapham and Bromfield Corey, the rich scion of society whose favor Lapham so earnestly covets, are dangerously close to stock characters. Howells excels at elaborate descriptive prose focused on intricate detail, sometimes to the point of exhaustion. Some elements of the plot may seem quaint to modern readers, but Howells does not treat them with condescension. The Rise of Silas Lapham is definitely a book of its time. Perhaps it is so rewarding because his time and ours are not necessarily so different as we think."},{"Title":"The Rise of Silas Lapham","review":"The photographs of Alfred Stieglitz still look modern and talented today, but it's nearly impossible to imagine how they would have looked to viewers in the 1890s, when they were taken. They were revolutionary, amazing, radically avant-garde. In a similar vein, the first novel about an American industrialist---a novel first printed in 1885---cannot seem so new, so fresh to our 21st century eyes. This theme startles nobody anymore. But in tracing the ups and downs of Silas Lapham, late of a Vermont village, a Civil War veteran, and founder of a fortune in 1870s Boston, Howells produced a highly original novel for his day. Lapham, his plain-spoken wife Persis, and two daughters live in luxury, thanks to the successful paint manufacturing business whose ubiquitous ads disfigured large portions of the New England countryside. Puffed up with success and not averse to considerable bragging, Lapham decides to build a sumptuous mansion on the water side of Beacon Street in the then-new district of Back Bay. At the same time, the Laphams come into contact with a family from the old Boston Brahmin elite, a family whose son falls in love with a Lapham daughter. The reaction of both families to this potential liaison, the love affair itself, and the fate of the Lapham fortune form the subject of this solid novel.William Dean Howells was and is known as one of the early American \\"realists\\", as opposed to the more romantic style that dominated most of 19th century English language literature. Not being a person well-versed in the \\"accepted wisdom\\" of literary criticism and history, I can only say that compared to later writers, for example, Crane, Norris, Dreiser, and Sinclair, to be followed later by Anderson and Lewis, I find that Howells' work still retains plenty of the more romantic elements even while he does portray the life and business of a paint tycoon with considerable accuracy and empathy. No snobbish repudiator of nouveaux riches gaucheries, Howells. This book is not a sarcastic look at the \\"ridiculous efforts of a bourgeois to climb above his station\\". Lapham may have his faults, but he is essentially a good, likeable man. If you have an interest in Boston history or in knowing what Boston life was like in the 1870s, I believe you will certainly enjoy reading THE RISE OF SILAS LAPHAM. The story is a little artificial, the language a bit outdated, I felt, though in comparison to the horrors and perversities that throng some modern works, the novel might fill a few winter afternoons with a quiet pleasure. Certain stylistic oddities surprised me, such as the sudden appearance of a narrative \\"I\\" after over 200 pages ! Howells has been quite neglected in recent times: for sure, he may not be a Dostoevsky, Balzac, or Faulkner, but don't brush him off."},{"Title":"The Rise of Silas Lapham","review":"William Dean Howells is an unjustly neglected American Renaissance author; his prose is more readable today than Clemmens, Hawthorne or Melville. His background as a journalist no doubt helps. The Lapham family is a delight to spend a couple of hundred pages with, as they interact and ultimately fall prey to Boston brahmin society. Silas Lapham is a self-made man who scores a killing in paint from his dad's farm; he becomes a self-unmade man. You get absorbed in the world Howells describes. Especially good reading on a plane."},{"Title":"The Rise of Silas Lapham","review":"This book blew my mind! I found it absolutely engaging and the character of Silas Lapham was endearing to the point of surprise. This book says a lot about a class conscious America and even more about how \\"mom and pop\\" capitalism gets pushed aside to make way for impersonal mega corporations.Silas Lapham is a good-hearted, yet rugged individualist who pulled himself up by the bootstraps to make a giant fortune. Once he succeeds however, there is a whole group of people at the top of the ladder ready to push him onto his face, along with his whole \\"wretched family.\\" No matter what he does to fit in with the \\"old money\\" he just can't seem to fit in and the more he works to fit the millionaire mold, the more he compromises his own values.What's best though is that we see him and his family through good times as well as through the downward spiral after his business crashes, and while it is sad, we see that they return willingly to what once was without coming out any worse.This book made me smile because the characters, especially Silas Lapham, are realistically flawed and human. I recommend this highly."},{"Title":"The Rise of Silas Lapham","review":"To the page, this book is symmetrical in its structure. It opens with a public confession (to a reporter) and ends with a private one (to a priest). In the exact center comes Lapham's moment of realization when he is drunk at a party. There is more to the structure, but that should be enough to get you going.A reviewer below calls Lapham a 'mogul with a conscience' which is accurate. The true core of this book is the way Howells carefully built it, though. Considering it comes from an age before modernism, it certainly feels quite modern. Give it a shot."},{"Title":"The Rise of Silas Lapham","review":"Well, I can not say that W.D. Howells was another Nathaniel Hawthorne. But what I can say is that his &quot;The Rise of Silas Lapham&quot; is A LOT better than some books that were made famous (probably for political reasons). Do not expect the superb images and construction of Hawthorne. But what we CAN expect is a timeless message about society. At first Silas is a rich money grubbing monster. (Just think of Dickens' Scrooge.) He finds ways to cut his friends out of deals, alienates his family with the want of more money, and even gets his wife upset. Ah, but later things go bad, and he starts losing money. This is when the human side of him begins to show and he becomes a very sympathetic character. In my opinion, to enjoy this even more, you must assume that before the book opens, he WAS a good and decent man. Once he ran into immense wealth, he grew detestable. So while, this is not exactly a masterpiece, the degeneration of Silas and his return to humanity is ample material to carry this book and place it in the American Museum of Literature."},{"Title":"The Rise of Silas Lapham","review":"This is a must read book and provides a glimpse of business morals in the nineteenth century. Read first, Mark Twain's &quot;The Gilded Age&quot; and Charles Dickens' &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;. Silas' 'rise' is not ironic unless accumulation of wealth is your only value. While his monetary assets may shrink, his family 'prospers' in many ways. Clearly, Howells makes the point that honest work can bridge the gap of old rich and new. Commerce is not inherently bad, but it does ask the question, how far should one go in disclosure and protecting others from their potential investment folly."},{"Title":"The Rise of Silas Lapham","review":"You might be able to take a man of humble beginnings and make him a rich man, but can he ever cross the line into Society?

Howells' work is credited with being the first impotant novel that truly focused on an American businessman, a man who came from nothing to become someone to contend with, but a man who still couldn't fit into the gentile Boston society because he was noveau riche and not from old money.

His wife and two daughters, Penelope and Irene, want for nothing, but unknowingly remain outcasts in the society. When a young man name Tom Corey (from old money) takes an interest in Laphams's business as well as in one of his daughers, Lapham sees it as a way to truly take his place among the society he so desperately wants to impress and be accepted by. However, incidents and mistakes from Lapham's past show up just as his star is on its meteoric rise, forcing him to change hiw ways, for better or for worse.Some of the standout elements of \\"The Rise of Silas Lapham\\" is the love triangle between the Lapham daughters and Tom Corey, as well as the Corey family's reaction to Tom's interest in one of the girls. Penelope Lapham is a clever and comic likable character, and there are moments when even Silas and his wife Persis are easy to identify with. However, Howells spent too much time telling the story and did not allow his characters room to breathe and exist by themselves in the minds of the readers. While not an overly long novel, I found it a difficult read because much of the story is either boring or told in a boring manner. I wish Howells had dedicated more time to the intriguing aspects of his character's life instead of on the mundane and annoying."},{"Title":"The Rise of Silas Lapham","review":"I was assigned to read \\"The Rise of Silas Lapham\\" as part of my Gilded Age class. The novel follows the rise (and fall of the titular character). Lapham made his money from mineral paint and as part of the new-rich he seeks to raise his social status by building his dream house in Beacon Hill, Boston.To complicate matters there is a suitor for one of his daughters who comes from an old-money family. Their is a supper party that is filled with gaffs as the \\"country-bumpkin\\" Laphams try to make their way through \\"high society\\". Including a scene of the normally prohibitionist Silas getting rip roaring drunk.There is a fall and a redemption in this book. William Dan Howells wrote this book as an antidote towards the more sentimentalist novels that were produced at the time. Though the dialogue to a modern audience can seem stiff at times, you must realize he was trying to move towards a more neo-realist form of fiction.This novel is highly recommended for class assignments for: The Gilded Age, Post Civil War America, Capitalism, and Social Class Divisions, and Comedy. The forward was well written, and the included extra material of \\"racist\\" language which was toned down between when this books was published in serial form in the \\"Century\\" Magazine was most enlightening."},{"Title":"The Rise of Silas Lapham","review":"Silas Lapham is a self-made man who despite having a fourtune is unable to break into the upper-crust of Society.

It is extremely well-documented, but as with any book, bold statements about individuals and organizations need to be further validated - which I personally have not taken the time to do. I, like many others, have for a long time had an understandably reasonable suspicion of secret organizations. It's the kind of thing you would expect children to invent rather than adults unless there are some sinister motives behind them. My suspicisions lend appeal to the book. Also, it is interesting how he fits many pieces of a puzzle together.

Many of these secret societies have gone through a major metamorphosis that has led them to become legitimate entities and organizations. These organizations have been ruling every aspect of our lives for many years. Just like in organized crime, these powerful families even tend to intermarry among each other to strengthen the bond of power and wealth among themselves. They are the invisible rulers of the world that make the policies which in return bring them more money and power. You will learn in this book how it all started and why it will never end. This is not a book about evil, or about a doomsday scenario, but it is a book about man's desperate quest, obsession, and addiction to power, control, and aspiration to become god. The one world order (globalization is another benign name for it) has already happened and no one can stop it. The elites have facilitated the wedding of the global corporations to the political world, thereby creating a conquering hybrid machine which has tremendously succeeded in subjugating every corner of the globe economically and militarily if needed. This book will provide the reader with enlightening concepts that might be so shocking to believe. Still's research is disturbing and unsettling but very well documented and mostly accurate."},{"Title":"New World Order: The Ancient Plan of Secret Societies","review":"I read William Still's New World Order: The Ancient Plan ... and found his research of magazine article, available books and some out-of-print material worthy of consideration. His conclusions on some materials are quite faulty in my view.1) p. 31 &quot;So to Luciferians, God has a dual nature ...This idea is symbolized by the circular ying-yang symbol of the Buddhists&quot;. I am not quite sure how the Buddhists ever owned the dualism of energy described by the Yin-Yang. Actually it is dark side of the hill, light side of the hill. It describes energy as being composed of expanding, concentrated forces and contracting, diffuse sources. It never sought to describe a God concept in these terms, check the Tao if curious. That is what bothers me about this type of conclusions offered in parts of the book, sometimes shallow in concept, lightly supported, and occasionally conclusions are emotionally stated.2) Singular references are brought in support of a line of reasoning that is desired to be proved. In some cases the single reference does quite force the proof of the statement - p. 31 &quot;Lucifer the angel of light , forevermore became Satan, the evil angel of darkness&quot; Isiah 14:12-15 is offered in support of this statement. I can see no support for the contention as to whether Satan and Lucifer were distinct personalities or were the same personality from the scriptural reference. But Still goes forward as it is.But I believe the book has high points if you are careful about not implicitly trusting the generalized conclusions from the author: 1) Chapter 12 - Central Banking, The Council on Foreign Relations and FDR is probably worth the price of the book 2) the independent research offered brings up forgotten points of history: the Ted Kennedy-E. Richardson exchange on Nixon's final days, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace statement of purpose.This book has several pieces of research while I do not know if they support the Mason's internal secret plan thesis are quite interesting.I would suggest reading."},{"Title":"New World Order: The Ancient Plan of Secret Societies","review":"Great research!

William Still takes the unusual tactic of investigating secret society activity through a fundamental Christian perspective. This could have led to interesting results, but this book comes nowhere close. I am not trying to criticize Still's beliefs, but he clearly comes from the religious tradition that believes that any sort of behavior that does not agree with his theology 100% is &quot;satanist&quot;. In fact he condemns his subject matter as &quot;satanist&quot; or &quot;satanism&quot; so many times that the judgement loses its force very quickly. Still also comes from the branch of Christianity that feels that all persons or ideas that do not comply with those fundamental beliefs to the letter are part of a vast conspiracy seeking to crush Christian beliefs. Once again, Still's personal beliefs are his right, but he has such a clear contempt for his subject matter that he is completely unable to investigate it in any useful fashion. Just when he is on the verge of unveiling useful information about the actions of secret societies, each time he collapses into tired religious dogma.This book is not the &quot;investigative&quot; journalism that Still tries to tell you it is. I'll give him a little credit for trying, but he fails. He is completely unable to see around his personal hatred and contempt for his subject...."},{"Title":"New World Order: The Ancient Plan of Secret Societies","review":"The author writes this book from a fundamentalist biblical perspective, which makes it like trying to argue the bible with someone who continuously quotes it out of context.

The author fairly early on (thankfully allowing you to set the book aside without much loss of time)lets you know the book is written from the point of view of a &quot;Christian&quot;. Apparently, the only reason we are not all enslaved to the much feared One World Government is due to the valiant efforts throughout history of a few enlightened Christians, who have kept the Beast at the door. From that premise, the book rapidly degenerates into a silly patchwork of spurious allegations, pseudo-history, unsupported theories, and random bits of moralizing. As an example, the reader will be enlightened to discover that, contrary to what we are taught, the French Revolution had nothing to do with inequality, povery and oppression, but was rather artificially caused by a small group of &quot;secret society&quot; members who engineered the entire thing for their (never defined by the author) purposes. All in all, one of the silliest books I've read, and very disappointing for someone who truly wishes to learn about these matters. If you want entertainment, read this book, although you could get about the same thing in a much more interesting format with a few &quot;X-Files&quot; reruns.

Jay is one of the best speakers and writers out there!"},{"Title":"Real Options: Managing Strategic Investment in an Uncertain World (Financial Management Association Survey and Synthesis Series)","review":"This book is another good example of a phenomenon I call \\"Fad-peddling\\" at its worst. \\"Real Option Valuation\\" is just a fancy new name consultants-for-hire have made up to describe a set of problems economists like Dr. Pindyck have called \\"contingency claims\\" problems for years. Given the history of the two terms, I prefer \\"contingency claims\\", because of its record as a term used by economists in academic journals and because \\"real options\\" sounds too much to be like some new fad, like \\"reengineering\\" or \\"liberation management.\\"Most of the other reviews are absolutely right: this book seriously lacks any quantitative explanation. No need to look for kind words; this is a serious oversight. And yes, this book does read like a long sales resentation.While the authors adequatley describe broadly how economists and financial executives solve contingency claims problems (generally using binomial methods, simulation, or partial differential equations), they don't teach any of these methods in any useful way. At best, after reading this book, you will be able to recognize whether or not your organization has any \\"real options\\".Beyond the quantitative short-comings of this book, however, there are some flawed fundamentals about their whole approach: this book treats real options as a new finance panacea for the 1990's, and suggests that the world of finance in 20 years will be a very different place because of these revolutionary ideas. Contingency claims problems are limited to a very specific set of economic phenomena with specific criteria. If the criteria are not present, contingency claims models fall apart. Consider the amount of abuse something as well-known as the black-scholes option pricing equation is subject to when it is applied to \\"real options valuation\\": the black-scholes equation is a function of two variables, primarily: time and stock price variance. When you take this equation and try to apply it to, say, the valuation of an option to market patented drug, how do you define variance and time? Time in an option contract is fixed in the contract. Variance is empirically observable from stock prices. Plus, how do we know that the value of drug patents resembles stock prices (log-normal process)? What if it is more like the behavior of a commodity (mean-reverting process)? And where are we going to get the data from anyway? In that case, the black-scholes equation needs to be abandoned and an alternative partial differential equation needs to be developed. But who is going to do that? At what cost? Obviously, at a certain point the benefits derived from exactly modelling your options is eclipsed by the cost and effort involved in doing so. The scariest part, however, happens when you realize that the greater the variance (risk) and the longer the timeframe chosen, the greater the final value of a project or investment. Now the project manager who wants to sell ice to the eskimos has the quntitative methods available to justify such a high risk project. (Just think, the project manager could sell this project to top management as a long-term investment anticipating the melting of the polar ice caps, when the price of ice in Greenland is expected to go through the roof).This book tries to reach too far, suggesting that phenomena which never should be valued as contingency claims can be valued as such. Real options (or contingency claims) are best treated as a very specialized set of quantitative techniques used to model very specific phenomena which a company may or may not be subject to see \\"Investment under Uncertainty\\" by Dixit and Pindyck for an inventory of those phenomena). Push the envelope too far and the paper tears as it does here."},{"Title":"Real Options: Managing Strategic Investment in an Uncertain World (Financial Management Association Survey and Synthesis Series)","review":"The importance of the subject can't be overstated.

Although this book will explain the power of real options I feel it does a very poor job of explaining how to evaluate them. Additionally the book has errors in some of its examples and in more than one place is incorrect. (ie spread option analysis) In several places it gives some theoretical values with no explanation as to how they were reached. I would only recommend you read the 1st Chapter in each section, as subsequent chapters just repeat the material but with a different concept. Definitely not for the person looking for a book with some meat on it.

Not inspiring and not recommended."},{"Title":"Real Options: Managing Strategic Investment in an Uncertain World (Financial Management Association Survey and Synthesis Series)","review":"I was rather disappointed by this book. I was hoping for something which could help explain to business managers why processes such as IT delivery are uncertain, and the value of delivering flexible solutions. The initial part of the book makes a lot of strong qualitative statements of exactly the right sort:- There is great value in breaking up large projects in uncertain markets- Options (flexibility) create value out of uncertain events.- Exit options which allow you to step away from a planned path, even if relatively expensive, may have significant value.- An option such as an exit option, can make an investment viable when it would fail a traditional NPV test.- Small speculative investments can enable larger investments to benefit from learning and to be much more accurately targeted.- It may create greater value to start many projects and abandon more, rather than aiming to abandon a minimum number.Unfortunately the remainder of the book then supports these statements only for a very limited set of circumstances. The Real Options approach only seems to work if the option can be translated into (or at least mapped onto) a tradeable financial security. There's no real attempt to provide tools to evaluate internal uncertainty, such as the delivery uncertainty common in IT projects, or the value of flexibility except where it maps to significant investment decisions.The book does do a good job of explaining that real world situations are non-linear, with value which changes as a result of natural volatility, over time, and as a result of one or more decisions. Traditional NPV-based approaches greatly undervalue flexibility, insurance, learning and platform investments, and can't really deal with this non-linear aspect. Simply increasing the investment discount rate, which is the usual way of dealing with such problems, doesn't bring the correct focus onto uncertainty and total risk.However, the mathematical basis for Real Option valuation is not well explained, and I found the processes difficult to follow. I suspect that the authors implicitly assumed a certain familiarity with economic and financial market techniques and terminology, which limits the value of this book to those seeking, as I was, to apply the techniques to other fields. It also left me puzzled as to why simpler approaches, such as Decision Tree techniques, can't be used instead.Surprisingly for a relatively short book the text is very repetitive, and too often turns into a blatant advert for the Real Options approach compared with others, rather than making the case on its own merits.Hindsight is a great thing, but it is unfortunate that this book praises Enron as an example of success through options manipulation, where we now know this was largely a \\"long company\\" scam. Some of the other examples, quoted at the height of the Internet boom, have also not stood the test of time. However, these should not be seen as invalidating the approach, merely as evidence of how uncertain things may really be.This book provides some good ideas, and if your focus is major business-critical financial transactions it may be very useful. But I'm still looking for a good book on how to generically value flexibility."},{"Title":"Real Options: Managing Strategic Investment in an Uncertain World (Financial Management Association Survey and Synthesis Series)","review":"The only saving grace about this book is that it is readable. However, the reason for this is because there is not much to learn about RO from this book. The author's talk about numerous examples and the &quot;concept&quot; of how RO was applied.

It recognizes that there is just as much power in developing a 'real options way of thinking' as there is in understanding the mechanics of the economic theory. Having worked for several years in product development where traditional financial treatments like NPV are extremely limited, I cannot emphasize enough the power of these frameworks. I would highly recommend this book to people who are similarly frustrated by their current managmement tools which fail to capture the nuances of the strategic decisions they face. Through its structure and frequent case examples, the book makes real options much more approachable.

It is very hard to find articles / books online or offline that directly attack Real Options methodology. It seems a kind of profanity.The principle of arbitrage capital market (like Delta Hedge Portfolio) is an important basis for giving an intuitive understanding why the Black-Scholes option price formula does not depend on the estimated price for the underlying asset (Notice that Markowitz Optimal Portfolio uses it)But the arbitrage (and diversification too) hardly applies in the context of real companies, though it would be the desire of a well-diversified shareholder who is indifferent to the risk of internal company because it is diversifiable.Furthermore, a high volatility asset with and enough time, turns projects OTM (Out of The Money) positive, i.e., many times, even if the investment is lesser than the NPV of forecasted project's cash flow, everything can be solved, if there are enough volatility and time.This value can not be wrong if the asset is very dependent on the market, only that the risk of the option can not be exercised is high and it may be that the company has no reserves for this kind of setback.In Academic work there are thousand of intricate Real Options modelling (for instance, JAIMUNGAL, Sebastian; LAWRYSHYN, Yuri. \\"Incorporating Managerial Information into Real Option Valuation\\", Toronto University, 2011 )Most modern paper like that get rid of naive Random Walk and Black Scholes formula.However, in most models, one try to find an asset or portfolio that correlates well with the desired target (contingent claim). but many times that correlation is just data snooping mixed with fake trend correlation. Besides, in many situations the real project is so stochastic and complex that it is difficult find this replicating portfolio.Another common process for incomplete markets is the use of dynamic programming using a risk adjusted rate, with all the vices inherent at the CAPM model.Volatility measures, Geometric Brownian Movement and other math artefacts, generally make part of this game. It doen't matter that the author believe or not in EMH (Efficient Market Hypothesis). Market prices is all about chaos, shaking and manipulation.In the real world, out of the Capital Market, Free Cash Flow is a compound figure that mix many different variables, that surely internal information within the company helps to elucidate and that he is influenced by the macroeconomy (like commodity price or the whole demand), but depends strongly from actions and decisions that occur within the company or project.I believe that exists a real academic obsession in compares any private company with capital market in some way.After all, in the real world the private risk, project risk mixed closely with the market risk, even inside the same variable and no option type (simple or complex) encompasses all, not nearly.This book itself is primitive and deals with Real Options like a God of Valuation (It does not show any realistic limitations of Real Options).The book is little quantitative, very verbose and furiously attack alternative methods (Analysis Simulation and Decision Tree) in 3 or 4 lines on pages 39 and 40.The best practical Real Options books are the Kodokula and Papudesu's bookProject Valuation Using Real Options: A Practitioner's Guide. andReal Options Analysis: Tools and Techniques for Valuing Strategic Investment and Decisions, 2nd Edition (Wiley Finance).The latter book presents a nice explanation about the intuition behind lattice trees and lattice equations.Avoid also the Tom Copeland's book (Real Options, Revised Edition: A Practitioner's Guide), it's confusing and it have a lot of typos.I have developed a new concept of Valuation, whose abstract can be read here(greatsolutions dot com dot br barra publint dot htm)The article is \\"Debunking Market-Driven Valuation\\""},{"Title":"Real Options: Managing Strategic Investment in an Uncertain World (Financial Management Association Survey and Synthesis Series)","review":"This is an excellent book to get an overview of real options, IF you are already familiar with the valuation of financial options.

The argument that corporate management with real-options will, in the long run, be rewarded by investors, is intriguing &amp; plausible, but not well supported in the book.In short, I would recommend this book to corporate managers who have studied financial options in college and for whom real options may not have come up before as a decision-making approach."},{"Title":"Real Options: Managing Strategic Investment in an Uncertain World (Financial Management Association Survey and Synthesis Series)","review":"I face difficult decisions every day -- the underlying information on which to base any of my decisions is often incomplete or uncertain.

This book addreses the general manager through case studies shorn of obscure and unnecessary detail.I would recommend this book for a general audience as an introduction to option thinking. But the book is uneven in tone (though it is structured so readers can skip the less relevant parts).Its biggest weakness may be when it comes to talk about how to calculate option values. It is still to dismissive of simulation (and wrong on some technical limitations) and too attached to traditional methods such as &quot;binomial trees&quot; and formulae like Black Scholes.The book (perhaps uniquely in the options literature) stresses the importance of communicating results and their rationale to decision makers: if you can't explain the analysis, you won't change decision-makers minds. But traditional calculation methods are part of the problem. We need calculational methods that are transparent and provide insight not just analysis. For option thinking insight is far more important than precision."},{"Title":"The Queen of Second Place","review":"Cassie Howard is used to be second best. Ever since she was a small child, she has never been number one. Nope, she's always come just shy of holding the title of numero uno, and has always fallen into number two. And, lets face it, after years of riding someone else's coattails, Cassie plans on being number one at something. Something good. But with Sterling Carter, that dream seems near impossible to ever reach. Sterling Carter is perfect, from her glamorous tresses, right down to her pedicured toes. Sterling has never been second place in anything, which is why Cassie knows that her new endeavor will land her behind Sterling, once again. You see, Cassie and Sterling are both vying for the attentions of the same guy: Kevin Matthews, and while Sterling will do anything sneaky and underhanded to win his love, Cassie is about to take a trip down clueless lane, that is sure to teach her never to try and beat Sterling at her own game.Laura Peyton Roberts has done an amazing job with THE QUEEN OF SECOND PLACE. Following closely in Meg Cabot's footsteps, Roberts' Cassie could easily be the step-sister of Cabot's Princess Mia. Cassie's story is told in a batch of useless essays written during her stint in detention, and narrated by Cassie herself, who brings readers through a tale of a twisted love affair, a boy who can halt any line - be it the lunch line, or the line at the movies - a girl who rips out the tags from her jeans so no one knows what size she truly is, and a guy who can find a perfect parking spot at the drop of a hat.

Cheating on school assignments, taking her father's car without permission, and betraying her friends all to try and win the attention of Kevin. Sterling, a.k.a. Fourteen-Karat, is of course one of those perfect girls that everyone wants to be best friend of and secretly despises. Through her desperate schemes, Cassie ends up making a mess of everything-including losing her best friends along the way. Will the queen of second place finally win what she wants most? As Cassie tries to solve the problems she created, she learns the meaning of real friends, her own capabilities, as well as self-confidence.The Queen of Second Place by Laura Peyton Roberts is a great book to read on a rainy day. Although the plot is clich&eacute;d and Cassie's antics are not surprising, Roberts makes the novel enjoyable through her creative writing. Even though the reader can predict exactly what will happen next, there's still something in this novel that makes the reader want to read on.

Overall, a GREAT, easy read."},{"Title":"The Queen of Second Place","review":"There's just something about reading stories that you can relate to that make them a joy to read. As someone who grew up feeling like her own version of THE QUEEN OF SECOND PLACE, relating to Cassie Howard was easy. She's pretty, she has friends, she's been on a date or two, she gets good grades--etc., etc., etc. But for Cassie, being a second-bester isn't good enough. She's looking for A-List status, for the admiration of her peers and, maybe more importantly, for her own self-worth.When she falls in love at first sight--yet again--with the new boy who has transferred to her school, Cassie knows that sophomore year will never be the same. She's determined that this time, for once, she'll be the one coming out on top, at least where Kevin Matthews is concerned. But no sooner does Cassie catch Kevin's attention than her nemesis, Sterling \\"Fourteen-Karat\\" Carter, moves in for the kill.Throughout the story, it's never quite clear if Sterling is as unabashedly vicious as she is out of jealousy or just pure spite. When she learns of Cassie's interest in Kevin, Sterling is, of course, even more interested in landing him as her boyfriend. As Cassie becomes more and more desperate to gain the first place position in this one thing, more important than any that has come before it, her values and morals somehow fall by the wayside. Suddenly she's driving a car without a license, she's plagiarizing parts of a one-act play, she's ditching her friends to work out yet another scheme to get Kevin to notice her.As Cassie's plans backfire and even second place seems a long way away, it's up to her to realize that people might actually have more than one talent. As her self-assurance and self-confidence both take a tumble and grow as never before, Cassie might just learn that second place doesn't always mean losing, and that good things do come to those who wait.THE QUEEN OF SECOND PLACE is a thoroughly entertaining, enjoyable read. True to life characters and engaging dialogue make this book a winner, and, if you're like me, you'll be looking forward to reading more about Cassie and her high-school adventures inQueen B, scheduled for release in July 2006."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Superior product; arrived on time & too bad the movie was so effective."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Certainly the most lyrical, at the very least.A feast for lovers of the English language.A feast for lovers, too.Simply consider Chapter 7.

The problem lies in the utterly self-referencial nature of the narrator, which sometimes obscures the fascination of every other character save himself. Of course this is meant to be part of the point of the book, but to me it just emphasizes my conviction that Warren tried too hard with this novel. He had everything working but for some reason decided to blur the facts (perhaps as an intential obscuring of history) in the muddled numbness of someone who has distanced himself from his own life and relegated himself to an observer.Second person narration is a difficult goal to maintain (one inevitably thinks of The Great Gatsby, helped out a great deal by its brief length) and Jack Burden ultimately comes across as a gloomy, arrogant, pompous jerk, so self-obsessed that the legitimicy of the tragedy and greatness of others is numbed, dragged down, trapped in the lowered expectations of his own world view. This brash imposition of reality is to be commended--as highly praised as anything that has been highly praised in this book. Jack is miserable and for good reason. He'd never expected anything of anyone in his life and can be satisfied that no one can disappoint him (until the betrayal of a long since ended romance comes along, but I should be honest--this sub-plot contains most of the parts I found boring and 'self-reflective'--I guess I don't imagine liking the author personally very much--).The prose, clearly, is confidently assured, a guy never struggling with style and language. Even the characterizations of others is profound, dense with meaning and the full force of graphic realization. But when he gets to himself, despite Jack's boasts to the contrary, he backs off and grows defensive, merely covering up, seeking not only to prove but to justify every wrong turn he's ever taken in his life.I don't like Jack Burden.

Only Willie Stark and Jack Burden intermittently ring true. The other characters, especially the women, are props stuffed with clich&eacute;s. The plots churn with coincidences and melodramatic events. And some passages are close to camp in their laughably extravagant rhetoric."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"let me start off bye saything that the book is a good book but it has its flaws. One of the few flaws it has however is that alot of the dialogue between different characters is to long and drawn out and not very exctiteing, but the actions bye the powerful polictical leaders in this book is what will get you hooked. It make want to see what happens next. See its about a man named willie stark whos corruption and crave for power almost led the us to have a dictatorship. Throughtout the book he learns how to bend the rules without breaking them however once he gets the power he has craved for so long he is slowyly taken down by senators and people in office with him seeing his true goals for america. It puts you in a possesion to wonder what would america be like with a dictator. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in history or good villians."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Warren has created a book not about &quot;the rise and fall or an American dictator&quot; as one edition has written across the cover- which has deprived the novel of its due fame. &quot;All the King's Men&quot; deals with Jack Burden's inability to fathom actions have consequences and this is rather interesting. Anyone can see Warren is a very learnt and well-read author. His novel relates to Huey Long (Willie Stark) - the political figure in Lousiana although the main character is NOT Willie Stark - but Jack Burden the narrator and reporter. I found this book philosphical and well-written. It is true one can not sympathize with the protagonist who palys the role of an anti-hero. Not the most interesting but very thought-provoking. ~15 yrs."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Perhaps it's because the beginning was so slow... I just couldn't get into the characters. I have yet to see the movie but I am tempted to rent it just to see if it might spark more of an interest in the subject. A far better political novel is The Last Hurrah by Edwin O'Connor."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"All the King's Men is based on Louisiana's Huey Long. Willie Stark's story is told through the eyes of Jack Burden, an aide to Gov. Stark. One can quickly realize where the entire notion for Primary Colors came from. A note of warning: the book is set in the 1920's through 1940's of the Deep South; within that time-line and region comes nasty social realities. I haven't a clue as to whether Warren himself comes out in the derogatory racism or if he just wants to truly capture the era, however, it is difficult to accept how casually and easily such fowl language can be used against other human beings. With that said, I think a far greater harm would be done by trying to sugar coat the past into something it wasn't. The book is incredibly well written and one can feel themselves a part of the story with the intense description throughout. All the King's Men is a classic story of how a politician feels he must resort to achievement by any means necessary as opposed to exhibiting proper means AND ends. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Yes, All the King's Men is one of the 5 greatest American novels, for all the reasons people here cite, and more.But this is not that novel. It is a piece of junk unjustly cadged together with manuscript fragments that one of America's greatest writers never wrote in this form. Despite decades to do so, in a life of over 90 years. A very careful,writer, scholar, and teacher too. This edition is a gratuitous insult to his memory and a dangerous precedent in American letters. The public should not countenance it. It doesn't matter if one paragraph or one sentence only is changed. Indeed one single word can change a whole book, as the recent restoration of Ulysees has proven. But that was justified because of: (1) an copyist's error that persisted for decades; (2) poor Joyce was blind. No such excuse exists here for putting in words that Robert Penn Warren cut out. Any writer knows that cutting is as important as writing. And certainly do not believe the ridiculous lie about the editor supposedly goofing with Warren's intention. For one thing, that was a conversation with a live man, who agreed and thereafter forever let it stand. And who certainly (several Pulitzers and every other literary award this country has to offer) eventually possessed the clout to \\"fix it\\" if he wanted to. Truth be told, this lie can be used to alter just about any book published in the last 200 years -- and so much easier after you die. For whatever reason they may like to.For decades, the community of American literary scholars has painstakingly put together a set of rules to govern the correction of texts, and the publication of manuscripts posthumously -- always to reflect the last and best intention of the author based on the evidence. For after death, this can be the only aim and only ethical endeavor.In America today, everything is now subject to fakery. Movies contain ads, even \\"news broadcasts\\" have product signs pasted in by computers. Such is our brave new world, even more tawdry than Huxley envisioned. This edition of a classic is a blatant attempt to prostitute our very cultural heritage. If they can do this to Penn Warren's masterpiece,they can do it to anybody. That is the book industry's message. That, plus a shameless attempt to pitch something \\"new\\" to go with the movie.It is especially ironic and doubly disgusting that this has been done to a book which has, as a major theme, vulger hucksterism and its dubious wages. The word left out of Ulysees, by the way, was \\"love.\\" The word invisibly yet indelibly seeped into this bogus imposture, on every page, is \\"garbage.\\"Just say no."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is Southern literature at its peak of perfection. I bought this for my BF a few years back when Sean Penn starred in the film remake of the original classic, as he usualy likes to read the books behind the film. Happily, I got much more than I bargained for. While I disagree about this being a \\"the best novel about American Politics\\", it is inarguably one of the best about Southern American life.There are many kinds of writers: poets, storytellers(novelists), playwrites, and investigative journalists (reporters). Great literary works need to involve a combination of these, I think. Literature is what happens when language is spoken through the eyes of the soul. Literature transcends mere writing. Literature hits a nerve and pulsates throughout your entire being. It's what makes you speechless after you put it down. Such is the power of ATKM.ATKM's force is driven by RPW's rich characterizations and narrative, seasoned by his deft prosaic hand. Clearly, the man knows how to tell a story. But this is more than that. It's an intimate look through a window in time and place that does what every great novel should do...pick you up and transport you, right into Willie Stark's crisp seersucker suits and spectator oxfords.That being said, nothing feels more like summer than good ole', southern-fried drama lit, and this book was no exception. RPW's . glorious poetic prose reels you in form the first page. Hell, you can just hear the damned kudzu growing, taste the whiskey, the sweet tea, collards, fried-green tomatoes, feel the scorching, molasses-thick humidity dripping rivulets down your back with every page.I'm not going to waste space feeding back to you the entire plot and storyline here. You already know that. Just add this one to your summer book list along with some Faulkner, Twain, O'Connor, Welty, Williams, et.al., and enjoy the ride with The Boss, Sugar Boy and Jack!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"As with many of the \\"classics\\" it seems like there are a bunch of editions of \\"All the King's Men\\" floating around. I recommend that you get the originally published Robert Penn Warren edition, in which the main character is \\"Willie Stark\\", and not this \\"Willie Talos\\" edition. In my opinion, the tale of Willie Stark is one of the best books in 20th century literature, from a pure story-craft standpoint, and not to be messed with.I'll admit I first came upon this book as part of the \\"summer reading list\\" for a school English class. There were some truly enjoyable books on that list as well as some that just seemed incomprehensible (\\"The Sound and the Fury\\", for example) and others where I had very little idea of what the author was getting at. \\"All the King's Men\\" was just a knock-your-socks-off novel. It has interesting characters, a (mostly) believable context, and enough suspense that you're not sure just what might happen next. The main characters in the book are Willie Stark, a powerful and corrupt state politician in the American pre-war South, and Jack Burden, a journalist from a wealthy background who essentially works for Willie. As the story begins, Willie hires Jack to find some dirt on a political rival that Willie wants out of the way. Jack's efforts to do so, and Willie's own hubris, eventually impact the lives of Jack and several people he loves, including the only consistent father figure he ever knew (an elderly judge) and Jack's teenage love. Jack tells the story of his own life intertwined with Willie's life, leading up to the climactic events where Willie finally falls from grace. In doing so, Jack shows how both he and Willie started out innocent but were gradually corrupted by the machinations of a system outside their control.Although Willie's tactics seem brutal, they may also be seen as a way of exerting control over a system that would otherwise crush him and other common people. An outwardly even less powerful person, Willie's secretary Sadie Burke, who is herself from a poor background and is scarred by pock marks, turns out to be the one who pulls the strings that both bring Willie to power and knock him back down. Sadie is one of the most interesting female characters in 20th-century literature (much more so than her foil, the quiet, retiring, beautiful Southern belle Anne Stanton, who is barely developed) and is as much of a politician as any of the men.This is a book that you can just enjoy reading from a pure standpoint of reading a political or historical novel, even if you don't want to get too deeply into analyzing it or understanding all the allusions and English-majory stuff. It's just a darn good book, period. I have seen the older movie adaptation but it is hard to do this book justice in the movie format since there's simply too much going on in it to fit comfortable into two hours."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book sat on my shelf for a couple months before I even opened it. Originally getting it because it was a bargain book on Amazon, I initially didn't think much of it. I attempted reading it twice and wasn't quite ready for it. It took an English professor in college who recommended I read it to get past the first twenty pages. What I first found to be boring pretty language transformed into something transcendent. After completing the novel I found that Robert Penn Warren was the only person in history to receive a Pulitzer in poetry and prose. \\"All the Kings Men\\" clearly illustrates Warren's poetic language and imagery. My first mistake with this book was to dismiss it as a \\"political\\" novel. While politics is involved and part of the story is set around southern politics, it in no way encompasses the novel. Instead this is novel about life. The story is both alien and deeply personal for the reader. The narrator walks you through his life and introduces you to the people around him. Willie Stark, while an impressive figure in American Literature is more like a supporting character throughout the novel. Instead it's a novel that focus' on the narrator's trials and tribulations. Everything from love, and loss, to past and present and how these things shape our lives. It is perhaps my favorite novel in American Literature. If at first you seem daunted, stop reading and come back to it. A novel that sticks with you, that is Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book covered so much ground and was so well written and so absorbing that I've put it at the very top of my Best Books list.It said so much about American - especially southern - style politics and so much about human frailties. Warren philosophized about life in a very satisfying way that left me feeling good about life's struggles. Best of all I was fascinated by the story of the two brothers who were slave owners before and after the Civil War. I think that part was always left out of plays and movies that were based on this book. Read it!

A thoughtful study (from a political viewpoint) of the question \\"Do the ends justify the means?\\" Really entertaining and a pleasure to read as well; one of those books that leave you amazed that the human race could produce such a gifted writer."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"All The Kings Men is written from the perspective of Jack Burden, a poetic, lost, troubled insider in the 1930s administration of southern-state Governor Willie Stark. In some ways, the book traces the trajectory of Willie from idealistic country boy to The Boss, but Jack is so present in his account of events and so in control of the narrative flow that it ends up being Jack's story well more than Willie's. And Jack's story is bleak. There are light moments, but they seem pale and washed out compared to the depth of the wounds that Jack, and ultimately all the central characters, carry.The book is beautifully written, slow, lush, and incredibly rich. The first few pages are among the best openings I've ever read. There are places where it's hard to see where the story is going (including a strange interlude set during the Civil War), but there isn't a lot that seems careless. Warren is a meticulous writer. Although it's hardly a political thriller or a romance, both of these elements peek through in the last half of the book, where the writing thins out a little and the story really takes hold.As a note of caution: Warren doesn't shy away from some pretty offensive depictions of both African Americans and women. It's an old boys club in the novel, and Jack's first person narrative is deep in the thick of it. My take is that this is less about who Warren is as a writer than it is about who Jack is as a deeply flawed protagonist, but some passages were hard for me to swallow even then.This is a book to read very slowly, undistracted, in small doses. One of those books that you can flip open to any page after you're done, and see a dozen layers and nuances you missed the first time through."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Whether you're Southern or non-Southern, this book brings together the personal and political, the observer and observed, the spectrum of a single point in time, like few other American novels.

This is one of the contenders for the Great American Novel."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Two pages into this exquisite work, the Southern torpor that I had experienced for a good deal of my life wafted off the page, and I knew I would take my sweet time with this reading. Strangely, though, it didn't feel like a leisurely read when I was done; so smoothly crafted is the language that it glides across the page and melts into one's senses like a pat of butter on a hot skillet.Beyond his quasi-impressionistic portrait of the Deep South, Robert Penn Warren does a stunning job with the theme of Redemption. Contrary to popular belief, the central figure here is not the well-meaning Governor who loses his way, but his hard-bitten, ex-newspaperman troubleshooter who is able to justify most any action he is asked to take.Warren presents us with a riveting cast of supporting characters who represent the continuum of moral choices that we, the Body Politic, must make every waking day: The stoic politician's wife, who looks the other way; the Attorney General, who eschews power when it comes with a price; the idealist who throws himself into his profession but commits a crime to honor his sister; his sibling, somewhat isolated in a rarified social setting, choosing to do &quot;good works&quot; but succumbing to temptation; the hard-boiled female pol, for whom &quot;Hell Hath No Fury&quot;; and, among others, the narrator himself, Jackie Burden, for whom Moral Relativism becomes High Art.This is a story not of people who rule, but of their loyal subjects, and how they drift from their original moorings and hit the shoals, with rationalizations 'a plenty. In the end, Warren may be telling us that while our elected officials are capable of being corrupted during their finite tenure in office, it is the citizenry in any democracy whose quieter, everyday choices richochet from one member of the community to another, oftentimes with unintended and far-reaching consequences - and with only so much time to repair the damage, if indeed that is possible.This is masterful storytelling that forces the reader to consider what unknown ripples he himself may have created in his life. It is, without question, a leading candidate for &quot;The Great American Novel&quot;."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Most of my life I have heard people talk about \\"the great American novel\\" and how they were either looking for it or were planning on writing it some day. If you are one of those people, you are wasting your time. The Great American Novel was written in 1946 and people will be reading this thing 500 years from now. Robert Penn Warren was essentially a poet, the first Poet Laureate of the United States, in fact. If you have not read any of his poems, you are in for a treat. His prose works are actually secondary in his great oeuvre, though many would have a hard time believing that after reading All the King's Men. Actually, the poetry is there, embedded in the crackling prose, almost mystically entwined in the magical descriptions and staccato dialogue. When Faulkner read this book, he was amazed and declared it one of the finest pieces of fiction he had ever encountered. It's easy to see why. If you have ever been deterred from dipping into literary fiction because you were afraid you would get bored, you needn't worry about this story. Once you get past the first chapter, the velocity of the plot development takes over and you ride the rapids to their swirling conclusion. There's no getting off this ride once you're strapped in. About half way through this tumult of American civilization, I consciously made myself slow down. I refused to read more than ten pages a day because I knew once I had finished this grand spectacle of artistry, I would probably never come across another American novel quite this well written. So far, and I'm 53 years old, this has proven to be true."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I'd seen &quot;All the King's Men&quot; described as one of the best American political novels, and after reading it, I don't see it as a political novel whatsoever. While it is based around the rise and fall of the fictitional Southern politician, Willie Talos, it is really just the story of the narrator, Jack Burden. Robert Penn Warren uses Burden to tell the story of Willie Talos and those around him but the novel ultimately ends up being just an insight into the relationships and emotions of Burden, which aren't too different than many that would be experienced by any modern-day American. At times, Burden's storytelling drifts far away from the topic that launched it, but Warren's writing is so pretty and the scenes described are so picturesque, that the drifting is enjoyable. While this also makes the book a slower read, it is more entertaining for being so. The novel is generally somber though, as life in the poor, early 20th Century, rural South could be, but the characters of the novel are very endearing. Their lives, intertwined with that of the man that has attracted them to him, rise with Talos' successes but are also doomed to crash with him and his all-or-nothing style. But while Talos is the protagonist, the most important parts of this book are those that focus on Jack Burden's life, especially the beautiful narrations he gives of his early-life memories."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"For those who are having a hard time with reading this very long book with the very long sentences, let me recommend the audiobook. Yeah, it's long, too-- 21 hours-- but I've been listening to it during my long commute and my evening walks, and it is absolutely riveting. In fact, it's so engrossing that I've started taking it to bed to listen to the way I used to sit up and read in bed. The long sentences are pure poetry, once you just relax and listen. The version I'm listening to (which I downloaded to my iPod from audible) is read by a very talented man who captures the inflections in the voices of all the characters. I only have about five more hours of it to go, and frankly, I hate to see it end."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Power and corruption go hand in hand in Warren's literary gem, set at the zenith of nineteen-thirty's Louisiana state politics. Mirroring the life of the infamous Huey Long, the novel's Willie Stark is ostensibly and outrageously a man of the people, shunning pretensions while appealing to the common man, capturing the attention of a mass audience, speaking in language they can relate to. While Stark cuts his political teeth on the betrayals of the wealthy and powerful, he quickly adapts to the tricks of the trade, a master manipulator and a quick study. Bred of poverty in a nation defined by the Great Depression, Stark is that rare genius who can take the public's pulse while seducing the powerbrokers, out-dealing their schemes with his own instinctive prowess.In a parallel story, Jack Burden shadows Stark's progress, doing the dirty work to maintain Stark's iron-fisted control of Louisiana government, the Governor with an eye to the state senate. An equally complex character, Jack hails from a well-connected family that hides its dysfunction behind the refinements of wealth, often the \\"Boss's\\" convenient pawn (Stark is never one to waste the talents of those in his employ). Burden comes of age under Stark's tutelage, eventually pushed beyond endurance by the duplicity of his position, especially when forced to confront a long-time family friend with the secrets of the past. Hurtling towards a confrontation of epic proportions, Willie Stark has a date with fate; his attitude subtly altered by recent events, Jack watches dispassionately, clinging to the threads of his tattered integrity, all but physically removed from the once-consuming relationship, a fitting end to a reign of excess and hubris, reality the great leveler.Filled with larger-than-life personalities, the novel exposes the coarse underbelly of state politics, the natural corruption of power and those whose lives are destroyed by the voracious appetite of Stark's ambition. Timeless, filled with the inherent contradictions of the democratic process, the author's scathing indictment of Louisiana politics is a harsh reminder that absolute power corrupts absolutely. Peppered with tragedy and excess, All the King's Men is as relevant today as in its heyday, a compelling contrast of two personalities, Burden stepping aside as the wily politician self-destructs, trapped in a web of his own making. To be sure, the politics of expedience warp the senses and the soul, idealism and compassion expensive conceits when the dust has settled: \\"Maybe that is the only way you can tell that a certain piece of knowledge is worth anything: it has to coast some blood.\\" Luan Gaines/2006."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"There's not much left to say about a Pulitzer prize winning novel that's already stood the test of time. (the book was written in 1946)A few points:1. The quintessential American novel about corruption, power, religion, money, lust, love, and madness. Like all great literature, Warren's book works on several levels. Don't put off reading this book because you think it's just about a corrupt Southern politician who falls from grace. It's all that and a lot more.2. One last point: it's a sad state of affairs that most of the reviews for classics are written by students required to read them for literature class. It's too bad that more people don't return to great literature after having children, serving in the military, traveling around the world, dealing with death, personal tragedy,and after the illusions of youth are gone. Great literature is written for mankind.An absolute masterpiece."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"\\"All The King's Men\\" is one of those great, weighty tomes of American literature that I had avoided reading for many years, simply because I didn't see the appeal of a 400+ page novel. But I finally got around to picking this up a month ago, and I have to say it is a fantastic example of the great American Novel.Based on the life and career of Huey Long (governor of Louisiana and major rival to FDR for the presidency before his death), the tale of Willie Stark is one of a good man corrupted by the very political machine that he needed to enact his reforms. We first meet Willie in the full swing of his corruption, but vingettes to the past reveal how innocent and truthful he was back in the beginning. The story is told through the eyes of Jack Burden, Stark's righthand man who does what he's told no matter what. He has a mind of his own, but he sees Stark as a man who can affect positive change. But Stark's own corrupted nature renders that impossible, and everything he touches (including Burden and his family) turns to dust.Robert Penn Warren's book does have some faults: some might want more of Stark's story than is provided, and the Cass Mastern detour is interesting only in retrospect (at the time you're reading it, I challenge you not to count how many pages are left before the chapter is over).There are no real heroes in the piece, simply men and women caught up in the fury of Willie Stark and his desire for glory, and everyone comes to an unfortunate end through contact with him. Jack emerges as complicated and unsure of his own function within the Stark machinery, and Adam Stanton's descent towards his final actions (echoing the real-life assassination of Long by Carl Weiss) is rendered brilliantly. Perhaps the most moving chapter is when Jack relieves his first falling in love with Anne Stanton, in the wake of revelations which force him to reevaluate that summer.Warren doesn't adhere strictly to the Long story: he starts the \\"present day\\" portion of the book in 1936, well after Huey Long's death in September 1935. And Stark does not meet his end until the end of 1937, while still Governor (Huey Long had gone to the Senate in 1932 but still controlled Louisiana through his goons). Was Long simply the wellspring upon which Warren fashioned his extraordinary tale, or was there more of him in Willie Stark than Warren might have wanted? It's really up to the reader to decide.All in all, \\"All The King's Men\\" takes the story of a man who means good but loses his way and turns it into one of the Great American Novels of the first half of the twentieth century. Willie Stark's rise and fall make for a moving, illuminating tale, but his reign affects all those around him. And it is his presence that causes the events of the novel, and the actions of Jack Burden and those he loves. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and nowhere is that more evident than in \\"All The King's Men\\"."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The end justifies the means. Make the good out of the bad. That ostensibly sums up the intriguing philosophy of Willie Stark, the Huey Long-modeled demagogue protagonist. All the King's Men follows the political career of country boy Willie Stark - from a small fry County Treasurer known as \\"Cousin Willy\\" all the way to Louisiana Governor referred to simply as \\"The Boss\\". The reader follows Willie undergo a transformation from a young, naive, idealist politician who despises corruption into a hardened, cynical machine politician who will use any means necessary to aid his poor and disenfranchised constituents - all the while helping himself as well as the cronies of his machine.But this is not entirely about Willie Stark. It is beautifully written in 1st person narrative as told by Stark's right hand man, Jack Burden, a man facing many struggles of his own. Throughout the book, Jack's inward struggle with morality parallels Willie's outward struggle with his actions and their moral repercussions. Both Jack and Willie believe the paradoxical philosophy that \\"you had to make the good out of the bad because there wasn't anything else to make it out of.\\" At the end they both undergo an epiphany of sorts as Jack starts a clean new life and rids himself of all the residue of his corruption while Willie states on his deathbed, \\"It might have been different, Jack. You got to believe that.\\"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1946, All the King's Men is a masterpiece and is unequivocally the best politcal novel ever written.

Or psychology. Or literature. No, there isn't a single President, governor, or elected dogcatcher before or after All The King's Men to whom this story is not relevant. Nor is there a single preacher, lawyer, farmer, or skidrow bum to whom it lacks relevance. Jack Burden and Willie Stark are Everyman in two persons. The most careless reader of this novel will understand that. The relevance to President Clinton is the same as it is to Richard Nixon, Richard Burton, Ronald Reagan, and Ronald McDonald.Now that these folks have read All the King's Men, I would suggest trying All the President's Men. That one is about politics, and the comparison would be useful."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"And maybe that's good.This American classic and Pulitzer winner is wonderful and absolutely worth reading if you like your books to have depth and girth and that they be truly literary instead of merely entertaining for the plane ride, the beach, et al. Nothing wrong with that, if you do. But be warned: it is, even, I dare say, for its time, way overwritten and the writer's writing, the literary pyrotechnics, stands out in front of the story, often burying it in its spent ordinance and soot.Yes, Warren's a literal poet, and there are jaw-dropping turns of phrase on nearly every page. The reason I give a 4 and not a 5 is because it is turgid, overwritten, overwrought and purple as hell. There's too much time spent in Jack's head reflecting, thinking and philosophizing for my taste. But these are gorgeous flaws and, in the end, I found the writing too good to worry about the fact that there's too much of it. Also, the novel-within-the-novel regarding Cass Mastern was not needed and really dragged the already slagging story to a halt. The book did not need that background, per se, but it is what it is. It ain't a breathless thriller. It's hundreds of thousands of words of shimmering prose. Tap in and drink it with relish. They just don't make them like this anymore. Why? Because no house would publish it because they know nobody will read it in the numbers necessary to make it remotely profitable. Books are products; books must show sales growth potential or they get snuffed out. Sixty years ago, before the world 'o screens we live in now, this book was fodder for actual conversations at the proverbial water cooler.

Politicsis simply the backdrop here.The real story is good/evil, redemption, love,betrayal, fatherhood, corruption, idealism goneawry, and a dozen other themes.Watch carefully whenever the words \\"white\\" or\\"black\\" are mentioned. What is their significance?Is Warren telling us that good and evil exist sideby side? Within the same being? Are inseparable?See for yourself.One sad note however: the use of the N-word."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"ALL THE KING'S MEN has a rich mix of carefully balanced characters who help Jack Burden, the narrator, explore the paths he, his childhood friends, his colleagues, and his parents take through life. At this level, ATKM is a carefully wrought story, more about the tyranny of the past than the bare knuckled compromises of politics, with the character Sadie Burke contrasting with Anne Stanton, Willie Stark contrasting with Adam Stanton and Tiny Duffy, Jack Burden contrasting with Sugar Boy, and so on. But while all of these characters are fully realized, they are also somewhat predictable. It is for this reason that ATKM seems like a melodrama; once you get the characters, their stories fail to surprise.Nonetheless, this novel is well worth reading, primarily because of Robert Penn Warren's fabulous style. I'm no expert. But most authors I read seem to use metaphors and similes to create a quick burst of insight or beauty. Yes, Updike, Chabon, McEwan and maybe a few others create occasional passages of descriptive writing with multiple elements that fit together in amazing extended metaphors. But Warren does this repeatedly, taking an idea and exploring it for 100 words or more. This, in my opinion, explains why ATKM has lasted: much of the novel is very fine poetic prose. Here's one example:\\"In the morning it had stopped raining and there was the sun. I went out and saw the thin pools of water standing on the black ground, like sheets of isinglass. Around the japonicas, the white and red and coral petals, which had been shattered from the blossoms, floated on the blackly gleaming pools. Some of them floated with the curled edges upward, like boats, and around them other petals floated upside down or had shipped water, making a gay carnage as though a battleship had fired a couple of salvos into a fleet of carnival barges and gondolas in some giddy, happy, far-off land.\\"Warren's poetic style helps explain why ATKM is both a long book but a fast read."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"After seeing the movie I wanted to finally read the book; I wasn't disappointed. Although some of the language does not translate well to today, I really enjoyed the story and the way Warren uses real life events to craft his story. The book is always better than the movie!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I have read this book several times, and I thouroughly enjoyed being able to experience it in a different way. Being able to listen to it gave me a better appreciation for Robert Penn Warren's use of language."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"\\"All the King's Men\\" is the story of Willie Talos, a backwater boy who teaches himself lawyering at night and ends up in politics as the Governor. Then as Willie finds out that politics isn't about doing the right thing, he quickly learns how to maneuver in the real world of politics. Before long, this formerly God-fearing, trusting man is drinking, carrying on with women, blackmailing, and surrounding himself with all the trappings of a king. Ambition overtook his good intentions.The rise and fall of Willie is told through the eyes of Jack Burden, the non-committal reporter who Willie hires as one of his \\"men\\". Jack's responsibilities are usually working as a researcher looking for dirt on political opponents or simply listening quietly. Eventually Jack's boyhood world and the world of politics collide, and almost against his will he must give up his role as observer and become a man of action and take responsibility for his life.Robert Penn Warren wrote a a stupendous novel (1946) that is considered the definitive book about politics. But \\"All the King's Men\\" is so much more than a political novel. The insights into human nature, the beautiful language that brings the South alive to where you can taste the saltwater and feel the warm ocean breeze against your cheek, the lively descriptions of the characters, and the ability to create dialogue that moves and makes you laugh is the writing of a true genius. \\"All the King's Men\\" is a delightful page-turner about men and women trying to find their way in life. And is full of surprises that catch you off guard until the end."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I almost feel it unnecessary to write this review, given the positive responses I see in the review section. But let me simply add my thoughts on this highly acclaimed, and deservedly so, novel. It certainly belongs on any list of great 20th century American novels. From the beautifully constructed plot to the poetic prose, the book is triumph. It tells the story of Willie Stark (Talos in the Warren original and based on the Louisiana governor, Huey Long) -- his political rise and fall, the corruption that is endemic in politics and in man, and the clash of the man of action (Stark) versus the man of the idea, represented in this book by the narrator, Jack Burden. His journey from cynic to admirer to mature observer of Stark's method and madness is in itself fascinating. But even the throw away stuff in this book is great, such as Burden's descriptions of the old men sitting on a park bench, observing the world, almost outside time, or the droll descriptions of the locals who clamor for Willie, and even the interview with the man that Burden believes might be his father, and the crisis of faith he encounters as he explores the history of a Judge he admires and knows better than even he realizes. An American classic."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The first Poet Laureate of the United States, Robert Penn Warren created his life-long masterpiece with \\"All The King's Men\\" (1946). Drawing upon his first-hand experience in Europe as Germany and Italy invaded their neighbors and Spain fought a bloody civil war, the author makes his best attempt to showcase the ill effects of demagoguery and the fine line Americans tread between freedom and totalitarianism.Set in the 1930s, \\"All The King's Men\\" follows the exploits of Willie Stark - a master politician and an expert in class warfare and corruption, who transforms from an idealistic man of the people into a creature driven by an insatiable lust for power. Readers would do well to learn more about the life story of Huey \\"Kingfish\\" Long of Louisiana. In the depths of the depression, he managed to become Governor and Senator of Louisiana (at the same time!!!), and he built a private army that rivaled the state militia and the national guard. Effectively, he became dictator of Louisiana before his assassination cut short his ambitions. With his eye on the White House, Long posed a true threat to FDR and the American republic, and his life serves as much of the basis for Warren's novel.\\"All The King's Men\\" is viewed through the eyes of Jack Burden, one of Stark's aides - a man still possessed of idealism, but paralyzed from action. From an insider's point-of-view, the reader witnesses the rise and fall of Louisiana's \\"man of the people\\".It has been said that \\"imitation is the sincerest form of flattery\\". If so, \\"All The King's Men\\" should be red in the face. The book's themes and ideas have been mimicked numerous times, most recently in 1996's best-selling novel \\"Primary Colors\\", a roman a clef with Jack Stanton (Bill Clinton) in place of Willie Stark (Huey Long). One of the finest novels of the last century, lovers of literature can't afford to miss \\"All The King's Men\\".Britt Gillette"},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I can not recommend this book more highly.

Why'd you fool even bother reading the Cliff notes, which are written in boring scholarly tones? Warren was a true poet, and each and every word of this book was carefully selected to convey Penn's message of corruption and fate. By taking the reader through a story through the eyes of Jack Burden, Penn documents the changes of Jack's philosophy of events. An extremely rich book, gripping, and for you ignorant girls, the plot resembles TV soaps that you're probably spending too much time watching. If you want soap-opera twists, ATKM has them also.

A long time ago I read RPW's &quot;Band of Angels&quot; which I liked but forgot the writer until I saw this book right beside it. I was so amazaed at this story and the very rounded characters. I really liked Jack Burden and as the story went on and incidents came to light I was just surprised. Usually I can figure things out before they happen but this book was one thing after another. A few weeks ago I was longing for a good book to read maybe about the south and an old book and presto this book jumped off the shelf to me. (Well, not literally). You can taste this book, the words just want to roll around in your mouth like good food, and you can feel the weather, and feel the sea against your skin, you can see the cotton fields, you feel the gritty red dirt. This book is like a Thanksgiving dinner and I will have to say it's one of the best books I have ever read and I have read about 1,000 or more in my life I'm sure. I like the part when Willie realizes he's a sap and gets up to address the crowd as hicks and rednecks. Then there's that part about how all a man needs is something, something and Coca-Cola. Yeah, I thought Coca-Cola is real big down south and it was good back then before they messed with the formula.

I ate through it during a couple of weekends of lazing about the patio on sunny afternoons. To someone with a certain interest but not fascination with American politics, this was still an incredible piece of writing. It deserves to be considered one of the quintessential Great American Novels. It was also surprisingly timeless. Written by the Pulitzer Prize-Winner, Warren in 1946, with the exception of occasional allusions to current events, this novel was as relevant and readable today as it must have been over fifty years ago. The novel traces the rise and fall of a fictional governor of Louisiana whose profile, most recognize, is that of the infamous Huey Long. I came away from it with two impressions: Robert Penn Warren's prose is absolutely beautiful (he was the country's first Poet Laureate and I see clearly why), and two, I have never spoken to anyone or read anything that would encourage me to travel to Louisiana, and this book drove the last nail in that coffin."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Alex KippermanReviewAll The King's Men, by Robert Penn Warren, is not only the story of a man's becoming of a politician, but is also a book that delves into analysis of human nature. Within it are several fascinating characters, but the two main ones are Jack Burden, a very well educated fellow and narrates with wonderful insight in the events that occur and Willie Stark, the man in which the story line is centered upon who is a raving politician, who's methods are be not that highly thought of by the other's in his field, but is loved by the people.What I found to be most noteworthy was the author's mastery over the language and skill of writing. Often he would go into detail of the minutest event and then make in-depth analogies. The detail was overdone though, as one might find a Dickenson novel to be, because it is always surprisingly thoughtful and insightful. The descriptions are often of small events and moments in life with striking precision For instance, There is a part where Lucy, Willie's wife, is sitting with a number of other men eating and first Warren describes her as she is \\"watching the jaws work\\" and hen he likens her face to that of \\"the chief engineer... when he goes down to the engine room at night and the big steel throws are leaping\\" and it's these parallels which make his writing most enjoyable.The ending is somewhat happy, though unfortunately it is filled with tragedy; the lives of all the characters intersect in some form and not always pleasant ways. But they and the different time periods covered in the story blend gracefully to form a book which is \\"brilliantly done\\" as the New York Times would put it."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"It is in fact a book that insightfully probes relationships -- friendships, romances and yes, those of a political nature.

This is better."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Penn Warren's All the Kings Men is an extremely involved read. The book focuses not so much on American politics and the myth of the demagogue politician but rather on one man's journey into himself into finding his place in the world. The book also provides the basis for one man's understanding of the meaning of responsibility for his actions.That said, a lot of the critical focus of this novel has been placed on the character of Willie (Stark) Talos the fictional governor who starts out as a simple man of the people and evolves into a Machiavellian powerhouse who demands that the ends justify the means for all his actions. The book has been called the ultimate political novel or even a novel about the rise and fall of an American dictator. This rather general review barely scratches the surface of Penn Warrens attention.In its most basic aspect, this is a novel which deals literally with one of the King's men. In this case that man is Jack Burden. Jack, for the most part, is an observer of the world around him. This is his most basic take on life. He observes and basically floats through his existence as a sort of thinking yes man for his political leader. He will do anything that his boss tells him and he will feel very little, if any responsibility for his actions. This view of life gradually changes through his interaction with Willie (Stark) Talos and the immediate circle of people around the governor. Jack through this novel grows into a responsible person.I called the novel flawed in the title to this review for a few reasons. The first is the narrative style. Jack is a first person narrator and an observer of life. As such everything (and I mean everything) gets described. This has a great tendency to slow the novel almost to a crawl at some points. The flip side of this, however, is that Penn Warren creates prose that almost has the feel of a painting in its description. The novelist forces his reader to view the entire world through the narrators eyes. There is very little direct narration and ore than a little of Warren's personal philosophy involved in reading this.The second point that has been called a flaw is the placement of the Cass Mastern episode. This however is a centralpart of the novel. It is also the portion of the novel that William Faulker thought to be the best writing of the book. The episode runs nearly fifty pages and contributes nothing to the existing narrative structure. First looks however can be deceiving. This section of the novel provides a model for Burden's eventual change into a more responsible person.On the whole this was probably one of the most difficult books that I've read in quite a while. At times one wants to scream in frustration but with some patience the careful reader is left with a feeling of great accomplishment and the feeling of having read something truly great and uniquely American."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This Pulitzer Prize winning novel is a thinly veiled, fictionalized account of the life of the former populist Governor of Louisiana, Huey Long, written by an aide, Jack Burden. Burden is something of an idealist who has somehow become attached to the political machine of southern Governor Willie Stark, known throughout the story as simply \\"The Boss\\". Also playing a prominent part is Burden's relationship to Adam and Anne Stanton, two childhood friends who were the children of a former Governor.The narrator of the story, Burden, seems to wander aimlessly through the events of the book, often as not doing much of the Governor's dirtiest work, while seldom seeming to question the morality or legality of his actions. There is much talk of good, bad and evil between repeated scenes of political graft, bribery and corruption.Much of the book is fascinating in its portrayal of raw political power and manipulation. However, far too frequently the author diverts to almost stream of consciousness prose with little or no advancement of the underlying story line. One hundred pages of such florid drivel could have easily been excised from the novel, resulting in a far more captivating tale. As it was, I'd immensely enjoy fifty pages of narrative only to be faced with ten pages of garbage that could literally be skimmed over.So, how to rate such a book? I give the approximately 80% of the book that contained actual narrative, five stars. The remaining 20%, which consisted primarily of meaningless babble, earns one star. That comes to 4.2 stars. Read the book, skim the garbage."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Warren's All the King's Men is deeply political in story, yet it also very insightful in its point of view, examining one man's role and perspective towards the monumental rise and fall of a political figure. As much as the plot is devoted to Willie Stark, it is more so linked to narrator Jack Burden, his ideologies about the world of politics, campaigning and playing hard ball and dirty politics, being Willie's right hand man, and his coming to terms with the tragic consequences that unfold later. Jack Burden lives essentially in two different worlds, the rural Burden's Landing, which is reminiscent of Jack's past, his family and close friends and past hopes, and the world of Willie Stark, where Jack, even as a dutiful employee, expresses his jadedness and cynicism towards \\"the Boss\\" and his methods.Warren is the king of lyrical prose; he has a way of taking long avenues and digressions to get to the point. This can be literally in the form of verbose sentences that cover half a page, or in the form of single reflections that go on for forty or fifty pages. When this meandering is for effect and purpose, it's pure genius. When it involves the trivial or unnecessary, it's quite cumbersome. At moments, this novel feels overwritten. There were points that I had to set this novel aside for awhile and pick it back up just because of the daunting nature of the chapters, but then I would read a passage that was a stroke of pure genius, where Warren had such an insightful revelation into Jack's views or life in general, and I was reminded why I wanted to read it through until the end. For instance, many readers thought the back story of Cass Mastern was unnecessary, but I thought it was a nice touch, an essential linking point between Jack's story and his uncle's story, as they parallel each other.The dirty politics aspects and its ultimate theme of corruption with unsympathetic characters made All the King's Men difficult to fully enjoy, even though the novel ultimately arrives at a moral and point.I'm glad I persevered though, and I won't knock the book's classic status as a political masterpiece, as others seemed to fully enjoy the book. The novel helped me discover Warren as a writer, and I look forward to reading some of his poems in the future."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is the kind of fiction I like--fiction with a strong moral and message, fiction bent towards standing against power. It's obviously a very famous book so I don't need to sell it too much here. It is the fictional account of a Huey Long-type demagogue in the 1930s, told from the perspective of one of his fixers-a sort of disenchanted but entangled observer not unlike those of Budd Schulberg's novels or The Great Gatsby. If you enjoy this book and want to explore a real-life embodiment of it (other than the Ken Burns' documentary on Huey Long) then I would definitely recommend The Power Broker by Robert Caro. It is incredibly long, but as one of the first books someone gave me when I moved to Hollywood, it holds a special sway over me. Like Huey Long and Willie Stark, Robert Moses was a man who got power, loved power and was transformed by power. We can learn from him-mostly what not to be and who not to become."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Robert Penn Warren, America's first Poet Laureate, won a Pulitzer Prize for this 600- page novel, considered by many as one of the greatest works by any American author. Set in the 1930's, it traces the rise and fall of a dictatorial demagogue loosely based on Huey \\"Kingfish\\" Long, governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1931. Long was loved by his supporters and hated by his detractors and ultimately assassinated in 1935 after he announced his run for the Democratic nomination for presidency against FDR. Warren was a professor at LSU during Long's rise in politics.What I actually read was the 2001 version taken from Warren's original manuscript, held at Yale University. Noel Polk, a professor of literature from the University of Southern Mississippi, \\"restored\\" the author's unedited version. There is debate among literary experts regarding Polk's version. And Warren agreed, in fact, participated in the editorial changes back then--he never indicated dissatisfaction with the 1946 publication. The true work, perhaps, is the published version, approved by Warren, vs. the Polk version. Polk claimed that the editorial decisions of 1945-1946 tampered with authenticity and bastardized Warren's first creative words. Well, I'll just leave that argument to the pundits. The restored \\"Willie Talos\\" version is what I found at the library, so it's what I read. And it was fantastic, as I'm sure the 1946 \\"Willie Stark\\" version is, since it's the one that has been critically acclaimed for over fifty years.I won't retell the story. It's long, complex, filled with multiple themes--and while Willie may seem to be the protagonist, the book is ultimately about Jack Burden, gopher for Governor Willie Talos. Just who is the protagonist is perhaps an interesting question for literary students (or old guys who like books). Does Willie or Jack drive the action? Regardless, one must conclude that Jack is the voice of Robert Penn Warren; and it's Jack's voice that is predominant. Jack is intelligent, from a southern genteel upbringing, but he seems to go through the motions, living in the Boss's world of dirty politics and increasing corruption. He just takes orders, appears to lack personal ambition, and is an observer of his world. Jack's got a sardonic wit. He's a realist but inside, he seems to question his own human nature. He's not a particularly happy person.This book is filled with fascinating well-defined characters, richly described--even the minor ones. While it was difficult to be sympathetic with any of them, I could identify with pieces of them, became familiar with them and wanted to learn more about them. A couple times, it struck me that Warren went a bit over-the-top with detail, like his description of Anne Stanton's laugh; it was so ornate, I concluded that only Pulitzer Prize winners must think like that! I particularly like the Cass Mastern episode. Jack did extensive historical research digging into the motives of this Civil War relative. Just why did Cass try so hard to find Phebe, the sold slave? Jack never finds out and in frustration, dropped his PHD work. Penn's writing style, his descriptions, his word choices and sentences, his steady use of creative similes grabbed me. Examples:Jack: \\"She kept on looking at me, not saying anything, with that look which always said, \`You've got something I want, something I need, something, I've got to have,' and said too, \`I've got something for you, I won't tell you what, not yet, but I've got something for you, too.' The hollow in the cheeks: the hungry business. The glittering eyes: the promising business. And both at the same time. It was quite a trick.\\" (Italics mine)Jack in an argument: \\"and the absorbent silence sucked up words like blotting paper.\\"Willie: \\"Folks, there's going to be a leetle mite of trouble back in town. Between me and the Legislature-full of hyena-headed, feist-faced, belly-dragging sons of slack-gutted she-wolves.\\" (It's the voice of a creative cracker. While I'd love to be able say such a thing to somebody sometime, it wouldn't be me).\\"...like the ocean chewing its gums.\\"Jack, cynicism on taking the state bar exam: \\"But maybe it had taken too long. If something takes too long, something happens to you. You become all and the only thing you want and nothing else, for you have paid too much for it, too much in wanting and too much in waiting and too much in getting. In the end, they just ask those crappy little questions.\\"Jack, frustrated with Willie's early speeches on the tax program: \\"Yeah... I heard the speech. But they don't give a damn about that... so it's up to you to give \`em something to stir \`em up and make \`em feel alive again... Tell \`em anything. But for Sweet Jesus' sake don't try to improve their minds.\\"I can partly relate to Jack's sensibilities: \\"At the hotel I ate a sandwich and went up to my room, and got the fan turned on and a pitcher of ice water sent up and took off my shoes and shirt and propped myself in a chair with a good book. There is nothing like a good book to put you to sleep with the illusion that life is rich and meaningful.\\" (But to me, good books do make life rich and meaningful.)Jack: \\"There is a kind of snobbery of failure. It's a club, it's old school... and there is no nasty supercilious twist to a mouth like the twist a drunk gets when he hangs over the bar beside an old pal who has turned out to be a big-shot and who hasn't changed a bit...\\"Jack: \\"\`It's a nice night,'I said in, I confess, the voice one reserves for small children, old ladies with ear-trumpets, and idiots.\\"Jack, with the goods on his old mentor Judge Irwin: \\"So I had it after all the months. For nothing is lost, nothing is ever lost. There is always the clue, the cancelled check, the smear of lipstick, the footprint in the canna bed, the condom on the park path, the twitch in the old wound, the baby shoes dipped in bronze, the taint in the blood stream. And all times are one time, and all those dead in the past never lived before our definition gives them life, and out of the shadow their eyes implore us. That is what all of us historical researchers believe. And we love the truth.\\"I loved the philosophical meanderings built into Warren's developing story:Jack Burden: \\"The end of man is knowledge, but there is one thing he can't know. He can't know whether knowledge will save him or kill him. He will be killed, all right, but he can't know whether he is killed because of the knowledge he has got or because of the knowledge he hasn't got and which if he had, would save him.\\"An example of Willie's belief that everyone is bad and the moral man makes goodness out of badness: \\"... the trouble with Governors is they think they got to keep their dignity. But listen here, there ain't anything worth doing a man can do and keep his dignity.\\"Jack: \\"One feels incredulity at opening the breaking of a habit, but horror at the violation of a principle. Therefore what virtue and honor I had known in the past had been an accident of habit and not the fruit of will. Or can virtue be the fruit of human will? The thought is pride.\\"Jack: \\"...is any relationship a relationship in time and only in time? I eat a persimmon and the teeth of a tinker in Tibet are put on edge.\\" (Or I buy a shirt at Dillard's department store and somebody in China gets to eat, but not very much).Jack, at Willie's request (or order), asking Adam to be director of the new hospital: \\" But I let my voice trail off, watching him shake his head again and smile now with a smile which did not forgive me but humbly asked me to forgive him for not being like me, for not being like everybody else, for not being like the world.\\" And more with Adam in the same conversation: \\"Listen pal, there was a man named Dante, who said that the truly proud man who knew his own worth did never commit the sin of envy, for he could believe that there was no one for him to envy. He might just as well have said that the proud man who knew his own worth would not be susceptible to flattery, for he would believe that there was nothing anybody else could tell him about his own worth he didn't already know. No, you couldn't be flattered.\\"On Jack's melancholy trip to the West coast, and back: \\"...you can go back in great spirits, for you will have learned two very great truths. First, that you cannot lose what you have never had. Second, that you are never guilty of a crime for which you did not commit. So there is innocence and a new start in the West, after all. If you believe the dream you dream when you go there.\\"Or... just great writing:An angry Sadie Burke: \\"...with her black chopped-off hair wild and her face like a riddled plaster-of-paris mask of Medusa except for the hot bituminous eyes, which were in full blaze with a bellows pumping the flame.\\" (Italics mine)Jack, at the place where he got the proof about Judge Irwin taking a bribe, describing a scene that made me feel like I was there: \\"There was Miss Lily Mae Littlepaugh, whom, after five weeks, I tracked down to a dark, foul, fox-smelling lair in a rooming house on the edge of the slums in Memphis. She was a gaunt old woman, wearing black spotted and stained with old food, almost past the pretense of gentility, blinking slowly at me from weak red eyes set in the age-crusted face, sitting there in the near dark room, exuding her old-fox smell, which mixed with the smell of oriental incense and candle wax... And in that room. Before it, on the table, a candle burned fatly as though fed not merely from the wax but from the substance of the greasy air.\\" (Italics mine)And finally, near the end, this:\\"The creation of man whom God in his foreknowledge knew doomed to sin was the awful index of God's omnipotence. For it would have been a thing of trifling and contemptible ease for Perfection to create more perfection. To do so would, to speak truth, be not creation but extension. Separateness is identity and the only way for God to create, truly create, man was to make him separate from God himself, and to be separate from God was to be sinful. The creation of evil is therefore the index of God's glory and his power. That had to be so that the creation of good might be the index of man's glory and power. But by God's help. By his help and in His wisdom.\\" (Hmmm... I'll have to think about that).A good book, to me, has to have interesting believable characters, a setting (or settings) that can been pictured, writing so vivid that it makes me want to write down the words, steal them for future use. I want it to make me think, and it must be a well-plotted, plausible story where things happen and lives change. Reading All the King's Men was a wonderful excursion. I'll probably read the \\"Willie Stark\\" version some day."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I have wanted to read, and had actually attempted to read, Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men a number of times. With the US political season in high gear I decided it might be an excellent time to finally take on the colossal, larger-than-life character of Willie Stark (Louisiana powerhouse politician Huey Kingfish Long). The book that was delivered by this vendor was in excellent shape and in perfect quality. I certainly enjoyed reading Warren's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, and found it full of a multitude of \\"teachable moments\\" about Louisiana politics from the past and insights into political high jinks and maneuvering that still ring true to this day. I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I consider All the King's Men, for which Robert Penn Warren won the Pulitzer Prize, one of the greatest of American novels, up there with Moby Dick (though far, far different). My comments are on the story itself, and not on this particular edition, which other reviewers have criticized. I would say, though, that if you can, read not this \\"corrected\\" edition put together by somebody else, but the original 1946 edition which was, after all, the one the author had published and the one that won the Pulitzer Prize.Some critics call Willie Stark, who rises from poverty to become the all-powerful state governor in this novel, the hero. But if the hero is the person whose actions move events forward, then this novel has two heroes: Willie Stark and Jack Burden. And their lives are inextricably bound. The actions of Jack Burden, as much as the actions of Willie Stark, move events forward. Burden is more of an observer than a participant: to observe and analyze and comment and not act -- that is what he wants. But, in investigating the past at Stark's bequest, trying to find \\"dirt\\" on Judge Irwin, Jack sets in motion a tragic series of events that lead to more than one loss, more than one death. What Burden learns is that there is no such thing as standing aloof from life's events, and that even seemingly \\"not doing anything\\" is doing something -- and repercussions follow. Highly, Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"All the King's Men was first published in 1946 to immense critical acclaim. The Washington Post made a comment about the novel and how if the idea of naming the Great American Novel is still being tossed around in 50 years (or, now), All the King's Men would certainly be a finalist. The novel won the highest literary prize in America, the Pulitzer Prize.The novel is set in the 1930's and follows the political career of Willie Stark, a provincial man with ambition tempered by honesty and integrity. He begins with integrity, but we see how the power he gains corrupts the man he used to be. His fictional career mirrors (in some ways) the real life career of \\"Kingfish\\" Huey Long (Louisiana). The story is told through the eyes of Jack Burden, a reporter who eventually ends up working for Willie Stark. Burden tells his own story at the same time as he is revealing the life of Willie Stark. The reader only gets to see what Burden shows us. The novel is told with a first person narrative.As would be expected with a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, the writing is quite exceptional. It was a little bit slow going at first, but about halfway through, i had a thought: \\"Damn, this is a good book.\\""},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"My choice for Greatest American Novel of the 20th Century is this Robert Penn Warren classic. Unfortunately for Warren (and us), this novel got off to a rotten start. The New York Times hailed it as \`The definitive novel about American politics,' and doomed it to be shelved with other drab tomes in that otherwise unimpressive genre. The Times, sad to say, widely missed the point on All the King's Men.Jack Burden is the point. Jack Burden, the politician's hack, makes this book. His is an evolution from disaffection to purpose, from carelessness to thoughtfulness. Willie Stark-the politician-is merely the means to Warren's greater goals. Warren originally set out to show, through Stark, the Dionysian allure of power and the grand effect it has on those who attain it. And he did; Stark himself is a great literary character.But Warren fooled himself: he created a character much greater than Stark, even though he planned Burden only to be a sort of an omniscient narrator of little value to the novel except as the storyteller of Stark's rise.In the end, Burden says (paraphrase), \\"This has been the story of Willie Stark. But it has been my story too.\\" And thankfully, it was. The novel is brilliant, Warren is brilliant, and political books are still boring-but this is not one of them!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"ALL THE KING'S MEN is about the corrosive and corrupting forces of politics. When good people get involved in politics they generally become bad people. Its the story of a country chicken-kicker named Willie Stark who gets into politics to do good then becomes the king of the corrupt after he's elected governor.My problems with this book are the backstories and the 'and then a miracle happened' moments. There is too much backstory, and much of it is irrelevant; Stark's election to the governor spot is a miracle that fell out of the sky; Stark was a chump and then he was governor. Getting from chump to governor woulda been interesting reading.At the beginning the book is absorbing, later it becomes tedious, and towards the end I kept asking myself, ARE WE THERE YET? ARE WE THERE YET? ARE WE THERE YET?"},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Has a better American political novel been written?

But you may be surprised to learn that Willie Stark is not the main character of this potboiler of a southern novel. That honor goes to Jack Burden, the book's first person narrator. Jack, a journalist by profession, becomes Willie's friend and righthand man despite their markedly different backgrounds. Willie is a self-described hick, while Jack was born of wealth and breeding.All the King's Men is about Jack and the complex relationship he has, not just with Willie, but with his parents, his friends, his childhood sweetheart as well as other political operatives. There is also a fair amount of text devoted to one of Jack's great uncles, a deeply troubled man who died fighting for the Confederacy decades before Jack was ever born.Artfully written using a very detailed and evocative brand of descriptive prose, this engaging novel succeeds in conveying a number of interesting messages. Prominent among these messages is the idea that mankind is corrupt by nature. But this, says Warren, is not necessarily cause for despair since in the fullness of time evil can give rise to good.All the King's Men is a wonderfully substantial and satisfying work of American fiction arising from the literary tradition of the South. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Of course, there is little I can add in praise of the book. It is one of the most outstanding examples of use of language, development of character and of setting that I have ever encountered. But I would like to call the reader's attention to the latest audio version (unabridged) read by Michael Emerson for Recorded Books. This is beautifully read, and in some ways enhances the experience of reading the book, because the exquisite language is sometimes even more enthralling to listen to than it is to read. I noticed a negative review of what I assume is an earlier audio version, and I wanted to share my very positive experience with this newer one.Any format you choose, this is a book not to be missed."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This well-written, Pulitzer prize winning American classic was enjoyable from cover to cover. The poet inside of Robert Warren Penn came through in this novel- with many poetical musings about the mundane and ordinary things in life. Several of these musings were so mixed with southern culture, that I could not understand them. But more often than not, they put a smile on my face. I don't know, there is just something about southern culture that is just funny in itself.The story itself develops slowly at first and then snowballs in tragedy at the end. Though an interesting and unpredictable story- the novel would be a dud without Penn's captivating writing style. Besides the story, the glimpse into deep-south politics was enjoyable. This is a world far removed from a west-coast boy like myself who is generally ignorant about politics in the first place. Not that the book is primarily about politics- it is not. I believe the book is about man's attempt to do right and how this is utterly impossible. There are a wide variety of characters in the book, yet all of them succumb to some sort of evil. It was not presented fatalistically, but factually. As the ancient Hebrew poet said, \\"man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.\\""},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"One feels after reading this book like one has lived an entire extra lifetime and now must get back to one's own life, though wiser and a little more world weary.

This isn't a book, it's rare genius hitting on all cylinders -- a spark from the shattered vessel of the deeper truths of life."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I have a list of books that I put into the category, \\"Books Every American Must Read.\\" I don't put books on that list thoughtlessly, but All the King's Men occupies one of the top spots. Many people are turned off by a book that is ostensibly about a politician, but this book is really about how politics is fused into our lives; it is about how many of the basic activities and achievements in a town, city or country come down to the mentality of one or two individuals; and politics becomes a metaphor for something that intoxicates you to the point of becoming unable to consider the humanity that surrounds you, so that the meaning of what you are doing is disconnected from your ambition to do it. It is also a story about how all of us, as we mature, give up the things that mean so much to us emotionally as we slowly but surely begin to serve what we believe is a better, more intelligent purpose. The narrator, Jackie Burden, has a wonderfully ironic way of expressing himself, where he recognizes that he has been disloyal to a \\"friend of his youth,\\" yet goes ahead with a dark plan anyway. Mr. Burden once had dreams of being something great, of exploring history for its beauty, he had honorable family friends, but he ended up instead digging up dirt for his \\"boss,\\" Willie Stark, the politician who transforms himself from a naive small-town speaker into a prominent, powerful figure on the brink of national attention. One of the people he digs up dirt on is one of those honorable people from his youth. But there is poetic justice in the story -- the corruption that engulfs the characters ends their upward rise. The themes of corruption explored in this book are played out again and again in American politics. The book was written in the 1940's, but it \\"predicted\\" Watergate, the Iran-Contra Affair, the Monica Lewinski scandal, as well as scores of other political games that have been played in the intervening decades. Finally, the main female character in this book is one of the most complex, unforgettable people you will ever meet in a novel.As an aside, the recent bestseller, \\"Primary Colors,\\" has a main character with the name Jack Stanton, which happens to also be the name of one of the main political figures in this book. I have always thought it was NOT a coincidence, but no other reviewer writing about either the book or the movie that came later has pointed this out. --This text refers to the Hardcover edition."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This Pulitzer-Prize winner is a great book, an astounding outflow of words that meander from delicate beauty to gut-punch brutality, particularly when dealing with machinations in the political arena.It is a riveting exploration of the rise and demise of Willie Stark, a loosely-disguised Huey Long, a Southern politician of the traditional confiscate-from-the-rich-and-buy-votes-from-the-poor school of governance. Here's a blustery mogul who assures everyone he just wants to help poor folks, yet he treats most of the people around him like dirt. He weilds power by breaking people, digging up dirt and blackmailing them, a good example of the politics of personal destruction that our recent real-life First Felon whined about so pitifully (while employing those very techniques every chance he got).Willie gives great speeches, the old-fashioned stump sermons that were rendered before television scared politicians into hiding their real personalities. Willie speaks from the heart to his constituents, performing for them, making them mad, making them laugh, making them LISTEN. Reading this makes you yearn for just one contemporary politician who would address people in such a manner. It would be such a refreshing change from all those podium lemmings who continually grovel in search of sound bytes.Willie vows to do good for all the poor folks who love him -- and, of course, his only means for doing that is to loot earned income from people who were foolish enough to be productive. Willie is the master of doing good with other people's money. He'd fit right in, with our Congress today.In the end, Willie got what he deserved.

A \\"Great American Novel,\\" like Huckleberry Finn, or Moby Dick, this book is also widely considered the finest fictional work about the political system of the United States ever written. Robert Penn Warren's crowning achievment, it tells the story of one Willie Stark, who rises in stature from absurd country bumpkin to serious presidential candidate in the years immediately preceding World War II. It's a beautiful, gripping narrative concerned with the conflict between the world as we wish or perceive it to be, and as it actually is, or as Warren considered it to be. Follow Willie as his genial innocence is gradually corrupted by a corrupt system and decide for yourself whether he becomes the tragic hero or cruel villain of the piece, a Hamlet or a ham-fisted Iago. Witness Jack Burden, Willie's right-hand man, undergo a transformation of such breathtaking, agonizing proportions that eventually it engulfs the lives of everyone around him, friends and enemies alike. Watch treasured illusions shatter and intricately-wrought characters unexpectedly fragment against a setting that can only be described as monolithic. And along the way find yourself questioning your own assumptions about people and the world.

Willie Stark stands in for Long as the demagoguing governor of Louisiana.The main character and narrator is Jack Burden, a rich boy turned newspaper man turned political fixer. Much more attention is paid to his story than that of Stark relative to the 2006 movie version. Characteristic is an aside in no way related to the main story that tells a tragic, horrifying story of Jack's family in the Antebellum South. We learn that Jack is a failed law student and failed history phd candidate. But we also learn more about Stark's relationship with his wife and about his son. All that said, I must say it very closely matches the tone of the movie even though it shares little dialogue and events diverge.All the Kings Men is the sort of book with a very high ratio of words to plot progress. But the language is just beautiful, and Warren draws the reader into the dirty world of 1920s/30s Louisiana politics. You just want to drink it in, to peel back the layers of story.All the King's Men is widely considered to be the greatest novel ever written about American politics. I cannot lodge any protest, although for a man keenly interested in politics my bookshelves are shamefully unadorned with political fiction. But it's really not in my mind a book about politics. It's a book about New Orleans and a book about Louisiana. It's a book about what could have been and choices we make that effect our lives forever.This review is of a paperback edition of the original version, NOT Noel Polk's revised edition."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"A steamroller of a book, All the King's Men begins in action and ends in action.

But inside our journey through mankind is the powerful engine of human enotion and All the King's Men runs the gamut.Warren had great facility with the language, in line with Twain and Faulkner, utilizing an extensive vocabulary that does not cloud or interfere with story or plot.Get the idea of a man who \\"debauched massively\\" from an automobile seat, and you see what I mean. Warren creates images that guide the viewer into the mind of the storyteller, yet exceed any one man's grasp.

But first I'll say that I enjoyed the story and Warren's punchy writing style.My disappointment stems from the buildup to the book. So many people say that it is a great book, a true landmark realistic examination of political idealism turned to corruption. It's also supposed to be loosely based on Huey Long. But there is precious little in this story about Willie Stark, a.k.a. Huey Long; it's much more about the intellectually cynical Jack Burden, an assistent to Stark, essentially a nobody and someone I don't care about. Jack is a \\"truth-seeker\\" for Stark; majoring in history at college helped develop his skills at digging up dirt on the people that Stark wants to manipulate. But other than getting paid a good salary, it's unclear why Jack seems to feel such loyalty and devotion to Stark. Perhaps he was mesmerized by Stark's powerful personality like the others?The character of Jack offers up a non-standard version of morality. Jack feels no ethical qualms about digging up dirt on people at the bidding of his employer, Governor Stark, because truth is the highest morality. But if the \\"truth\\" is used for untruthful ends, shouldn't that compromise Jack's purported integrity? Jack never seems to ask that question.Not only do we never get to see Stark, the young idealist, we never get a good look at the corrupted Stark. Through Jack we learn that Stark occasionally uses bribery or blackmail. We never see Stark as a complete person, on the one hand as an effective, energetic, charismatic, get-things-done leader, and on the other hand as a heavy-handed, hardball-playing politician who bends the law and pushes up against constitutional restrictions. We never even really get a good look at all of the \\"king's men,\\" except for Jack, and he's just the guy who digs up dirt. So I never really learned anything about the corrupting influences of politics, or any of the specific practices of corrupt politicians.To remedy the shortcomings of this book, I am reading \\"Kingfish\\" by Richard White, a biography of Huey Long. That is perhaps the best redeeming feature of \\"All The King's Men\\"!By the way, both movies - the old and the new - are so-so. The book is better."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Overall, I thought the story was okay. I am not much of a fan of Penn's prose, and this book dragged until Jack Burden retells the story of Cass Mastern. For me, this is where the book starts falling into place. Maybe I was set up for failure with this book because I keep seeing this novel being called \\"political fiction.\\" As someone picking this up expecting \\"political fiction,\\" you'd expect the story to focus on Willie Stark and in much more detail of his humble beginnings to his tragic downfall, but he is only a distant focal point in this novel as the story belongs to one of Stark's cronies, Jack Burden. I don't know WHY I'm supposed to give a flip about Jack Burden and after finishing the novel, I still don't give a toss for the character. There are so many sub-plots and interesting characters within the story that I was much more interested in than the big picture of Burden's personal \\"odyssey.\\" I felt that some of the story was predictable (Burden's father) and some of the book just didn't seem feasible (the relationship between Stark and Anne Stanton). So all in all, this book didn't do it for me. I have read better."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Robert Penn Warren was one of the most outstanding writers of the twentieth century. He was the Poet Laureate of the United States and won two Pulitzer Prizes. After a brief stay in Italy Warren wrote a drama called Proud Flesh where he deals with many issues of political power and moral corruption for that power, also in this drama Warren tried to use the ideas of Louisiana politician Huey long. After not being satisfied with this piece of work he elaborate his drama into a novel called All the King's Men. All the King's Men is a book about the lives of southern governor Willie Stark and his right hand man Jack Burden as the live through the depression (1930's) in an unnamed southern state.The book starts with Willie becoming a noticeable politician after he warns many people that a school building was going to collapse. No one listens until one day the building dose collapse killing three children. He then is chosen to run for governor but unknowns to him he is only a dummy candidate to break up the vote. After he learns this he tells the rural people that the government only thinks of them as \\"dummies\\" and he drops out. He eventually runs for governor and wins a few years later and wins. Jack becomes very interested in Willie after covering Willie when Jack was a reporter and eventually Jack becomes Willies right hand man. Along with being Willies right hand man Jack also uses his skills in research to dig up info on all of Willies enemies. Along with this the book also focuses on Willie becoming more corrupt when he has more power. We also see Jack's role as the moral compass in the story. Even as Willie becomes more and more corrupted jack keeps a steady path of working toward good for the poor. In addition we see how Jack works toward marrying his childhood sweetheart Anne. In the end Willie is murdered after all the political corruption gets the better of him and the doctor of a under funded hospital assassinates him. In a side note Huey Long was also assassinated but only after he went to the senate.After reading both this book and many sites that offered commentaries. I have found that this was one of the most enjoyable books that I have ever read. Although as a critical reader I would not recommend this book to the average person. Personally I am very interested in the inner workings of politics, the West Wing is one of my favorite shows on television. But for people that are not as interested in politics this book may also be interesting because is dose deal a lot with personal relationship that everyone can relate to. For example everyone has someone in their life that they view as a moral compass.In conclusion this was a great book that I would strongly recommend to people that like the workings of politics, but I would still recommend this book to everyone. It was a great read and interested me greatly."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"With well over 150 reviews, most of them five stars, I am not going to add much to the mountain of positives.

If you enjoy writing that is prescient and intelligent, that makes you stop and re-read and pause to reflect, than you will cherish this book as I did.

I found it to be a love story where a young man (Jack) meets a girl (Ann Stanton), man loses girl because he himself is lost in his quest for self discovery, man finds and redeems himself and in the end man and woman live happily ever after.I certainly did enjoy the trip Warren took us on during Jack's journey.

Robert Penn Warren writes of Lousiana politician Willie Stark, in a Lousiana long before Katrina, but not so long before politics corrupted and paralyzed the system. But it's not just about politics, or I wouldn't be reading it. It's about every other thing in this world besides that.Warren is most known for his poetry, and this long, rambling book is filled with poetic moments, grand gestures of philosophical phrases, and the bombastic arrogance of someone who things he knows much more about life than you, and as it turns out, probably does.Take a pencil, underline the good parts, watch for the cows, the bugs, the road, the twitch, the clock towers, all the things that mean everything and yet still mean just the cow. Absolutely amazing work! And no movie can come close to fulfilling the poetic wonders that fill &lt;u>All the Kings Men&lt;/u>'s pages.

I was then on the second reading of the book, and decided that it had no merits other than the writing style. That was earlier today. Well, I began reading again, from the beginning, and the most insane thing happened - I began loving the book. And not just that, I read for hours on end, finishing at least a quarter of the book before my first break. Still, I don't feel that this is the best book ever, and in a similar vein (as far as writing style is concerned anyway) Ulysses is much better, but then again, Ulysses is one of my all-time favourites."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The following review was based on seeing both film versions of Robert Penn Warren's classic political noir All the King's Men recently as well as having read the book some time ago. Many of the points about the character of Willie Stark as portrayed on the screen apply to the book, especially the Crawford portrayal. However, the book gets much more into the grit of what ails Willie and his seemingly endless quest for power and control-when he actually gets his hands on it. Every class and personal resentment seems to come to the fore. An amazing piece of writing. As noted below, the Sean Penn version is a little closer to Warren's intent in that the narrator/ reporter Jack Burden is the real 'anti-hero'of the piece. Why? He gives legitimacy to Willie's efforts in quarters where Willie cannot go-the old Southern aristoracy that scorned the 'hicks'.I might also add that one can benefit from a careful reading of this book as a quasi-historical document of what stump-style politics looked like up close and personal- a type of politics that has practically vanished from the American political scene in the age of mass media and 24/7 'talking heads'. Today, one probably could not get elected to town selectmen with old Willie's style, but such is life.I have seen both film versions of Robert Penn Warren's classic tale of the rise and fall of a \`populist' corrupted politician, Willie Stark, based at least loosely on the political career of 1930's Louisiana Governor Huey Long. America has had no shortage of such politicians who have allegedly championed the cause of the \`little people' in their rise to power while on the side lining their pockets and the pockets of their friends. The late Governor of Alabama George Wallace comes to mind as a more modern example but there have been others, some who did not bother to champion the cause of \`little people' or anyone else, for that matter.The question before us, however, is who is the real Willie Stark. Since the story line is fairly simple and familiar from a glance at today's newspapers or a look at the political landscape it is the believability of the performances in the films that counts here. Broderick Crawford played in the original black and white film version and won an Academy Award for his performance by acting as a initially nave country bumpkin with a thirst for power to do \`good' who is corrupted by power as he goes about the business of governance. Seemingly, all his baser instincts come into play and there is an almost fatalistic sense that he is in for a big fall. Sean Penn in the more recent version seems to be more world-weary about the political process and cynical about what he can do for the \`people' and himself when in power. Of the two, Crawford just seems to be more comfortable in his interpretation of the role. Moreover, in the recent version the narrator's story, that of a troubled alcoholic former news reporter hired by Stark as his smooth-tongued flak, takes top-billing and that diminishes Stark's role in all the shenanigans. For my money, although Penn's performance may appeal to today's more politician-averse audience, Crawford wins this duel. View both films and you decide."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"In the Noel Polk version of All the King's Men, Willie Stark becomes Willie Talos. TALOS?!? Yes, I get the classical allusion, but that doesn't mean it's not a terrible name for the character. He's supposed to be a hardscrabble, down-and-dirty American politician, and you're giving him a highfalutin, European-sounding name like \\"Talos?\\" As opposed to the perfectly-fitting Stark? This egregious miscalculation makes me seriously doubt Polk's judgment on all matters relating to this novel. I stuck with the original.And the original is enough. Because really, people. This novel is badly overwritten as IS. Almost grotesquely so in parts. Do we truly need MORE of this? Warren is very much given to investing events and characters with baroque, pointlessly elaborate verbal curlicues that quickly collapse under their own weight and only serve to gum up the novel and remove whatever narrative momentum it might have had.The opening is a great example of this: two and a half densely-packed pages describing the highway on which the protagonists are driving. What does this do? Does it contribute to the plot? Does it add any sort of meaningful atmosphere to the proceedings? No and no. And it certainly is not sufficiently arresting on its own terms to make up for that. It's empty, self-indulgent fluff. All that it does is demonstrate that Warren is truly madly deeply in love with the sound of his own voice. And if we weren't convinced, he demonstrates it again. And again. And BANG.This isn't a political novel. Don't let anyone tell you it is. Everyone always identifies Willie Stark as the central figure--presumably because otherwise, it would be hard to nail it down as being about much of anything--but he is very much a secondary character; we only get a very sketchy idea of who he is or what his appeal to his constituents is, and his corruption, such as it is, is so laughably picayune that you barely raise an eyebrow. The mechanics of power are barely explored. \\"The rise and fall of an American dictator!\\" my copy breathlessly proclaims on the cover. Yeah, not so much. There are the seeds of something interesting here, but they never grow into anything.No, this is about the narrator, Jack Burden. Forget Willie; forget all the other characters--none of them are more than half-formed; it's a stretch to even call them \\"characters.\\" This is All Jack All The Time. Which means an awful lot of windy philosophizing about morality and duty and history, none of which amounts to much of anything. A deep psychological exploration this is not.The fact that no one else is defined in any real way also means no one to care about and no drama either. There is a murder. It's meant to be the novel's climax. It's not climactic, because all the people involved are just shadowy puppets. Nothing they do matters or signifies.I do admit that I was caught up on occasion. I liked the Cass Mastern story, and I liked the Judge Irwin plot. But then, oh lord, I had to slog through the Ballad of Jack and Anne. I think I'm at least as romantic as the next man, but I defy anyone to claim with a straight face that this long digression is in any way affecting. It's not. Anne's not a character (did I mention that there's a fair bit of misogyny here?), and Jack's not an interesting one. Overall, the interesting-to-mind-numbing ratio here is distressingly low.I see that most of the negative reviews for the book on this site seem to come from apathetic high school kids. My normal inclination is to mock such people, but in this case, I have to admit, the apathetic high school kids kinda have a point. It was painful enough for me, a graduate student who's used to this stuff, to get through--you're gonna force it on teenagers who have no interest in literature? I mean, at least for me, there's a certain value in having read such an (however inexplicably) acclaimed book; for them, it just seems pointlessly sadistic."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The book was top notched and wasn't dat bad even though it was use.

The novel gives us a glimpse into the underhanded, controlling, backstab-your-own-kin tactics of politicians and their cronies, and that is always enjoyable. Sometimes the book becomes a bit long and plodding, but other times it is a pageturner. And, as I said before, Warren writes with a beautiful turn of phrase."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Warren's novel -- one of the best American novels ever written, I believe -- is beautiful and evocative, but it is only tangentially about politics and Willie Stark. It is instead primarily concerned with history; specifically, the New South and the Old South, one generation versus another, backwoods Jeffersonian agrarianism versus modern political ambition. Willie Stark is certainly an important character; it is with him, after all, that the novel reaches its violent climax. But Jack Burden, tortured former graduate student, keen observer of everyday life, is the true focus of the novel; through the course of the book, we see the world through him, and come away shaking with revelation and uncertainty."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read the restored edition. The first chapter (which Warren wrote before the editors got hold of it) was added as an appendix, along with an editorial afterward. I think I preferred the ORIGINAL first chapter. This restored edition used the name Willie TALOS, instead of Stark. Again, it was the editor who got Warren to change it...the editor didn't like Talos. Loved the story, but I suppose I am showing my ignorance (yet again), in saying that I didn't like the WAY it was written. I judge a book two ways...overall story and writing style. I am not a classics scholar, so what do I know. Of course the book was narrated by Jack Burden, former newspaper reporter turned right-hand-man to the governor. So I guess if you looked at it that way, it is understandable why it was written the way it was written. Some words are misused like \\"pore ground\\" instead of \\"poor ground\\", in speaking about the farmability of the land. This one really \\"stuck\\" out, but there were others that I don't remember, as I didn't make a note of them. Maybe this was just Jack Burden being sarcastic, I don't know. Being from Louisiana, I was especially curious about this book because it is supposed to be loosely based on former Governor Huey Long, who was assassinated in the state Capitol building. It has made me want to read up on Long. I didn't see the Academy Award winning movie starring Broderick Crawford (who won an Oscar for his role as Willie Stark). I wanted to read the book before seeing either movie."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Wow!This book was great! I read some reviews before I read this book, but when I started reading the book I though \\"how boring\\" he is talking about a highway???? But after this the book got much better. This book has every type of style of writing, romance, action, comedy ,drama. I really thought the ending was perfect, I really didn't see Adam doing something like that, he didn't seem like he could kill a fly. This is why I like this book it doesn't follow the way it should. Nice little country boy turning into [debauch],\\" bust or buy em'\\" Willie Stark. The other part of this book I liked is that it was from Jack burden's point of view, this story is from the eyes of a political aide, not from the governer. This gives it a diferent look on what was going on. Jack Burden is basically Stark's best friend,although Jack calles Adam his best friend, he is not. Adam and him are holding onto a relationship that doesn't exist anymore. It is just a memory of what they had in their youth. The age of each of these characters is different then what you may think. Jack is 41-42 years old when he is telling this story, but he is not at all mature. He doesn't understand what death means and still has a slightly perverted outlook on life. Willie Stark's age I could not figure out, but he must have been a good bit older then Jack, beacuse he calles him \\"boy\\". This is not some thing that would happen in real life. For this to be realistic Stark must have been at least 65 years of age, which I don't belive he was. Anne Stanton was another one whose age was distorted, She is about 37-38, but Jack still thinks of her as the 17 year girl he loved. Before I figured out how old he was through dates, I thought he was maybe mid to early thirty's, I also thought that Stark was about 55 or so. In Jack's eyes he views Adam as a brother as well as a friend, but he views him as a younger brother, he refers in the book about Adam's age \\"around mine\\", he also states that he alway's wins the verbal arguments and Adam won at sports. Adam is the stero type of the sucessful younger brother who Jack feels has everything he lacks, passion and peace. Which makes it ironic when Adam kills Willie for he doesn't seem to need to( I know that Anne was fooling around Willie, and that Adam was her brother, but it really should have been someone else. Which brings me to the point that it was not Sadie or Tiny's fault that Willie was killed. In the end it was Adams who pulled the trigger not tiny or Sadies fault. O.K.

Dad never mentioned the quasi-police state the populist governor established while he ruled Louisiana. While in college, I first read Robert Penn Warren's fictionalized treatment of the founder of the Long Dynasty. ALL THE KING'S MEN tells the story of Willie Stark, an initially idealistic small-town pol who learns how to win big by losing first. Jack Burden, Stark's idealistic hatchetman, narrates the tale and shows the reader how Willie becomes slowly corrupted by wealth, power, and ego. I've read this book many times, and each time I find myself fascinated by the moral ambiguities of the Stark character. Willie got into politics to do good. Even at the end, he still believes he is on the side of right battling the forces of evil. In his novel, Robert Penn Warren wrote, I contend, the most perceptive biography of Huey Long ever written. ALL THE KING'S MEN is a literary landmark of the last century."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I doubt if any book would ever comes close to the experience of reading Penn Warren's book.

Jack's duties include gathering weapons for use against those enemies, like biblical David before him, by gathering stones with which to fell the Goliaths of a more genteel, if scarcely less corrupt, plutocracy who formerly ran the state. But it is not the stones themselves that Jack gathers but rather the creepy crawlies living underneath the stones unearthed that will eventually allow Jack to be so successful that tragedy will ensue for all, good and evil alike.This theme of raking through the muck of bygone days resonates with me as I first read this book as a youth some forty years ago and as I reread it I see my childhood and this book in a different light. But as I understand more of this book than I did upon first reading, I fear that one need not delve so deeply into the past to see the relevance of this book today and into the future. Although inspired by Louisiana's Governor Huey Long, one need not look to the thirties to see the type. Stark rather resembles a certain Arkansas governor of recent vintage whose wife, like Stark, attempted to redeem the family of its sins by providing free health care to the less fortunate. One need not squint too hard to see in Anne Stanton, that paragon of female nobility whose virtue could not survive an encounter with Willie Stark, the National Organization of Women who were only too willing to overlook the sexual improprieties, lies and corruption of their Willie Stark if only he pretended to respect them in the morning. Why, even the senator from Massachusetts may be glimpsed as Tom Stark drunkenly drives into a culvert ruining the life of a young lady companion with no consequence to himself, although admittedly Tom had the foresight to avoid plunging the car into water. Huey Long promised to raise Louisiana up out of the muck but mired it in corruption just as Willie Stark promised to raise a Louisiana-like state only to see it sunk into corruption. Now we see the results of an additional seventy years of Democratic good old boy (and girl) corruption in Louisiana as it struggles to blame others for its failures of government to the detriment of the very people in pretends to help but, in fact, victimizes.So off we go into the future as the citizens of Louisiana and elsewhere continue to not only accept but to positively demand a snake oil salesman, well acquainted with his wares due to close family relations, to lead them into the promised land. Too bad that we, like Jack Burden, Willie Stark, and the rest, will find more venom than remedy from the fangs of the serpent we demand."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is a tour-de-force, a book that will revive your faith in humanity.

It is really about the narrator (Jack Burden), whose perspective delivers us to the inside world of the political smoke-filled negotiating rooms of the state' deal makers. Why deals must be made, how deals must be made, the purposes for deals, and more information about the machinations of political machinery are disclosed.Not surprisingly, what happens in these pages is similar to what happened in the same time period 1,300 miles away in Mario Puzo's \\"The Godfather.\\" Stark is Louisiana's Don Corleone.And, like Corleone, there are lickspittles - \\"yes men.\\" And, like Corleone, one will betray the leader. Like Corleone, there is a fair-haired son whose antics are governed more by his libido than brains. Like Corleone, the provider wants to deliver a world to his child that he could not have. And, like Corleone, his efforts encounter tragedy. Greek theater does not deliver greater tragedy.The book is highlighted - in this reader's perspective - by the down-home farm metaphors constantly recited in the dialogue of Stark - the \\"Boss.\\" And the zingers delivered by narrator Jack Burden also bring cheer. Many of the contrarian and pithy statements they deliver remind me of the great lines written by Ayn Rand in \\"The Foutainhead.\\"Beneath the story of the Starks is the story of the Burdens. All of it. From Jack Burden's boyhood days living on the \\"Row\\" of \\"Burden's Landing.\\" He recalls his childhood relationship with his \\"first love\\", Anne Stanton, and her brother (and his best friend), Adam Stanton, the children of then Governor Stanton. He recalls how his education was enhanced by neighborly and fatherly Judge Irwin. And, in great detail, he recalls how his freshmen days were tainted by beautiful Anne Stanton's breaking of his heart.The beat and rhythm of this book has a few slow spots - Jack Burden's smitten character with Anne Stanton when they were teenagers; and his thorough description of the book that he never published on \\"Cass Mastern.\\" But, those spots are easily overlooked when the Stark dialogue comes about and the human intricacies of the Row and governor grow until they reach a crescendo where either good music or disaster must arrive.William Faulkner's Lafayette County is rivaled by William Penn Warren's \\"Burden's Landing.\\"Robert Penn Warren's greatest work is claimed to be this novel.

Although I could appreciate the flashes of genius and the beautiful passages which populate the book, I got lost in the weeds of the characters and politics and eventually gave it up as hopeless.I picked it up again this year after reading and enjoying some poetry by Warren. I had the idea that I might be better able to appreciate the book now that I was older. The idea was a good one, as it happens. Either my patience has increased, or I understand the characters better now, or something. In any case, the book really spoke to me this time around.You can find a lot of information about the political side of the novel-- the comparisons between Willie Stark and Huey Long are many and well documented. I have to confess that I was more interested in the intersection between the personal and the political than in the probable historical parallels. There is something really nice about Willie Stark's fall from idealism as highlighted by Jack Burden's simultaneously cynical and romantic narration. Dressed up as a political novel, All The King's Men somehow manages to put the focus squarely on the people involved.Warren is a poet writing prose. This is worth bearing in mind when you pick up the book. The digressions into the thought or the moment are many. Although generally very beautiful, it can often be quite tricky to follow the thread of the plot. If you bear in mind that the digressions are as important as the point, I believe that you will struggle with it a lot less. Nobody will ever accuse the novel of being terse. It is very big and often windy, in the best and grandest possible fashion.I would recommend the book to nearly everybody.

The story for me was relatively straightforward, with the twists and surprises really pretty predictable. But the story and what could be considered its shortcomings for me were not an issue at all; I still thoroughly enjoyed this book, and likely will read it again within the year. Its prose is absolutely brilliant, flowing and fluid, creating colors and feelings, taking me far deeper into the world inhabited by the narrative and its characters than just about any other book I've ever read. Of course Robert Penn Warren was a poet laureate; how could he not be, given the depth and feeling of his writing. Whether you know it at the beginning, you can't escape his poet-ness and his poetry as you read this work, thoroughly enoyable from beginning to end.I especially liked his fascinating detours into discussions of religion and belief, the nature of faith, the power of West and moving toward it, so strangely in tune with what I have come to believe and feel as well.If you enjoyed this book, I'd recommend James Dickey'sDeliveranceor even better,To the White Sea.This is an outstanding book, a wonderful read, and one to keep around the house and enjoy again and again.

Whatever you may think of the stance taken by these authors, I think you will find, as I have found, that this book anticipates that attitude, one which I had always associated with the late 1950's. Reading &quot;All the Kings Men&quot; has given me much insight into the great books which came later, as I consider how those authors must have thought and felt, creating their work with Mr. Warren hanging over them. &quot;All the Kings Men&quot; is a fabulous work, and I'm not sure that its treatment of ethics has been surpassed by those which came after."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I'm currently a high school senior and we read this book in our AP English class.

Warren at times is really amazing; his prose in countless paragraphs is as good as or better than any 20th century American novelist.

Eventually, Stark calls on Burden to get the goods on the lilly white Judge Irwin, the surrogate father of Jack's youth and a man of widely acknowledged rectitude:Jack: But suppose there isn't anything to find.Stark: There is always something.Jack: Maybe not on the Judge.Stark: Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the stink to the diddie to the stench of the shroud. There is always something.Sure enough, Jack digs until he finds the ugly truth and unleashes a series of shocking revelations and tragic deaths.I'm sure that this must seem too cynical to some, but it is actually a marvelous retelling of the essential Puritan democratic myth that informs the American system. Politics after all is nothing but a system of choices about how some men will wield power over other men. All of the choices are bad, but the alternative--the lawless State of Nature--is worse and so we try to make the best bad choices possible. But we must remain ever vigilant against those who wield power over us &amp; noone is more dangerous than the populist or the do-gooder who cloaks himself in the mantle of the Good &amp; the Right. FDR and his New Deal come hand in glove with interring the Japanese Americans and packing the Supreme Court. LBJ and Civil Rights are accompanied by profound personal corruption and Viet Nam. And, of course, when you elect the purely evil, you get Detente + Watergate or the Health Care Plan + Monica + Chinagate, etc. The only politicians who are even mildly trustworthy are those who renounce the very powers of government--George Washington, William McKinley, Calvin Coolidge, Eisenhower &amp; Reagan.This is a book that John Adams would have loved and you will too.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book won the Pulitzer, as well as made the Modern American Library's list of the top 100 books of the 20th century. As far as I'm concerned, it's flawless. Why? I've a deep hankerin' for Southern fiction, and I read any of it that I can get my hands on. The story of Willie Stark and his political rise and fall parallels not only its true origins as a fictionalized account of the life of Louisiana politician, Huey Long, it also has as much to say about today's political landscape (Bill Clinton...did you read this book?).

The story rings as true today as it did when it was written. The story is that of the rise and fall of a Southern politician, Willie Stark, a humble small town lawyer and reform politician , who wins over the people and ascends to the rank of Governor. As Willie's popularity rises so does his ambition and he becomes the most poweful man in the State who will stop at nothing to maintain his power. I agree with a reveiwer who says that Willie Stark is one of the great characters of American literature but so is Jack Burden, who transforms himself from a cynical follower, who performs several distasteful acts for Willie , to someone who does the right thing at the end. Even Willie comes full cicrle at the end. The secondary characters are wonderful. Allegedly the story is loosely based on the Huey Long storyand set in Louisiana; but it could just as easily be based on a number of other Southern politicians in any part of the Deep South."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I am completely shocked by &quot;Tina's Friends&quot; and their comments.

All the King's Men presents the reader with a vision of mid 20th century Southern politics through the adapted story of Huey Long. This narrative also includes page turning elements of the mystery novel while covering tricky issues common in Southern literature. For example, the protagonist deals with the notion of a southern cavalier or hero (Cass Mastern-civil war), behaviorism in the form of the &quot;great twitch&quot; as seen by a doctor friend, and other areas of S oren Kierkegaard influence like the &quot;leap of faith&quot; required of the protagonist. This book is painted with the rich Southern tradition of language, religion, friendship, and romance; it also deals with the simple struggle for good in a time of personal and political decay. Penn-warren's novel can present some student readers difficulty without notes; nonetheless, most readers will leave this book knowing why it deserves its place in the Southern literary genre."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The descriptive passages in this text are able to take me, an Australian of this era, into the lives homes and meeting places of people of a different era and nationality.The characterisation weaves through the narrative to provide a consistency unparalled in other writings.The writer cleverly builds to the climatic and devastating discovery by the anti hero (Jack Burden) that nothing is safe (or sacred) from corruption - even his boyhead love."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"There never has been and never again will be a book like ATKM. It is, arguably, THE great American novel. Unfortunately, some view this work as a retelling of the Huey Long story but, of course, it is far more than that, for in Willie Stark, Warren has created a character both more complex and more sympathetic than Long. How greatful we all should be that Warren abandoned his play, Proud Flesh, and chose the novel format instead. I doubt the play, if produced, would ever have been successfully transformed into a novel, while the novel has generated numerous plays and a successful screenplay. With the exception of the Cass Mastern episode, which tends to drag, this work is up there with the very greatest fiction in the English language."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"A rich political tale following the path of a small town lawyer to the governor's manson.

Corruption is inevitable with the power given to the new governor, Willie Stark, and his team of smart, slimy, and invaluable confidants. Written from the perspective of Stark's #1 right hand man, Jack Burden, we get to see the unpolished life of a local politician who fights his way to the governorship and whose goal is to make a difference and to make a permanent and indelible mark on his state. There is no shortage of back-room bargaining and scandal, as well as two-faced public pandering. Reading this book allows the reader to see how easily it would be for one in power to get sucked into the level of influence he or she exudes. Dangerous and compelling, this novel is one that could provide an unfortunate template for our nation's politicians, whether they be dirty or clean."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Amazon lists this as a movie tie-in edition, and I must admit that I bought it because I had been attracted by the movie trailers, but wanted to read the original first. Now having done so (and still not seen the film), I cannot imagine how it would be possible to translate any but the broadest outline of this subtle masterpiece into cinematic terms.For one thing, how could one capture Robert Penn Warren's superb style? Not for nothing was he to be made the first American Poet Laureate; the story is enfolded in broad tracts of rich Southern prose-poetry, capturing the climate, the country, and the lives of the ordinary people who dwell in it. For example, consider this paragraph on page 33:\\"It looked like those farmhouses you ride by in the country in the middle of the afternoon, with the chickens under the trees and the dog asleep, and you know the only person in the house is the woman who has finished washing up the dishes and has swept the kitchen and has gone upstairs to lie down for half an hour and has pulled off her dress and kicked off her shoes and is lying there on her back on the bed in the shadowy room with her eyes closed and a strand of her hair still matted down on her forehead with the perspiration. She listens to the flies cruising around the room, then she listens to your motor getting big out on the road, then it shrinks off into the distance and she listens to the flies. That was the kind of house it was.\\"I quote this in full partly so that readers may get a sense of the riches that are in store: a style that is leisurely and expansive while remaining utterly straightforward. I quote it also because, like so many descriptions in the book, it captures a place in terms of the people who inhabit it, with a feeling for the rhythm and values of their lives. In that this is a political book at all, the charismatic politician at its center, the populist Willie Stark (loosely based on Louisiana's Huey Long), first derives his strength from just such a grassroots understanding of the ordinary people he represents.But I question whether ALL THE KING'S MEN is a political book, at least in the sense that the movie trailer appears to be marketing it. When the novel opens, Willie Stark is already the Governor of his state, and even in flashbacks there are very few scenes of him campaigning or working up crowds with his oratory. Similarily, although we see him quietly collecting information with which to dissuade his foes or manipulate his allies, any graft or corruption remains mostly beneath the surface, and Stark's descent into demagoguery is nothing compared to what was going on at the same period (the thirties) in Germany or Italy. Warren does paint a very clear picture of old-style machine politics, with Stark at the center of his web, surrounded by a small circle of \\"the boys.\\" But very little of the drama is played out in the public arena, but rather in the lives and loyalties of a small group of childhood friends from moneyed backgrounds quite different from Stark's own, who nonetheless get drawn into his orbit.Chief among these is the narrator, Jack Burden, who gradually emerges as the principal character in the novel. I quote the passage of description above because it demonstrates Jack's voyeurism. Not only does he see a farmhouse and imagine the woman inside it, but he also writes a little story about her. This characteristic continues throughout the book; Jack's imagined stories are plausible, for he is very perceptive, but they are all things that he sets in motion and watches from the outside. A failed PhD student of history, he first encounters Willie Stark while covering him as a newspaper reporter, and his objective viewpoint, his insight, and his talent for uncovering facts make him very useful to the rising politician.While Jack remains outside the political machine, fascinated but aloof, Willie Stark gradually invades Jack's own circle from his childhood home at Burden's Landing. Chief among these are Adam and Anne Stanton, the children of a former Governor, and Judge Irwin, who served as a moral guidepost and second father to Jack. Before even the first chapter is out, you know that Jack's personal allegiances will be tested. You gradually realize that because Jack is a watcher and not a doer he will fail these tests in many respects, though not utterly.In the end, this book is about Jack's journey to self-knowledge. Willie Stark's story continues to propel the plot, but he fades into the background as a force, remaining more as a touchstone for all that Jack is and is not. In movie terms, the part requires a star performer, but it is not a starring role. Jack, by contrast, is central though anything but a star. His story would be hard to realize on the screen because so much of it is internal: a moral journey played out in memories, long (sometimes overlong) paragraphs of meditation, and occasional episodes of action, brief but brilliantly realized. A true cinematic adaptation of this book would concentrate almost entirely on personal relationships. It might have elements of romance, but it would be neither an action movie nor a thriller. It would be political only in the sense that politics highlights the question of how good intentions may lead to evil ends, and bad means may be necessary to acheive good results. But this moral conundrum is eternal, and Robert Penn Warren has found a wonderfully intimate and subtle means of adressing it."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Perhaps, by now, you will have heard that All the King's Men has been made into a film (again) which will be released this September. Because Hollywood always goes for the glamour, I wanted to read this novel before the mega-celebrities' beautiful faces spoil my ability to imagine the characters as real 1930's Southerners. The first thing a movie script takes away from a novel is the reader's thrill of discovery, of apprehending the psychological detail which fuels characters' motivations. The dramatic kick of the film visuals is a pleasure but too often films substitute for our experience; the true test of Warren's precise prose is that we bring our individual knowledge of life to bear on what he shows us. Warren's prose is so detailed that I felt I was in the South, the ordinary South of the Depression Era. I fear that in today's fast-paced life people will have lost the taste for Warren's carefully crafted sentences and dense detail.Warren is as precise with landscape description as he is with human interaction. Because each sentence and image is connected, it's difficult to quote Warren: \\"It was very hot and very still. You could look down the bay, beyond the cove, toward the Gulf, and see the water lifting up into the light as though the horizon had ceased to exist.\\"People who go to the film before the novel will have the pleasure of looking at Jude Law as Jack Burden, but if you skip the novel you will miss the self-education of a man, the training of a sentient being. The novel could have been titled, The Education of Jack Burden, since Burden is the narrator and it is through his consciousness that we experience Willie Stark, a.k.a. Willie Talos."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"All the King's Men is the story of Jack Burden who, as assistant to Governor Willie Stark, describes the inner workings of the political machine (of which he is an integral part) that consolidates and strengthens Stark's power. The corruption of the Stark administration, and Jack's involvement in that corruption make this a compelling story. But the real power of this book is in the development and portrayal of its characters, especially Jack Burden. The description of his transformation into someone who recognizes his responsibility over the consequences of his choices and actions over a period of several years and 400+ pages is remarkable yet believable.No other book that I have read compares to this book in its combination of enjoyable and exciting reading; believable character developments; and beautiful descriptions of events, activities, thoughts, feelings, conversations, and surroundings."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"One of my all-time favorite American novels! Although touted as the definitive novel about American politics, All the King's Men reveals more about the lens (narrator Jack Burden) through which we look than the actual subject.The writing is lyric and engaging, although long-winded, and discourages some less-determined (or appreciative) readers. I like a book I have dig into, like a juicy steak. Warren's misuse of the English language is brilliant. Each sentance can be savored and enjoyed.Structurally interesting, we meander through Burden's life in a manner bolder than, but not unlike Proust's Swann's Way. Be sure to leave some mental bread crumbs, the extra effort is well worth it.Overall, excellent!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This World War II-era, Pulitzer-winning novel ostensibly chronicles the rise and fall of Willie Stark. Loosely based on Louisiana boss Huey Long, Stark is an ultra-charismatic, larger-than-life, Clinton-esque, Southern governor looking to reach the U.S. Senate. In truth, though, the political story ultimately yields to the personal story of Jack Burden, a reporter turned right-hand man to Stark and the first-person narrator of the book.Burden's vibrantly crackling, descriptive, often lyrical narrative drives the story throughout, frequently delving into the past--his own and others'--to comment upon the present and, just as frequently, infusing descriptions of events with cutting questions of philosophy and observations of human nature. Burden's chronicles introduce a variety of utterly realistic and memorable minor characters--his ex-wife; his mother; Stark's chauffeur; a judge; the girlfriend of his youth and her brother, just to name a few--and seldom wane in intensity.The one weakness I noticed was that much of the language and dialogue relies on Depression Era slang that can prove distracting and require a bit of thought to figure out. This proved especially true in the beginning of the novel, the pacing of which is by no means fast; however, once the story got going, I noticed it less and less. And the last chapter, as Jack struggles with the meaning of all that has happened--struggles to understand if there even is any meaning--is simply sublime.A highly recommended tour de force and great American novel--not so much for its insight into politics, but for its insight into human nature in the whirlwind of history and politics. A book worth owning and re-reading. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"As a visitor living here for a few years I have decided to read the cream of American Fiction.I must say in this book I struck gold.The writer seemed to have the skill to combine a hugely compelling plot,elaborate character development and prose which at times was poetic.The novel is full of timeles themes such as the greed and corruption of the body politic,sowing what one will reap and the importance of friends and roots,it is all there.This novel for me was a great discovery and I was in awe from start to finish.This is compelling reading and stands head and shoulders above some of the modern writing we are getting today.I would recommend this book to anyone.......it is a must read."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I have a list of books that I put into the category, \\"Books Every American Must Read.\\" I don't put books on that list thoughtlessly, but All the King's Men occupies one of the top spots. Many people are turned off by a book that is ostensibly about a politician, but this book is really about how politics is fused into our lives; it is about how many of the basic activities and achievements in a town, city, or even a country come down to the mentality of just a few individuals; and politics becomes a metaphor for something that intoxicates people to the point that they become unable to consider the humanity that surrounds them, so that the meaning of what they are doing is disconnected from their ambition to do it. It is also a story about how all of us, as we mature, give up the things that mean so much to us emotionally as we slowly but surely begin to serve what we believe is a better, more intelligent purpose. The narrator, Jackie Burden, has a wonderfully ironic way of expressing himself, where he recognizes that he has been disloyal to a \\"friend of his youth,\\" yet goes ahead with a dark plan anyway. Mr. Burden once had dreams of being something great, of exploring history for its beauty, and he had honorable family friends, but he ended up instead digging up dirt for his \\"boss,\\" Willie Stark, the politician who transforms himself from a naive small-town speaker into a prominent, powerful figure on the brink of national attention. One of the people he digs up dirt on is one of those honorable people from his youth. But there is poetic justice in the story -- the corruption that engulfs the characters ends their upward rise. The themes of corruption explored in this book are played out again and again in American politics. The book was written in the 1940's, but it metaphorically \\"predicted\\" Watergate, the Iran-Contra Affair, the Monica Lewinski scandal, as well as scores of other political games that have been played in the intervening decades. Finally, the main female character in this book is one of the most complex, unforgettable people you will ever meet in a novel.As an aside, the recent bestseller, \\"Primary Colors,\\" has a main character with the name Jack Stanton, which happens to also be the name of one of the main political figures in this book. I have always thought it was NOT a coincidence, but no other reviewer writing about either the book or the movie that came later has pointed this out."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book was written before the baby boomers had slacker kids... it shows that the trend for unhappy self-centered people who have ot hitchike on other people's energy started a long time before the slacker generation. Every person who was disappointed in his family and freinds being less than perfect will understand Jack Burden, and every person who wished that somebody, anybody would take charge will admire Willie Stark. And every woman who screwed around with someone else's husband and was then offended when the jerk screwed around on her had best take Sadie to heart. This doesn't have anything to do with politics for me. That was just the incidental setting for a great study of grownups who never outgrow their need to be loved. And in this age of television blurring the distinct regional speech patterns except when artifically exaggerating them, this book does a wonderful job of capturing the humor and imagery of down home speech that I enjoyed reading almost as much as Clude Edgerton's &quot;Raney&quot;."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is one of the great books in the American literary canon.

If you've never read All The King's Men this is good news. If you've read it once or several times, it's still good news. This is the originally published version from 1946 - not the version that renames Willie Stark as Willie Talos.Okay, if I could take two books with me to a desert island, the first book would be All The King's Men. The second book would also be All The King's Men, in case I lost the first book. I think it's that good, but that's just my opinion and it doesn't count for much. Some people hate it; they say it's long and that it rambles and waxes poetic and has lots of philosophy in it. They're right. Some people love it for the same reasons. But there is this about it: It is full to the brim and overflowing with life. It tells a fictional story of people that lived over 75 years ago - and it could just as well be talking about people that are alive today. You will find yourself in this book and you will know yourself better if you finish it. What more can you ask?"},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Have never read a book that felt more like a graduate class. No, make that three graduate classes, for there's enough in here to provide ample curriculum for Ethics in Politics 320, Rhetoric & Logic 420, and at least a full semester of Modern American Literature.The story is set in the 1930s and is told in first person by Jack Burden, former journalist-turned-aide to Willie Stark, a southern governor in the Huey Long mold: broad, brash, and bold. But now that I've gotten that out of the way you can stop worrying about it, because what this book is really about is Original Sin/corruption/moral compromise. Literally every character in this tale faces some sort of moral/ethical dilemma. A small handful (for instance, the governor's wife Lucy) manage to navigate the morass of existence without falling from grace, but the vast majority slip and fall - some out of a genuine lack of morality (for instance, the assistant governor, Tiny Duffy, a true Tammany Hall villain), but most of them gradually, one ethical compromise yielding inevitably to another, like a Jenga tower from which pieces are systematically removed until the whole thing collapses. I'm not sure whether Penn himself is clear whether this is the result of free will or a manifestation of Original Sin. One of the governor's favorite quotes, repeated often throughout the tale, is that \\"man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud. There is always something [corrupt in their nature]\\" - suggesting that at least a part of him comes down on the side of Original Sin. But it's hard not to want to kick many of the (largely unsympathetic) characters in the butt every time they wittingly make choices that are obviously going to lead to catastrophe.Students of Ethics in Politics will relish the examination of how Governor Stark's noble motives become gradually corrupted by the realities of the political system in which he operates. Originally convinced to run for office by corrupt politicians counting on him to split the \\"rube\\" vote so that the state's Political Machine can continue to churn unmolested, Stark eventually turns the tables on his manipulators, but in doing so finds himself resorting to increasingly unethical methods (threats, blackmail) in order to achieve his largely unselfish and well-meaning ends. Which begs the question that seems to arise every time someone like Huey Long - or, more recently, DC Councilman Marion Berry - ends up on trial for corruption, even as thousands of deservedly grateful, devoted constituents picket the courthouse steps: can even the noblest of intentions ever justify ethically questionable means?Meanwhile, students of rhetoric and logic will be kept busy by chapter upon chapter of cascading syllogisms employed in order to justify all sorts of questionable ends. No topic seems too vast or intimidating to escape Penn's scrutiny, from life, death, and fate, to the nature of good, evil, and God. The narrator, Jack Burton, uses these syllogisms as justification for a series of increasingly dubious acts; what's less clear is whether he is self-aware enough to realize the extent to which his syllogisms are laced with sly and intricate fallacies, enough to keep a class of grad students huddled over pints of ale for months, hashing them all out.And, lest students of Modern American Lit feel left out, there's plenty left for them in examining the parallelism between ancient Greek tragedy and Stark's gradual fall from grace (substitute Judge Irwin's fall from grace, or Adam Stanton's fall from grade, or Jack Burden's fall from grace, if you prefer), culminating in a series of climaxes as horrific as they are undoubtedly hubristic. Even the names of the characters in the story - Jack Burden, Tiny Duffy, Willie Stark - are loaded with symbolic and metaphoric relevance. No - English lit students needn't feel slighted; there is more than enough here to keep them churning out papers until final exams week.In other words, this book is stuffed full of juicy, complex content - which makes it a capital book for studying, but perhaps doesn't much contribute to creating a diverting or entertaining reading experience. The characters aren't particularly likeable, the plot is largely introspective rather than event-driven, and - believe me - I'm not spoiling anything by letting it slip that no one lives happily ever after, which can make portions of this tough slogging. Guess I'm saying that while there's plenty of meat here, definitely requires an investment in energy, attention and cognition on the part of the reader in order to appropriately digest it."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book won the Pulitzer and is described as \\"the finest novel ever written on American politics,\\" so I was expecting great things. However, right off the bat, in the opening chapter, I started to get a bad James Agee vibe. While Robert Penn Warren's long, rambling, stream-of-consciousness digressions are not as gratuitous as Agee's (and not so obviously written in a drunken haze), they can be equally tedious. The \\"poetic\\" repetition of the same sentences over and over grates on one's nerves after a while. Nonetheless, every so often in the midst of the rambling the author makes a really profound observation and you feel glad that you stuck with it instead of chucking the book across the room. There is some excellent characterization in \\"All the King's Men,\\" and there are some very exciting moments. Even though this book annoyed me frequently, I still feel that it has its moments of brilliance. Also, it really made me think. Therefore, I give it four stars.By the way, I noticed that sweat is a recurring motif in this novel, especially in the first third. Every character is \\"perspiring,\\" \\"damp with perspiration,\\" building up \\"beads of sweat,\\" sporting pit stains, etc. My brother, who did not like \\"All the King's Men,\\" comments: \\"Many bad \`Southern' books use the \`Long, Hot Summer' motifs of constant heat and sweat and ludicrous \`everythin' gwine be alright' dialect (see the similarly overrated Faulkner). Even modern-day novels use this conceit, even though air conditioning became commonplace during the 1950s.\\""},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"All works of art are only as strong as their underlying structure. In this book the organizing theme is perhaps the most daunting question any of us will ever face: The book is built upon an examination of our universal confrontation with the impossibility of integrity, or moral wholeness, and whether our life remains worth living afterward.One character finds it is not. One becomes mad from her unknowing. One believes it doesn't matter, yet dies at the hand of another for whom nothing else matters, and who in turn dies for his belief.The protagonist and narrator, Jack Burden, is surely one of the most cynical of men, but his 650 page journey through darkness, false enlightenment, and eventually toward a dubious and paradoxical redemption, wet my face many times. Where does this effect come from? Not from the plotting (which is flawless, of course), or the magnificent and dazzling array of characters, and their epic tortures, or the stupefying command of literary craft, technique, and method the author displays, but from the sustained poetic narrative itself, every single word of which is perfectly calibrated to unlock one's deepest feelings, and to change one forever."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This was the book I most enjoyed reading in 2006.

I don't know why I waited so long to read it. It is high quality fiction, written in an era when important novels were taken seriously. There is an air of asseveration that pervades the work- it seems understood that this tract will not be taken lightly. I'll not provide a general review; rather, here are a few unexpected points of interest.The novel provides a good balance between action and mental reflection. Jack Burden, the prime political hatchet-man for Gov. Willie Stark, is the first person narrator. He has a good fix on what is happening to him, his friends and family. He can observe and articulate every gesture and nuance. He is his own psychiatrist. However, his ability to understand his condition also loses him respect in the reader's eyes. Burden does his job well, but his lack of heart and passion destroys his intimacy with the reader. The mayhem he unleashes hardly costs him a night's sleep. After it is revealed that he is complicit in patricide, I lost all respect for him. He held neither loyalty to his clan nor to an ideal. He was just a mercenary with a flair for reportage. From that point, the book was less enjoyable for me. I want my narrators to have at least one redeeming grace.I would have been pleased if the editor had culled 100 pages. The early relationship between Jack and Anne seems tedious, but perhaps in the 1940s it was hot stuff. I did enjoy the examination of Jack's Civil War ancestor- his perfidy is a harbinger of Jack's some 70 years later. I am curious as to how closely the novel tracks Gov. Long of Louisiana. It seems that Long was charged with improprieties that the fictional Judge Irwin shot himself over. I wish new editions would address the obvious similarities in a preface.The interrelationships between the characters is masterfully designed- it's Southern Gothic at its best. I don't think the most astute reader will predict all the subtilties. However, much of the prose is very mediocre- not what I'd expect from a poet. Of course, there are memorable paragraphs and scintillating lines. Here's one example from Gov. Stark on finding political dirt: \\"Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud. There is always something.\\""},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Within the confines of a bookstore one is often overwhelmed with the numerous topics and choices available to them. A solution to this problem, if a reader is interested in an engaging, magnificently written piece of literature, then take a few steps and find All The Kings Men by Robert Warren Penn.The theme is one of uncanny importance and relevancy to this stage in American lives despite the fact it was written in 1946. The story is told in the first person, the narrator is Jack Burden; a right hand man to the leading political figure in the story, the \\"Boss.\\" Interestingly, the \\"Boss\\" is based on the real life story of Huey \\"Kingfish\\" Long of Louisiana.The story encompasses Jack Burdens revival from a involuntary life, as well as the metamorphosis of Willie Stark's, the \\"Boss\\", idealistic political views to the lust for power and fame. Robert Warren Penn won a Pulitzer Prize for this book, and within the last few months I can not recall a book that would equal it in quality and purpose. Penn utilizes his characters to develop and provide insight on the issues of forgiveness, power, and corruption, and the consequences of leadership.Within a bookstore there are many choices, and many possibilities to choose from, but in the busy lives of the average person today why waste the time just pick up a copy of All the Kings Men by Robert Warren Penn today."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Completely American- this book has stood the test of time. A gregarious, larger than life and country boy politician and his loyal assistant set about conquering Louisianna politics and do so, but not without costs. As the politician, based on Louisianna's legendary Huey Long, Governor Talos outsizes himself so that his original principles no longer fit. They sink, with his marriage his temperance and his honesty. Incremental excesses, adulteries and ruthlessness devour him and his assistant, our narrator whose interests became the same as the governors whom he followed unquestionably. Each generation of readers can find similarities in this very American story with its matching story of their age. Many of the people who reviewed the novel before me wrote during the Clinton sex scandal and, in their outrage and sense of being manipulated could draw similarities with Warren's book. I read the book during the year anniversary of 9/11 and found the mythic themes and Eastern philosophical overtones outstanding. Southern writers who incorporate the heat and the light into their passages inevitably recall the landscapes of the ancients. Myths caution us that when humans live fully as products of the light, they will ultimately suffer. That was certainly the case in this group of characters. The themes of young idealism, success, excess and loss of soul are never out of touch with modern life. We find the most revered 'gentlemen' in this case the white male protestant old guard (Judge Irwin and Dr. Stanton) felled by their attachment to their position and protection of their class. Their respective descent into murder and adultery were the consequences of their inability to integrate the dark impulses into their addiction to the perfect glow of the light. Similarly the characters who were gifted with great beauty and physical superiority, a hero- athlete and an Olympian beauty did each fail to do the work of mortals and were equally doomed. One, the Governor's son, to a drunken and debauched death scene and the other, the narrator's mother, to solitude and lost youth. The indignities and normal sufferings that their bodies protected were merely delayed and undisciplined, they ultimately had nothing to do but fall.Politics is naturally a metaphor for so much of the conflict between good and evil in mankind. Jack, our narrator, was a traveller, also a lost child, one who attached himself to families in the absence of his own. He was not, as some have noted, a voice of honor or reason, he had an ambivalent moral code, but a developing one. He pursued his tasks with an indifference to cruelty, but not as a person who received pleasure in inflicting pain. He did retain loyalties, however, even toward his physically and emotionally repulsive father and the ancestors that propelled him to seek his legacy and ultimately his livelihood. Jack was a pilgrim and Governor Talos a sort of master, and in the end, the student outdistanced the teacher. All, at least in my own life space, quite mystical and mythic. It was also emotionally moving, not in a sentimental way, but in the way that we recognize so much of our own struggles and the fact that we are neither perfect nor complete, and unlikely to ever feel that sublime contentment.But most significantly, this is a good story that 'sounds' Southern and conveys in the smell of stale beer and smoke, isolation and back road honkey tonks-a photographic and gritty realism that works. That it offers even more for those who care to reflect- is a bonus- but you don't have to care a bit about that stuff to enjoy."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Born in Kentucky, Robert Penn Warren (1905-1989) had a long and prestigious literary career, his huge body of work including poetry, essays, textbooks, history and novels. &quot;All the King's Men&quot;, written in 1946, won a Pulitzer Prize and I can well understand why. First of all there are the words, lots of them, words that flow and caress and make liberal use of just the right tiny details to get to the essence the people he dscribes. Never have I seen such artful characterization and I found I was re-reading some of these descriptions just for the pure beauty of the way he used his words. And yet those words never got in the way of the story; they enhanced it. It is also a piece of history as the author brings alive the South of 1920s and 1930s.The story is about Willie Stark, man of humble origin who rose to power as a governor of an unnamed Southern state and is supposedly loosely based on the life of Huey Long, the Governor of Louisiana. But the main character is really Jack Burden, the narrator of the story. He's a reporter when he meets Willie Stark early in his career and is there as witness his political rise. Later, he works directly for Willie and becomes a key player in the blackmailing and political intrigue that surrounds the Governor. We come to know Jack through the people in his life as well as his own internal introspections and watch the swirl of events that grow in depth and complexity. Nothing is quite what it seems at first, and there are multiple sub-stories that unfold as the basic action of the book moves along. And then, just when I think I understand it all, there is yet another and another layer of depth and meaning. Everything has an effect on everything else. I found the book impossible to put down, thinking about it all the time, not only as it related to the story itself, but also how it applies to my own life.This is perhaps the best book I ever read and I can't heap enough praise on it. It is clearly a masterpiece and I give it my very highest recommendation. It's a present to yourself to read it. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Yes, this is a great novel, though I personally think the last three pages were a big mistake. But this review is about the \\"new, corrected edition\\" by Mr. Polk, which, I'm afraid, is a literary and scholarly travesty. Readers will be well advised to stick with the original 1946 text.; the fact that it has been a force in American life for over 50 years, and that in the 43 years before his death Warren never gave any indication he was dissatisfied with it, should be reason enough. (A cynic would argue that the only reason for the new edition was to extend the copyright.)Polk went back to Warren's original typescript draft to restore many of the passages, phrases, and stylistic features that were changed or deleted in the editorial process before publication (and approved by Warren); and he claims that his editorial decisions have created a superior novel. The first problem is that, except for a very sketchy 10-page essay, Polk gives the reader no help in judging for himself. A respectable scholarly edition would at the least indicate, at the bottom of each page or the back of the book, each instance in which the first edition text has been changed and where the change came from (the draft was edited by several hands, including Warren's). A reader who wants to assess Polk's work will have to have both editions in hand and scan page by page, and even then will not know whose decisions Polk has overruled. Thus Polk puts himself beyond criticism.Polk's essay tries to justify his decisions, but his illustrations are merely anecdotal and offer no consistent editorial principles or methodology. I haven't the space here to go through a critique point by point; suffice it to say, I'm not convinced by any of his examples, including the reversion from Willie Stark to Willie Talos. Polk seems to be one of those editors who believes that the closer you get to the author's very first words on paper, the better or the more authentic your version will be, since then you are closest to the \\"white heat of creativity.\\" But this is one of the silliest forms of romanticism still in existence. And I suspect it runs directly again Warren's own philosophy of history. Polk may think he has restored history, but in fact he has falsified it, for the history was the event of publication.Polk writes: \\"Many may feel that Warren's at least tacit approval of the [original] editors' changes-indeed, his gratitude for them-should argue against a new edition. But his \`approval' may have come from fatigue, from pressures of one sort or another, from the years of constant work on it. Indeed, his very closeness to the novel may have prevented him from exercising his own good judgment, and in any case this version indicates that he had written better than he knew.\\" Ah, but surely Mr. Polk knows? No, these are the lamest of speculations, for which there is no evidence, and the surest signs that Polk's fantasies are in danger of effacing Warren's work."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"It is extremely hard to sit down and write a review for any piece of classic literature for there is very little a reviewer can say that is new. Of course, for a book to be considered a classic most of its reviewers have to have had a favorable opinion of the work and all a new reviewer can do is concur or disagree. In this case, I couldn't possibly agree more with previous reviewers who have written rave reviews of this book.This is not so much the story of Willie Stark, who was Willie Talos in the original manuscript, as it the story of Jack Burden, the man telling the story. It really seems to be the story of a young man and his road to maturity. That young man is Jack Burden and Stark seems to be just a convenient focal point around which Warren weaves his story. The plot is very well laid out and flows very well from beginning to end, which is quite an accomplishment when one considers all of the subplots to be found in this book. As Burden tells his story he often wanders down memory lane, recalling events which his story has recalled. Each subplot builds to it's own climax while also building toward the climax of the main story and the reader is swept along like a barrel on the Niagara River. Just as the reader feels as if he can put the book aside for a while, another subplot begins to ascend through the story and the reader is again swept along unable to pause. I got so caught up in one of the subplots that I was late for a very important appointment. I just couldn't stop until I found out what happened.Stark is obviously supposed to resemble Louisiana Governor Huey Long and he very much does so. If one also reads T. Harry Williams biography of Long they will see just how strong the resemblance is. There are several morals and messages to be drawn from this story including thoughts on good and evil and past and future. In addition to the messages though, one has to admire the incredible amount of research Warren had to have done to write this book. Warren of course was alive and well during Huey Long's reign and that had to help him but in all events described his historical accuracy is uncanny. For example, one of the subplots involves Jefferson Davis in a minor way and even in delving in things well beyond his own memories Warren laces the story with many accurate details. In one passage, Warren relates that Davis missed the steamboat that was to carry him on the first leg of his trip to Montgomery to assume the Presidency of the new Confederacy. Warren points out that the boat left Davis Landing and then was halted out in the river while a smaller boat brought the new President out to get on board. A historical fact that would not be common knowledge but that is entirely accurate.Many people avoid books that are considered to be top-flight works of literature. These people often assume that such books must be dull and so philosophical that they are beyond the average reader. In some instances this may be the case but not with this book. Warren has turned out a masterpiece that is not only fun to read but is so enjoyable that the reader will hate to come to the end. There are messages to be found here, both obvious and subtle but do not worry about the messages. They will come through on their own as you sit back and enjoy the ride over the falls."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The one star is not really for the novel, but for this edition of it. If, like me, you have read this and are looking to purchase a copy, this has an attractive cover. However, it is not clear from the product description that this edition of the novel is in the form the author originally submitted to his editor, and not the edition originally published. Accordingly, Willie Stark is Willie Talos throughout this novel. Even though this may have been the author's original intention, I absolutely hate that it's a different edition from the novel I read and loved. I will be returning it and purchasing an older edition without this reversion."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Let's get this out of the way: having just finished this book, I feel confident in ascribing \\"All the King's Men\\" the status of one of my all-time favorite books. My words cannot begin to describe just how good it is, but I shall try...This book is primarily sold as a political novel. I think this is somewhat of an inaccurate pitch, because while Willie Stark is certainly a politician,and the book's real main character, Jack Burden, is one of stark's pundits, to limit ATKM to the political realm does it a disservice. This book is truly about so much more than politics. Sure, one of the main themes of this book is how politics are present in nearly every aspect of our lives, but this book is also about ideas, the ties that bind, the search for self, the human condition at its best and at its worst, the driving force of passion, and the intricacies of morality. It has romance, mystery, scandal, suicide, murder, and some fairly awesome speeches.Sound dense? It is. At nearly 700 pages, ATKM is a true epic, but not one word of it is superfluous. Warren deftly spins multiple storylines into an intricately tangled web. His prose is deceptively simple, the strong Southern voice of the narrator belying some of the stark truths. He selects and arranges his words so that you feel the full force of their meaning as it resonates within you. After reading this book, you will understand with fierce clarity how this book won the Pulitzer prizeThis book is a testament to what fiction should strive to be, for there is more truth in these lines than fantasy. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who wants the ultimate reading experience, and I daresay that this is one of those books that only improves upon re-reading. This book rocked my world, and I can only hope it does the same for you as well."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Calling anything &quot;the best&quot; is a dicey proposition, but in my opinion, this magnificent novel deserves the billing. I've read it more than a few times, and it has never failed to deliver an emotional punch, and Warren's poetic prose has never failed to lose its luster.On one level, of course, &quot;All the King's Men&quot; is a fictionalized account of the life of Huey Long, the machine politician who rose to state and national prominence as the iron-fisted governor of Louisiana, a man strong enough to seriously offer FDR a challenge in the '30s before his (Long's) assassination. As a hard-nosed political novel, &quot;All the King's Men&quot; delivers the goods. Warren's Willie Stark develops absolutely believably from a laughably naive idealist to a ruthless politician who has convinced himself that the political ends justify the brutal means.But beyond this, Warren's novel is a profound meditation on the limits of power and the nature of our understanding of the world. Its narrator, Jack Burden, is one of the most complex creations in American fiction, a man at once supremely self-assured and wracked by the most essential of doubts about himself. On the one hand, Jack, who becomes Willie's number-one assistant, is as hard edged a realist as his boss. On the other, he is a wounded romantic, lamenting a long-lost love and the disappearance of a world that offered the simple pleasures of boyhood and none of the ambiguities a complex world in which nothing -- politically, socially, or romantically -- is as it seems.Finally, the novel is a voyage of self-discovery for Jack, and in this, &quot;All the King's Men&quot; continues the great tradition in Western literature we trace back to Oedipus. The novel explores the fundamental theme of self-identity, as Sophocles did, and it succeeds brilliantly in creating a complex, multi-layered story that achieves its thematic goal.There is really no describing the richness of the experience you will find if you read this novel, but be forewarned that it is a novel that demands much. If you are willing to submit to the experience, Warren's great work will reward you many times over."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"All the King's Men is perhaps one of the best works of American fiction of the twentieth century. As an historical work, it gives us an incredible insight into the way Louisiana functioned under Huey &quot;the Kingfish&quot; Long. The story line is riveting, certainly, but the most remarkable thing about Penn Warren's book is the beauty of his writing. That might be why this work has become a classic: one doesn't need to be a political junkie to appreciate it.The other major work of fiction using Long as inspiration, Adria Locke Langley's A Lion is in the Streets, doesn't even come close to the greatness of All the King's Men. Anyone who read (or thought about reading) Joe Klein's Primary Colors should read Penn Warren's book to see what a quality &quot;novel of politics&quot; is like.To be honest, I was surprised to note the number of negative reviews of this book on Amazon. Fair is fair, and everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion, but how a mature reader of fiction could not enjoy this book totally escapes me."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Like a few other reviewers here, All the King's Men is my favority work of fiction ever. I first read it two years ago, and re-read it last month. I can't say whether I liked Robert Penn Warren's style or themes more - they both appealed to me. More on that in a second, however. I just want to say that, even after I finished it the second time, I kept on returning to the novel just to read select pages. This book alone accounts for three or four of my ten favorite passages.Now, everyone seems to enjoy the style of the book. It's hard not to. But the themes of All the King's Men are equally poignant. Jack Burden, the main character, deals with lost love, disgust at the life he's led and still leading, and disillusionment with modern society. Willie Stark, the demagogic governor, presents themes regarding the nature of power - is it possible to attain power and still remain moral? Can morality survive as a means, or can man only try to, as Stark says, \\"make the good from the bad?\\" Is it necessary to pander to corruption to achieve good? Penn Warren not only presents all these questions, but knows how to argue them as well. This is rare for an author - many only fancy themselves stylists, not philosophers. Penn Warren is both.I could write for days on the style of All the King's Men. Suffice it to say it's wonderful. A touch of nostalgia, a whiff of fatalism, a little cynicism here and there...since the novel is written in the first person, the writing provides the best way to get to know the narrator, Jack Burden. Because of the strength of the writing of All the King's Men, Jack Burden may be one of the most detailed and complex characters in all of american literature.I can not state this any more clearly; All the King's Men is my favorite work of fiction ever. If you haven't read it, please, please do."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The release of the new movie (disappointing) drove me back to the book, which I probably read thirty years ago. The book was a revelation. It's astonishingly good - a great American novel - but not for the reasons I remembered. If asked, most people would say All the King's Men is about the rise and fall of Willie Stark, a country lawyer who becomes the near-dictatorial governor of a poor southern state. Willie's story is based fairly closely on the life of Huey Long, the populist governor of Louisiana during the Depression. Willie is certainly a central character in the story. In fact, his attempts to bring economic justice to the poor people of his state through the imperfect vehicle of a corrupt legislature have led many critics to call All the King's Men the best novel ever written about American politics.But Willie's career is chronicled by Jack Burden, and ultimately this is not Willie's story, it's Jack's. Born into privilege, Jack rejects his upper-class background and goes to work for Willie because he believes Willie is trying to do good for the people who have been kept down by Jack's ancestors and childhood associates. Jack accepts that the means to Willie's ends aren't always pretty or pure. As Willie's right hand man, Jack spends a lot of time digging up the dirt that Willie uses to bury his political opponents. During the course of the novel, some of this dirt spatters on Jack in direct and very painful ways.What make the novel astonishing are the workings of Jack's consciousness and the prose that Warren uses to describe that consciousness. Jack is a classic American type, the cynical idealist. Jack thinks he can remove himself from his own history, only to find himself lacking the optimism and conviction he needs to fully inhabit the present. The real struggle in the novel is not Willie's attempt to soar above gutter politics, but Jack's effort to know and accept his own heart.Jack is both a romantic and a wise guy, and Warren's supple vernacular captures the full range of his expression, from soaring perorations on the moral confusion of Southern history to crude jibes at hack politicos. Jack's insights about the haphazard constructs we assemble into a self are forward looking for 1940s when this novel was written, and give this Depression era story a curiously postmodern feel. Beyond the tragic and almost gothic machinations of its plot, this novel reveals some fundamental truths about the American character. Americans are a strange blend of idealism and cynical opportunism. We're born to believe we can flee our past, right up to the point we run out of land and run out of excuses. It's only when Jack turns around and retraces his steps that he finds what he needs to go forward."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The New York Times blurb &quot;The Definitive Novel About American Politics&quot; on the cover of &quot;All the King's Men&quot; is somewhat misleading. This novel is only barely about political process and instead focuses on the quest of a man to uncover the past and how his discoveries lead to the undoing of a state of grace.The man (and narrator) is Jack Burden, who starts out as a local newspaper reporter in a thinly disguised Louisiana. A young, temperate, idealistic county treasurer named Willie Stark comes to Burden's attention during a minor scandal. Stark refuses to give in to a kickback scheme involving a contract for a schoolhouse construction project and is promptly ousted from his position. Burden's reporting of Stark's honesty starts Stark on a path toward a political career. After years of developing himself as an orator and demagogue, Stark becomes Governor and hires Burden to be a sort of right-hand man in his administration.During his political rise, Stark transforms from a naive idealist into a cynical imperialist, as his relationships to his wife and son grow distant. He is the manipulative type of man who will slap a friend reassuringly on the shoulder while browbeating and intimidating members of his administration (the &quot;king's men&quot;), such as making them write resignation letters that he personally will date when he wants to get rid of them. Especially symbolic is the possum incident at the end of Chapter 1: The Willie Stark political machine crushes anything that gets under its wheels.Stark commands Burden, who is a former history student with experience in research, to dig up dirt on a political dissenter who happens to be one of Burden's lifelong friends. In doing so, Burden uncovers a revelation that shatters not only his own life but the lives of several people close to him. The novel ends with the weight of a Shakespearean tragedy, where the line of responsibility weaves directly and indirectly through several major characters.Robert Penn Warren writes in a style that alternates between straight hard dialogue and poetic philosophical musings. It's not easy to see where the novel is going after reading only the first couple of chapters; Warren takes his time unfolding the story to allow the reader to develop a genuine interest in the characters and appreciate the wealth of ideas presented."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Excuse me, reader from St. Louis, but i find it very rude of you to adress my best friend, tina, as being stupid.

Penn Warren's writing is superb, his command of the English language perfect, and his use of images simply fabulous. However, the book fails to strike me as anything. After reading it I don't feel as though I have, for a time, entered a different world and learned something in that world. In short, this book is bland, repetitive, unnecessary fiction that fails to impress the reader on any level other than its use of language. At first, I didn't want to admit this, and went back and read the book again; each time I found myself falling asleep every 30 pages. Many would say &quot;Oh, well you must like escapist fiction, and this is why you cannot appreciate this book,&quot; however, this is hardly the case. If you want to read a great novel that is deep, equally well written (if not more so), keeps the reader's interest, and is written in a simlar &quot;stream-of-consciousness&quot; narration style, go buy yourself Ulysses by James Joyce.

It was not until about five chapters into this novel that I actually cared if they lived or died, but by the end I did not have to make myself read it. (instead I was trying to make 26 hours in a 24 hour day- my schedule is... rough) Still, I'm glad I read it. It's a good book for class disscussions, but I would only recommend it for the upper honors or gifted classes. Most high school students would read it and instead of seeing the philosophical meanings, they would get bored at what they perceive to be meaningless ramblings. There is a lot of philosophy in this book; not all of it is correct (in fact there are only a handful of philosopies in the first eight chapters that I could not easily disprove, but I enjoyed reading the stuff at the end, it was correct, and it often told why the previous chapter's thinking was wrong.) It does not have the descriptions like 'A Tree Grows In Brooklyn' or the lovable charactors that most of my favorite books have, but it is a great serious book. If you have extra time, I would recommend it. If you are having to read it, do not harden your heart towards the charactors too soon. They do get better."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I thought this book could have been alot better. I think he rambled on too much in the beginning.

The teacher felt she owed it to us. I can respect that this has social significance, it was well written, etc. I don't agree with the girls that it was &quot;just plain terrible&quot; but I do think that it was more than a little flawed. While reading it, I had trouble deciding whether I liked it, but finally decided it had not been worth the time. Ever get the feeling that a book was simply too cute? This book's series of contrived coincidences annoyed the bejezus out of me. Let me reel them off: Jack's father figure Judge Irwin becomes an enemy of the Boss, so the Boss says find dirt on him, which he does thanks to a childhood friend of his, who he loves. (She later has an affair with the Boss.) He finds the dirt, the Judge kills himself, he finds out the Judge was his real father. The dirt also implicated his friend's father, who like the Boss, was also the governor. The Boss is killed by that governor's son, who had found out about the affair and assumed he'd gotten his job because of that (it was actually basically unrelated.) It makes me want to vomit, I can tell you. How can any writer be considered great when he tries to pass this soap opera stuff off as literature? Get rid of the absurd coincidences and it's a good book...maybe, but as it is I just felt insulted. Don't waste your time (I just gave away the plot anyway.)"},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The first time I opened this book, the cover broke off. I was very displeased. It was very brittle. I do not like reading a book without the cover. Disappointed."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I found this book way too long and drawn out. Jack Burden, the narrator spent way too much time describing things. I never did get caught up in the book. I only finished it for a class. If you start reading this book and do not like the narration style, put it down. Jack Burden narrates the same way the whole time through. Not liking politics also makes it very hard to find the good things people say there are in this book."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"All the King's Men is a very thick book. I've been looking at for about a week now, but haven't had the motivation to conquer it. I'm in a bit of a pickle too, being that our Southern Literature exam is tommorow. I did read the Invisible Man by another fine Southern writer, and boy was that a good book. Well for what it's worth I'd like to say that I'm sorry for not reading the book."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This had to be the most boring book I have read in my entire life! We had to read it for school, and a majority of the class ended up just reading the cliff's notes. I do not recommend this book to anyone, except to this one pig-like girl I know. Anyway, I never want to see this book ever again. I'm going to have nightmares about it! A warning to all: Never read this book unless you have to!"},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I feel like a cheerleader: was this book great or what? I was just awed by it, great characters, both flawed and glorious, great story line, great setting, really great writing (it was awesomely devastating to read, time after time, sentences that I could never craft to be their equal in power and economy), and great theme (pick one that's most relevant for you, they fairly ooze off the pages). For me, the pertinent theme was what Jack's ancestor discovered: that you can't step on the fine spider web of existence without shaking everyone else's footing. If absolute power corrupts absolutely, it doesn't just affect the Willie Starks of the world, it affects us all. I love it because with this book Penn says: Here is where we are in American culture, and I don't have any answers. That's for all of you to figure out. I love his teaching that isn't undercut by what could have been a lot of ineffectual preaching."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I read this book initially during my junior year of high school, and I believe that it was the first (and perhaps only) literary work to instantly change my entire outlook on life. While the first chapter seems tedious, as so many reviewers have commented, I think that this shows the readers' inability to immediately access and appreciate Warren's distinctive prose, rather than a flaw in the writing. As I read on and became more involved in the characters, I realized how Jack Burden's rambling observations on human existence held even greater importance than the politically-charged plotline. Warren perfectly captures the mortal struggle to find meaning and order in the vast chaos of reality. This is the kind of novel best read slowly and carefully, so as to digest its themes and elegant style with the thoroughness they deserve."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This book started off slow, but you have to stick in there in order to get up to speed, just like taking off in a sport's car. By the time I was less than half-way through, I did not want to put it down! Jack Burden follows the political career of Willie Stark from start to finish, and in doing so surprises the reader at every turn. Almost a dictator, Willie rose from essentially nothing to essentially everything in a matter of years, possessing strength and power only known to those who can manipulate and have people completely under their control at the mention of a threat. The novel explores two arenas of life: political and philosophical. Jack Burden is the narrator, and since most of the book is his story as much as it is Willie's, he has a lot to say on life, and makes some great points throughout the novel. Politically, the book explores the dimensions and evils of the political scene and the thirst for power among political leaders. One of the main issues to be brought up (in the mind of the reader) is: does power corrupt? Willie's story does a good deal in explaining that question. The reader himself shall decide in the end. Though at times Jack Burden's descriptions were too drawn out, the book as a whole is a masterpiece. Recommended for all, especially those interested in politics. If one is not interested in politics, they will be by the end of the book (myself included). The book is exciting in its action and detail of events, enlightening in areas of philosophy, yet horrifying in the aspect that anyone can rise to political power and virtually become a dictator within a democratic society. The title of the book seems to echo the words of an ancient nursery rhyme, Humpty-Dumpty. Change the name to Willie Stark, pack more &quot;men&quot; into the story-line, and you have a modern-day example of the strength, yet fragility, of political power. A great novel."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is definately one of the most underrated books of all time. Many will believe that this book is about politics, but it is about life. Robert Penn Warren creates Jack Burden, a character who is more like a spectator then one who actually lives life. The writing style is wonderful, and some of the lines in this novel are extremely well written and created. I highly recommend this book to anyone who can survive the first chapter, it is definately worth it. Many themes can also be drawn from this book, a book that you will be thinking about long after you have finsihed."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Penn Warren was a poet laureate, and word is that it took him 10 years to write this book because he treated each line like a line of poetry. I have read the book three times now, and it is the type of work where I feel I will keep gleaning more wisdom from it as time goes on. Whenever I am feeling overwhelmed and scared about the direction my life might be going in, I re-read passages that somehow capture what is essential about the passage of life through time."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"&quot;All the Kings Men&quot; is not about politics.There. I've said it. This book is about love, and personal connection, and truth, but not politics.This book is about Jack Burden, not Willy Stark.This book is genius - but this book is not about politics."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"To be honest, I originally had a tough time getting into this book. The first 100 pages were a bit confusing because I couldn't tell where the story was headed. However, I kept on reading and I'm glad I did. By the time I neared the end, I had to stay up until 2am to finish the book. The many subplots throughout the story unfolded in such a subtle way that I didn't realize until later that they were all building up to a beautiful, interwoven, complex, story of how people and the passage of time come together to create history and all of its truthful glory. This book is worth the read."},{"Title":"All the King's Men (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Emerson said of Plato's Republic, it is more than a book it is a world. This is also true of Penn Warren's classic political novel. But the political story of the rise and fall of the demagouge Willie Stark is just a veneer for the real story. The real story is the struggle of Jack Burden, the cynical and emotionally reclusive narrator, to understand himself and his role in the chaotic world that surrounds him. This book is a probing reflection into the soul on par with Miller's \\"Death of a Salesman.\\" The movie starring Jude Law and Sean Penn did not do it any kind of justice.
