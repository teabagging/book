Students want to feel like we matter to our teachers, and professors Blitz and Hurlbert definitely are two teachers who care about students, even students who are not always the best of people.

The high praise seemed excessive...until I actually read the book. I was taken by the artfulness with which these authors render such emotional subject matter without a trace of the maudlin. They ask poignant questions, and elicit equally poignant responses from their students. This book doesn't simply offer profound insights into the nature of teaching writing, it also provides a remarkably workable plan for a large-scale assignment that students evidently appreciate deeply. I have put this book on my required-reading list for my graduate students. It should be required reading for anyone who teaches, and for anyone who believes the college writing class is a place of tranquil reflection. In fact, as Blitz and Hurlbert show, the writing class ought to be the locus of incredible discovery, sometimes painful, sometimes joyous, but always real.

I can only say you would have to read this book to understand. Michael and C. Mark write letters to each other, to their children, to themselves, too, I think.

It reads like a novel or a strange journal about real people who have gone through some unbelievable experiences. And what makes it more gripping is that these two authors are completely up-front about their experiences as teachers of kids who have lived through incredible violence. Michael Blitz and C.

In fact, Byron is one of the most popular examples of the \\"mad genius\\" myth, although there is considerable doubt as to how much of his extravagant behavior was motivated by his supposed \\"illness,\\" and how much he deliberately cultivated as part of his stormy Romantic image.When a biographer has an agenda, it's amazing how many things fit in. It's like giving a hammer to a small boy: everything will need hammering. But the \\"psychological autopsy\\" is nowhere as amusing, since -- even in our so-called \\"enlightened\\" age -- retroactive labeling of long-dead people creates unnecessary stigma, as well as the false impression that their creativity is propelled by mental \\"illness.\\"Fortunately, the drawbacks of this practice are finally coming to light. It can be difficult enough to diagnose someone in real time who's sitting in front of you, particularly when you have to use those wobbly DSM criteria for mood disorders, but doing a clinical evaluation of a deceased poet (or composer, artist, etc.) based on speculation, gossip, and calculated self-exaggeration is just irresponsible. And unnecessary. Worst of all, it adds nothing to our understanding of bipolar disorder, and diminishes the accomplishments of genius.(I explain all this in my forthcoming book, but amazon says I can't tell you about it.) ;->"},{"Title":"Byron: The Flawed Angel","review":"This mean-spirited biography does nothing to help a reader gain insight into this remarkable English poet. The author leaves great gaps in her examination of Byron's life and what she does relate (i.e., about his illfated marriage) is biased and gives absolutely no sense of the personalities involved or a sense of regency England. Her reaction to Byron is hostile throughout (without being at the same time incisive), making me wonder why she decided to write about him in the first place. Give this one a pass and look for Leslie Marchand's biography which ranks among the finest or read Byron's complete correspondence which gives one a direct view into his personality."},{"Title":"Byron: The Flawed Angel","review":"Phyllis Grosskurth writes of Byron with an air of affected authority. After psycho-analysing him, she concludes that he is text book bi-polar.Armed with this assumption she storms through the book validating this \\"amazing\\" insight at every opportunity. That is all very well and she does have a point. Where this biography really falls short however is in her dismissal of two major players in the Byron story; his mother who was a complex creature is dismissed as \\"a rather silly woman\\" and most lamentably Thomas Moore who was Byron's idol as a young man and his best friend as an adult is described by Grosskurth as \\"a rather endearing little snob\\"( this is about all we hear about one of the most important figures in Byron's life.) Jeffrey W. Vail's excellent \\"The literary relationship of Lord Byron and Thomas Moore\\" and Fiona Macarthy's astute \\"Byron Life and Legend\\" consign Ms Grosskurth's work into the lesser rank of gossipy pot boiler type bio's where it belongs.

Born with a club foot, he was flawed emotionally as well as physically. He constantly ran from his demons as he sought the life of gentry. In a cartoon by Caroline Lamb, he is pictured as a fairy.Constantly in debt, he kept on the move from his creditors, to Greece, Italy, France, Spain and Portugal. He made enemies along the way due to his superlous nature. At the age of 27, he married Annabelle Milbanke in 1815. He flighted through this brief marriage, which produced a child, Allegra, who was raised by a wealthy Englishwoman living in Vienna. She couldn't articulate the letter \\"r\\" at all (in Knoxville, we had trouble with \\"L\\", not just me but Bob Lobertini, a local t.v. personality, too).His best known literary work, \\"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage\\" was published in 1812. A couple of years later, he finished \\"Don Juan.\\" He had many affairs of heart, male and female, normal for the age and society he moved in. In 1824, he had a horrible death as related in Chapter 32 of this book.

Originally written in 1931, the book depicts the declining country house society and its ways of life, post World War I, within a clever mystery. Sir Gervase Chevenix-Gore, owner of a sizeable estate, has written to famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, demanding that he come to England to meet with him.Before Poirot arrives, Sir Gervaise is discovered dead, shot in the head, a gun by his hand, and a letter saying \\"Sorry\\" on his desk, an apparent suicide. The study and windows are locked from the inside. Numerous relatives, guests, and employees of Sir Gervase are in attendance throughout the weekend, including his ditsy wife, one of his friends (who has always been openly in love with his wife), his adopted daughter, his nephew (the person who will inherit his title) and his girlfriend, a woman hired to write a biography of the family, the estate manager, a private secretary, etc.As they relate their whereabouts at the time that the shot or champagne cork or car backfire was heard, the immense size and configuration of the estate become clear, and as Poirot investigates the suicide that he is convinced is murder, the listener is struck by the arrogance of Sir Gervase and the expectations of the guests. None have much conception of the outside world, and several have motives for murder. As always, Christie drops small clues, leading the reader to form conclusions about who did what to whom, then springs a surprise ending.Hugh Fraser does yeoman's service playing all the voices on this recording without overacting, reflecting subtle class differences and personalities in the process. His French accent for Poirot is controlled, and his diction is superb. The audio moves quickly, making this a fine, light entertainment. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Dead Man's Mirror","review":"This book follows the same old Agatha Christie/Hercule Poirot formula.

Fortunately, shortly before the fatal shot was fired, the dead man had the foresight to invite Hercule Poirot for a visit. Thank goodness he is there to unravel things, as only he can!

Sir Gervase thinks that someone is trying to defraud him. Despite the fact that Poirot takes orders from no man, he still decides to go and see what the case is all about.He arrives just before dinner, but he arrives only to find his host dead. Sir Gervase is found in a locked room with a bullet hole in his head. The local police are quick to draw the conclusion that it was suicide, but Poirot is not convinced. After all, Sir Gervase has just wired for Poirot to come. Surely, he wouldn't do that and then kill himself. Is Poirot right? And how can a shattered mirror provide a clue?This is an audio version of a short story originally published in MURDER IN THE MEWS. It's around two and a half hours long, but very enjoyable. The first two thirds or so are pretty much interviewing the suspects, and each one seemed guilty to me. Yet Poirot manages to bring everything to a logical solution by the end. And, while I did guess a couple of things, the complete solution was a surprise. The biggest problem with the story is the cast of characters. I had a hard time keeping a few of them straight, even by the end.Hugh Fraser, who played Captain Hastings for A&E;'s Poirot TV shows, narrates the story.

The relationship between African Americans and Native Americans has been, from the time of forced removal, through the Civil War, reconstruction, land runs, statehood, oil discovery, miscegenation laws, civil rights, and subsequent history leading to the recent \\"vote,\\" very complex indeed."},{"Title":"Red over Black: Black Slavery Among the Cherokee Indians (Contributions in Afro-American and African Studies)","review":"Although written from a non-Native perspective, I found this book to be perceptive, objective, and extremely useful in understanding Cherokee slavery of African peoples in the 18th and 19th centuries. Halliburton points out that chattel slavery is not traditional to Cherokees and brings forward the range of viewpoints and perspectives in his well researched book. He also includes excerpts from the WPA Slave Narratives -- these firsthand remembrances are invaluable and put a human face to a charged, politicized subject."},{"Title":"Red over Black: Black Slavery Among the Cherokee Indians (Contributions in Afro-American and African Studies)","review":"According to Halliburton, Cherokees had black slaves and did not treat them better than white masters would have. They discouraged interracial unions and would not allow part-black Cherokees to become tribal members. They did not have a pronounced abolitionist movement like whites had. They did not promote person-of-color unity; they clearly saw blacks as inferior. Further, whereas modern whites may be ashamed of their slaveowning ancestors, modern Cherokees are not. If the truth is the truth, I may have to let my P.C. assumptions go. Still, there are many things that make me skeptical about this book.Unlike other historians who write, \\"This is the general trend and here is an example of it.\\" Halliburton will give an example of Cherokee oppression of blacks and imply that the entire Cherokee Nation must have acted in the same way. I've forgotten the difference between inductive logic and deductive logic, but this author seems to use the method that modern Westerners have rejected. He brutally minimizes the impact of the Trail of Tears; you would think the Cherokees just wanted to have a fun adventure and wanted to come to census on moving, rather than being forced out by the very racist President Andrew Jackson and his administration. He points to many wealthy, male Cherokees slaveowners; did poor or female Cherokees feel differently about slavery? Halliburton cites numerous Cherokee laws against Cherokee-black miscegenation. However, white states had those same laws and it didn't stop white men from fathering children with black slave women. Why does Halliburton say nothing about sexual liaisons that must have gone on between Cherokee slaveowners and black female slaves?Please remember that Halliburton is a black professor. He is writing for a black book series. His book is written in the 1970s, during the height of the Black Power Movement. He teaches in the Southwest. Was his purpose to say that black are more oppressed than the many Native Americans in the region where he lives? Was this book meant to ensure that blacks get the same or more benefits than what tribal members would receive in Southwestern colleges? Some legal thinkers assert that it's bad to play \\"the oppression sweepstakes\\" in which group X tries to maintain that they suffered more than group Y. Halliburton seems to not care about that concern.The Cherokees were known for accepting white culture much more easily than other tribes. Couldn't having slaves be just one more example of that? Halliburton says little on how whites encouraged Natives and blacks to distrust each other. Maybe that is what is playing out here. If Halliburton is correct, than why do so many African Americans (myself included) claim to have Native American blood? Why did Katz's \\"Black Indians\\" book sell so well? Why do people of many races want black-red unity to exist? How is Halliburton's book helpful to modern projects to encourage black-red unity? Who benefits from his research and absolutist descriptions?This book frustrates me so badly, even as I try to keep an open mind toward what the author is saying."},{"Title":"The Fashion System","review":"I love fashion theory writings. I really do. And i know this is a seminal text in fashion theory. But man, oh man, is it a doozy! I'd give this book a 5 for the concepts, but a 1 for the ease of understanding. It is really hard to plough through - it is translated from French so features some tortuous sentence structure, and feels like the writings of a guy who really loves to read his own work; the higher the word count the better. I feel that it is work like this that leads people to view academic writing as necessarily dry, dense, verbose and pretentious, when there are amazing theory writers out there who are accessible and interesting to read.OK, admittedly a lot of this style is because of the era in which it was written; maybe a little because of the gender of its writer, and a lot because of the complexity and originality of the ideas Barthe is illuminating. But I would strongly recommend leaving this book until graduate level. Undergrads are better off with any of the contemporary writers in fashion theory, gender or cultural studies who have addressed Barthe's ideas in simple language.EDIT 9/17/2011 I've been meaning to update this review for a while now. Originally I gave this book 3 stars, however I was wrong. This is a 5-star book. All my criticisms in my original review really do nothing more than point out my own shortcomings in understanding it, and I'm sure that many people realised this when reading my review, and either forgave me for my ignorance, or thought \\"pfft, what an idiot\\". Fair enough. No, Barthes doesn't love his own work: he's enjoying the play of the text and letting us enjoy it too (hence the sentence structure). Yes, understanding Barthes fully can take time: totally worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Fashion System","review":"For anyone interested in fashion (the real essence of fashion) you need to get this book. Being that I am a designer, I am using this book to fully understand the superficial meaning of clothing and fashion. I feel it is very good for people to understand not only what (art of fashion is) but also to understand how others perceive this (art)...This book does this very well. If you don't LOVE fashion and everything about it (ever the psychology of fashion) ...I don't recommend this book.Barthes is the first (ever published) to really look at fashion with a semiotic approach."},{"Title":"The Fashion System","review":"For any reader who has had a father that read *Playboy* &quot;for the articles,&quot; even Barthes' highly analytical approach to the relation between image and text--which he insists *produces* Fashion or &quot;real clothing&quot;--can be funny. I.e., reading in translation the American reader may not identify so much with the eccentricities of Barthes' style so much as his choice of subject. Barthes' work remains entirely relevant, even though the book was published in 1967--the decade where fashion models withered, along with any grand sense of ethics on the part of commercial artists, clothing designers, and filmmakers, down to nothing. Perhaps Barthes would say this Nothing was a *commentary.* Perhaps not. But certain details of Barthes' analysis hold very interesting still: for example, the fact that Barthes refers to the way the &quot;written-garment&quot; in a layout calls attention to specific portions of the &quot;image-garment&quot; as &quot;amputations&quot; (15).For the reader, it's important to place the book into some sort of context, as Context is Barthes' entire position when he insists that in relation to popular imagery, text &quot;arrests the level of reading at its fabric, at its belt, at the accessory which adorns it&quot; (13). Barthes' idea that the language used by magazine writers does not comment upon but rather *creates* Fashion arouses some questions about certain social centerpieces in, for example, popular (once &quot;folk&quot;) music: Janis Joplin to Madonna to Britney Spears. While Barthes clear interest is a structuralized definition of Fashion, not women, studying Barthes' book may help us understand at a more analytical level just what these women &quot;mean&quot; as they are mediated through imagery and arrested by their respective (worn and written) articles. Barthes is crucial for anybody who has ever noticed that, compared to that which accompanied artists of Joplin's caliber , the accompanying texts of contemporary magazines read, more often than not, like a report of Time Temperature and Date.Furthermore, the book certainly becomes enjoyable for the more fantastic-minded who could envision a day when fashion magazines no longer have to rely on flamboyant nudity, tasteful or otherwise, or suggestive postures, but wherein nudity and erotic positions are implied in a truly Barthean, truly erotic manner: by the fact that all text has been stripped bare. After all, even in a picture-mag where there is no writing, there is still, if one reads Barthes, *writing*. This reviewer would imagine that in Barthes' eyes, the old fashioned critique of the ironic incongruities between the image and the text of other vestments of fashion (such as shampoo commercials whose orgiastic imagery and sounds have nothing to do with the actual product) could be easily solved by one magazine, of any kind, that had no writing at all but consisted entirely of centerfolds."},{"Title":"General William S. Harney: Prince of Dragoons","review":"This is an outstanding book that is both well-researched and clearly written. It is badly needed and therefore most welcome for students of the pre-Civil war army and its frontier campaigns. When the Civil War erupted, Brig. Gen. Harney was the nation's third most senior general, behind only Winfield Scott and John E. Wool. He was also the country's most accomplished Indian fighter. Yet he has been forgotten along with Gens. David E. Twiggs and E.V. Sumner. Rollie Adams has rescued Harney from oblivion and in the process sheds light on the behavior of the antebellum army's officer corps as well as on the extraordinary unit -- the Second Regiment of U.S. Dragoons, later redesignated the Second Cavalry -- that Harney led as lieut. col. and col. during 1836-58. Rollie Adams is a realist, and so he brings to the reader's attention not only his subject's long suits (valor, strategic thinking, organizational skills, and innovation) but also the warts (impulsiveness, financial irresponsibility, lack of tact and diplomacy, and a persistent streak of brutality). With respect to the short suits, the army court-martialed Harney four times and a civil court near St. Louis tried him a fifth time for bludgeoning a female slave to death. This was a leader who was a very mixed bag in the sense of a complex (and at times unattractive) psyche and command style. That Harney could overcome these short suits to rise as rapidly as he did is a direct reflection of the pre-Civil War army's willingness to overlook a hopelessly contentious, brutal personality because of its needs for his skills and talents. In a sense, Harney was an officer deeply affected by his long-time mentor, Twiggs, and he in turn impacted the contentious behavior of argumentative officers like his subordinate, Philip St.George Cooke. Small wonder that at one point Harney even went so far as to prefer charges against Gen. Scott for executing the sentence of one of the courts-martial that had convicted Harney! For Harney it all came crashing down with his role in the so-called &quot;Pig War&quot; of 1859 -- a clash in the Pacific Northwest in which he singlehandedly almost brought on an armed clash between the U.S. and U.K. in a border dispute -- and then finally because of his mishandling of the political situation in volatile Missouri at the beginning of the Civil War. This book is not only well-written, it is well made -- printed on highly quality paper with a handsome type design and with page headings/numbers displayed at the bottom of each page in such a way as to minimize reader distractions as happens with conventional layouts. I recommend Rollie Adams' book most highly. It ought to be read in tandem with the recent re-issue of Rodenbough's classic &quot;From Everglade to Canyon with the Second Cavalry&quot; and Durwood Ball's new book &quot;Army Regulars on the Western Frontier, 1848-1861.&quot;"},{"Title":"General William S. Harney: Prince of Dragoons","review":"GENERAL WILLIAM S. HARNEY: PRINCE OF DRAGOONS, is the first full-length biography of this important American warrior since 1878. George Rollie Adams has combined his skills as an eminent historian and gripping story-teller to bring to print the complete narrative of one of the country's most important, yet relatively forgotten, military leaders. Raised on the Tennessee frontier, General William Selby Harney patterned many of his traits after his neighbor, Andrew Jackson, and like &quot;Old Hickory,&quot; often drew criticism from his West Point-trained associates. Yet, when he died in 1889, Harney's military career had spanned seven decades, and he had participated in every one of his country's major wars and military conflicts beginning in 1818. This is an outstanding biography--one that shows the author's years of dedication and research into the life and times of this very important American figure. This book should be nominated for the Pulitzer in biography."},{"Title":"General William S. Harney: Prince of Dragoons","review":"I was impressed with Rollie Adams' Harney biography. It's trite to say that this biography &quot;reads like a novel&quot; and that &quot;I just couldn't put it down,&quot; but those cliches are certainly true here. I bought this book intending to dip into it for those parts that would help me with a book I'm writing myself, but the introduction hooked me. I read the entire book through, rereading parts of it in my attempt to understand Harney. Mr. Adams must have had fun researching and writing Prince of Dragoons! He certainly made a larger than life historical figure come alive for me. His search for primary sources for this biography are exhaustive and his interpretations of them perceptive. I recommend this well-written, well-edited book to anyone interested in 19th century military history and to anyone just wanting a &quot;really good read.&quot;"},{"Title":"General William S.

Harney: Prince of Dragoons","review":"In reading a book called The Irish Soldiers of Mexico,(by Michael Hogan) I discovered that William Selby Harney was a cruel, savage, and despicable man. Why anyone would be interested in reading about this piece of sh** man is confusing to me.During the wars against Native Americans, this criminal had a notorious penchant for brutality and cruelty.He presided over the hangings of the St. Patrick's Battalion that defended Mexico from imperialist U.S. invasion in 1847.He had been accused of rape and murder of innocent Native American women and was indicted by a civilian court for thebrutal beating of a female slave which resulted in her death.He avoided prosecution by jumping bond and escaping from the city where this occured. Legally, he was a fugitive from justiceduring the entire war against Mexico in 1847.Record show that Harney was a reckless, insubordinate and arrogant officer who was also an indicted murdered, an alleged rapist, and a fugitive from justice.(According to The Irish Soldiers book.)I wouldn't waste my time reading about this s.o.b criminal.George K.

Gunrunner Francis Hagarty comes to town and excites Sylvie with his passion. Gowry discovers a cache of guns hidden in the shamrock, but though angry is not sure what to do about it. Even worse his wife is having an affair with the smuggler of the weapons.Unable to cope with his life's collapse, Gowry joins the fight on the continent. However, trench warfare in France is not an improvement. On the other hand back in Ireland, Sylvie is trapped in the Easter Uprising. In their separate hellholes, both know it will prove impossible to return to the lackluster life they once shared.SHAMROCK GREEN is an engaging historical novel that brings to life the turmoil of a world gone mad. Though the book starts extremely slow setting up the key characters and the background, once in gear it shifts into a lively period piece. Fans of World war I dramas will appreciate this deep look at the times. One should watch the PBS video The Twentieth Century as the one on this era is frightening, fascinating and unforgettable.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Java Database Programming","review":"Is this a Java database programming book or just a plain database programming book? I could not quite catch the difference. There is almost nothing in this book other than endless listing of source code (about 80%???).Certainly, I can find a better JDBC book than this one."},{"Title":"Java Database Programming","review":"Jepson understands the topics of JDBC very well. It might be interesting for the one or the other to see how you can develop your own JDBC-driver as well as a little database. If you are looking for a tutorial how to build database-applications this book is the wrong choice."},{"Title":"Java Database Programming","review":"First of all, I was not troubled by the writing style or any of the other things some of the previous reviews mentioned. For those of you who complained about the amount of source code in the book, I would just say that while the book is largely source, it is there for a reason. It would be really hard to explain the book if the code were not there. I suppose he could have asked us all to download the code, but I would have been *less* likely to buy the book if I knew I had to print everything out myself. (And yes, when I am learning, I like to see the code written out on paper - I don't like taking my laptop in the car to read, but I do enjoy the portability of a book. But I suppose that's a whole other debate.)Anyway.... this is a great book for learning how to write your own DB. I have been meaning to write this review for a long time. I have checked this book out of my local university library at least 3 times, and I finally am going to bite the bullet and just buy the thing! No more worries if it will be stolen or &quot;lost&quot; by another student.There are a lot of books out there that will show you how to code SQL and how to work with drivers. This is one of the few books that shows you how to make your own database and how to make your own drivers. This knowledge is indispensible to people who think they know everything about databases already. One of my biggest accomplishments in my master's program was being able to say that I wrote my own database. This book helped!! Now that I am a PhD candidate, I plan to use this book whenever I have to teach a database class in the future.I agree with the previous reviewers who said to put out a new edition though! This is the only reason I did not give this book 5 stars. A lot has changed in Java over 4 or 5 years since the first edition came out. I would like to see some newer Java features integrated into the product, and especially see those explained in the book."},{"Title":"Java Database Programming","review":"This book is subtitled &quot;Master Next Generation Web Database Techniques&quot;, so you might be forgiven for thinking that it has something to do with the web, or HTML, or distributed computing. No such luck.What you really get is mostly a collection of annotated source code listings for a simple SQL interpreter and database using plain text files, padded out with one or two chapters of introduction to SQL and JDBC. If you are interested in how an SQL database might be written, or you want to provide an SQL/JDBC interface to some plain text files then it could still be a ueful book, but I can't give a good review to any book which so wildly misrepresents itself."},{"Title":"Java Database Programming","review":"The author really gets into the basics and explains how an SQL engine works, how to use JDBC drivers and even how to write JDBC Drivers.

Halfway towards the end, it seems running out of steam. It tries to cover as much as possible but one area being left out is the MetaDatabase. The book lacks in explanation for the codes. You couldn't expect readers to hunt for other books to understand it.The author should put more examples to explain the concept rather than running the course like bullet. Include source codes together with the book."},{"Title":"Java Database Programming","review":"This is an extremely useful and timely overview of database issues when the language is Java as well as a cookbook of solutions. Jepson understands the subject very, very well and swoops around the material with joyous abandon (one example from the table of contents: &quot;The Banshee Screams for Database Meat&quot;). The book includes source to tinySQL in Java and describes the gory details of creating a JDBC driver and accessing it from Java.The source is available online and Jepson makes himself available by email. Reading the book is very much like having a conversation, distractions , intellectual toys and all, with a brilliant programmer. He knows his stuff; but will you suffer through examples featuring Rita, Maxwell Edison and Mr. Kite just because Mr. Jepson is listening to the Beatles as he writes? That's the only reason this excellent book is not a 10 IMHO."},{"Title":"Java Database Programming","review":"One of the worst books I have ever tried to read. The organization of the book is incoherent. It seems to have been dashed off with minimal time and effort. Pages and pages of code listings that aren't helpful.

The first thing I noticed about Halliwell was that he used the entire 4-star scale in a consistent way. Most other film guides, while they purport to rate movies on a scale of 0 to 4 stars, really just use 2.5 to 4 (with ratings of 0 to 2 all meaning &quot;not recommended&quot; -- but who cares whether a film is rated 1 versus 1.5, if it's not recommended, don't bother). Halliwell's system takes some getting used to, but once you see the value in it (if you give it enough time), the pay-off is worthwhile. And another refreshing aspect is that relatively few films get the highest rating of 4-stars, unlike some critics who give 4-stars to half the films they see, making the rating meaningless.After Halliwell died, John Walker took over. He almost immediately 'updated' many of Halliwell's ratings (e.g., &quot;Persona,&quot; which used to rank a 2-star rating, was upgraded to 4-stars). I agree with most of Walkers updates, though he has a slight tendency to over-rate, in my opinion.Many film entries are peppered with quotes from other critics, often going against Halliwell's and Walker's assessment and offering an alternate evaluation -- this shows that these gentleman have an open mind.This is a thoroughly enjoyable, incredibly well-researched book. Worth every penny. But stay with it -- it's a goldmine if you take the time to delve in."},{"Title":"Halliwell's Film and Video Guide 2000 (Halliwell's: The Movies That Matter)","review":"While the content of the reference book is excellent, the typeface is very small and thus difficult to read."},{"Title":"Halliwell's Film and Video Guide 2000 (Halliwell's: The Movies That Matter)","review":"This is the most complete movie reference book that I have ever seen!

Usually cast and director. The Halliwell guide also gives you studio,producer,writer,composer,director of photography and sometimes art director, set designer, special effects supervisor,make up and costume designer. This is the best reason movie fans should get this book. I keep it near my television and am constantly looking stuff up. Sure the reviews can be lame (Halliwell sounds like an old fart sometimes) and the synopsis of films sometimes give the endings away, it is still the best single volume of reference for specific movies. I also like his star rating system. I mostly don't like grading a movie by giving it a score, but his system is better than most. For instance, most entries get no stars. I thought their could not that many awful movies. Most movies are mediocre anyway, not bad enough to be memorable. No star movies to him are &quot;watchable but equally missable, these are routine productions or worse&quot;. That statement describes most publications 2 or less star rated movies. A great reference guide but only average reviews."},{"Title":"Halliwell's Film and Video Guide 2000 (Halliwell's: The Movies That Matter)","review":"As much as I favor film critics Leonard Maltin and Ephraim Katz, I would have to say that they are only followers of the great Leslie Halliwell. Halliwell more-or-less created the film guide. His is the longest-standing film reference still readily available on the market today. It's also one of the most comprehensive works of its kind. Each film is given a plot synopsis that is short, but to the point, as are Mr. Halliwell's overall opinion of the film. Naturally, not everyone will agree with his opinion of every film, but that's to be expected. Admittedly, Halliwell's book is one of the more opinionated works of its kind. You can turn literally pages without seeing a four, even three-star film in sight. But there's little room for debate that Halliwell singlehandedly created the film guide with this book, and he was a man who sincerely loved and devoted himself to the movies. That's why, to me, Halliwell's is truly the Father of all Film Guides."},{"Title":"Halliwell's Film and Video Guide 2000 (Halliwell's: The Movies That Matter)","review":"This is truly one of the finest and most invaluable film guides available on the market today; it is also one of the first of its kind, but the years have been very nice to this perennial favorite which hasn't lost a bit of its spark. The synopsis given for each film is generally brief, but always concise! Of course, you may find yourself in conflict with the reviewer's overall opinion of the film, but let's face it, that's gonna happen sooner or later with any movie guide you buy! Admittedley, Halliwell's book is one of the most aggressively opinionated film guides out there(one can turn pages and pages without spotting a film that rates four, even three stars), but the quips, even the most disparaging of them, are undeniably clever and amusing. Halliwell's Film Guide is also unique in that it often includes a movie's slogan above the title of the film. Yes, Leonard Maltin is one of the country's most knowledgable and rightfully respected film critics of today, but Leslie Halliwell was the great man who pretty much set the standard for the many other movie and video guides out there, including Leonard's. Although Halliwell's guide is pricier than most of the other movie reference books, the payoff is immeasurable, as the book provides page after page and hour after hour of endless reading pleasure. Whether you are looking to be informed or entertained or perhaps both, Halliwell's Film Guide is the book for you! Those who like it will also appreciate Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies."},{"Title":"Disney y Dali, dos hombres y un Destino.(Salvador Dali y Walt Disney)(su colaboracion en, realizacion del cortometraje Destino): An article from: Epoca","review":"I saw a Dali exhibition of his art in Melbourne Australia in june 09.

She tells her story from an existential and sociocultural perspective. The writing is quite poetic at times.Though Stephen is into guns, gangs, theft and other crimes, the author views all this as an incongruency of Stephen and society, eg. he just can't adjust.I felt like the author needed parenting classes. The writing is lovely but the content irked me. Where is accountability and responsibility? Diggs talks about fairness between her and Stephen. I was more concerned about fairness to Stephen's victims."},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","review":"Althought Deborah Digges died in 2009, this bookabout her struggles with her young son to overcome hisemotional problems, is a courageous example of motherlylove, to the point of over the top! The results aregood. The sorrow, reflecting on Digges' wonderful mindand poetic talents, is that she herself was unableto go over the top for herself! An amazing story!"},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","review":"I discovered this book after reading about the author's apparent suicide. After reading this book, it is really hard for me to believe she could have committed suicide. This story of her son Stephen's difficult adolescence is so moving and powerful, so full of clarity, I just cannot imagine that any mother could have lived through this and come out the other end only to end up taking her life. It just doesn't add up. Also, there was absolutely no hint of mental illness in her writing, though I have not read her poetry. I understand the poems she wrote after the death of her 3rd husband were full of anguish. Still, he died 6 years before this so I'm not sure that her mourning would have led to a suicide 6 years later. I have read that her older son, Charles, questions that her death was a suicide. Finally, as an animal lover myself, it is hard for me to believe she would have deliberately left behind not only her beloved sons and other family members, but also undoubtedly a number of animals who depended on her. She took that responsibility, that human-animal bond, very seriously. I do not pretend to understand suicide or what could push a person to take their own life, I just feel in my heart that in the case of Deborah Digges it just seems highly unlikely to me.As for the book itself, it is wonderful and I would highly recommend it to any parent, teacher, or counselor!"},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","review":"I bought the book after I read Deborah Digges' obituary in the New York Times and did not know what to expect. I did not look for parenting advice but for more clues on Deborah's persona and life circumstances to explain her choice of taking her own life. What I found is an unconventional story about real life written in such superb language, imagery and honesty - I could not put it down.Read this book for its tragic, sad and magical moments captured in poetic lines and scenes. Deborah's unconditional compassion, her belief in the good and her strong emotional engagement saved her son's life and might - in the end - ended hers all too soon.I am a father of two sons and a daughter, and while I might disagree with some of Deborah's parenting ways SDL reminded me on every page that there is no deeper bond like the one between parent and child - shall we never give up embracing it."},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","review":"This book saved my life.

Thanks to Deborah and Stephen Digges for sharing their story."},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","review":"What do you do if you're a single parent and your younger son comes home with a gun ? That's a terse version of author Deborah Digges' situation ten years ago, and what she did comprises the story so affectingly told in this book. This is by no means a &quot;how - to&quot; book; it tells of one mother's experience and the love of a mother for her son, no matter that he was a really, really bad boy. And it is beautifully told, at times poignant and at others humorous. The apparently positive effects of pets on Stephen's development are convincing and may well be &quot;generalizable&quot; to other difficult childhood situations. &quot;The Stardust Lounge&quot; inspired me and everyone I know who read it."},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","review":"I loved The Stardust Lounge for many reasons, most of all because of how the three dogs and-- how many cats?-- were loved and cared for. The Digges houshold grew wild with compassion! I loved the story of how Rufus the basset hound took over the motherless kittens, how the bulldog G.Q.'s agression was dealt with through training, love, and humor, how Buster the bulldog's epilepsy became the driving concern of the household. In the long run, what really matters to any family but memories like these?"},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","review":"This book is interesting from a philosophical vantage point. However, it is alarming and disturbing. No parent of an adolescent can hope to glean any meaningful direction from this book. Ms. Digges philosophically 'interprets' her son's antisocial acting out, excuses (yes I mean excuses) his violence, gun-toting gang persona and never deals with consequences in any rational way. If he did turn out as well as she says (which I doubt) it is not because of her non-intervention or 'fairness'. I hope no innocents were killed along the way. This book is fantasy and chance, as unworldly as a Las Vegas show."},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","review":"A harrowing and moving description of life with an angry teenager. Digges rejected residential placement and medication is not mentioned. The therapist she found most helpful was Eduardo Bustamente, the author of &quot;Treating the Disruptive Adolescent&quot;. The treatment regime, as she describes it, was that of abandonment of any attempt at limit-setting, combined with taking in a number of pet animals. The results seem satisfactory so far, judging by this account, I think that what Bustamente helped most with was the mother's feeling of guilt. Many of of these parents feel they must take the blame for their children's misbehavior. The book will be useful to parents who suffer this kind of worry about what their friends and family and neighbors think. Digges was helped by knowing she had raised an exemplary older son. She also seems to like animals herself. The writing is beautful and poetic, and even contains poetry. as well as diary entries, letters to schools, and extracts from Jane Goodall's observations of apes. In fact it is rather too literary to be a self-help book I would recommend to most parents. It is not written at a practical advice-giving level."},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","review":"The silly grins of non-judgmental Rogerian acceptance and thrill-seeking. A theory that two messed-up childhoods brought together might find an acceptable lifestyle due to the extreme need for affiliation that afflicts children within a wierd isolated anti-society. This book echoes every myth of the &quot;recovery&quot; movement, but it lacks footnotes, specific attributions to source literature, and a thorough explication of opposing views. Buy this book to join the &quot;pity party&quot;. What a thrill for &quot;professional educators&quot; who, with career tenure, can get away with doing such destructive antisocial things to children. Includes convincing anecdotes that show why some psychotherapists should be debarred."},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","review":"I just finished reading &quot;The Stardust Lounge&quot; for the second time. At first read, it is a riveting, albeit, troubling journey of a devoted mother and her out-of-control son. The book is unsettling in it's raw, unabashed exposure of the power of the dark tunnel through which many adolescents pass - both male and female. As a counselor who has worked with adolescents for many years, I know, first hand, that the author's experiences are much more prevalent than most parents, and society in general, would like to admit.The ultimate power of this book, written in a seductively honest, often poetic style, is the message of the true nature of healing. Anyone who has been through troubled times - and who hasn't? - will find their answer in this book."},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","review":"i'm a psychiatrist and a mother of an adolescent boy and can tell you that this book is one of the most beautifully honest books i've ever read on ANY subject. i'm going to recommend it to all my patients who are parents. it's a wonderfully inspiring story that helps one move beyond fear into a state of grace. i just loved it."},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","review":"I first heard about this book on the Dianne Reemes show.

I KNEW I had to get up for work, I KNEW that in a few hours I would be dead on my feet cooking my kids' breakfast. But I just couldn't stop, and though I was, for sure, exhausted the next day, I was also haunted by Digges' break-through story. I have talked about it with other parents, co-workers, and friends.

I was one of the ones who loved it! Maybe because I didn't believe Digges meant this book as a &quot;How-to&quot; but more a &quot;this- is- how- we- did it-,this- is- how- we- got- through&quot; book. What a fantastic story-teller Deborah Digges is! I read this book cover to cover and then re-read, and will some more. I loved THE STARDUST LOUNGE for its honesty, from time to time its sense of hopelessness in the face of her son's adolescent horrors and terrors. Two thumbs up for Digges!"},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","review":"This book was difficult to put down. I enjoyed the story. For that reason I gave it 5 stars.Ms. Digges is a good writer and a good mother but I disagreed with many points made in this book. For one thing, should it really have taken all those therapists to figure out that this kid, whose only steady older male figure in life, went crazy after that male figure, his older brother, left for college? The kid obviously had abandonment issues. Why? Because his mother kept marrying unavailable men in jobs and/or lives that kept them away a lot. She seemed to like it because it allowed her to freely (a bit too freely) raise her boys. I raise this issue because the most helpful therapist said the past is irrelevant. Frankly, I think it was quite relevant. Ms. Digges, a rebel herself, a true child of the 60's, married a military guy. Why, because she wanted to escape her oppressive parents. Then, surprise, she has babies with that husband yet does not agree with him on parenting issues. They divorce and the boys, particularly the youngest child, are left holding the baggage she created for them. She then picks another unavailable guy and he ultimately leaves. All of this is relevant since, despite the fact that she raised two boys who ultimately made it, both appear to be nomads. Let's hope they learned through their own examination of the past to be prepared to be available and part of a team when they have kids, if they choose to have them.The big solution for this kid is to teach him the value of fairness. Great, but honestly, that discussion at a younger age might have prevented a lot. For instance, could she not have introduced this concept when the whole family was busy destroying rented houses? Honestly, I pity their many landlords.On the subject of fairness, she talks a lot about how society doesn't \\"get\\" her kid. I believe the traditional school path is not the best one for every kid, particularly this kid. With that said, she was a writer and professor with plenty of time on her hands to homeschool him. Was it fair to dump him on a school system in his condition?She also seems to talk about how \\"poor\\" they were at times. Seriously, legitimately poor people do not eat take out as much as was referenced in this book. Poor people do not have her education. Poor people do not send their kids to (multiple) private schools. I realize citing limited funds paints a more pitiful story but self-imposed neediness is not pitiful.She talks about people's views toward her as a single parent. Specifically, she says that people seem to revere single dads but dump on single moms. She's right. With that said, the dad in the story was interested and wanted to help. She admitted that she wanted to be the single mom with her boys. She did not want to be apart from them. Then, as unfair as people may be, when you choose the path, suck it up.My view of this mom is that she did step up...later than I would have liked...but kudos to her for sticking by her son, especially when it seemed like it was the end of the road. She also gets kudos for taking in a foster son, who, by the way, gave her own troubled son the opportunity to be the big brother/dad he missed so much.This is a good book. I think parents and people who work with children should read it. I don't believe it should be used as a guidebook by any means but there are important lessons in it, not the least of which, happy endings are possible.As a mother of young children I want to believe prevention was critical here. As a mother who has encountered those times when I am shocked to learn that my kids have already decided my authority is limited, I pray I am right and that I can find the tools to prevent complete mutiny and worse. I am wise enough to never say never but I am well-planted enough in reality to say that troubled adolescent boys don't show up in your house without a history that explains at least some of it."},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","review":"For anyone who has ever had a child they believe to be out of control, this is a must read book. As a counsellor, it is a known fact there are not many parents who would abandon conventionial methods of therapy for the non-traditional. Deborah Digges did just that when she sought help from a non-traditional therapist for her thirteen year old son, Stephen, who was alrady toting guns, stealing, and doing drugs. In the words of her therapist, &quot;Join him in his anger at life. Don't educate him in what he should have done. Let him figure it out.&quot; The world could certainly use more therapists with this type of modern-day philosophy - it would open endless possibilities, particularly in dealing with teen-related issues.What follows is a bizzare lifestyle reminiscent of the Bohemian trend of the 60's - virtually anything goes! With the aloof attitude, &quot;you sleep where you drop,&quot; munching on fast food and pizzas as the fair-of-the-day, and opening her home to gang members who would give most mothers an acute panic attack, the book is full of surprises. Ultimately, they are surprises that work. It is a modern day version, of &quot;if you can't beat 'em, join 'em&quot; philosophy.The most enjoyable element of this off-beat, true-to-life tale is the author's light-hearted, witty writing style. Faced with overhwhelming adversity from teachers and law enforcement officers, her incredible determination will win the hearts of any parent who happens to think no other parent on Earth could possibly be going through &quot;this insane pile of sh..!&quot; Hats off to Deborah Diggs. She is a woman with a purpose and a mission, clearly treading where few mothers dare to go. The book teaches a powerful message in a rather unorthodox manner."},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","review":"The Stardust Lounge has been widely reviewed-- USA Today, The New York Times Review of Books, Esquire, The Washington Post Book World, and others. As an avid reader of reviews I am amazed that none focused much on the animal-human relationships that bind this book together! Without Buster and GQ, the bulldogs, Rufus the basset hound, Sybil to cat, and all the kittens, I can't imagine that SDL could have the depths and layers it does in relationship to its dangerous story of male adolescence in American culture. I think that most reviewers don't know how to write sensitively and effectively regarding the integrity and wholeness of animal presences. This aspect of the book was to me the most mysterious and moving. I loved this book for all of its strangeness,it's breaking rules so rigidly assigned to the notion of &quot;family.&quot; What IS a family? Digges, her sons,Trevor, an all the cats and dogs impress me as one of the greatest families I've ever read about. I only wish I could live in this book a while, step in and join them on their way."},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","review":"This book was a bit slow for me to begin with. But after Deborah took Stephen to the unconventional therapist, things picked up. I thought, this guy can't be real. But when you read what he tells Deborah to &quot;join his anger&quot;, you see that it all makes sense. Her book is full of wonderful prose. And the way the animals help them all heal. Towards the end, as Stephen is making progress, he begins to teach her things also. This in a wonderful book for parents, therapists, teachers, principals, and any one who has judgement on those teens who don't look or act like we think they should. Maybe, as Deborah says, it's time for the school systems to look at how they deal with these children. Stephen tells a little of his story too. The essay he wrote for a class is wonderful. Good luck to a family who made it despite the establishment and all their rules and regulations."},{"Title":"The Stardust Lounge","review":"As a single mother of a teen, I have to say that Digges' Stardust Lounge was music to my ears. The difficulties she faced with her son Stephen are are too common. I know! What I most appreciated was how Digges refused blame and victimhood. Her book has given me courage to face my own problems with my son, the school system, the courts, and my son's circle of friends. This book is a must for any parent. Digges kept her faith and her humor through the toughest times. I'm hoping my boy will read it too!"},{"Title":"Sun Up, Sun Down: The Story of Day and Night (Science Works (Picture Window))","review":"We checked this book out at the library and my 3-1/2 year old loves this book almost as much as I do. It is a wonderful text that teaches how the sun moves across the sky, how shadows change, and how the earth orbits the sun. Well written with cute little conversation bits for fun. This is a bit longer than most of our bedtime stories but holds his interest and peaks his curiosity.

It's a great introduction to the sun in relation to day and night. I think it's appropriate for elementary aged kids. My 4 & 6 year olds both enjoyed it.

FROM THIS: Mr. Leeland has founded the Sparrow Clubs in schools around the country and has raised over $750,000 for \\"broken sparrows\\". . .and he believes in kids helping kids.This book is not only inspirational for those who know cancer, and sickness, but for those of us who never dealt with that issue this book is VERY inspiring . . . and very full of hope and love.

I first heard of Jeff and his families terrible ordeal in June of 2009 through one of our fellow teammates from our earlier shared days on the turf of Husky Stadium. I had no idea what Jeff and his family had persevered through concerning their gripping ordeal with their infant son Michael. I immediately ordered a copy of \\"One Small Sparrow\\" and when it arrived I sat down to read a book that will forever leave the words on the page indelibly etched on my heart. I couldn't hold back the tears from this powerful expression of unconditional love that one selfless junior high schooler had done by \\"giving all\\" the money he'd saved which became the catalyst affecting the entire Seattle skyline and the financial support that ensued. I tell everyone I meet to buy a copy of Jeff's book because this story of committed faith, unwavering hope and unrelenting love, which defines the pages of this book, will be forever timeless in its scope.

But I think the Chaim Potok may have inserted an error in the plot in this chapter, which is interesting as this chapter deals with errors; and I don't seem to find record of this anywhere!Chapter 7 takes place on Shabbat and the completion of Shabbat. Meaning, when Reuven finally comes home late around 10:30pm ON SATURDAY NIGHT, upsetting his father somewhat... they go over the details of the day... and at the end of the conversation Reuven's father tells him they must get to bed, as tomorrow is a school day. Reuven attends secular school on Sundays?? Odd. And that's how Chapter 8 begins, back in school the next morning!Have I mis-read this?

It is a very deep and moving story about the friendship between two people from different backgrounds and the history they both share."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I loved this book from the first time I read it. It is a friendship story and there are few of those while there are many love stories. It is also a friendship story between two intellectual teenagers. It is hard for such to find someone who can share his world. I remember what it was like-and still is.One thing that isn't noticed but I wonder about. Danny Saunders seems like an allegory of the Jewish people. He is \\"the Chosen\\" raised in a severe way and taught that he is destined for a high calling which he does not quite want. He is devoted to his father(who \\"brought his people up out of the land of Russia\\"). But he cannot understand him and is always trying, not with complete success to convince himself and others that his father loves him. At the end all is explained. I don't know if all that was the writer's intent but I often wonder. At any rate as a Christian I sometimes think about the Jewish people as if I was Reuven Malter and they are Danny Saunders. Like Reuven I sometimes wonder why God seems to treat them so hard...By the way, someone called Danny a \\"rebel son\\". He was certainly not that. He was straining himself not to rebel. In our culture many hold submission in contempt but sometimes it takes as much strength of will to submit as to rebel. Danny was growing and learning. But he never scorned his father and people and certainly never rebelled. One can be different from one's family without turning against it.A trivial criticism: while Rebbe Saunders certainly did have a remarkable amount of power, is the emigration an example of that? It does seem that he was the first one in the community to have a decent idea.Another bit of trivia. I have read in \\"God on the Quad\\" by Naomi Schaefer Riley, a book about American religious colleges, that the feuding between professors and rabbis in Jewish colleges as described in the book and it's sequel The Promise, is based on a real life phenomenon.Jason Taylor(son of John Taylor whose password I am using with his permission)"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I first received this book a couple weeks ago from my English 2 Preap teacher, since I'm a 10th grader, I didn't think much of it. When I started reading the story, it caught my eye about the friendship that was built around two complete opposites of &quot;the world&quot; per say. Then I became slightly confused with the story, not sure what it was trying to tell me, and I went in search of answers to my question.&quot;What was this book truely about?&quot;I found it out while talking with other students and teachers that had read the book and all found it interesting. Only one source truely helped me and I found inspiration in the story, though many still ask me what it was. Heh...I can't truely say what the moral of the story conveys, I believe you can only understand when you read it for yourself. It is worth it, definietly."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The book started off great, you could tell the friendship between the two boys was full of hatred, but it ended up to be a great story of how a boy lives on his life with his father practically controlling his every move, but does it in silence. Great book, highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This novel is suited for just about anybody regardless of religion or race. Those who are Jewish will relate a little easier but those of other faiths can apply the various relationships that occur in this book to their own lives.The story is primarilly about two boys, Reuven and Danny who meet one day in a softball game. Danny is a Hassidic Jew and Reuven is merely Orthodox. Danny's initial impression is one of disdain towards Reuven as he is unable to relate to people who are not on his religious level at first impression. An accident on the ball field brings them together and eventually they begin a friendship. It grows deeper when both their fathers are drawn into each others worlds. It is indeed very interesting how each father raises his son so diffrently.The backdrops of the hospital, World War II, the surrender of the Nazis, The Zionist Movement, and the eventual statehood of Israel effect the two worlds of Danny and Reuven. There is a period of time when the Zionist movement causes Danny and Reuven to put their friendship on hold. However, in time they return to nurture each other.This is not a quick read by any means as anyone with a soul with be enamored by the details of this fine novel. Practically each page offers descriptive information about critical steps that Danny and Reuven take in their critical years to discovering themselves. Even both fathers learn something in the end. This is a story which will have you thinking and analyzing many many aspects of the lives of Danny and Reuven and I sincerely hope more teenagers and college students read this book and develop a greater acceptance for peers who may be a little different from themselves."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This is a story of friendship, a friendship that is formed between two Jewish boys (of differenct sects) under the most unusual circumstances. One boy, Danny, destined to be a tzaddik, a rabbi to the Hasidic community, is raised by his rabbi father who communicates to Danny only during study of the Torah. The other boy, Reuven, from a less strict Jewish sect, becomes more than a friend, actually more like a buffer or a liason between Danny and his father. Their friendship grows, is torn apart and then mended, leading to the emotional final chapter, as their true destinies begin to take shape.Chaim Potok has become one of my favorite authors. This is the third book of his that I have read this year, and, as a Christian, his novels give me great insight into modern day Judaism. His books are not only informative, but brilliant, heartbreaking, and compassionate. Everyone with any kind of religious bent at all, or even the non-religious, should read his work. I'll guarantee that you will be moved."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I am an African American attorney who read this book as part of collecting readings for a summer trip with Operation Understanding to share with Black and Jewish high school students. Operation Understanding takes 8 Black and 8 Jewish students between their Junior and Senior years of high school on a trip across the South and Northeast, stopping at places of significance to both, in an effort to restore the alliance that existed between the groups especially during the Civil Rights Movement. This was the perfect book to gain a deeper understanding of American Jewry for the trip.The book explores the relationship between two deeply religious boys from profoundly different traditions within that religion who are accidentally -- divinely, really -- brought together. The development of both boys' spirituality starts with lessons from their fathers and deepens with lessons from each other.The Chosen takes place in World War II America. I was already familiar with many of the classic accounts of Holocaust survivors (Anne Frank, Elie Wiesel, and others.) This book richly filled a gap in that understanding by presenting a fully formed first person account, though ficitious, of the wrenching experience of American Jews who helplessly learned of the horror from here.The book also offers thorough background information (which will have to be supplemented by further reading) about Jewish history, both cultural and religious. The author patiently explains terms presumably unfamiliar to the general reader and then trusts the reader to turn back if, during the course of reading the novel, the terms are momentarily forgotten. Those reviewers who said that Potok left the reader unaided were simply not paying close attention.Beyond its fascinating historical and religious perspectives, this book's elegant craftsmanship and universal themes will move anyone, regardless of background. Potok's gift for writing regional American dialogue is similar to that of Twain and Steinbeck. Thematically, especially moving to me was the way in which the fathers' mostly wordless love and support for their sons manifested itself in the friends' often wordless love and support for each other. It is significant in this regard that the fathers never meet in the novel, even as they separately express a conflicted admiration for each other when each speaks to one or both boys. When both boys choose career paths their fathers had not expected, Potok allows the reader to share all four characters' realization that it is fulfilling the expectations of God, the Father that ultimately matters most.I will share an excerpt of this extraordinary book with the young people on our trip. And when we reach New York, my hometown, I'm giving my copy to my Dad."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book explores the friendship that develops between two Jewish boys in New York City during the Second World War. I loved it for it's beautiful story and how it weaves together the very different lives of the boys, their relationships with their fathers, and the eventual interactions of all four of the characters. Potok includes numerous desriptions of Jewish tradition and customs, which is vital to the story as well as fascinating information. I found myself seeking to learn more about the Jewish faith when I finished this book. The plot is complex in how it balances the characters and their lives, all while teaching the reader about the various sects of Judaism. At the same time, it is told in beautiful language that is very easy to understand and appreciate. The entire book is muted and wonderfully understated, and it feels like you are listening to an old man recount his youth in a soft yet spirited voice. Potok's book &quot;The Promise&quot; follows up the story of &quot;The Chosen&quot; nicely, but the first book in the sequence is by far the best. At times tragic, jubilant, and thoughtful, this is by far one of the best books I have ever read, if not THE best. I feel like I'm a better person for it. Everyone should have a chance to read this book."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The main thing I want to add to the reviews here is that there really is no custom to raise a child &quot;in silence&quot; as Reb Saunders does with his son in the book. This was a literary device used by Potok for the sake of his story. In real life, Hasidic fathers and sons interact with each other outside of study classes, too.For those of you who find the use of Yiddish and Hebrew words a bit off-putting, or the details of a strange (to you) culture boring, I want to say, please keep reading. Learning about somebody else's culture is always a brain-stretcher, but in this case, it is well worth it. The seemingly &quot;extraneous&quot; details in the beginnig of the book all come together in the end. And you will be very much enriched by the experience."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I had to read the Chosen for my 8th Grade English class in1998. It is without a doubt the best book I have ever written. I readit in under 2 days, and since then have read almost all his books dealing with adolescent Jews. This book shows what it means to be Jewish, that Judaism is as much about personal relationships with God as it is with others, with the community. It shows that friendship conquers all, even schisms in religion. It was a big insight into the sometimes mysterious worlds of Hasidism and Orthodoxy, and is useful in showing differences (I was not aware of any until I read this book). I am a secular jew and identified strongly with both characters.For the students who say it was boring and that only Jews could understand it, I think they should have done some research before starting it. For instance, you shouldn't read this book until you know what the Torah is, at least. A glossary at the back would have helped comprehension, but would have taken away from the story as well. By not proviving definitions every five pages, Chaim Potok let the story envelop readers, so that they felt that they knew everything Danny and Reuven knew. If the students didn't understand something, they should have looked it up, like the students in my class should have. I cannot believe that anyone can say this was boring, as I think it is one of the best looks into stricter American Judaism. Such books are necessary for the reform Jews of today who regard Orthodox Jews and Hasidism as fanatics and extremists. His books &quot;The Promise&quot;, &quot;My name is Asher Lev&quot;, and &quot;The Gift of Asher Lev&quot; are good for this purpose as well.The character of Reb Saunders is one of the most original ones I have ever encountered. He makes me understand my late grandfather, a &quot;Born-again Jew&quot; better.This book has impacted my life and I will always be grateful to Chaim Potok for writing it. He is a genius, and I hope he lives to write many more masterpieces of litterature."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I only heard of this book recently, here into my third decade of life, and that's a shame really. When certain books hit you during certain stages of life the impact can be profound. This one missed me by a few stages. &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; hit me during the early teens (a perfect time also to tackle &quot;The Chosen&quot;), Catch-22 upon entering college, recently &quot;Underworld.&quot; The point I'm laboriously arriving at is that &quot;The Chosen&quot; is indeed a great book, but I wish I would have read it at fourteen. Its message would have been more poignant and internalized then (not that it was entirely lost on a grown up child of today though).The real strength of Potok's book lies in three areas. First, the insight the reader gets into the American Jewish sub-culture of Hasidim and Orthodox at a critical point in history for Jews (1940's) is truly elevated. Second, the strong characterization between four very different individuals reveals a beautiful relationship development between father and son, friend and friend, and growing young men encountering the world. Third, it reaches out for the soul and stays true to things that matter; a search for spirituality, a tolerance for beliefs, a search for a place in this world (for individuals and cultures), and a search for knowledge.The writing overall was simplistic and the reader is handed many things on a silver platter that could have been presented more subtle, more artistically. Another thing, Sigmund Freud lurks in a mystical &quot;portent of doom&quot; shroud when the character Danny starts to study him. It is never really explained why the other characters in the book have such a fear of Freud. What the reader sees is that Danny is studying Freud and the rest of the characters know for certain bad things will befall to his tainted mind.Despite these inconsequential distractions, the story, search for meaning, and character interplay more than make up for it. I think I would have given this a 4.5 stars if allowed, but I'm leaning towards 5, baby, cuz more stars are better than less. Give this book to a teen and help them learn tolerance. It's fundamentally important--now more than ever."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This is one of those books I should already have read but hadn't. There are so many of those! I am so glad I finally picked this up. It's short and straight-forward, as books used to be, yet complex and beyond meaningful, as books at their best are.It isn't hard reading, by any means, but it reveals a strong, strong lesson played out through the friendship of two young boys, their complex relationship to one another and within their small world, their fathers' relationship to each another (and their worlds and thought processes), and how they are viewed--and view--their school and community. All of this in such a tiny book - while nowadays books are 800 pages of nada (and I'm just in my 30's).It's not a children's book and, while simple, it's far from simplistic. The &quot;lesson&quot; or &quot;moral&quot; or journey of the two boys is life-altering for them, and really, in its way, was for me too - because of how haunting it is, how direct its story, how the plot is the thing. We're handed the message, easily, on a platter - and that is all that's needed.The levels of complexity are within these peoples' worlds, not wordplay or fancy writing. It's the/their real world - a world full of those who don't fit in where they &quot;should,&quot; those trying to find their own ways, being judged by others, and pressured by their own.Some of the themes are universal; the world in which these two live isn't. Their world is specific and small, and has to be for this story; yet, for anyone interested in this particular world--the multifacets of Judaism and its sects at some of the highest, most historic or profound, levels--the book is a history lesson. It isn't a boring history lesson but one told through the eyes of two boys finding their ways through their respective cultures and into the world. Do people [does a person] want to be the part of the world laid out for them and what is involved in leaving it? This question applies to everyone.It's mainly their relationship to each other that reveals the information. Two boys talk and teach one another; people love and resent; one boy is uniquely pressured, the other more free. This is a book about Jewish history, about friendship, about personal choice, and the road to independent thought.The thing that makes a character a brilliant talmudic scholar is the same character trait that makes him an independent thinker who questions the path set out for him and his duty to fulfill it. His duty and his feelings are at odds; he is a young boy and his struggles are moral, intellectual, historic, and human. His conversations with his friend are profound and eye opening, both for the characters and the reader.Conversation and human interaction dominate a book that is predominantly a journey of thought. It's lovely. This approach leads us to feel not only for the characters but for their relationships - the boys' to one another and each to his and the other's father, as well as the bonds formed with &quot;minor&quot; characters.From the first chapter, I was hooked. It begins with an edge-of-your-seat baseball game. I couldn't be less interested in baseball, but there was something going on here, a nail biter, a bring-us-in chapter that brought us into a world so complicated yet, again, written and shown to us so easily. Piecemeal, in a way - from the game to the hospital, other characters in the ward, then to their outside-the-hospital world that is the rest of the book.It's a must read, truly. It is a must-read for Jews (I am Jewish) but also universal in theme, and an insight into particular elements of Judaism. I'd recommend it to absolutely anyone.It's taken me a long time to write the review since finishing the book, as I didn't even know where to start. But, The Chosen is with me in the same way as the day I put it down, and as I hope it will always be. I hope not to forget. I hope no one does."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I read &quot;The Chosen&quot; in one sitting...something I haven't done in a long, long time. The book is a coming of age story about two Jewish teenagers, Reuven and Danny, who become best friends as a result of an accident during an interscholastic softball game. Danny is raised as a Hasidic Jew, while Reuven is raised as an Orthodox - a less strict sect of Judaism. Danny's father expects him to become a Rabbi but he wants to be a psychologist, and Reuven's father, who is much more liberal than Danny's father, would like him to be a mathematician, and he want to be a rabbi. The book explores the relationship between the two boys and their fathers. It is a story of contrasts, but at the same time is depicts how alike they all really are.While the story is interesting and educational, I found the character's development stifled by Potok's inability to delve into their lives outside of a religious context. The story takes them through high school and college but we never get to know anything more about them then their relationships with their fathers, and the impact of their religious differences. But I guess that's the point of the book. I can't fault Potok for these limitations because he is an excellent writer and tells a great story. However, I wanted a bit more meat to the story. There are many wonderful themes in &quot;The Chosen&quot; and I highly recommend it to anyone in the mood for a clean-cut, &quot;G&quot; rated read."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I read The Chosen by Chaim Potok in twelfth grade. The book focuses around the lives and unexpected friendship of two boys named Reuven Malther and Danny Saunders. The two of them are Jewish teens growing up in Brooklyn, New York during World War II; however, Danny is the son of a Hasidic Rabbi while Reuven is the son of a powerful minded Zionist man. Those two differences are what brings the boys together and at the same time separates them in unimaginable ways. For example, Danny has different religious rituals than Reuven, which causes conflict for the two families when they learn that their boys are best friends. However, it is ironic because secretly, Danny's father is happy about their friendship because Reuven is a way for him to talk to his son. Throughout the story, Danny struggles with the mind games his father plays on him. The Chosen was written in a pictorial fashion and you can clearly make out each scene in your head along with the character physiques . The book begins at a baseball game (where the boys meet) with a slow start but once you finish chapter one, you won't be able to put the book down. The book will take you on an emotional roller coaster ride when you read how Danny's father treats him, how society is, and how the boy's friendship strengthens and weakens. Throughout the book, Danny and Reuven learn an abundance about their selves from each other while they spend every second of free time they have together. The Chosen teaches extraordinary lessons about the power of friendship, the necessity to be able to communicate with loved ones, and religion. Even if you are not of Jewish faith, the book is written with so much religious description, you will be able to follow along without a problem.All in all, I think The Chosen is truly an amazing book. I would, without a doubt,give it a rating of 5 stars. After reading this book, you will have learned so much about Judaism in America, the Holocaust, and friendship. I recommend anyone who wants to be enlightened to read this book."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Overall Review: \\"Merely to live, merely to exist--what sense is there in that? A fly also lives!\\" So states the father of Reuven Malter, a young jewish boy in America. In The Chosen we meet Reuven and Danny Saunders: Two boys who couldn't be more different. They are both Jewish, but the similarities stop there. They become friends over an accident. Danny hits Reuven in the face with a baseball during a game. Reuven's glasses shatter into his eye, and from that moment on, life changes its course. Reuven's eyes are literally and figuratively opened as he sees everything in a new light. This is, of course, one of the important side effects of traumatic experiences--we are torn away from our old point of view and comfort zone, and given new ideas, experiences and friendships. Danny comes to the hospital to apologize and the boys become fast friends. It is an unlikely friendship from the beginning, but they are so good for each other--balancing their ideas and personalities to perfection. I loved following Danny and Reuven through their formative years, watching them make decisions that were difficult; waking up to what life really has to offer and finding the strength to follow their own dreams. They go through so many emotions, disillusionments, and learning experiences. They both have amazing minds and intellects. The book overall is astounding. The scope of information presented is huge--yet it is also intricate, well researched, and delicately complex. We learn amazing things about WWII from a totally different perspective. There is some fascinating information presented on Jewish history, customs, and beliefs. It never feels like a textbook or an encyclopedia, though. The story is poignant and flows with expert ease. The Chosen is a coming of age story that reminds us to wake up, to live life to the fullest, to open our eyes and see what can't be seen...to Listen to the unspoken silence. Overall rating is 4.5 out of 5 stars.Content Review:PROFANITY: A few mild instances throughoutVIOLENCE: Some mild instancesSEXUAL CONTENT: NoneMATURE THEMES: Mild to ModerateRECOMMENDED AGE GROUP: 16+At the very beginning of the book, there is a baseball game between two groups of young men. During this game, there is quite a bit of \`religious' profanity. Every once in a while, another word is sprinkled in here and there, but it is never as concentrated as during the ball game. There is some violence, but it really is handled very low-key for the content that is dealt with. A character is hit in the face with a baseball and his glasses shatter into his eye (he's eventually fine). There are some references to boxing and the effects of serious fights (losing eyes, etc.). There are many fistfights and a lot of anger and hatred at times.Also, there are many mentions of WWII, and subsequently we read a lot about the death toll of certain battles as well as seeing the desolation of post-holocaust life of the American Jews. Other smaller wars, skirmishes and battles are also mentioned along with many terrorist acts. Many people are killed in battles, hangings, bombings, etc. This is all told as hearsay as the main characters are not in the heat of the action. A younger audience may not enjoy this book due mostly to the more adult themes of raising children, making serious life/religious choices, deep friendships, and the effects of war, but all of these themes are lovingly handled--The Chosen is a book to make you think deeply that is a Clean Read for ages 16+.This review was written by EmilyA Squeaky Clean Reads Book ReviewerTo see more reviews with content in mind, visit us at squeakycleanreads!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"'The Chosen' is one of those books that I've seen on bookshelves in both new stores and paperback exchanges for most of my life - so much so that I felt like I'd somehow absorbed it without ever reading it. On the advice of a friend, I finally sat down with it, and while the contents weren't exactly surprising, I did find it instructive and enjoyable. Instructive, though I think it's appropriate to mention right up front that 'The Chosen' reads as though Mr. Potok had definite opinions about different aspects of Jewish culture, and that the novel uses its adolescent characters to illustrate these opinions and cast them in accordance with Mr. Potok's preferences.I think most authors do this, so I won't penalize Mr. Potok too badly for it - I can hardly expect him to write glowingly of ideas with which he doesn't agree. However, the danger in this case is that someone like me, who is very unfamiliar with the issues concerning Orthodox Judaism, can get a slanted picture that may unfairly represent one side or the other.'The Chosen' follows the growth of two boys, one a member of an isolated Hasidic community and the other an orthodox Jew who, while still faithful to the commandments, is part of a group that has taken many steps toward assimilation in 1940's America. Largely, the book is about the struggles these two have in accepting or breaking free from responsibilities to their families and to their beliefs. Mixed together with their coming-of-age stories is the story of the end of WWII and the birth of the Jewish state.From a historical and cultural standpoint, I thought 'The Chosen' was informative, with the caveat that this is the only source I have read that addresses Hasidic culture and the attitudes of the Jewish population in America in the closing years of the 1940's. Because Mr. Potok comes down solidly in favor of certain issues, I would like to read more before accepting or disregarding other views. Literature can be a powerful persuader, as the author is able to control outcomes and points of view while remaining essentially true to the record. With that in mind, 'The Chosen' provided an easily digestible method of learning about Jewish history, and opened my eyes to intricacies I hadn't known existed within that culture."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. I have read this prize winning classic every so often since I was first exposed to it in an advanced English class during my senior year in high school (1974-75). I have read all of Mr. Potok's fictional novels and this one is one of his two best--the other is his \`In the Beginning.' This book is enjoyable reading for anyone of high school age or older.The book is about the culture clash between two brilliant, young men of the Jewish faith who become life-long friends. For those of us not of the Jewish faith, this is an interesting portrayal of the Hasidic culture. The portrayal of the young men's brilliance is fascinating because not many high school students read the basic works of Sigmund Freud or Russell and Whitehead's \`Principle Mathematica'--especially for me since I love to read about brilliant folks and learning to know what makes them tick and act the way they do even in a fictional depiction. The unique relationship is shown from the time of World War II, the creation of the state of Israel, and their graduation from seminary and emergence into manhood.I cannot recommend this book more highly! I have given this book as a gift to many people and have been told they all enjoyed it. Enjoy this classic."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"A classic story of an unlikely friendship between two boys divided by a common culture. Orthodox and Conservative Judaism clash in the lives of two boys coming of age at the close of WWII.This compelling story transcends the culture it is set in--but those interested in Judaism will find many enlightening insights into the culture and religion.Reading this story made me realize the awesome responsibility that passed to American Jewry when they realized the acknowledged keepers of their culture, European Jewry, had but all been wiped out of existence. The mantle was now upon them to preserve their forefathers' traditions, culture, and worship."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"What a great book. Set in the time period of World War II, two Jewish boys from radically different homes become great friends. Great themes - friendship, loyalty, tradition, life in general. It's a quick read - Potok really has a way of keeping the story moving swiftly. I learned a lot about Judaism and thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Highly recommended to all readers.NOTE: For part of the book, I listened to the audio version on CD - it was okay, but I felt the reader was a little too dramatic in some interpretations. The story was good enough that I didn't want to wait to listen to it, so I got the book and finished it."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This was a wonderful book, which I would highly recommend to any reader above the age of 16. I learned a lot about the Jewish faith. One lesson learned was the fact of how much our life can change by just one indident. Mr. Potok makes each of his characters lovable no matter which view they hold. The culture the author shows us, is foreign to a lot of people, including me, but I think it is a part of history that is important to our society.The parental side of this book is told well, each father loving their sons with such a passion, but each showing it in the only way they know how - a conflict with their traditions and religion.It's hard to write a review about just one aspect of this book, since it is layered with emotion, love, tradition, life changes, friendship, and hard lessons. You could read this book over and over again and come away having learned something you didn't quite catch the first time.I'm looking forward to The Promise, I'm not quite ready to let go of Reuven and Danny.A must read."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I read The Chosen for my literature class at school, and I enjoyed it very much! Chaim Potok did a wonderful job of portraying the life of two young Jewish-American boys. Based in Brooklyn in the 1940s, we first meet the narrator, the modern Orthodox Reuven Saunders, as a 15 year old. An incident occurs to where he becomes close to his Ultra-Orthodox (Hasidic) counterpart, Danny Saunders. One is a mathematician and the other aspires to become a psychologist. Both are brilliant scholars of the Torah and the Talmud. Although I had little knowledge of Jewish customs and cultures, after reading this book, I learned some aspects of Judaism I never knew before. Potok defined many Jewish and Yiddish terms that otherwise I would not have any clue understanding. He made this a novel which looks into the lives of two brilliant young men who struggles to preserve their friendship and their own beliefs."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Chaim Potok's emotional heart-warming story The Chosen captivates its readers from page one. The intense ball game grabs the reader and involves him in the lives of Reuven and Danny from the start. Potok knows how to hold the reader's attention and concern him with the day-to-day happenings in both boys' lives. The historical events show accurate reactions toward events such as D-day rejoicing and pure sock after President Roosevelt's death. Every character has a role; there weren't any extra personalities to detract from the main action of the book. Potok introduces the different beliefs among the Jewish sects and helps the reader to better understand the religion and its affect on father son relationships. Reuven and Danny's friendship strengthens as they come to realize that their father's way of doing things isn't always the only right way.Danny and Reuven's friendship get them through some of their toughest ordeals. It is even able to survive the ban set by Reb. Saunders. True friendship stands the tests of time. I know that when I need advice or support, my true friends are there to help me though whatever problems I'm having, even if they don't live in the same state. This novel has helped me realize how important real friendships can be.This book is highly recommended for those looking for a compelling insightful novel. It is great for anyone struggling with a friendship because it helps the reader to realize how important friendships are. The friendship between Danny and Reuven gets stronger through each hardship they go though."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I loved this story. Who wouldn't? It has universal appeal that is undeniable, even though some of the religious themes are strictly Jewish. Even so, the fact that I'm not Jewish didn't stop me from appreciating the way the author presented his faith. The book was superbly written and in a way that allows people of all faiths to appreciate it's themes of friendship, conflict, love, and loyalty. A must read....."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Not only does The Chosen present an entertaining story of the relationship and maturity of two young men, it also presents a deeper theme of the mental maturity of all people and the essence of human nature. Potok introduces the two main characters, Reuven Malter and Danny Saunders, as rivals, or enemies, however, through the fateful accident during the baseball game the two are brought together and become the closest of friends. The two are practically inseparable and each plays a major role in molding the mind of the other, effectively helping each other come to decisions concerning each one's own future. Together, the two experience adolescence and eventually adulthood while sustaining a friendship that endures their religious differences and forced separation by Danny's father.From the beginning, The Chosen is packed with symbolism such as the baseball game, Reuven's friends in the hospital and Potok's references to sight, which run throughout the novel. In the story, the baseball game is simply a contest between schools and the bringing together of Reuven and Danny. Symbolically, the game represents two groups of Jews playing the \\"greatest American past time,\\" baseball, showing that they, as Jews, can be as American as everyone else. Additionally, the game sets the attitude of each Jewish sect with respect to the other, which is, of course, unfriendly. The irony of this situation lies in the current world events during the time of the setting of the novel. WWII and rumors of the holocaust are evident in the background of the novel. Even with the extreme persecution of the Jewish people, these two groups of Jews in America let their petty differences and religious disagreements lead to feelings of hatred among themselves.An enlightening novel, The Chosen presents the journey through life of two friends and relates to all people, for all people must first discover their place in the world and then have the courage to pursue their dreams. Only then is life lived to the fullest and happiness finally achieved."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"When I was reading through this book, because I found it on the back to school shelf at the bookstore, I told my roommate it was enjoyable and informative, but that i didn't see how it could be a classic because it had no climax and was going nowhere fast. Well, then, towards the very end and with very subtle fingers, the climax touched me and I cried.This was a subtle, enjoyable book and I'm happy I read it."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I am a young, reform jew living in southern california. This book was originally recommended to me by my maternal grandmother, who grew up, and still is, a hasidic jew. At first, like any modern teenager, I was wary of reading anything that my seventy eight year old grandma had recommended. But I was proven wrong. Not only did I learn the ways of my ancestors and the history of my people. I was quickly drawn into the story of the brilliant Danny, whos' father is a hasidic rabbi, who, after trying to kill him, becomes best friends with the son of an orthedox man who is breaking into new ways, called Reuven. However, this book is so much more than a story of a friendship. This book tell the story of finding the balance between soul and mind, new and old. Although many who read this may be shocked at the sometimes harsh ways of the hasidic jew, one must remind oneself of the great love that flows through the book. And this book is not only for jews. Since reading it, I have talked to many classmates who love it as much as I do. To sum it all up, this book is a must read for anyone curious about the intracate community and hardships of an orthedox jew."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"When i started this book it was off of a reccomendation of an English teacher of mine. I did not know what to expect considering her selections have always been good but a little borring.This book might start off a little slow, but in its own way it is jam packed with action, just not the type of action most teenagers are in the mood for.I enjoyed this book because i feel like i am part of Reuven Malter, and that i know what he knows and i feel what he feels. Danny is a good friend to me and becomes a worry of mine just like it does for Reuven.My religious upbringing has made this book all the better for me. i know what they are referring to and i know what the interperations are.I reccommend this book for anyone with a mind and a belief in the discovery of other sides of culture or an in depth look at their own culture"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I read The Chosen for English class, and after reading it, its full implications astounded me. This book has some profound things to say about friendship and family relationships. It is more of a thinking book, and involves dialogue rather than action. Some of the themes in The Chosen are friendship and how it conquers any divide, silence and how it can teach or destroy, religion and its schsims and purposes, traditions and their place, and conflict of a perosn with his society. The beginning of the book has a quote that claims \\"it is hard for a free fish to understand what is happening to a hooked one.\\" The reader understands what is happening to a hooked fish gradually, as Reuven meets Danny almost by accident (although the reader may believe it is fate) when Danny hits a baseball during a game into Reuven's glasses and eye. Their friendship is difficult, as it grows. It is challenged by their religious differences (both are Jewish, but Danny Saunders is Hasidic while Reuven is not), by their society, and by Danny's incredible intelligence. Danny's intelligence also ignites his struggle with his father, who wishes for his son to become a Jew and fears for his son because of Danny's genius. We begin to realize that Danny is a hooked fish, because of what his intelligence might do to his faith. Danny's father is a rabbi, and only speaks to his son when they discuss the Talmud. This silence tortures Danny and his father. Danny does not know the reason for it until the book ends, but Rabbi Saunders is silent quite purposely, as much as it hurts him. This idea of society that Chaim Potok presents is amazing, and its implications stretch beyond a single religion. It is well-written, and the characters are carefully and beautifully developed. The ending is powerful, but the entire book is masterpiece, an idea and a passion."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Chaim Potok's epic tale is of two boys who struggle through their years of friendship, threatened by their different branches of Judaism. Both boys' fathers play important roles in their communities, even the world. But the emphasized importance they had on their childrens lives and each others is astronomical. Little things can be of great importance, true, but this point is accentuated almost too often, and too much, for that matter. Some points tend to hang on things for excessively long times.Despite this, the story was sensational. Great for all ages, it throws different elements in the mixture- a little history here, dash of fiction there.... This tends to spruce up the story and pick up the slower, more uneventful points, making the read much more enjoyable. I have no doubts that 'The Chosen' is one of, if not THE most phenomenal books of its time."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I love this story. I love the warmth, the compassion, the wisdom demonstrated by all four of the main characters. But I do want to note that Potok's depiction of women is flat, cursory, repressed. Women are mothers (or mother substitutes, in the case of the housekeeper) or sisters. They serve food, marry, and get pregnant. There's a half-sentence in which Reuven, the narrator, says he is &quot;dating&quot; and finding it fun, but doesn't romance... rate more than a few words in the world of a normal 19 year old?"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I LOVE this book! I thought about it for weeks after I first read it. This is most definitely worth a read. I learned a lot about Jewish culture that I had never known before and about people in general. I must admit that the book started getting a bit boring when they went into depth about certain things, mainly because sometimes the author went on for pages...but other than that, the book was very, very good."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"After four years of Honors and AP English courses I have had the pleasure of reading many wonderful works by various talented authors. This book, however, is by far one of my favorites. The touching story of these two friends and their heart-wrenching relationships with their fathers brought tears to my eyes. Chaim Potok offers an intimate look into the traditions and everyday lives of two very different Jewish families. Never before have I had such a clear glimpse into these very different worlds. I must be thankful that this wonderful story gave me a greater appreciation for my relationship with my father."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Mr. Potok has done a great job; from the moment he starts the book, til the very last word, I felt as if I were actually part of the story. The way he portrays the character makes it so you feel as if you've known that character for your entire life. This book only goes to show that friendship really is forever, despite what happens in life. I truly hope that readers, young and old, will discover this book, and enjoy it as much as I did.Some words however, were in Hebrew or some other foreign language, and were hard to understand. Context clues didn't help my frusteration. I suggest that a glossary should be added, or maybe a Hebrew-English dictionary.Because of the uncomprehendable words, I am forced to only award this book 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen is a spectacular book and I totally disagree with what someone said as being a total waste of time...Out of a baseball game that nearly became a religious war , two Jewish boys become friends. Danny comes from the strict Hasidic sect that keeps him bound of Orthodoxy. Reuven is brought up by a father patiently aware of the twentieth century. Everything tries to destroy their friendship. But they use Honesty with eachother as a shield. It proves an impenetrable protection. I am 16 years old and studying The Chosen as a literary unit.. I honestly think its one of the best books I've read and I think every teenager and also people of any age should try and read this book..You truely will find this book soul enriching..."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"These CDs were very helpful to my class who have a hard time reading."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This Book was about two kids growing up together and being two different types of Jews during the Holocaust. They started off hateing eachother and bye the end of the book they were best friends. They had a lot of ups and downs that they had to learn how to deal with along the way. This book remindes me of &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;. It remindes me of this because Anne was a Jew in the Holocaust and had to go into hidding. During this book it talks about the differences the two boys have with there religions. They are both Jews but one is a stricter Jew then the other. I enjoyed this book, because it was very enjoyable. It made me think of the hardships people have with there religion. In this book there were two main characters, Danny and Reuven. Danny was a Hasidic Jew. Which was very strict. They wore skull caps and had ear locks. Reuven was an Orhodox Jew. They were normal Jews who acted like normal people. They wors Skull Caps and went to the synagaouge on every saturday. I recomend this book to a lot of people. But, if you don't like to read about this topic then this book isn't for you. On the other hand, if you like to read books about the Holocaust then this book is for you.

I later bought the movie which was very good, but the book was even better. That's why I went on to purchase several other books by Chaim Potok."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The book had a different subject than from what am used to. I had to read it for 8th grade English and about quarter of the class enjoyed it. It was very into the Jewish religion, however, many people didn't know much about it and found it sometimes difficult to understand. The main subject seemed to be the physical silences between charcters that occurred throughout the novel. Many different silences occur through different events in the plot, as different family views get in the way of a friendship. It was a novel that was a bit difficult to understand, and not the best plot I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This former library book is kind of smelly. I could not place it with my other books in case of mold, so it is sitting in the freezer. After a week or 2 I will see if I can read it.

I checked it after a couple days and have hopes for a good outcome."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Although this book's story moves along well, it is pointless.

I should have picked a shorter book as to not waste my time on this."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"in my opinion, The Choosen is a good hook, but not nearly as good as some others that I have read! This novel taught me a lot about the Jewish religion in general, mostly because of Danny and Reuven's differences in opinion. It can drag at some points though! For instance, when Danny and Reuven are forbiden to see each other! And from the time when they begin colleage to the ending, there are some parts where little action takes place! That's why I gave it three stars!!!!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"i was not only dissapointed about this book but bored with every moment of it.

I didn't like the book because it seemed a little unrealistic . I couldn't really relate to the book , because i'm not familiar with Jewish culture and I don't know any Jewish terms. I myself like action books and don't care for any boring Jewish books. there are facts that show that Hasidic people do not get along with other cultures they keep to themselves. So why would Danny try to be friendly with rueven. I don't think any parent would act like that to his child, and the child would be okay with it. I would of like the book if it was a little more exciting. I suggest this book to anybody Jewish or who is interested in Jewish culture."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"worst book EVER.The repetitive inanery of Potok's prose made me want to scoop my eyes out with a dull melon-baller.sample dialogue:Davey: What do you think?Reuven: They're a snooty bunch.D:What do you think about their playing?R: They're lousy.D: They're murderers.[later]D: Well?R: Well what?D: I told you they could hit.R: So you told me. So what?D: I wasn't bragging or anything. I just wanted to know what you thought.R; They can hit.D: They're murderers.and so on, for 50 pages.Unfortunately all the reviewers with insights into the shocking awfulness of this book seem to be 16 and illiterate, which destroys my credibility.

It is a work of art meant for the enrichment of the heart and the soul in pain. For those who live in the tender places of the heart, this work is for you. It is a story of love and truth and deep meaning. Beautifully written and timeless in its depth and simplicity, The Chosen is a authentic and beautiful and compassionate book.The metaphor of God's love within the silence and pain is for me, something far beyond helpful, and something I could never articulate properly.But I do feel that this book is a Divine gift to those who need it."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I had to read this book for an academic decathlon, and i thought it was very well written and complex. the characters are multi-layered and change throughout the book. at times, though, i got a little lost and confused, and had to read the same page several times. i dont know much about jewish culture or customs, or the controversy about a jewish state, but i still understood the book. i even learned a little. i would reccomend this book, but if you like shallow reading, dont read it. if you enjoy good literature, then by gosh, read it!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I found this book to be both highly moving and extremely educational. The characterizations are vivid and truthful. This would be a wonderful text for an adept high school literature class, but that doesn't mean it shoudl be confined to that purpose. &quot;The Chosen&quot; is a book for everyone."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen encompasses some of the most important ideas that human beings face during the course of their lifetimes. Potok investigates the theme of self-discovery in the growth of both Reuven and Danny as individuals. These characters start out with blinders on in regards to the real world, but due to a high intellect are able to see past what their social surroundings have hidden from them. Reuven has an easier time with this than Danny mostly because of his father's guidance while Danny on the other hand must rely on books at the library.The concept of questioning one's own religion or lack of is apparent when Reuven compares his particular sect of Jews to the orthodox followers of Reb Saunders. Reuven wonders if the Hasidic ways are really right which leads him to examine his own beliefs. Danny even takes this so far as to break away from the traditional Jewish hierarchy which would have forced him to fill in the position of tzaddick and starts on his way to becoming a psychologist instead. This situation illustrates the struggle to find an answer in religion, the same struggle that is common to all people.The competition between two similar groups of individuals as seen in the early baseball scene can be compared to almost any fight between two types of people. Potok uses the friction between the orthodox Jews and the \\"apikorism\\" to remind the reader of how out of hand things can get when people take small ideas such as physical or religious differences too seriously. We can use the situation to help us recognize the inconsequential issues that we face in our daily lives."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The chosen by Chaim Potok is a novel that traces the development of a young protagonist. What makes the chosen so different from other books is its focus on the development of two main characters instead of one. While the story is told through the point of view Reuven Malter, Danny Saunders is an integral part of the plot. They are both Jewish teens growing up in New York City during the time of World War Two. However, Reuven is the son of a more modern, open-minded man, while Danny Saunders is the son of a strict Hasidic rabbi.The story begins at a baseball game with Reuven's team playing against Danny's team. When Danny steps to bat he hits the ball straight into Reuven's face, shattering his glasses and sending him to the hospital. Danny visits Reuven in the hospital and at first Reuven doesn't want to talk to Danny, but eventually the two of them overcome their differences and become friends. Their friendship faces many obstacles, including prejudice from both sects of Jews, but Danny and Reuven stay close, even through a period where they are literally not allowed to speak to each other. This friendship is an essential part of the story and is used to show how people from different backgrounds can accept each other's differences and use them to grow as individuals.Religion is another major part of the story and is consistently used as a means of showing the similarities and differences between Danny and Reuven. Danny's father wants his son to take over as tzaddik, or leader of the Hasidic community when he gets old enough. While Reuven's father is less strict about what he wants his son to do and will except and decision he makes. The friendship between them helps each boy do what they want to do and not allow religion or their father's to decide their fate.The theme of sight is an important one in this book. When Reuven is hit in the eye, he first begins to look beyond the strange appearance of the Hasidic Jews and let go of his prejudice. Potok stresses the importance of looking beyond appearances and accepting people as they are."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The transition from adolescence to manhood is perfectly captured in this story. This novel is about Danny Saunders, a teen from a Hasidic family, and Reuven Malter, a teen from an Orthodox Jewish family. These two boys had never met each other because they went to different schools. Danny and Reuven had only heard negative things about each other, therefore they had somewhat of a bad perception of each other. Both of the boys met each other through a school vs. school baseball game. During the game, Reuven steps up to bat while Danny is pitching, and Danny is knocked out after being hit by Reuven in the eye with a baseball. Reuven later visits Danny in the hospital and tells him the reason he hit him with the baseball. Danny has trouble accepting Reuven's presence and his explanation, but after a while Danny gave in. During the course of this book these two friends learn from each other how to follow and practice their religion, how to cherish the relationship they have with their families, how to succeed in school, how to make life changing decisions and how to handle important matters in their lives.This book can teach you to do many things in life. For example, it can make you see how little you are involved in the practice of your religion or how poorly you are trying to succeed in school. This story about these boys can bring you closer to your family if you're not already. This story is not only intended to intrigue and orient teens, but anyonewho comes across this treasure. Once you lay eyes on the first page, you won't want to put down this book."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"\\"One of the most compelling novels that I have read is written by Chaim Potok. The Chosen is so well-written you won't be able to put it down, compiled with undulating emotions, it will make you reach for the tissues. The turmoil of a friendship caused by one father's selfishness teaches the reader about the trials and tribulations between Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish religions. Filled with love and compassion it will make you want to rejoice and maybe even shed a few tears. Chaim Potok gives the reader exactly what they want, and even more. The novel really opened up my eyes and gave me an insight on how people react to those of different religions. The Chosen helped me to understand the Jewish religion, while teaching me to cherish friendships. Potok brings hope and gratitude to the things we have and those that we wish to have. I recommend this book to everyone, because it not only educates the reader on religion, but it teaches how to love and respect people for who they are.\\""},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"\\" Touching and sentimental, all together one of my favorite novels. The journeys and paths Reuven and Danny had to take really hit home. It had so much to do with real life, and there were so many things I could realate to; Jewish or not I felt that The Chosen focussed on life in general. The Jewish society, picayune to some and important to others, is finally \\"unmasked\\" and everything you wanted to know is finally being told. I found that by reading this book my eyes were opened and I saw a whole new world filled with strength and wisdom. Chaim Potok gave me something I can carry with me through my experiences yet to come. Fresh and mature, I would recommend this book to ANYONE interested in finding the truths of our society that are concealed in Potoks writings pertaining to Orthodox and Russian Hasidic Jewish cultures. Read this book and I garauntee you will be given the same gift that will open your eyes and your heart to Jewish beliefs and the strengths in friendship. \\""},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen is either loved or hated by those who read it. In my English class, we read this book, and I really was the only one who had a neutral stance on it. The story is about two young Jewish adolescents from very different backgrounds living in Brooklyn with their two fathers. I suppose I shall list PROS and CONS I have found with this book.PROS: Very insightful about relationships, discrimination, the power of religion, and different branches of Judaism. Characters you can sympathize with.CONS: Slow moving and tedious to the less keen reader, and some of the characters are too easy to dislike (until you get to know them and their motives a little better).Well, I think this was a good enough book. Go out to your local library and give and give it a chance!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen is an awesome book. The author Chaim Potok writes about these two Jewish boys who became friends from a weird incident. The story takes place in Brooklyn, New York during World War II. Although the two boys, Danny and Reuven are both Jews, they have completely different lives. Danny's family comes from a Hasidic rabbi, while Reuven is a traditional Jew to a Zionist father. But they discover that what they want in life is the opposite of what their fathers are expecting from them. This book explores the struggles that Danny and Reuven go through. Even though they are both Jewish, they have many spiritual clashes with their fathers. The author makes the two characters very realistic. The word of the author makes you think that you are another character in the story. As I was reading the book, I felt like I knew the characters already and could feel what they were going through. It is very interesting to read about how such a good friendship grows. There are many obstacles the two overcome in order to keep their friendship alive. The end of this book is very exciting and keeps you in suspense. I really enjoyed this book because I learned a lot about Jewish culture. Although, at times some parts do become confusing since I am not familiar with Jewish concepts. It put my life someway into a different prospective. It's a funny thing because I receive the same pressure from my family as Danny and Reuven. I also think of my relationship with my friends and how similar it is compared to Danny's and Reuven's relationship. I highly recommend this book to anyone. It does not matter if you are Jewish or not. I found it interesting to learn about a different religion. This is a great book that will make you never want to put it down."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This story was impressive because of the myriad of themes it covers in such a short, comprehensive read: the voyage of boyhood to manhood, friendship, compassion, faith, family ties, the pursuit of knowledge, loyalty, respect, etc. Although the story involves the lives and beliefs of two Jewish families, it is easy enough to understand for those not of the Jewish faith. The theme best covered is the nature of parental love and it made the book a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This is one of those books that come back to you. The thoughts of the readers, the highlighted moments, their downfalls and upheavals. I just want to share with you the main point that Potok is trying to make in the book.&quot;Human beings do not live forever. We live less than the time it takes to blink an eye, if we measure our lives against eternity. So it may be asked what value is there to a human life. There is so much pain in the world. What does it mean to have to suffer SO MUCH...if our lives are nothing more than the blink of an eye?I learned a long time ago that the blink of an eye itself is nothing. But the eye that blinks, THAT is something. A span of life is nothing. But the man who lives that span, HE is something. He can fill that tiny span with meaning, so it's quality is immeasureable though the quanity may be insignificant. Do you understand what I am saying? A man must fill his life with meaning, meaning is not automatically given to life. It is hard work to fill one's life with meaning. THAT I do not think you understand yet.A LIFE FILLED WITH MEANING IS WORTHY OF REST. I want to be worthy of rest when I am no longer here.&quot;THAT is what The Chosen is about."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I'm used to reading plot-driven books, usually with plenty of action, so I wasn't sure how I was going to do with character-driven novel. I shouldn't have worried--Chaim Potok is capable of turning a baseball game between boys into a heated, pitched battle and a Hasidic Shabat dinner into a confrontation filled with suspense. Potok also does a marvelous job of inviting the reader into the world of Hasidic Judaism, with its curled earlocks and long beards, its disdain for outsiders(goyim), and its followers' deep and abiding love for their rabbis and the Talmud.Ultimately, however, the book isn't about Judaism. it's about stuff we can all relate to: friendship despite differences, children who love their fathers but choose paths which challenge their upbringing (and the parents who struggle in turn with these children), conflict between deeply engrained belief and the new discoveries that challenge them. Potok creates believable, loveable characters. This is the first book to make me cry in a long time.Here's an excerpt that struck a chord within me:&quot;Human beings do not live forever...we live less than the time it takes to blink an eye, if we measure our lives against eternity. so it may be asked what value there is to a human life.

He can fill that tiny span with meaning, so its quality is immeasurable though its quantity may be insignificant...A man must fill his life with meaning, meaning is not automatically given to life. It is hard work to fill one's life with meaning.&quot;The bottom line: if you haven't read this book, get on it!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I listened to this book in the audio download edition and my comments pertain specifically to that edition.The Chosen is a classic that I've meant to read for years. I finally took the plunge with the audio edition. I'm not sure if it was the slow-moving story or the reader, but it took me a long time to get through the book.The story is understandably a classic of both coming of age literature and Jewish literature. It tells the story of the friendship between Reuven, an Orthodox Jewish teenager, and Danny, a Hassidic teen and brilliant Torah scholar who is heir to the rabbinate of his sect. Although the Hassids and other Jews do not usually interact, Danny and Reuven become friends after an accident playing baseball on rival teams, and remain close through several years of high school and college. Both boys struggle with issues of growing up, what they want to be versus their fathers' wishes for them (Danny more so than Reuven) and in this way the story is a universal one. However it is also of a very specific time and place, one of the American Jewish experience as World War II came to an end, the true horrors of the HOlocaust came to light, and the drama of Israel's founding was played out. The story offered a new insight to me on that time and I enjoyed that aspect.However, I was underwhelmed by the narrator Jonathan Davis' performance. It was a bit too monotonal for my tastes and had a hard time holding my attention. However the book itself is quiet and moves at a stately pace so I don't know how much of it is the pacing of the book or the choices of the narrator. I never abandoned the book entirely but found myself taking breaks to listen to more exciting books or podcasts, and then returning.Still it was a book well worth reading and I am glad I finally did so. I may tackle more of Potok's work, however, I'll probably opt for the print version over the audio."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I confess that, unable to have a fresh Harry Potter for a long plane trip, I was just looking for a book to pass the time. I saw \\"The Chosen\\" in an audiobook listing and decided to go for it. I liked the movie, especially Rod Steiger's portrayal of Reb Saunders. I was anticipating a fuller story, as books are usually chopped up for the screen play.I was pleasantly surprised. The narrator spoke well and the story had much detail. I found myself being drawn into the story and back in time. There were many historical portions of the story that gave me insight into my parents' backgrounds growing up in the US.I was annoyed that several scenes in the movie were not from the book (e.g., the Hasidic wedding and the party where Reuven's dad has his stroke (heart attack in the book)). I felt that the book's story line more than satisfactorily brought out the plot points.You probably do not have to be Jewish to appreciate this story, but I think that it helps. It is a good story about two fathers and two sons. My non-Jewish wife liked both the movie and the book, so I guess that you can never tell."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"In The Chosen we are brought inside the world of World War II and post-war Brooklyn, and get a chance to see both the Hassidic side and the more liberal yet still Orthodox Jewish side that was the backbone of the Zionist movement of the time. It offers fascinating insights to the thinking of both groups.At the same time we get to crawl inside the head and life of a young boy, Reuven Malther. He is an excellent student and well-liked, well adjusted boy who is being raised by his widowed father. A Hassidic boy of the same age, a young genius, named Danny Saunders clocks him with a powerful hit during a softball game between their two schools, and Reuven lands at the hospital fighting for his sight. Danny comes to apologise to him, Reuven regains his sight, and they overcome their initial hostility by slowly developing a deep friendship and mutual respect.This is a story about the differences between people and peoples, about friends and sons and fathers, and it is a story about relationships and misunderstandings. The Jewishness of the boys is interesting, the historical perspectives (World War II, the birth of Israel as a country) are interesting, too, but the story is a universal one. Chaim Potek is a wonderful story teller who keeps the action moving while tying all these threads together beautifully."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen was a great book, written by a great author. I finished this book in a matter of two weeks and I am still thinking about it. The book was so good, at night before I went to bed at night I thought I would read a chapter. That didn't always work out, I would just keep going through chapters, until I realized that it was close to eleven o'clock or sometimes even midnight. The book was so good I couldn't put it down.I found I liked Chaim Potok's way of descriptive writing, explaining every aspect of the novel and every scene in geat detail, not seeming to miss anything, or leave anything untouched. At the beginning of the book, you see a great example of this within the first few pages. After that its just captivating. Some parts were really heart-wrenching and others were intense, such as in the baseball game in the beginning of the novel. Chaim Potok makes you feel what the characters are feeling and makes you want to get back at the person whose hurting them, in some way, but you can't because its just a book. A great example of this is Danny's &quot;evil&quot; father, or so I thought until the end, when he explained his ways, and everything came into perspective, like pieces of a puzzle falling into place evenly and smoothly.I really like Mr. Potok's way of writing and will probably be reading another one of his novel's very soon. You can tell in his writing that he likes the subjects that he is talking about, and that he does a lot of research on them, or that he is just very well informed about the topics that he speaks of. That is what makes his writing even more unique."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The readers sit, captivated by the novel, The Chosen. This summer I was one of those readers. I think that the reasons for this captivation are the two boys' friendship, the changing of their understanding of religion, and the phases of growing into men. All of the reasons above come together in friendship because their friendship changes, as they understand religion and manhood. These changes in friendship are especially hard for Rueven because he has to understand Danny and Danny's father. These misunderstandings between Rueven and Danny's father make the conflict very exciting. One of the major arguments that make the boys' friendship very tense is about Zionism. This argument is between Rueven and Danny's father. The book is also very powerful because as you go through it you begin to understand the politics that are going on at that time. Rueven starts talking about Zionism and how so many people want it. Reb Saunders, Danny's father, becomes very angry, and comes back with a speech that ends with, \\"True Jews do not say such things!\\" (199). This makes Rueven think about what a true Jew is; although Rueven is very religious. It also makes Rueven think about their contrast in thoughts before speaking to Reb Saunders again. Their friendship changes as well because Danny doesn't want his father to get so angry, but he secretly agrees with Rueven on Zionism. This is an example of a religions and political phase changing a friendship phase in their lives. The Chosen is a coming of age book. The main point the author, Chaim Potok, is trying to get across is the change from boyhood to adulthood and how this change affects the boys' friendship and their friends. The book changes from a childhood story to a deep moving story about two men. This is done by starting out with a childhood activity: playing baseball. As the book progresses the boys' conflicts become more sophisticated and their ideas about religion change as well. An example of a younger conflict is Rueven not wanting to become friends with Danny although Danny is truly sorry for what he did. This is resolved by Rueven's father who knows Danny. He tells Rueven to befriend Danny and finally Rueven gives in. An example of an older, more sophisticated conflict is about Danny. He should become the next rabbi, but he wishes to go to college instead. Reb Saunders does not want him to go, and Danny does not want to see his father angry with him. He decides to go to college, convinced by Rueven and his own inner feelings. This is a conflict only an older and more mature boy would have. Through these changes the boys' friendship really changes. When Rueven is in the hospital he really grows from a boy into a teenager. He does this by learning that Danny is not an enemy. As they grow into men their friendship goes through phases of talking and not talking. This is because Reb Saunders forbids Danny to talk with someone who is in favor of Zionism. I think that when they are not talking they grow and learn more. This is because they have to learn to keep their friendship alive in silence. The Chosen is an amazing book for many other reasons as well, such as the politics, Danny's regular reading periods with Rueven's father, and Rueven's father learning to deal with his health. The ones I have discussed are the ones that I think hold the book together. I think that Chaim Potok did a very good job at getting his message of how boys grow up and the different phases of their feelings that help them grow into men across. The story really draws you into the book so you are living with the boys, trying to help the along. I really enjoyed this book and I would greatly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Chaim Potok is a guiness. This book is the most wonderfully moving and well written peice of literature that I have ever read. I am a reform Jew and this book taught me what my Orthodox cousins must live like. Even if you are not a Jew, the themes in this book go so much deeper. Everyone can learn about being a person from reading this book."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I read this book my freshman year of high school and I loved it. The only assigned reading book I've enjoyed this much so far. Then, I was happy to see it on a suggested summer reading list for the summer before my junior year, being very proud I'd already read it. So if you're in high school and looking for a book that's not too challenging but not easy and actually interesting, this is it."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This is a story I would definitely recommend. Brilliantly written, it teaches the history of Judaism in a way that makes everyone relate- through the unlikely friendship of two boys from different backgrounds. I agree with the poster below me that the basic premise of this book is one everyone can understand, whether or not you are Jewish.I only wish I had read this book before I read \\"In The Beginning\\". While I loved \\"In The Beginning\\", there were many terms and references to Jewish history I found confusing, but they were explained in this book. Potok is a wonderful writer whose works speak to everyone."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I read this book because it was on the reading list at George Wythe University. I loved this book because even though I wasn't familiar with baseball or Jewish religions, I could easily follow the plot and enjoy the strong characters, friendship and parenting styles behind the scenes.Danny and Reuven transformed strong hostility into friendship, which was amazing! How Danny was acting at the baseball game and his seemingly intentional injury on Reuven's eye would have been unpardonable. It wasn't intentional and Danny didn't even know why he wanted to kill Reuven. He gathered his courage and went to apologize to Reuven. It was of course a shock to Reuven, but with his father's kind guidance, Reuven developed listening ears not only to Danny but Danny's father later on.Danny's father and Reuven's father were both Jewish, but they had a totally different approach to find a meaning on the death of six million Jewish people. They both deeply loved those Jewish and wanted to do the best for them. Since Danny's father was in a very visibly respected position in his neighborhood, I was wondering if Danny's father was going to win the battle but it wasn't so. Reuven's father won more support by publishing his opinions and making public speeches. I myself should be more involved in the government, so they were good examples to me, no matter what the result, to fight for our beliefs.I didn't know much difference between \\"mind\\" and \\"soul\\" until I read this book, but the difference was a huge deal. Danny, an heir to his father's rabbinic position, has a brilliant mind with photographic memory, but not a soul to understand other people's anguish. Danny does not want to and cannot be a rabbi without a soul. But because of his father's intensive Torah education, Danny was able to become a tzaddik in the world, whatever he chose as an occupation.There was a constant criticism on Reb Saunders' way of raising Danny, but I wonder if Danny would have chosen to be a rabbi if he was raised by Reuven's father. As a parent, I do believe that parenting matters, but I wonder if things happen just because, like a fate.Like I said, characters in this book are very strong. I do not know personally anybody who is like a character in this book. Maybe Danny's mother and sister, maybe. I know now that I cannot stereotype Jewish people anymore.Since the description of everything was very intense, I was worried that the author was going to describe Reuven's injury intensely, but thank goodness, it was pretty much omitted out and I was not grossed out. I thought this book was very focused on emotions and very much in style ;)Over all, I was constantly entertained and educated throughout this book. I recommend this book with 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"in reading \\"The Chosen\\" i was very pleased with the book. The plot was very touching as we saw the boys (Danny and Reuven) grow from the grounds of a baseball field to the advanced college campus. Their friendship was very strong and was normally able to overcome most obstacles...except for the silence that Danny and Reb Saunders had between them. Mr. Malter brought Rueven up in talking, so Rueven began to hate the silence simply because he couldn't understand it. i believe that that applies to much of life. If we don't understand something completely, we tend to write it off as bad, hard, or tend to hate it. i would highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a good book for any occasion."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Two Brooklyn Jewish boys live a few blocks away, but a world apart. One feels imprisoned by his family's long-held tradition. The other one is secretly very lonely. Although they hate each other at first, they grow to become best friends. This is the story of The Chosen by Chaim Potok. It takes place in the mid to late 1950's, and it is the story of Reuven Malter, a Modern Orthodox Jew, and Danny Saunders. Danny is destined to become a tzaddik, the spiritual connection between his people and their God, just like his father has become. The only problem is that he wants to be a psychologist. I thought this book was very, very good. It managed to be pretty modern, but Potok also weaved in much of the Jewish philosophy, customs, and history. And that, along with the characters, is what drives the story. These things give the story power, they give it drive, and they add deepness to it. The characters are truly amazing as well. Danny is so many things. He's friendly, but can be cold. He's surrounded by people constantly, and yet he feels rather lonely. He's strong, but only Reuven can help him to break free from his \\"imprisonment.\\" Reuven is popular. He's scholarly. He's a very good baseball player. But beneath it all, he is rather sensitive to and troubled by the world around him. He doesn't really feel like he has a contemporary who he can relate to, who can lift his fear. And Danny seems to do that, slowly but surely. Both their fathers are extremely interesting as well. Both are sort of mini-celebrities. Reuven's father is a Modern Orthodox professor, as well as columnist on Jewish texts. He is constantly criticized and very frail, but ambitious. He serves as Reuven's conscience and source of wisdom throughout the book. Reb Saunders, Danny's dad and a Hasidic Jew, is the spiritual leader of his people. By far the book's most exciting character, the rebbe is a tyrant one minute, and gentle the next. The book gains a lot from Danny's strained relationship with his father. It provides a window to each of their minds, and it adds to the conflict. Danny isn't so much angry at his father, he just feels confused and trapped. The storyline I felt could be slow at times (the whole hospital part sort of drags on somewhat), but it never seemed to lose my interest. The Jewish culture Potok injects into the story is absolutely fascinating, and you weren't really sure what was going to happen next. I wouldn't recommend this story to anyone that gets bored with history or internal conflict. Even then, I would encourage them to try it, just because it expands the reader's cultural horizons and it is so great.After I read this, I wanted more of it. There is a sequel called The Promise, which has most of the same characters, and is just as good (though in different ways). So I'd have to give this story ****** out of 5."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Although i read this book for a class, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The book hooks in the reader by opening out with a tension-filled baseball game. Needless to say, this book is a real page-turner. Furthermore, the book was a very enriching read. The often overlooked customs, history and varying religions of the Jewish religion is covered in a way that doens't put the reader to sleep. The tale itself is also very well-developed, as it shows the clashing between two Jewish realms.The only downfall of the book in my mind, were the unrealistic qualities of a few of the characters. It seemed as though they were too smart for being just teenagers at time, and many of their discussions seemed unrealistic.This however, didn't detract too much from the read, and I'd recommend this to any adult-level reader. Once again; it's a page turner (took me only about 3 days) and well worht the read."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This is an absorbing novel about two Jewish boys, Reuven (Bobby) and Daniel, taken place in NY in the late 1940s during the time of WWII.The book is written from Bobby's view. It begins explaining that Bobby and Danny didn't know of each other for 15 years of their lives even though they lived within 5 blocks of each other. Daniel lived among Russian Hasidic Jews (black hats and coats, beards and earlocks). Bobby is a Modern Orthodox Jew with an intellectual, Zionist father.The boys met during a ball game. They were enemies on opposing teams but grew to be best friends as close as David and Jonathan. Reuven was a pitcher and Daniel was the batter. Daniel hit a ball that landed in Bobby's face breaking his glasses and causing glass to go into his eye. He required surgery. The rest of the story is about their close friendship and problems because of their belief and family differences during high school and through the college years.I was fascinated about the boys' education. First, by the amazing amount of time each boy spent with their father's studying Torah. Secondly, by the amount of time Torah was studied in their college years. On a typical day the boys studies Torah from 9am to 3pm then began academic studies at 3:15 pm to 6 or 7 pm. They certainly put God's Word as a priority!The end of the story had me in tears and anxious to purchase another book by Chaim Potok."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Like few authors have, Chaim Potok vividly illustrates the precious bond of friendship and its profound impact on choosing one's destiny as well as one's path to becoming a man. From worldly issues of war to personal issues of faith, Potok delves deep to provide a moving story.Potok subtly but brilliantly depicts the inability of humans to get along with each other. In the midst of WWII when the Jews are experiencing extreme persecution, still they bicker with members of their own faith over rather trivial issues. While the central conflict is between the two Jewish sects, many other more underlying conflicts exist. Potok illustrates the existence of conflicts inside conflicts thoroughly enough to show that that this situation does not just apply to the Jewish faith. From a Hasidic Jew to Liberal Jew, Hindu to Punjab, Shinto to Taoist, Chinese Buddhist to Shin Buddhist, humans have an incapability of keeping peace and good nature not only with each other but within their own faith as well.On a less global matter, Potok also portrays the difficulties of the transition from adolescent to adult from the perspectives of two Jewish boys. A young Hasidic Jew named Danny struggles with choosing his path in life. He wants to please his rabbi father by becoming a rabbi himself, but at the same time yearns to have the close bonded relationship his best friend Reuven has with his father so he can tell him that his true passions in life lie away from a strict Jewish life. Reuven struggles with his father's illness as well. Their paths to manhood are twisted and rocky, but each boy makes the trip with the other's friendship.The theme of friendship is explored comprehensively as well. Despite Potok's tone of multiple conflicts, the two boys of very different Jewish background come together to form a bond carried through the toughest of times. During a long-term separation they both find a piece of themselves missing and are not really happy until reunited.The novel is an inspirational story of a struggle between paving your own path in life and walking one paved, while all at the same time making sure the path leads you to happiness. Potok always makes sure you feel for the character in every situation and in turn teaches lessons to be applied to all of our lives."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"A novel so fresh, honest and symbolic as to reach below our cultural appearance to pierce the depths of the human spirit must be labeled as striking. When indulging in the journey of two teenage boys as they tread through the complicated web of the Jewish religion, one cannot help but be swept away by a tide of impressive literature. Filled with an abundance of figurative language, from a fateful baseball game, set in the heart of a great American pastime, to the last religious debate, The Chosen puts to light the finest inner struggle; the bond and duty of a son to his father, and perhaps more importantly, to himself. Danny Saunders becomes, through the course of the novel, a most prominent example of a mind begging to be set free. And as his once archrival (Reuven Malter) descends from the realm of a more liberal Jewish sect, Danny opens his eyes to the world outside of his religion. Danny discovers the courage to explore the many facets of knowledge separate from Talmud.Chaim Potok slips in so many hidden emblems behind Billy's unseeing eyes and pressed between the pages of Danny's psychology textbooks, that even the most efficient hunter cannot help but miss a few of his carefully aimed shots. By indulging in this novel, the inner recesses of the human race merge into a single, striving being, yearning for our own place in the trite society of the 21st century. With the comprehension of this simple yet complicated tale, comes the ability to see beyond the physical world into the depths underneath. The book eloquently presents the true struggle of the human spirit through such characters as Reb Saunders, the father who lives through his remarkable son, and Danny Saunders, as he searches for his own path, separate from his father's. The Chosen enriches each individual's own quest for destiny. Just as the day the first ink spread the title on a cover, today's world could learn a great deal from the trials and triumphs of Danny Saunders, Reuven Malter, and each of their lives."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The measure of a writer is the diversity of people whose hearts he or she can reach. By this standard, Chaim Potok was a genius. His story of a Jewish boy growing up in 1940's Brooklyn spoke directly to me, a Catholic girl growing up in small-town West Texas at the most recent turn of the century. The story of unlikely friendship was beautiful and one to which I think many people can relate. Who would have thought the son of a Zionist and the son of a Hasidic rebbe would be such good friends? Their beliefs were as different as two Jewish people's could be. They didn't- but God did. That is clear in this book. It meant a great deal to me, as my own best friend is a member of the Church of Christ. We're as opposite in beliefs as two Christians can be. But we help each other. That's what friendship is- that's what The Chosen is about."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book is very close to me. I was easily able to relate.The religious struggles Reuven and Danny go through are accurate.This book is a window into the Jewish-American culture durring WWII. This book helped me to see that I am not the only Jewish-American teen who has to go through finding a grasp on my religion, making friends, and dealing with parents who have aspirations for you that you just do not want to fulfill. The Chosen served as a guide for me, and it is close to my heart, a must read!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I read this book for outside reading in my English 10H class, and i loved it. The prose was wonderful and i really appreciated the themes. The ending almost made me cry. It is true that there is not much action in the story, but that is because this book is about friendship and the relations between fathers and sons, not about runaway trains and hijacked nukes. If you want action, go buy the latest John Grisham or Stephen King. This is a really moving book for those who want reading material with more depth. It is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I read &quot;The Chosen&quot; as an assignment preceeding my becoming a Bat Mitzvah. The basic story was very easy to understand for a 12-year-old, and it described the evolving frienship of two once-enemies, now best buds. There are three books within the novel, and as the second book culminates and the third book starts, the text begins to get &quot;heavy&quot;. The average reader easily becomes distracted with the in-depth writing about Hasidic Jews, the Talmud, and other subjects pertaining to the Jewish religion. Even I, a well-educated Jew for my age, was confused. In a nutshell, &quot;The Chosen&quot; deserves four stars for its vivid description and interesting plot; however, it was a incredibly intricate."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"What a beautiful book! Haven't read anything so moving for a very long time. The novel concentrates on four characters, two adolescent sons and their fathers. Like in 'My Name is Asher Lev', Chaim Potok proves to be a master in character development: Danny's father is one of the most interesting personalities I have ever encountered in a book, and one of the most tragic! (I wonder if he could also create a female character?! As in 'Asher Lev', the women stay in the background. Half the book focuses on the conflict between Danny and his ultra-orthodox father, a few pages get devoted to the relationship between Danny and his younger brother, but when Reuven tries to talk about Danny's sister, his answer is: &quot;....Let's not talk about my sister,...&quot; (p200), and from the mother we only know, that she has a heart condition.) There are many more parallels to 'Asher Lev': Again we have the conflict between the Orthodox Jewish way of life and how the more 'Assimilated' (not sure if this is the appropriate word!?) Jews live. The conflict is mainly religous, but overspills into politics and escalates when the Zionists succeed in founding Israel.I don't agree with some of the reviews suggesting that you need to be Jewish to understand/be interested in the book (If you don't have a clue, like me, it'll make you more interested).I finished the book in under two days, was simply glued to it!! READ IT!!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Many readers of this book have commented on how the theme of friendship is treated by the author in this novel. I was, however, more deeply moved by an element of the book which is so much present throughout the story as to appear like one more character, even though it is not a person: the Talmud, to which we are introduced almost from the first page. The Talmud is a distilation of wisdom, the core of knowledge that jewish sages have collected and handed down from generation to generation for centuries.What better thing can a father do than to try to teach his youn son such words of wisdom?This is really for me the essence of the novel -the different ways Daniel's and Reuven's fathers have of transmitting this knowledge....and the differetn ways the two young protagonists have of learning and applying what they have learnt. Learning and knowledge are so much the focus of the novel -a novel that is, in my opinion, deceptively simple and charming- that the author places the climax at the point when the university professor asks Reuven about a particularly difficult passage of the Talmud.....and this is done in such a masterful way that you find yourself sitting at the edge of your seat with expectation.The way the conflict is solved (or explained) and the final conversation with Daniel's father made me cry like no book has for ages ! Chaim Potok's is a quiet, simple, totally unpretentious wisdom."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"These two very religious Jewish boys in the throes of adolescence at the \\"end\\" of WWII in America will win your heart, if not your soul. They have so much in common, and so much that tears them apart. Their relationships with their fathers, their relationships with each other, create heartwarming and challenging memories that are as relevant today as the day they were written. With deep insight into the challenges that Zionism created at its inception, it becomes far more easier to comprehend its continued complexities today. Highly recommended, beautifully written, a very pleasurable reading experience."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen is a heart warming tale of two friends, Danny and Robert, who meet after a baseball accident. They both have completely different fathers and Jewish beliefs, but overcome these challenges to become great friends. Though the book is a little under 300 pages, it will keep you on the edge of your seat. I like the plot between the friends and it it will keep you reading. The style is the same as some of his other books such as My Name is Asher Lev. They are both about Jewish families and both take place in Brooklyn, New York. They also take place in the 1940's and post World War 2. It is a book you will surely enjoy and love. It is a keeper!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book takes you to a world you aren't familiar with, even though it is in Brooklyn, New York. It is about a community of Hasiddic Jews in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. These are people who continue to dress as their ancestors did in Poland and Russia many generations ago. The men wear dark suits in all weather, hats, long beards, and &quot;side curls&quot; or &quot;ear locks&quot;, hair hanging down past their ears. They separate themselves from others by their noticeably different appearance. In The Chosen, we get to meet them. This is a much better way to meet them than by reading about the murder of an Australian Hasiddic Jew visiting Crown Heights, a tragedy that happened not many years ago.The whole Hasiddic movement was born in Poland as a response to incredible cruelty shown to the Jews by their Christian neighbors. The Jews needed a Messiah - quick! In The Chosen, we meet a modern day &quot;tzaddik&quot;, closest thing to a Messiah that this community can have. He is a wise man, a community leader and rabbi, who enjoys the unquestioned belief and adulation of his community.The tzaddik in this book is Reb Saunders. His son Danny is &quot;the chosen&quot;, the crown prince of this community, next to inherit the mantle of &quot;tzaddik&quot; after his revered father is gone. Danny Saunders is Americanized though. He is a very good baseball player, and he is interested in secular knowledge like the writings of Freud. The question becomes - is Danny Saunders going to continue the tradition and become tzaddik or will he become an American.Danny is brought up in silence. His father rarely talks to him. This is a drastic way to bring up a child. It is done to bring Danny into contact with loneliness and suffering, so he can be a more compassionate tzaddik when his time comes.If you like learning about cultures unlike your own, you will probably enjoy this book a lot. It takes place in the late 1940s but the Hasiddic people are alive and well today, in Crown Heights and in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, among other places. They look, of course, just the same as always."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I first read this book when I was 15, and reread it four years later, and was as moved by the words and story that Chaim Potok wove. This book gave me a deeper understanding of two very different Jewish traditions, and Potok's words are poignant and elonquent.The most amazing thing about this book is that I felt so much for the characters, Danny and Reuben, who struggle with their self-identities and desires, and how two boys with different traditions were able to find a common meeting ground. Danny's struggle with both his particular beliefs and his thirst for knowledge are touching and frustrating, and means so much in terms of his familial and personal development.Read this book--it's touching and powerful, and I believe that despite its melancholy tone, it is one of the most enlightening books I have ever read; both in terms of religion and human desire."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I am a secular Jew - a \\"jewish goy' as Daniel's father - Rev Saunders would call me. This book has opened up a world to me that I want to explore - my jewish history.

The book tackles universal and controversial topics. Growing up, religion, becoming an adult, tolerance, but overall it is about the relationship between fathers and sons. If you are a parent you should definitely read this, if you are not you should too, it will make you reflect in your past, present and future choices in life.Spend sometime with Danny and Reuven, they will enrich your life."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This was required reading for my World Religions class. I didn't like the teacher much, hadn't been impressed by his choices before, and had been expecting another novel about the woes of the Holocaust period, so I was relunctant to pick this book up, but once I did, I just couldn't put it down.The Chosen is a novel about two boys (Reuven Malter and Daniel Saunders) on the brink of manhood (15 years old, both of them) who are struggling with the values of the community they live in. Danny is a member of the Hasidic community- his father is the Rebbe (which, for those of you who don't know, is different from the rabbi, and is I believe, the second most powerful leader next to God in the religious community), and Danny will eventually inherit that position from his father. However, there is a problem . . . Danny doesn't want to be a rebbe, he wants to be a psychologist, despite his obligation and the fact that his father apparently thinks that the world outside of Judaism is wicked. Danny spends his afternoons shut up in the library reading because he's driven by a desire to know about the world. The novel essentially centers around the struggle about Danny's desires and that of his father for him, between Danny and Reuven's friendship, and, of course, the Holocaust and WWII, which are both going on throughout the novel, though surprisingly, Potok leaves out any mention of the Holocaust whatsoever until the end of the novel.The Chosen is an intriguing read- not something you can read on the bus to school, or on the plane to whatever destination, though. This is something you have to set aside at least an hour to read through, but it's well worth it. Not only do you get a fascinating story, you'll learn plenty about Jewish history as well without having to sit through hour and a half long classes listening to a professor droning away."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The concept of this book is good. The author tends to drag on in the middle of the book, making the separation between friends long and boring. He could have eliminated a good portion and made the book a better read. I could not see why Reuven did not make new friends, but continued to pine for Danny as if he were a girl. That part of the book seemed unrealistic."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"After spending part of my summer vaction reading Chaim Potok's novel The Chosen, I felt that I learned more about the Jewish religion, but I was also a little disappointed. The Chosen is a novel of two Jewish boys growing up under different Jewish customs in the 1940's. Reuven Malter, the main character in the book is an Orthodox Jew, and Danny Saunders, the other boy is Hasidic. Since the two are different in religious ways, Danny being more serious about his beliefs, and Reuven being more relaxed, there is a lot of tension between the two at first, but they get around that and evolve to become best friends. I felt disappointed after reading this because I expected much more. It has wonderful reviews, so I expected non-stop excitement. At times the book was fun to read and interesting, but most of the time it was rather monotonous.I give this book two of five stars."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"\\"The Chosen\\" is a story about Orthodox Jews written for a secular audience, and while there's nothing wrong with this idea, it often feels like a TV-movie-of-the-week's worth of familiar themes of friendship and father-son relationships topped with gratuitous sprinklings of Judaica, packaged as a novel. It takes place in Brooklyn in the 1940's and is narrated by a teenage boy named Reuven Malter, whose father is a teacher at a local yeshiva. Reuven's neighborhood is a primarily Orthodox Jewish enclave with many sects of Hasidic Jews who scorn the \\"regular\\" Orthodox as \\"apikorsim,\\" or assimilated Jews of lesser devotion to Torah and God.One day Reuven meets a Hasidic boy his age named Danny Saunders at a softball game; in fact, Danny's line drive puts the bespectacled Reuven in the hospital to get glass shards removed from his eye. Danny's contrition leads him to visit Reuven in the hospital, where they overcome their differences as Jews to become friends. Reuven starts hanging out at Danny's house, where Danny's father, a tzaddik (community rabbi and Talmudic authority), conducts services to his Hasidic sect and discusses the Talmud with his son in an intense, magisterial manner.Despite their scholarly respect for each other, Danny's relationship with his father is quite distant. Danny is a brilliant student who is able to memorize large portions of the Talmud, but he is also a voracious reader of secular books, and his father believes that any activity that takes time away from studying Talmud is iniquitous. He confides wistfully to Reuven that he is interested in psychology and does not care to inherit his father's position as the community tzaddik, even though it is expected of him. That Danny is constantly expanding his world outside the Talmud, the only thing his father can talk to him about, is driving a wedge between father and son.I felt that the plot developments were rather predictable. The boys' friendship is tested by their fathers' conflicting views on Zionism -- Reuven's believes a new Jewish state will ennoble the deaths of six million Jews in the concentration camps; Danny's believes a secular Jewish state created and governed by apikorsim would be an affront to God -- of course, the importance of Jewish unity in the face of Arab hostility against the newly formed state of Israel is cause for reconciliation. And will Danny's father graciously come to accept his son's desire to pursue an outside profession? Don't hold your breath.Structurally, thematically, and linguistically, this novel is about as simple and straightforward as they come; like an essay on the sociology of Orthodox Judaism, it often reads like a textbook. I can't deny the novel's warmth and sincerity, but I can't ignore the trite formulas, the Hallmark sentiments, the flatness of its characterization, the dry, bland prose, or the overly egoistic first person narration. I enjoyed the story-within-a-story about the founding of Hasidism and the recounting of the first bloody days of Israel's existence, which demonstrate that Potok's writing can be engaging and informative, but is third-rate fiction like \\"The Chosen\\" the right vehicle for it?"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I was excited to read this book as a highschool requirement because I thought it would be interesting and challenging, but I was severly disappointed. The theme of the book and many ideas intertwined in the plot are unique and interesting, but the author barely goes into any detail. The character development is extremely poor and the following statements support my criticism. Danny, a strict Hasisic Jew is not expected to share his innermost feelings. Yet when he confides in his best friend, Reuven, and tells him how utterly trapped he feels; Reuven replies with silence. The author does not compensate for the lack of dialogue by explaining the importance of Reuven's silence or his feelings. The novel also doesn't clearly show the growing relationship between Reuven and Danny. In every situation, they put their schoolwork before their own wishes. It is understandable that they do this because of the confinements of their culture, but they do not even question it! Another example is when Reuven's father is hospitalized, and Reb Saunders' welcomes him into his home. Is Reuven surprised at such a friendly gesture from what he knows to be a stern man? And when Reb Saunder's is somber and is even seen with tears on his cheeks, what are Danny and Reuven's reactions? Are they upset at the man's obvious depression? None of these answers are expressed through the characters in this novel. Readers, remember the attraction between Dany's sister and Reuven? When Reuven finds that she is betrothed to someone else, what does he feel? Nothing? Of course the society in which he as grown up would not permit him to address a situation like this to his friend, but what about his personal thoghts? The characters have sparsely any debth at all. As one is reading The Chosen, they should ask themself if what happens to the characters is of any importance to them. Can the reader clearly see how the character's are feeling?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book is about a Jewish boy and how he grows up in a small Jewish ghetto called Williamsburg in Brooklyn during the era of the holocaust. In this story young Rueven Malter must face the challenges of growing up in a strict and powerful Jewish society. During the length of this story Rueven meets the son of a highly respected Jewish rabbi. The two boys become best friends after an unfortunate baseball accident. Even though their parents have different views of how and what holy things occur, the boys manage to remain friends until college when they are forbidden to see each other. This story however ends with the two back together. Personally I thought the subject was interesting, but was told in an uninteresting way. The author took too much time discussing Jewish history and costums that he didn't really explain enough of Danny and Rueven's lives. After finishing this story I am still wondering what the writer's reason for creating this book, what was he trying to get across? Mabey I spent too much time trying to pick out the details of the boy's lives to understand what was happening. If you are the kind of person who enjoys reading things in which the writing is mechanically correct than this would be your book. The mechanical writing was perhaps the only thing that really reminds me of this book, other than that I am surprised that the Jewish philosophy did not interest me."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book is an ok read. I was assigned this book for my english class. The beginning is easy to get into but there are slow parts throughout the book. Potok goes into great detail in describing the characters and their emotions. I could see each character vividly in my mind as though they were real, and as I read I felt every emotion that they felt. Potok's descriptions were so clear that the world around me became the world of Reuven Malter and his friend Danny Saunders. In the story I saw how two jewish boys, each raised differently, became friends, overcame their families differences, and grew to become confident, intelligent young men. Reading The Chosen taught me a lot about the Jewish religion and what it must have been like to be a jew in 1940's USA. It also taught me about life. I learned that anything can happen, and that true friends are hard to come by and should ba cherished always. This book is a atory for everyone."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I recently ordered this book for my daughter; it was on her summer reading list. We are new to the area and I needed this book quickly. I placed my order and received it before the expected date of delivery :) My daughter has finished the book and loved it. I will read it and get back to you on the actual book."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book doesn't do anything for me. The Chosen, by the late Chaim Potok is very misleading to me. From what I get, it is about a Jewish teenager who learns how to grow up in a Jewish culture. The first time I read this (and believe it, I've read this many times!) I couldn't get it. I was all uh...err... and just couldn't make sense of it. So I started over, and over, and over. But if you, however, are used to more advanced novels, read this. From what I did get, this book was quite intriguing. So take it from me, this is a great book about cultural diversity. Or don't, depending all on how you look at it."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I hated this book when I had to read it for school, but it did help me understand when my best friend's parents wouldn't allow me in their house because I wasn't Jewish. I was only allowed in the garage, and my best friend had to fight to allow that much access. I can't imagine what it was like for blacks...segregation sucks."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The book was very inspiring and motivational. It was very hard to read. It took a very long time to get into the book. I almost gave up reading it but I had to see why other reviews that I read spoke so highly of it. Once I finished the book I realize why. It was about true friendship and how it can last through anything. It was also about a young man and his thirst for knowledge, and the lengths he had to go to to reach his final happiness. It inspired to to follow my dreams, and decide my future for myself."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"it was ok....if you dont have to read it for school then DONT READ itother than that it was ok :)"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Nothing in this book made sense. The friendship between the boys is a good prompt for a story, but the events leading up to it are clumsy. Danny Saunders has absolutely no reason to befriend Reuben Malter; when they first meet, he calls him an \\"apikoret\\" (heretic), then feels bad when he hits him in the eye with a baseball. What exactly is Danny's reason for wanting Reuben as a friend? Does he need an outsider to talk to? Is he looking to learn about the outside world?This business of \\"raised in silence\\" is absolutely alien to me or any psychologist, Jewish or otherwise, that I've inquired. A central part of the book is that Danny Saunders is \\"raised in silence\\" with his father never speaking to him. I've known psychologists who found disorders and habits unique to Hassidic Jews in Eastern Europe, but none of them ever encoutered this problem. Chaim Potok simply crafted a load of hokey to give the book a bit more jive.If you're a gentile and you want to learn about how Ashkenazi Jews think, don't read this book."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book is based on teenagers. In todays society children can not relate to the characters of this book, The Chosen. I believe that I should have enjoyed this book a lot more if I were able to understand what the characters were going through emotionally. I felt the author would help me understand, unfortunatly this is not the case. When I first heard of this book, I thought I would like it, because I too am Jewish. As I started to read it though, I felt as though it were extremely boring. I was hoping for it to be abook were I wouldn't want to put it down. but as I found out I would simply try anything to aviod it. I hope others readers have abetter feeling about this book, and it enjoyed it"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen, by Chaim Potok, was a great book about two Jewish boys from different sects of Judaism. Reuven Malter , one of the main charchters from the book gets hit in the head with a baseball by Danny Saunders, one of the Hasidic boys during a baseball game. Throughout the book, Danny and Reuven become good friends. The two boys do alot of things together, such as study torah and Talmud. Not only is this book about the boys good friend ship, but also about the relationship of father and son. But because of the different beliefs of both their fathers, the boys are not allowed to see each other. This book, demonstrated friendship and helped educate people on the Jewish Religion."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen seems very unrealistic and unbelievable. Some times , Chaim Potok uses Jewish words that only people who are Jewish or study Judaism could understand. Potok uses a word and then a few pages later gives a brief definition of that word . The book brings up the topic of Danny and Reuven's friendship and how odd it is that the two could be so close . Potok discusses this far too much in this novel and it seems very unrealistic . When teenagers get caught doing things that they are not allowed to do by their parents, they usually get reprimanded and have some type of punishment. In this novel the parents do not ask as most parents would. However, this book gives great details on how Hasidic Jews act, what they wear , and how they follow the Talmudic Laws . This book gives the reader a great insight on how all of these aspects affect how they run their lives . This novel helped me understand more about Jews and their beliefs on how they lives there life based on the Torab ."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book is ok...it teaches important life lessons, but the whole book is a waste of time and too long to read. I found it to be very very boring and didnt want to finish but i had to for a school report"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"For your convinience, I will now boil down The Chosen into one easily readable paragraph:&quot;I can hear silence,&quot; Danny said sadly. I went over and gave him a big hug. After that we went for a long walk. We walked for about two hours. We walked at a medium pace. While we walked, we talked about the Torah. Danny does four blat of the Torah a day! Danny's so smart, I can only do two blat. After that we went to Danny's house and argued with his dad. We argued about the Torah. Then I went home and cried.Now imagine if this paragraph was two hundred pages long. That is pretty much all The Chosen is."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I read this book last year because my mom suggested to me. I started to read it at first and slighty after the baseball part I got bored. Then A few months later I picked up the book and read it again and found that it was very intresting. Being a reformed jew I found that I acutally did not realate much to the hasidic and othordox jews. I did however know the terms and I did not find it difficult to read. I do not understand how people could find this book boring and I think that if they would of given the book a chance they would of enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The book The Chosen is a classic story about friendship and discovering what kind of a person you are inside. The setting is New York City, in two Jewish neighborhoods during World War II. The two main characters, Reuven and Danny, meet each other after Danny smacks a hit off Reuven's eye in a baseball game. Reuven is angry at first, but after encouragement from his father, he and Danny become friends. Reuven is then invited to Danny's house to study the Talmud with Reb Saunders, Danny's father and the tzaddik or leader of the Hassidic Jews in the area. Although Mr. Saunders doesn't agree with Reuven and his father's views, he permits the friendship. While Reuven is a bright boy, Danny is brilliant and \\"one in a million\\". He is, however, plagued by the fact that his father never speaks to him as part of his preparation to inherit the position of tzaddik. Danny would rather pursue a career in psychology, but he is terrified of telling this to his father.Years pass and both boys are attending a Jewish college together. Everything is going smoothly until Reuven's father leads a rally in the city promoting Palestine as a Jewish state. Reb Saunders is enraged that his son is friends with someone whose father believes in such things. He tells his son never to speak with Reuven again and threatens to pull him out of college if he disobeys. After two years, the silence ban is lifted and Mr. Saunders shocks Danny by announcing that he knows about Danny's wishes to go to psychology school and he agrees to pay his way. Both Danny and Reuven are thrilled and everything ends happily.All four of the main characters in this story were extremely plausible and well rounded. They had strong opinions about their faith and were overwhelmed at times by the complexity of life. Both fathers had good intentions, but struggled at times with the magnitude of raising a son and juggling their jobs. I enjoyed the style of the book because it was in first person as Reuven told it. I was able to see inside Reuven's mind and understand the struggles in his relationship with Danny and his father. I don't think that I would have enjoyed the book as much if it had been in third person. This story has a very strong theme, which can be linked to almost any friendship that anyone, anywhere, will ever have in life. The main theme is that strong friendships, no matter how complex or troubling, are very important in life. Both Danny and Reuven learned so much from each other and they became much better people because of that. A smaller theme is that you should never judge a person when you haven't met them and spent real, quality time with them. Reuven was so angry with Danny for hitting him that their great friendship almost never took place.I felt that Chaim Potok did an excellent job with this story. He molds the life of young Jewish boys at that time with a compelling and compassionate tale of a friendship that will last a lifetime. He explored the characters' minds and their feelings toward life in general. However, I felt that the story was a little predictable and that once you were led down a path, the story continued that way. There were few shocking twists in the story. Also, I felt that there was little suspense or action in the first few chapters. The story starts fairly slowly compared to later chapters. It would have been nice also, if the boys' school life had been explored in greater detail as there was never even a classmate's name mentioned anywhere in the story. Lastly, I wish that more had been foreshadowed in the end about Danny's brother's future. Levi seems to be the one to inherit the tzaddik title even though he seems gravely ill at times with an unnamed illness.Overall, this is a great story that I would recommend to anyone. It really makes you think about life and the importance of those close to you."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Ok there are alot of reviews here so Ill keep it simple. This book is very important on a educational level alone. Real history is taught here about the war effort and its effect on the jewish community. Also, it gave me much insight to Judaism. Oh yeah, the story . . . very touching coming of age tale, great ending and a must read."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"'The Chosen' is a story of friendship that considers and is impacted by the relevancy of an ancient faith in a modern world and the clash between the different ways of approaching such faith. The debates within the book hold particular interest for religions in which faith tends to also become a culture and lifestyle. Potok vividly presents both the joys and the frustrations associated with such religious culture. The story is beautifully told, the portrayal of Jewish culture fascinating and the issues discussed are challenging."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen is a heartwarming book that examines relationships, freedom, and choice. Chaim Potok writes with a beautiful, flowing narrative, that is like sitting down and listening to someone tell you a story from the heart.The Chosen is based around the Jewish religion, and as such was quite a revelation to me, as I have never read a book on the Jewish religion before. Although the book was very informative about Jewish religion and sects, it avoided getting bogged down, and every bit of history was presented as a story in itself. Although The Chosen is a generally pleasant, easy to read book, it also contains deeper meanings throughout, which can help the reader to inhance their understanding of the storyline. The chosen is a book of true literary quality, and as such is doubly rewarding.The only drawback to the story is that it is not one that you can read a chapter per day. To truely understand the whole story, you need to read it in longer passages, to truely understand the direction, and the importance and meaning of each event.I would recommend it to anybody with a true appreciation lof a literary work."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I have read The Chosen by Chaim Potok. The Chosen is a very good book. The author was very discriptive about every character and place. He used very good adjetives. The Chosen was a book of understanding. It had very good concepts that our world needs to take under consideration. I learned something new every chapter! The Chosen took place in the late 1930's and early 1940's. It is about two jewish boys of different sects that become good friends but are torn apart by a very religious father. It tells how hard it was for Jews in America through the war and when Isreal was becoming a Jewish state. I enjoyed The Chosen so much I am reading the sequel and plan on reading more books by this author if they are all as good as this one!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I have recently read the book, The Chosen, by Chaim Potok. I found this book to be very entertaining and informing. I learned about Judaism and the Jewish culture. This book helps you to realize how valuable a friend is. It tells of how friends can help you through life and have fun as well. I also learned a lot of things about the Jewish religion. I would recommend this book to people that are open-minded. You have to be willing to learn about different customs in order to enjoy this book. Also you must look beyond the text of the book into the meaning. This is a deep and powerful book. I hope you decide to read this, and enjoy it!!!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book was recommeded by a Rabbi, and I cannot thank her enough. Potok takes you through the friendship of two Jewish boys, one Conservative, the other Hasidic, and examines the joys and sorrows of their friendship during the 1940's. The friendship of the two boys is tested by WWII and the differences in their beliefs. A must read."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen lets readers of any background get a good insiders view the life of religious Jews, their life, their thoughts and feelings.It gives readers the chance to understand that we are all humans, with similar fears, emotions even though we may be of different backgrounds or religions.If there was one author that I was to name to help people understand and sympathise with one another, Chaim Potok would be it. In his books, you will find yourself feeling the emotions, understanding the fears of the characters, and this, hopefully will help us all realize that we are similar as humans, although we may be different in lifestyle or belief. Empathy and sympathy is, after all, what we need alot of."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I read this book as a school asignment and when I was handed it by my 10th grade teacher, I groaned. By law, I hate reading school assigned books, but I ablsoutely loved this one. This has got to be one of the best books I have ever read. The way in which Chaim Potok explored the friendship between Reuven and Danny (the main characters) and their relationships with their fathers is wonderful. This was not a book that you read and then you move on. This is a book that changes the way in which you look at your life and the happenings around you. The story will affect your life, feelings, and way of thinking. Go read it and see what I mean!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"When my high-school freshman son (who naturally no longer shares absolutely everything in his life with me) approached me with some questions of the more arcane variety with regard to the first of his summer reading assignments, I took a look at the title, and my heart leapt for joy. I first read &quot;The Chosen&quot; over 30 years ago. I vividly recall that, when I reached the last page, I immediately went back to the first and read it again. I have since re-read it at least 10 times (though not recently), each time discovering something new. My son's assignment has given me another opportunity to do so. We used the Amazon review board as a springboard for discussing the contents of the book. In reading the reviews, I am glad to see that, in large measure, Potok's ageless story is touching and educating another generation. To those who complain that they don't understand aspects of the story or the Jewish cultures central to it, I say, do as Reuven and Danny do -- savor the beauty and subtlety of the language and the ideas expressed through it, study for the pure sake of acquiring knowledge and understanding, stretch your horizons and seek knowledge of that which you don't understand, feed your soul. In this speed-, computer-, and greed-driven society, we need to slow down and remind ourselves of the existence of timeless, truly important things. This book does it better than any other I have encountered in 40 years of avid reading."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"bought this for a siblings course requirement. does what it needs too. this was a good purchase at a reasonable price."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I had previously read this book and given away my only copy. It is one which deserves a permanent place on one's bookshelf. The story features a young Jewish scholarly boy growing up in Brooklyn during WWII and afterwards. While slow in starting, it gives the background and atmosphere, along with much of earlier history, of the Jewish community in America prior to the war. The characters are memorable and believable."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"\\"The Chosen\\" is a great novel. I loved all the suspense. I liked all the themes and how the related to one another. It was a comedic, upsetting novel, and it was brilliantly written. One of the most important things I learned was about the Jewish religion and culture. I only knew a little about the Jewish way of life, but after reading this book, I expanded my knowledge. I felt this book is for anyone, regardless of religion, race or beliefs. However, Jewish people and people who study the Jewish religion might have a better time understanding or relating to the book then me.It talks about two boys and their fathers, what they learn from their fathers, and what they learn from each other. Their friendship started during the most unusual circumstances, strengthened, had to be put on hold, but continued again.This is one of the best novels I've read. I felt enlightened after reading this book. At first, I didn't find this book intriguing or anything. But you can never judge a book by its cover, literally!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This is the story of two boys in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, and their fathers, during the 1940s. Danny's father is a Hasidic rabbi, and Reuven and his father are orthodox Jews, but not Hasidic. The story begins with a (softball/baseball) game--the author seems to confuse the two games--in which a ball hit by Danny strikes Reuven, the pitcher, breaking his glasses and putting him in the hospital. Danny comes to the hospital to apologize to Reuven, but Reuven angrily rejects Danny's apology. Reuven's father counsels him to apologize for his rude rejection of Danny, which he does, and they become best friends.I suspect that many of the one-star reviews were written by folks who read no farther than this; I must admit I came close to quitting at this point and giving it one star, but fortunately I persisted, and soon thereafter the boredom ceased, and I could hardly put the book down after that.Several reviewers have commented on Rabbi Saunders' silent treatment of Danny, which may, in this case, have accomplished its purpose of developing compassion. However, most children develop compassion as they grow up, without the silent treatment, which was cruel, and was uncomfortably close to the parenting style that, according to what I have read*, has been found to be common to most serial killers such as Ted Bundy. The ending could easily have been tragic, and it is not exactly happy, but life will go on, and will probably be bearable. Reuven will probably get married eventually, and maybe Danny will, too.There are some surprises which I won't spoil. This is not a book for children; you need the life experience of growing up to adulthood to fully understand and appreciate it. I doubt that I was ready for it before age 35. But at 77, I am very glad that I read it.Watziznayme@gmail.com* SeeThe Stranger Beside Me, by Ann Rule."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen does an incredible job in explaining the ways of the Jewish people.As a Christian,I was able to have an insight in how the traditional Jews lived...

The competition to win is stiff. As a result of that competition the more religous one Danny Saunders bats a ball directly at the less religous one Reuven Malther and injurs him. As a result of his guilt Saunders goes to the hospital to try and attone and much to his surprise Reuven discovers actually likes Danny. With Reuven's father's support, a friendship forms between the two. Then we get a very good insider's view of life among the Hasidim (Orthodox Jews) of Brooklyn around the time of the end of World War II and the birth of the State of Israel.Like I said those elements form the ostensible story told by Rabbi Potok. However, beneath those ostensible elements is much richer detail as the boys share their experiences and discuss their relationships with their fathers. Just like in Fiddler on the Roof you find yourself soon forgetting \\"all the Jewish stuff\\" and soon concentrating only the human story being told.Because of that human story this book was a rightful best seller and remains a rightful classic. It's well worth the read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen contained detailed descriptions of some very complex relationships. The story was complicated by religious considerations, but was not entirely about that. Though some of the characters behave in a manner I don't approve of, Mr. Potok makes all of them both likeable and frustrating, which is typical of most people when you know them."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Other reviews have given a summary of the plot so I won't do that. Just know that the true beauty of this book, while focused on the Jewish religion and differences between its members, is that its themes apply to all of us as we navigate our lives and our interpersonal relationships. The Chosen, and its sequel, The Promise (which I liked even better) are amazing novels that explore genuine issues that arise from the different weaknesses and strengths of humans and understanding that each of us has something to offer no matter how inadequate we may sometimes feel. Two of my all time favorite books."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I still can not beleive the greatness of &#34;The Chosen&#34;.

It is about the importance of interaction and not reaction to problems. It shows how two boys who are very different and start their relationship hating each other, turned into kids that were best friends. It taught me a lot about understanding and finding a middle ground. It's funny, although the book is about two Jewish boys, it seemed almost Buddhist in nature.... Anyway, read this book."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"..and found this book a great reminder of why I'm choosing to join the Jewish community, even though I'm choosing a Reformed path.If you care about thinking and care about reading and want to better understand strangers in our midst, pick up this book.

But there is no Hasidic sect that has a tradition of silence."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The setting is in Brooklyn, Ny during WWII and a few years after the war. The story focuses on the relationhip that develops between two Jewish boys, Reuven and Danny. The book describes how their different customs and loyalties to the church make it impossible for the two to become friends. Danny is a Russian Hasidic Jew, and Reuven is an Ultra-Orthodox Jew. The two boys start out as enemies, but after an accident at a softball game, things begin to change and they begin to overlook their differences and develop a unique friendship. Each are brought up in two different homes. Danny's father is a Rabbi who seldom talks to him. Reveron's father is a secular scholar, who is very close to his son. This story addresses some of the personal issues they go through to see past each other's different backgrounds."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Two Jewish boys living within 5 blocks from each other have never met each other until their respective teams play each other in baseball. Reuven and Danny play on opposite teams with different forms of the Jewish religion. Danny hits a ball back at Reuven (who is pitching)and sends him to the hospital. During this game, the two boys exchange words etc to show their dislikes for each other. Reuven gets put into the hospital because of his eye getting hit by the baseball. Danny comes to visit him and to apologize. The two boys discover many common things about each other and become good friends. The rest is held withing the book!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen is a wonderful story that changed the way that I think, forever. When I read this book, I was a &quot;good&quot; Catholic, but because of this book I questioned my religion and decided that I believed in Judiasm and not Catholicism. Because of this book, I realized that maybe what I had been told to believe all of my life might not be true. This is perhaps the greatest compliment that can be paid to a book: That it made me change my life."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The chosen was excellent book about two people, somehow became friends. Reuven Malter was an orthodox Jew living in New York City. His friend Danny Saunders who a Russian Hasidic Jew who lived 5 blocks away from Reuven. At first they didn't even know of each other's existence. The one day when Danny hit Reuven in the face with a baseball , Reuven almost lost an eye. Surprisingly enough this was the first founding stone, of the one of the best friendships I have ever read about. This will touch you in a way that no other book could. I hope You give The Chosen By Chaim Potok a chance because I did, and I will never forget that book for as long as I live. There is something that says that Danny and Reuven should have never been friends. I think they were the chosen friends of this book. This book also teaches people to always give people a chance to be friend with you no matter what their background is. Read the chosen!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen is ok for a general book. But as a classic it is not that good. It was a deptessing tale about two people that could not be friends because of religous differences. What religion in this age? nothing any more decremination will be almost completely terminated in 100 years so Chaim took people's time to read about a unrealistic plot and it has become a classic! I could write about me and my friend's father that had some differences so then we can't be friends.For a plot this stupid it was an excellent book but the plot was to radical."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen is my single favorite book. After reading this book (which I couldn't put down) I was amazed at Chaim's writing style and how different the writing was than other fictional titles I've read.

If you want to be captivated by a world of two intellectuals, who's main goal is to remain the best of friends, through the thick and the thin, then I would strongly suggest reading this particular book.I have never read a book that I literally couldn't put down, but as I was reading &quot;The Chosen&quot; I stayed up all night because I just couldn't stop reading. The way Potok writes is so mesmorizing that the reader is drawn into a world of dissension and yet a world of true friendship. If you have'nt read this book already you are missing out on one of the best pieces of classical literature there is (in my opinion)."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"After the people of his village are ordered to evacuate Tevye, the milkman in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; asks himself &quot;Lord, I know we are the chosen people, but couldn't you sometimes choose somebody else?&quot;This wistful statement is at the heart of Chaim Potok's The Chosen. In this novel we are introduced to Reuven the traditional Jew and hisulta-Orthodox friend Danny the son of Reb Saunders. Against a backdrop of post World War II Brooklyn and the yet still mysterious Holocaust the reader bares witness to the inner conflicts the Jewish people have dealt with and continue to today. Struggles between ultra-orthodox and less religous Jews dominate today's headlines just as they dominate the them of The Chosen.In the end the secularly named Danny becomes more secular, perhaps symbolic of the growing assimilation of American Jewry after World War II. Danny leaves behind his world for entrance into the greater society of academia. In doing so, however, he looses something that social acceptance cannot compensate for. H. Brookman"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen by Chaim Potok is a must in any person's reading list who is interested to know about the world that surrarounds him/her. Potok takesthe reader into a factional world, where fantasy and illusion become reality, and the characters take in life of them, to a point that one could feelpart of a Jewish community located in a pre-WWII New York City. His prose is beutiful, with a rich description of every small detail with the same careof the bigger picture. Just as Potok paints the scenery with a skillfull brush, he explains the psychology of his characters. He points out their weaknesses,their flaws, and, in a joyful tone, their triumphs. Reuven, the narrator of the story, lives in a world where knowledge doesn't only provide power, it also givesits owner a great responsability, as is proven by his friend, Danny, who is the son of a rabbi and a also a genius. Danny has to confront the reality of the familytradition that would force him into the service to his community as a rabbi, because his mind is needed there to guide his people through one of the most turbulentmoments in the history of Jewery, the discovery of the Holocaust and the establishment of the state of Israel. However, Danny's soul wants him to be the next Freud, theman who would unveil human kind's flaws, and solved them. The book doesn't cointain much of a physical suspense, but the tormented minds and souls of its protragonistsclearly make up for it. Potok has created a universe where poetry is law, and where a dreamer can go and escape from reality into a world of innonce that is controlled by thewarm souls of the innocents."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This is a novel about growing up.This is a novel about growing away.This is an intense novel about two boys in Brooklyn, and their paths to becoming men.

The quality of the product was in conformity of what was stated.

It is the story of a deep friendship between adolescents Reuven (Modern Orthodox son of an intellectual) and Danny (brilliant Hasidic heir to the office of head 'rebbe'). On the surface its lots of fascinating religious debate. But fundamentally it is the story of how two friends together navigate the delemnas of adolescence.Beautiful, deeply interesting story, by a master novelist (and ex-rabbi).Don't rent the old Robbie Benson movie until after you've read this book"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The relationship between the two boys in The Chosen reflects any friendship where different backgrounds are involved. With Reuben, who has the freedom of choosing whichever profession he pleases and Danny, who will inherit his father's position as tzadik (rabbi), it is very interesting to read and discover how each of them will end up. The overall theme of The Chosen is forgivness and friendship for that is what Reuben and Danny's relationship is based on."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen is an excellent novel. It is written from the perspective of seemingly every possible point of view. One doesn't always find such reading material to which one can relate to nearly every character. The characters are not so similar, but very well-expressed. The Chosen is about two teenage boys: one destined to inherit a Hasidic rabbinic ordination, and one who helps the troubled boy with the phenomenal mind. I recommnend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Our 7th fomr English teacher gave us The Chosen for our chosen book to read for bursary.. Now I was not much of a reader, which is a bit unusal for NZDers. Once I picked up The Chosen I couldn't put it down. Danny and Reuven just seemed more than charactors held together by a bunch of words. They really came out to real life. I finished the book in 2 days and followed by reading the sequal, which I finished that week. I am so grateful for reading these books, as I have learn't a lot through the lives of these 2 people. I have also now recieved a passion for reading and learning more. Since moving to England I have now brought both The Chosen and the sequal, which I have read them many times."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"A touching book which relates to all readers. The Chosen is a symbollic and uplifting experience. Chaim Potok succeeds in defining two different sects involved in Judaism. It possible for the reader to experience the problems each character conquers. The Chosen, although about Judaism, can be related to by all people which go through religious questioning. Chaim Potok shows that all dreams can come true. Overall, this book was the best I have ever read and I recommend it to all readers."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I just finished reading this book for the third time. Each time I read it, I find something new love and appreciate about it. Reading it is a miriacle within itself. It teaches acceptance, appreciation, and friendship through example, not preaching. In fact, this book never preaches. It is, in fact, a book for everyone. I adore it. It is my favorite book. It's sequel The Promise is very good also."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Although often assigned to young adults, this book is really meant to be re-read throughout life, as it can be understood and enjoyed on many levels as the reader matures. The old &quot;ParDeS&quot; method of analysis (an acronym for Hebrew words meaning: literal, moral, allegorical, and mystical) can be applied to this story, and it is excellent on each of these levels. Literally it is a moving story about growing up, friendship, families, making choices, and finding one's place in the world rather than letting it be assigned by others. Morally, it shows different life choices in a remarkably non-judgemental way--the two diametrically opposed families each find a way that fits their character to make meaningful choices and contributions to the world without compromising their principles, and both are partially successful, but both pay a price. The sons must choose for themselves which elements to retain and which to reject from their traditions. Allegorically, it shows the tension between the interior life, symbolized by the Hasidic family, and the exterior life, symbolized by the politically activist Orthodox family. Neither way has all the answers, and both suffer (the Hasids mentally, both father and son; the Orthodox, physically, again both father and son). Each son has to learn to adopt elements from the other approach to grow up a complete person. It is on the mystical level, however, that this book touches me the most. The terrible silence of the Hasidic father, which seems so senseless and destructive to his talented but tormented son, is revealed to have a transcending reason. This is like the experience so many of us have with a God Who remains silent despite even the most desperate attempts to make contact with Him. We can't see why a supposedly loving God would be so cold and remote when we cry out to Him the most. This book provides a model which might apply to this, perhaps man's oldest and most painful question."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I found The Chosen to be a captivating book that gave me both emotional and spiriyual fulfillment. Potok is proven a master in this book about two young boys and how they help each other to find themselves. Potok gives us a look at unexpected friendship as well as spiritual growth from two different points of view. The Chosen is a modern masterpiece of courage and friendship. It explores how difficult being a friend can become."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I first read The Chosen as a summer reading assignment in high school. It quickly became my favorite book. I read the sequel, The Promise, on my own time and have read both books many times since then. The unlikely friendship of Rueben and Danny, two boys from totally different backgrounds is a perfect lesson for young adults to learn. It should be on all summer reading lists."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I think that the chosen by Chaim Potok was an interesting, but hard book. I am an eighth grader who had to read the book for school, and in my opinion, it was a pretty hard book to follow, but it did have a whole lot of meaning to it. AWESOME BOOK!!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"While full of rich themes and complex characters, this book is not for those looking for action and a fast moving plot. Through the story of two Jewish boys, it deals with the value of friendship, but also with the reality of being born into a lifestyle that one must eventually choose for oneself, or reject. The author blends rich dialogue with a detailed plot making it easy to sympathy with characters and situations. Additionally it offers a unique behind the scenes look at Hasidic Jews."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I was in my mother's room one day, kind of bored, when she handed me the chosen. She told me it was a very beautiful story and made her cry and that I should read it. I was 16. I rolled my eyes. I am not a person who cries and I certainly didn't feel like reading some book that my mother thought was beautiful. But I was bored and had nothing to do and so I started reading it. The intersting thing about the book it that it starts very simply. To make a long story short I really liked the book and it had a pretty strong impact on me. Its the story of a boy living in New York. The captivating thing is that this boy is very different to us, he has a religion and culture that is strange to me as I have never been exposed to it in my life (Orthodox Judaism). He is very different from most people arround him, and in the book he shares with us his deepest feelings about this. The book had a very strong impact on me as it allowed me a glimpse of a different world, viewed from the eyes of a boy so different from me, but in many ways so simmilar. His loneliness, his difference echoed my own.I strongly reccomend reading this book as it gave me a perspective I didn't have before, it was a beautiful and captivating story and gave me a window into a new world."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This fine novel is set in ultra-Jewish Brooklyn, during the 1940's. Two teenaged boys from different backgrounds---though both are Jewish, one is Chasidic and the other 'merely' strictly Orthodox---meet during a baseball game in which the brilliant son of a powerful Chasidic rebbe injures the Orthodox young man. An unlikely friendship develops between these two and from there we are introduced to those divergent cultures within Judaism that dwell close together within a community, but are separated by belief and custom almost to the point of mutual exclusion. The rebbe's son is a Talmudic scholar of rare giftedness, slated to succeed his dogmatic father at some future time. The other boy, who acts as our narrator, learns of his friend's wishes to become a Freudian psychologist and that his secret wish is to shun the leadership role for which he was born. This friendship survives great external hardships, clashes of belief (especially over the nascent state of Israel) and in the process of taking us on a carefully detailed tour of American Judaism circa 1948, it concludes with a positive ending that more or less justifies the trials at the heart of the story and also sets up for a welcome sequel."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"When I started reading THE CHOSEN, I was rather disappointed. It read like a run-of-the-mill pop fiction work for at least 90 pages. Reuven Malter, 15, plays baseball for his yeshiva team in Brooklyn; their opponents are a Hasidic team whose star is Danny Saunders, the 15 year old son of the religious guru or the tzaddik of a Hasidic community. The teams clash, Reuven winds up in the hospital thanks to stopping a vicious line drive with his glasses. Danny, the hitter, comes to visit him and apologizes. They become friends. The year is 1944---D-Day and the war hover in the background. There are a couple other stock characters. At that point, the tenor of the novel changes to a schematic balancing of the two sets of fathers and sons. Reuven's father teaches in the yeshiva where his son studies, but he is more open to the outside world. Danny's father is a patriarch steeped in tradition, bearing the cares of all his people on his shoulders, revered by them to extremes. Danny, with a photographic memory and keen mind, has long been tipped to succeed his father, hence he is \\"the chosen\\" one. Reuven, the less religious of the two, decides to become a rabbi. Danny wants to go into psychology, but will his father permit it ? Can their friendship hold out before the narrow, strict vision of life of Danny's father ? Will Danny's fate be decided for him or will the American ideal of individual choice prevail ?THE CHOSEN is a coming of age novel with a difference, it traces the onset of maturity, the making of life choices in an environment unfamiliar to most people in the world. Mainly, though, the novel compares and contrasts differing ideas on Jewish life and the creation of Israel. There are also earnest discourses on psychology and Freud, the Talmud and logic. Readers can learn a lot about Jewish tradition and customs, including, by induction, the importance of women in Orthodox Jewish life (there are perhaps ten lines about women in the whole book, showing how they take care of men). Though I did learn a lot about Hasidic thought and practice, I did not admire this novel in terms of literary power. Both Bernard Malamud and Isaac Bashevis Singer wrote to a much higher standard on similar topics. I felt continually as though Potok was using the text to educate me. I don't object to such sincere and gentle lecturing, but it seldom produces great literature. I think that your take on this novel will depend on your age. The younger you are, the fresher it will appear."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I first read The Chosen several years ago, and I'm glad I picked it up again. On the surface, the novel is about 2 teenage Jewish boys who become close friends, their relationships with their fathers, and the decisions they make in life.Looking past the surface, the book explores the process of friendship and what makes a good friend. What draws Danny and Reuven together? How do such different people become so close?The novel also explores family traditions and patriarchal expectancies. Danny is expected to take over the rabbi position from his father, but Danny is literally a genius and is interested in psychology. His father is also raising him in silence, which Reuven questions throughout the book and which is explained only at the end. Reuven's father is a scholar and wants his son to be a mathematician, but Reuven wants to be a rabbi.Finally, the book is a reminder that not all people within a certain group are the same. Both Danny and Reuven are orthodox Jews, but Danny is Hasidic and Reuven is not. There is some prejudice between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews, and different groups of Jews have different stances on the establishment of Israel.Chaim Potok has written a beautiful story that is as relevant today as it was when it was first written. It is a novel that, I think, trandscends age, gender, race, and religion, and I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Being a book person, I have done a lot of reading. The majority of the books I read are forgotten soon after. However, it has been more than a year since I first read The Chosen, and I have certainly not forgotten it. In fact, my understanding of the book is far more acute than it was when I finished that book for the first time.Briefly summarized, this book is about two Orthodox Jewish boys from Brooklyn who have grown up in strikingly different societies and have been exposed to strikingly different views, whose lives are bound by a single event at a baseball game. The boys form an unlikely friendship, through which they each learn about the other's world. They each grow from this friendship. and, ultimately derive from it the courage to follow their dreams.Whether or not the reader is familiar with the world of Orthodox Judaism, he/she can't help feeling drawn to the characters of Reuven Malter and Danny Saunders. Chaim Potok portrays these characters so beautifully, they don't come of seeming like characters at all, but like people -- real people whom the reader can care about. A few chapters into the book, the reader will feel him/herself becoming a part of these characters, and engulfed in their Brooklyn world.The book goes from chapter to wonderful chapter, until the unusually captivativating final chapter, which will leave you wanting to know more. To read more about these luminous characters, read The Promise, a sequel to The Chosen."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"What a find! Not sure how I stumbled upon this, but I'm glad it came my way. I am not Jewish, really not even religoius at all, but you don't need to be Jewish to appreciate the humanity in this story. The writing is masterful. The characters and their world come so alive when reading this. Eaxacly what happens to them is not even as important as just being able, through the author's magic, to inhabit their special world for a short time. A very moving story that should not be missed. Also, the sequel, The Promise, is at the same level. I read them in reverse order because I did not know about The Chosen until after I read The Promise, but even in this order nothing was lost."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Even though this book is steeped in the culture of religion, when I read it in high school the religiosity barely registered. This is a great story about two boys in the midst of growing up. Potok paints a realistic and touching portait of Danny and Reuven, who abandon many of their childish views by the time the last page comes around. The particulars of what is, to me two alien cultures was also interesting, but the real beat of the story is in the human relationships that it unveils. The characters are 100% believable, 100% sympathetic, and 100% compelling. That authenticity drives the story in a way that no over-the-top action stunts ever could.I highly recommend this book to a young reader who has only found light-hearted fare interesting so far. This is a book to start broadening your tastes."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"\\"The Chosen\\" is deceptively plain. At times, it reads like a novel for young adults; its descriptions are explicatory (but not patronizing), its language is simple (but not simplistic). Potok takes an archetypal story of two boys growing up and presents the Brooklyn Hasidic community and its history in terms that even \\"goyim\\" can understand. Occasionally Potok's prose style is a little too edifying--several sections have the feel of a primer cast as conversation (\\"What a lecture it has been!\\" exclaims one of characters at the end of a chapter)--but the payoff is worth the book's didactic tone.Even its exciting opening scene, which features a high school baseball game as a metaphor of holy war, is told in the unadorned style one would expect from a \\"boy's novel.\\" Reuven, son of an Orthodox Jewish scholar confronts Danny Saunders, a Hasidic rabbi's son who has a fearsome reputation as a \\"murderer\\" in baseball. Danny lives up to his reputation, sending a line drive straight at Reuven's eyeglasses; the two boys become uneasy yet steadfast friends while Reuven recovers in the hospital.After this inauspicious encounter, the two boys are initiated into each other's world--and we are introduced to theirs. Reuven shows off his own Talmudic training at a Hasidim Shabbat service, while Danny, with his new friend's help, secretively fills his thirst for the \\"forbidden\\" (to him) literature in the public library--especially the works of Freud (in the original German, no less). Although Danny, a brilliant student as well as a formidable athlete, wants to be a psychologist, his father, Reb Saunders, is grooming him as the next dynastic tzaddik (\\"righteous one\\") to head a community in which \\"secular literature was forbidden, and the Hasidim lived shut off from the rest of the world.\\"The struggle between Reb Saunders and his rebel son is supplemented by several digressions into the arcanae of Talmudic study, which in Potok's hands become bizarrely stimulating. And an important subplot pits the two boys (and their fathers) against each other because the Hasidim virulently oppose, for religious reasons, the founding of the nation of Israel.The novel is set in the post-War era in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg (where I now live), and it's fascinating to see, through the prism of fiction, how much--and how little--has changed in the Hasidic community. (Readers interested in a more recent work might check out \\"Teacha!\\" by Gerry Albarelli, who taught in a Brooklyn yeshiva for Hasidic students.) While it's an undeniably facile sketch of a complex society, \\"The Chosen\\" benefits from its true-to-life portrayals and from a compelling story of friendship."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I first read this book in high school. I thought it was a great book because it uses very intense and personal description to share the lives of two Orthodox Jewish boys. It was interesting to read about a life which was foreign to me, yet to find parts that I could identify with.I just read this book again, because it had themes that I remembered and wanted to explore again, even though it's been over a decade since the first reading.Recently, as I've been pondering my relationship to my own father, both as a boy and as a man, I've thought of this book again and again. What especially touches me, is that the boys are far more like me than not, and the constrasts in their relationships with their own fathers, can be read as two perspectives: One, Warm and Communicative, the Second, Cold and Intentioned.I don't know if my own father has ever read this book, but I'd like him to, because it would help create a common language to compare from.An interesting detail about this book, is that it set at the same time as the creation of Israel. That's note worthy, because it mentions the Jewish terrorism against the British.I rated this book five stars, because it is definitely a great book, but for a second reading, it was a bit dry somehow. I don't know why, perhaps it's because I rememebered it as such a great book, but I think it's something else.The Chosen tells the story of two boys becoming men. I read this first as a boy, and now as a man. There is a very simple change that occurs (at least with these boys) in that transformation. They go from products of their values, to masters of their values. As intellectuals, they are learning how to publically defend their viewpoint, and to understand the context of the views of others. This is a form of maturity, that comes at the expense of youth.A wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Sometimes a tragic occurrence can be the catalyst that sparks a bond of friendship between two people of dissimilar backgrounds. This is demonstrated aptly in Chaim Potok's novel, The Chosen, first published in 1967. In this outstanding book, two fifteen year old boys, Reuven Malter, the son of a secular Jewish professor, and Daniel Saunders, the son of the Rabbi leader of a very conservative Russian Hasidic sect, confront each other on the baseball field. The lives of these two boys and their families are forever altered when Daniel hits Reuven in the eye with a line drive shot, nearly blinding him. At first Reuven feels terrible contempt toward Daniel, but in time the boys grow to understand and respect each other and there develops a bond between them that overcomes their significant differences.The story takes place in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, starting in 1944 when World War II is coming to an end and the full tragedy of the holocaust is being discovered. It follows the lives of the two boys as they finish their studies at Yeshiva and go onto Jewish college together. Reuven learns about the very different upbringing of his friend when he moves in with Daniel's family for a few weeks while Reuven's father is away. He learns that Daniel's father does not speak to his son except during prayer services, and only then to test him on his knowledge of the Talmud. Reuven learns that Daniel is expected to follow in the family tradition and inherit his father's position as head Rabbi of his sect. But he also learns that Daniel has different desires and is torn by his loyalty to his father. \\"Reb Saunders's son is a terribly torn and lonely boy\\", Reuven's father explains. \\"There is literally no one in the world he can talk to. He needs a friend. The accident with the baseball has bound him to you, and he has already sensed in you someone he can talk to without fear.\\"The story is told through the eyes of Reuven. Through his eyes we experience the difficulties of trying to comprehend another culture so different from one's own, and we see the growth of Reuven's understanding of Reb Saunders and his approach to parenting. Reuven also learns that possibly there is a greater purpose to seemingly random events. As his father explains, \\"Reuven, as you grow older you will discover that the most important things that will happen to you will often come as a result of silly things, as you call them-\`ordinary things' is a better expression. That is the way the world is.\\" This book is a compelling novel that tells a story of growth and understanding and the meaning of true friendship. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I am a Freshman in high school, and had to read this book for Communication Arts. I myself am Jewish, so I figured okay, here's a book about a Jew; nothing new. While reading the book, many interesting ideas were brought up, but the overall appeal of the story was just alright. As it progressed, I began to fall deeper and deeper into the story and characters. By the last chapter, I was in tears. Why? No, not because it was happy. No, not because it was sad. It was because everything worked out just as you would have imagined, and it all fit together like one big puzzle. Give this novel a chance, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"To write a summary of this book would do it injustice. Moreover, giving away the plot takes away the fun. Potok has a gift for sketching out what the magical world of Judaism looks like. While I was reading the dialogues, I could almost hear the characters with accents (like Danny's father, Reuven's father, their Talmud teacher Reb, etc.). I do sympathize with those who do not know some of the Jewish terms (e.g. tzaddik, Torah, Mishnah, Talmud, etc.). It would have helped to have a glossary, but an attentive reader would be able to figure out from the context what the terms meant.The story is not merely about Judaism; it's about friendship and parenthood. What does it mean to have a &quot;soul&quot;? But none of these values or principles makes sense unless it is embedded in the narrative of two rather different Jewish boys growing up as best friends."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I had never heard of this book but I decided to get it because it was one of the books on my 8th grade reading list; and my mom said it was good. Even though a book about 2 boys' friendship may sound boring, as it did to me, this is a verrry good book. I could hardly ever put the book down. Not only was it a great book it also taught me a lot about Judaism. I had no idea of the bad sentiment between the Hasidim and non-hasidim Jews."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"ok, the book may focus on the relationship between two young Jews, but the main theme they they are in conflict by, as their father show, is Israel. A state now, in 1948, on only when the Messiah comes and says so. BEIng Jewish and living in a traditional family that obseveres customs that both boys do, i fully understand the conflict and was fascinated by how well a person who knows nothing about Judiasm can learn so much. I had the honor to meet Chaim potok and he said he wrote it back in 1950 to show his support for zionism and how two people who are the same yet so different can cope together. They are both trying to keep the Promise. Read this and it's sequel. Both are simplely-written but powerful in meaning. DONT WAIT TILL YOU GET IT FOR YOUR READING LIST!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen is an astonishing novel that describes how a father-son relationship can be important in life. This novel reminds me of a book I read in school called A River Runs Through It but this book has sort of a different twist. I feel that you learn a lot knowing how much pressure the main character Reuven had to go through with his father's health problem and a weird relationship between his new friend Danny and his estranged father. Also, how both fathers emphasize on studying their religion Talmud can be to their future career. Although this book is truly exceptional, sometimes I find it difficult to understand their Jewish history and religion. But overall, I would recommend anyone to read this novel because it's an impressive story you won't forget."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Recently I had to read The Chosen in English. The best book I've read this year by far. I haven't read one before that held my attention and my own feelings like that. The perspectives of the book pull at all of your emotions. Anger towards Danny's father, hurt with both of the boys, and an everlasting friendship between them. It's a type of book full of valuable lessons. It teaches one to stand up for himself, and do what he thinks is best for himself. One has to do that to achieve happiness. Even though it obviously hurt him, Danny had to do it. And it's so neat because he couldn't have done it without the help of his 'soul' mate. It also teaches the reader how few and far between true friendships really are. And teaches the fact that certain things may happen in your life, and from there on out, you're forever changed. A new outlook, new perspective. Always hoping it's a change for the better. Who would think in chapter one of the novel that getting hit in the head would be a change for the better? Life's amazing how sometimes it just works itself out."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Of all the books I have read, \\"The Chosen\\" is perhaps the most deeply moving work I've had the fortune to discover. Although very educational about Orthodox and Hasidic Jews, this book is not merely about two Jewish boys but opens our eyes to a vast range of emotion and depth - the family ties that bond us, the friendships that free us, and the deepest desires of our hearts that drive us beyond where we ever imagined we could go. It's a disturbing book that requires much courage on the part of the reader to understand its depth and beauty. Potok writes in such a way that I was shaking at the end. Danny and Reuven were not just characters I was reading about; they became a part of me, a part of my heart. Though the whole book is moving, the ending especially is extremely intense. I wept with Danny - not only for him, but with him. His weeping tore me apart, and no longer was the typed page a barrier between me and these characters, no longer holding back suffering, forgiveness, and love. \\"The Chosen\\" transcends all preconceptions and barriers to reveal profound universal truths. It is a gift."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I accidentally came across this book. My brother was forced to read this book for school and I decided to read it myself despite the fact that at first I didn&#65533;t expect much.Still I started reading and soon was captivated. The warmth and love that dominates this book took me over. potok describes different opinions and different personalities with a lot of affection and acceptance of their differences.The book tells the story of two Jewish boys that come from different ways of life and their growing friendship despite the differences and all that happens around them in the world.Upon the first glance it may seem that this book talks about what it is to be a Jew. It does deal with this issue but in seeing only this side of the story, I think, you lose the real beauty and depth of the story. It deals with so many universal issues, issues that are greater than religion .one of the issues is what it is to be a human being in an ever changing world, a world which you cant always understand. Other issues are what it is to be a friend, a son, a father, deals with the growing pains and the realization of truth and that there isn&#65533;t one global truth.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to fall in love with amazing characters, who wants a book that provokes feeling and thought.This is one of the rare books that make you thankful for being alive and thankful for being able to read."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book was very good. It chronicles the teenage years and early adulthood of two Jews: Daniel (Danny) Saunders is the son of a very conservative Rabbi and Reuven Malter, son of a significantly more liberal Jewish father.Time period: June 4, 1944 (when the Allies captured Rome) to approximately May 14, 1948 (when the State of Israel was proclaimed).Setting: Williamsborg, a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, United States of AmericaIn the novel, Danny and Reuven become friends and they frequently discuss books, ideas and, of course, the Talmud. The Talmud is an ancient collection of commentaries on the Torah (the first five books of the Bible in the Old Testament). More times than I can remember, the characters clash over the interpretation of some Talmudic passage and then they consult Medieval Jewish commentaries written on the Talmud.One of the interesting issues in the novel was the idea of Zionism and Israel. The conservatives forcefully oppose its creation, arguing that only the Messiah can reinstate Israel and to setup up a secular State (what the Zionists were arguing for) is apostasy. The pro-Zionist position is argued for by David Malter (Reuven's father), \\"My father sighed. \`Reb Saunders sits and waits for the Messiah,' he said. \`I am tired of waiting. Now is the time to bring the Messiah, not to wait for him.'\\" (page 207). While Reb Saunders (Danny's father) argues passionately against the Zionist cause, \\"\\"The land of Abraham, Issac, and Jacob should be built by Jewish goyim, by contaminated men?\\" Reb Saunders shouted again. \\"Never! Not while I live! Who says these things? Who says we should now build Eretz Yisroel? And where is the Messiah Tell me, we should forget completely about the Messiah? For this six million of our people were slaughtered? That we should forget completely about the Messiah, that we should forget completely about the Master of the Universe? Why do you think I brought my family from Russia to America and not to Eretz Yisroel? Because it is better to live in a land of true goyim than to live a land of Jewish goyim! Who says we should build Eretz Yisroel, ah? I'll tell you who says it! Apikorsim [Heretics who reject the teachings of the Rabbis] say it! Jewish goyim say it! True Jews so not say such a thing!\\" (pages 187-188). In the college that Danny and Reuven attend, there is incredible tension over the issue; only the Dean's threat to instantly expel anybody who starts a fight keeps the peace.The story is also one of dynasty, because for generation, the Saunders family have been Rabbis and Reb Saunders expects his son Danny to continue the dynasty. However, Danny is far more interested in psychology (especially Sigmund Freud) and hopes that his younger sickly brother will be take his responsibility instead. Reuven is quite skilled at mathematics and initially he plans to go into a career of teaching mathematics at the university level; one of his major interests is symbolic logic. However, by the end of the novel, Reuven decides to become a Rabbi and Danny a clinical psychologist.The closing pages where Reb Saunders talks about his son are very touching. He laments that he knew early on that his son Danny was tremendously gifted (Danny has great memorization speed and can read very quickly). However, he feared that Danny would become a mind in a body with no heart and become, as Reb's brother had, \\"It [his brother's mind] was proud, haughty, impatient with less brilliant minds, grasping in its search for knowledge the way a conqueror grasps for power. It could not understand pain, it was indifferent to and impatient with suffering.\\" (page 264). However, his hard discipline and the suffering Danny endured eventually produced a great heart; he had become a tzaddik (a righteous man who has conquers his &quot;evil inclinations,&quot; towards pride, power and oppression, and practices righteousness and humility, and who is, like God, always on &quot;the side of the oppressed.)&quot; The profound Jewish understanding of suffering, as seen in the later part of the Old Testament (especially in the Major Prophets and Lamentations) is manifested here.I now have some small measure of understanding for what it must be like to be a Jew in such a thoroughly Gentile (non-Jewish) land such as America (Jews comprise 1.8% of the population). Maintaining one's identity and faith is very difficult and one must constantly struggle to avoid being assimilated. Here there is a lesson for Christians, who in North America, are living in an increasing secular society. Christians must keep in mind that to be salt (see Matthew 5:13) light (see Matthew 5:14) is to be a postive influence IN THE WORLD to conform it to God's standards."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I have never read a book by Chaim Potok that I didn't love. This is the first of his many fine novels and explores two relationships... first, that between a Chasidic teenager named Danny Saunders and his more &quot;mainstream&quot; orthodox friend Reuven Malther, and secondly, between Danny and his father, a great Chasidic Rabbi. The setting of the novel is Brooklyn in the 1940s. Being strictly observant, the Rabbi looks upon Reuven's family as apikoros or, (roughly translated) as heretics. Of course Reuven and his family are far from secular Jews, indeed Reuven attends a yeshiva (an orthodox Jewish school) but in comparison to the Saunders family, the Rabbi views them as unreligious. Clearly, the Rabbi does not approve of any relationship between Danny and Reuven. The Rabbi is very cold towards his son but does that mean that the Rabbi is cold by his very nature or is there an underlying reason for his relationship with Danny? This is a beautiful novel that is not just about Judaism but about relationships and it should appeal to Jewish readers and non Jewish readers alike. Additionally, this book was made into a movie that was reasonably true to the text."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This is a choice book, written in a sensitive way about several very tender relationships. It compares the life of two young men who live with very different fathers. Both young men come to know of their father's love as they reach adulthood."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen by Chaim Potok was never excited or intense in its events that took place in the story of Reuven's and Danny's lives together. However, so many things can be learned from the story that make up for the lack of action. Potok embedded messages in this story through the way Reuven changed and looked at things differently as he matured and grew older. Potok displayed a situation in which Danny was torn between pleasing his fatherand doing what he wanted to do with the rest of his life. The Jewish culture is a mystery t the majority of readers, and Reuven's and Danny's lives would seem strange to most, but the general situations of decision making and continuous maturation lead to many similarities between everyone and these two boys. The Chosen was thrilling not for action, but for all the knowledge one gains from it in Jewish culture and history, and what everyone around the world shares.I think that overall The Chosen was an informative book to read. It not only teaches about different religious faiths and views in our world, but it also goes through the lessons of growing up. Both main and minor charactersin the story contribute to the lessons taught in the novel. It teaches forgiveness, freedom, and most importantly, acceptance. The novel goes through the lives of two young Jewish boys, and shows that through the story their lives are changed by one another. In addition to important live lessons shown, it teaches the level of destructiveness that can be caused by lies and secrecy. Through the course of the novel, you witness both characters maturing and becoming different, and it causes you yourself to think of your own life, because it's easy to relate to the varied conflicts. The Chosen is worth reading because you learn and you relate.The Chosen is a very interesting, if a little slow, novel. The main characters are both Jewish, but the novel appeals to a wide audience beyond Judaism, because of its universal themes of family, friendship, secrecy, and understanding others. The story is about two friends, Danny and Reuven, who come from very different branches of Judaism. Due to their families different viewpoints, their friendship is pulled a part, but they are gradually reunited. Throughout this plot, the reader can learn many different lessons, such as loyalty to a friend, especially when that friend is in through, and understanding others' points of view. The Chosen's lack of female characters was a weak point, but overall it is a pretty good book.The Chosen is a novel that revolves around two adolescent boys, Danny Saunders and Reuven Malter, who are a part of Jewish society though they differ in their specific faiths. This book is filled with lessons to be learned and information about the Jewish faith and the Zionist movement that anyone can benefit from. The themes of friendship, secrecy, acceptance, tradition, and angst all play pivitol roles in the maturation of the two characters. Specifically, Danny learns that he has a right to live his own life despite growing up in an extremely tradition-based household. Reuven learns to accept different methods of teaching and thinking, despite the fact that he doesn't agree with them. The absence of female characters is inconsequential in the plot because they do not have a dominant role in the Jewish society. There are many minor characters met a long the way as well who all convey a certain message that Reuven and Danny can benefit from. Overall, The Chosen is a novel that will teach one to open his/her eyes to the differences in the world and they can help positively shape our lives.We are all very prejudiced. We judge each person by what they look like, what they sound like, and where they come from. This book destructs all of our prejudiced ideas when two boys of the most prestigious groups of Jews become friends. Their friendship is continuously strong through all of the bonds that are broken by the rules of their religion. It teaches life lessons concerning family life, and facing your deepest fears. It had a strong plot and reading what helpful in learning more about the Jewish religion that caused Reuven and Danny so much trouble. Every family has problems, and without pushing away the strong iron gates of secrecy is unable to reach mutual understanding or resolution, which slowly breaks apart the family they thought they new.The Chosen by Chaim Potok is a book about friendship, conflicts, and the clashing of two worlds that are similar but different. It contains lots of information concerning Judaism to help the non-Jewish reader understand what is happening. It is a book where secrecy abounds and the characters are often hurt as a result of this secrecy. Overall, The Chosen contains many good lessons about friendship and accepting others. This book, while not my favorite read, was gripping at times and is a good read for older readers.Chaim Potok's novel, The Chosen, was a narration appeals to both the young and the old, by the means of eloquent lessons Potok preaches. It is the story of two teen age boys, Reuven and Danny, who find that even though they live in radically different worlds, they have more in common than they know. The book accompanies the adversity faced in adolescence, with the rich Jewish heritage shared by both boys. The novel seems more real than other fabricated fiction because it speaks to all of us. It focuses on humanistic qualities that we are often blind to in own lives. Life, we realize at the completion of the novel, is something that is fleeting. We are faced with choices and those choices drastically affect our lives. But, what if we were \\"chosen\\" and we didn't have a choice? How would you choose to live? The lessons you learn after reading are life-altering, but the quality of the book is determined by how you receive those lessons.The Chosen is a great book for everyone. Chaim Potok created a miraculous story about friendship, secrecy, and differences. Although both protagonists, Danny and Reuven, are Jewish it does not affect the overall comprehension of the story. This bildungsroman has a powerful and inspirational plot that relates to everyone. It displays the true meaning of friendship and what being a friend means. Even the minor characters instill hope in the reader, and teach moral life lessons, like not taking things for granted. This book reveals inner turmoil that is present in everyone. The Chosen also helps give insight on the Jewish religion. Throughout the maturation of Danny and Reuven, the reading audience matures too, learning life lessons valuable to everyone."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Reading the reviews here of \\"The Chosen\\" might make one think it is a novel about Judaism, which is only partially true. The real story is one of friendship, that between the Hasidic prodigy Danny and his pal, Reuven Malter. According to Wikipedia, Chaim Potok discovered his love for the novel when he read \\"Brideshead Revisted\\". You definitely can feel the resonances of that book when reading \\"The Chosen\\".Instead of 1920s Oxford, the setting is 1940s Brooklyn, specifically the Williamsburg section, then a haven of brownstones and ailanthus trees that look pretty in the sunlight but produce pungent, jabbing leaves. Reuven first encounters Danny as an opposing player at an ill-tempered baseball game. Danny's line drive puts Reuven in the hospital, but when Danny visits him there, the two teens find a lot to admire in one another and become firm friends.One of those books I first encountered in the corridors of high school, and pretty much avoided on that basis, \\"The Chosen\\" is a moving book that requires a certain commitment from the reader going in. Like Waugh in \\"Brideshead\\", Potok is a deliberate writer, and his narrative, while not long, is slow-paced. He buries you in the world of strict Judiasm, though he is careful to provide a road map, explaining various terms and practices.As meaningful as the relationship between Danny and Reuven becomes, neither is the novel's most absorbing character. That would be Reb Saunders, Danny's strict father, who views Reuven with a fascinating blend of empathy and hostility.\\"The world kills us!\\" Reb Saunders tells his congregation. \\"The world flays our skin from our bodies and throws us to the flames. The world laughs at Torah! And if it does not kill us, it tempts us! It misleads us!\\"Being that this is the 1940s, Reb Saunders' words have more than metaphoric meaning. So you understand a little when he seems to resist Danny's impulse to befriend Reuven, and wonder a bit at how, after Danny makes clear his chosen path is not what his father wants, Reb Saunders switches tactics and employs Reuven as a bridge to reach his son.One fascinating subplot of the novel involves the birth of Israel. Published in the war-torn year of 1967, \\"The Chosen\\" presents the question of Israel's necessity in the wake of the Holocaust. For Reuven, such a state is a matter of survival. For Reb Saunders, Israel is a threat to the more religious side of the Jewish experience, which leaves the question of survival up to God.Unlike \\"Brideshead Revisited\\", humor is almost completely absent from \\"The Chosen\\", and the focus of the book after a while becomes very tight on four principal characters (including Reuven's sickly father). But what Potok does is more impressive than what he doesn't do. \\"The Chosen\\" dares to make its characters' intellectual journeys the stuff of real drama, while at the same time arguing passionately for the value of true heart and soul in a world that places a higher premium on brainpower. It's an inspiring read."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"It was a rare treat. A novel without kitschy romance or sex. I couldn't put it down and hated for it to end."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Potok is one of my favourite authors. I am not even Jewish, but I found this book in my mother's library. I read it in High School and was totally intrigued by Judaism and the Jewish culture. I learned about Jewish life, Hasidism, Hasidics' view of Conservative (or secular) Jews and vice-versa, father-son relationships, and following one's dreams which might go against a parent's expectation.I absolutely cherished this book (sadly it was already falling apart and I had to tape the cover page back on).For anyone who is interested to know more about the topics that I mentioned above, go ahead and read it."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Set in the 1940s in Brooklyn, this is the story of 2 sons of rabbis: the Hasidic Danny Saunders (brilliant, photographic memory, goes on to become a clinical psychologist) and Reuven Malter, son of a merely Orthodox rabbi, (considered as little more than infidels by the Hasids.) The story revolves around their friendship, beginning when Reuven is sent to the hospital when batter Danny's ball ends up in his eye, shattering his glasses and embedding glass in his cornea. All turns out well for Reuven's eye, and the friendship persists into college, when it is interrupted by the Zionist work of Rabbi Malter and his work in establishing the Zionist state of Israel. The Hasids were strongly against a secular Jewish state. At that time, Reb Saunders forbade any further contact between the two boys. The boys continue a separate path through college, with Reuven deciding to become a rabbi, and Danny leaving the religious community of Hasids, shaving off his earlocks and entering the secular community. He had been raised \\"in silence\\", a failed tactic intended to ensure the development of his soul as well as his intellect. Reb was concerned the boy did not have a heart for suffering. The suffering Danny experienced by not being able to talk to his father was intense. The final scene between father and son comes after Rabbi Malter insists that Reuven answer the insistent invitations of Reb Saunders to come on Shabbat as in earlier times. Reuven thereby acted as a medium to give Rev's son Danny the message that it was OK to leave the Hasid community, but that he must remain a man of the Commandments."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I had to read it for my class, but I wanted to read it again the second I got done. It was the first book that I read that I got emotional about. I really recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I really liked the historical aspect of the book. Though a work of fiction, it helped me to understand many ideas among the Jewish followers. A little too slow at times for my tastes (particularly the Talmud discussions). A certain amount was necessary to comprehend the background and situation but it went a bit overboard for me.Overall I thought this was worth the time invested in reading it and I feel like a gained new insight into the Jewish faith and relationships in general."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"\\"The Chosen\\", by Chaim Potok, is a narrative about two Jewish boys, Reuven Malter and Danny Saunders, who are from different Jewish sects. The novel is all about their friendship and about them growing up together and the troubles they face due to their different religious interpretation. The boys are raised in different styles Reuven is raised in a regular manner, while Danny's father raises him in silence. Silence is a recurring, mysterious theme of the novel and the way they are raised greatly affects what they become in life. Silence is Danny's father Reb's way of raising Danny so that he will become a good rabbi by learning the ability to figure things out independently. Unfortunately, silence also separates Reuven and Danny when Reuven's father stresses the need to form a Jewish state. He supports \\"Zionism\\" while Danny's father does not and this causes Reb to forcibly separate the two boys.In the novel Potok uses silence as a literary device that gives the text depth and mystery. The style of Potok's writing is sometimes very mysterious and, for me at least, confusing. The steady moving story shows the ways friendship can mature and change through different uncontrollable factors. It also gives insight into the different beliefs about raising children. I would recommend this book for someone who is prepared to think on a deeper level about the things of life, about differences, and about what can unite us."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This and its companion novel \\"The Promise\\" are my favorite novels -- at least if I haven't read Leon Uris's \\"Armageddon\\" or \\"Exodus\\" lately. I've read this beautiful story of friendship more then eight times and it still brings tears to my eyes. The fact they are Jewish and that it is set in WWII NYC are incidental because the challenges they faces are timeless. I love this book."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I read this book as a teenage boy, and it changed my life forever. It satisfied me in an emotional and intellectual way that no book had managed previously (and would not do again until reading another Potok novel, &quot;My Name is Asher Lev&quot;). Although I am a Gentile (and an atheist), this book moved me so strongly that I still feel linked to Judaism. My own angst and confusion seemed mirrored in the tale of these two true friends. I recommend this book to all thoughtful readers, children and adults, who wish to explore themselves as they explore the adolescence of troubled young men growing to mature manhood."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I haven't finished a book in about 5 years. I haven't found a book that could keep me interested. This book did. I am a high school student and this was part of our required summer reading. This is the reason I started reading the book. However, after I started reading I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I first read this book as a teenager, and have re-read it numerous times since. I'm now in my mid-40's. As a teen, it opened my eyes to a world most of us never encounter - Jewish Brooklyn, the sphere of the Hasids, Talmudic study. As I've aged my enjoyment of the book has matured. These days, it's particularly interesting in light of Mid East politics and the controversy surrounding the founding of the State of Israel. Through all these years, though, the relationships between the boys and their fathers remains as touching, as profound as they were upon first reading. I cried the first few times I read this book. I still re-read certain passages just for the emotional \\"oomph\\".A tremendous, powerful book that bears up well for a lifetime's enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I'm not Jewish but my co-worker who is Jewish recommended this book to me. I found it to be very engaging from beginning to end. This is a coming of age story of two teen-age boys who form an unlikely friendship set against the backdrop of the end of WW II.The reviewers who called it boring apparently don't understand that good storytelling doesn't have to be all about slam-bang action. It's lamentable that popular culture has become so action-oriented that so many cannot appreciate a quiet, well-told story such as this one.This book reminded me of \\"A Separate Peace\\", another novel that is often assigned for school reading. If you like the one, you will probably like the other and sadly, if your taste runs only to action and adventure you may not \\"get\\" either one."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Chaim Potok's The Chosen is the powerful story of two Orthodox Jewish boys and the friendship that unites them in the face of all kinds of opposition.Reuven Malter is fifteen years old when he meets Danny Saunders, the son of a Hasidic tzaddik. As Danny and Reuven become friends, Reuven learns that Danny is not the average Hasid. For one, he has a brilliant mind such as only appears once in a generation. He also has deep struggles with his culture and his family, which Reuven often cannot understand.The novel follows Danny and Reuven through high school and college, where they both struggle with their beliefs, their families, and their friendship.The Chosen is both challenging and uncomfortable to read, for the questions that it raises are ones that cut to the heart. What is a soul, and what price is worth paying for one?Beautifully written, compelling, and challenging, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"From the very first page, this story grabbed me and wouldn't let go. At first, I thought it would be a pretty boring, run-of-the-mill type story, but for once I was wrong! It begins with the protagonist, Reuven Malter, in a basball game. Now, I'm not a fan of baseball (what can I say? I'd rather play it than watch it) but I still got really into it. Reuven is Jewish, but of a more moderate sect, while the other team is of a fanatic Jewish sect. I won't even try to spell it because I'll almost certaintly get it wrong. Anyway, the other team is pretty awful at baseball except for one boy, Danny Saunders.The baseball game is long and intense, with both sides feeling that there is more going on than a simple game. Finally, Danny faces off with Reuven. Danny is hitting and Reuven is pitching. Danny strikes out on the first two pitches, but then figures out Reuven's trick and hits the ball straight into Reuven's face, breaking his glasses. Needless to say, Reuven is in a lot of pain and has a terrible headache. The other team wins the game and Reuven is rushed to the hospital where it is discovered that a piece of glass is lodged in his eye. He goes through a successful surgery, but no one knows whether he will regain sight in that eye.The next day, Danny comes to visit Reuven and to apologize, but Reuven, still angry, sends him away. Reuven's father tries to explain the importance of listening to someone when he wants to talk to you, so when Danny returns the next day, Reuven is ready to listen. Danny apologizes and they begin to get to know one another a little. In spite of his religion, Danny is interested in psyco-analisis, while Reuven wants to be a rabbi.This is the beginning of a wonderful, if sometimes rocky, friendship between the two. The rest of the book deals with each boy and his own problems, although it is mainly about Danny. Danny feels trapped in his religion. His father is the leader of the sect, and as the oldest son, Danny is destined to take his place. He doesn't have a good relationship with his father, and they don't talk except during Talmud memorization battles. Both boys learn something and benefit from the friendship and the ending is heart-wrenching, with a twist you'll never expect. Overall, I have almost no criticism for this book, it is a moving story and everyone can learn from it. I will try to find the sequal as soon as possible, and in the meantime, I advise everyone to read this book. You will never regret it!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Chaim Potok's book, THE CHOSEN, is an extremely well written book. If you read and enjoyed MY NAME IS ASHER LEV, also by Potok, I would highly recommend this book to you! Besides the fact that the story itself was excellent, the vocabulary and context of the story are very easy to follow.The story begins with a baseball game that includes excellent details that keep even a non-baseball lover intrigued. During this game, the protagonist, Reuven, is injured by a player on the opposite team, Danny. This book discusses the growth of the relationship between Reuven and Danny. It goes through the struggles Reuven has with Danny's father, as well as talking about each of their personal growth. Danny, the son of a Hasidic rabbi, wants to become a psychologist, while Reuven, the son of a professor and great thinker, wants to become a rabbi. This book describes their lives chronologically through Reuven Malter's eyes.This book was yet another success for Chaim Potok! I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great story and wants to learn a little more about Hasidic history."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"For those that want something different from the usual love stories that could possibly never be true, action movies with impossible moves made by just about the cutest guys on the planet, and the most blood chilling horror movies, Chaim Potok's &quot;The Chosen&quot; offers a different concept of entertainment. Although it is based upon the story of two teenage boys and the special friendship that they share, it is built upon the foundation of Judaism. If you want to learn more about the Jewish culture, &quot;The Chosen&quot; would be perfect for you. But it's not only a religious experience because Potok knits into the explanations of certain Jewish sects, problems that teenagers would commonly encounter in their lives. The ability to relate to these teenage characters' lives and by the descriptive ways Potok present their teenage life story drew me into the story and will draw you into it too. Potok cleverly used the characters to heighten the reality of the story and helps you feel like your actually one of the characters. It's a great book to read when you're having problems with your parents because it helps you realize how great the bond between parents and their children are no matter what one might be going through with one's parents. And when the sons or fathers cry and their hearts ache for one another, you feel it in your heart too because you can relate to it... the painful yet sweet pang of love that occurs within the relationships of close friends and family."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Well, it's been another year, but the Chosen is still the best book I've ever read. I made some errors on my last review, so I'll change them. I did not WRITE the Chosen, I READ it (which is what I meant to say, except that I was too busy applauding Chaim Potok). And I have since found out that the term for one who is born jewish but becomes more religious later is &quot;b'aal teshuvah&quot;, not &quot;born-again-jew&quot;. (But it kinda works, doesn't it?)For people who are still confused about all the Jewish terms: LOOK THEM UP! I didn't know much about Judaism before I read it either, so I read through dictionnairies, encyclopedias, etc... NOW I know enough to UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. (And aren't books much more FUN that way?)Reuven is clearly NOT a secular Jew. He is Orthodox. (Modern Orthodox, as it is called now.) No secular Jew goes to synagogue, is instructed in yiddish and hebrew in a yeshiva,(or even goes to a yeshiva) studies talmud, wears a yarmulke and prays with teffilin, ok?Clearly, Reuven's character is portraying the few thousand orthodox jews who think that the current-day-Israel has the right to exist, despite passages in the Torah that say otherwise. (I think Potok, who is also Orthodox, is one of them too, and the fact that there were enough Orthodox Zionists in the High School show that he was really trying to set these characters apart, even among the orthodox.)The theme here is not that Danny is more religious than Reuven. It's that BOTH are religious, and that each thinks the other way is wrong.This often occurs among M.O. (Modern Orthodox) and U.O. (Ultra-orthodox, including Hasidism).The interesting thing is, according to the HALACHAH (I hope I spelled that right), or &quot;religious laws&quot;, they are both &quot;religious&quot;.ex: torah forbids touching face and sides of head with a blade, so hasidism grow beards and &quot;sidelocks&quot; (peyes). However, M.O. use an electric razor (no blade), so technically, they are still fulfilling the commandment.Every time I read this, more insight is gained. I still say this book, although fictionnal, is a valuable reading material for the secular and reform jews of today who still can't comprehend why &quot;anyone would want to live like that&quot;.This book has impacted my life and I will always be grateful to Chaim Potok for writing it. He is a genius, and I hope he continues to write many more masterpieces of literature.(I eagerly look forward to the finishing of Asher Lev's story, which Potok is supposedly working on.)"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book is an amazing story of two different lives brought together by an accident.

There were times that I didn't want to read it at all, but I'm glad I did, because it was well written. It's a good story about boys holding onto friendship even through adolescence. I only wish the author would have included more women, because it almost seemed like an old story because Danny's sister and mother were practically the only women that had any lines in the book. I would recommend this more towards guys and only if you're committed, because it gets very boring at parts."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The book begins with two boys divided by their religion. Throughout the book is a wonderful portrayal of how friendship can overcome boubdaries. The Jewish language causes a bit of a stunbling block.

This book is an eye opener about common Jewish people and how they handle different struggles.

I myself am not Jewish, but the material discussed, though rooted in Jewish religion, pertains to all.

I have to admit, there were some parts of the book that almost put me to sleep, but in the end it turned out to be a good plot and I really liked the story. I also like the fact that during the entire book, the author sneaks in little turning points and events happening in the war at that time so that you can relate the story to history."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book was very good in a sense of enjoyment.

But after I got over the extremly boring beginning (apx. 180 pages of 270) the book began to really be good. If you are looking for even a hint of action look somewhere else, as this book can be extremly boring for thrill seekers. I encourage current readers to read until pg. 200 before you decide wether the book is boring or not.

It never looked particularly interesting to me personally, so I put it off and put it off. I finally got around to picking up a copy, and was pleasantly surprised for the first 75 pages or so. It did engage me. And then...what I expected: the author began to describe the tedious nuances of the slightly-different faiths in excruciating detail. I just didn't care. I found myself skipping whole paragraphs hoping to get back to the storyline. Eventually, I just threw in the towel. Judging from all the positive reviews here on Amazon, and from friends and coworkers, I trust that there is something worthwhile here. Unfortunately, I couldn't find it. So, take the advice that makes sense for you. You know yourself better than most, right? I should have trusted my own instincts. But, sometimes we're wrong, right?

It won't be as interesting if you weren't be able to picture what is going on, so you should try to picture some of the events of the story in your mind as you read it."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen was a very interesting book. I rated it as a four star, because the flow of the book was great. A main point that stuck out to me was when Danny had caused the accident with Reuven. This was interesting because it caused the theme of friendship. It had brought the two of these people together and they both had realized &quot;forgiveness&quot; was a key role. I enjoyed this book, and i have read several books, and this was most likely one of my favorites. This is because it had many themes that had a major impact on how the characters acted. one example is how the Jewish religion had affected Danny's life of studying the Talmud all the time and not having many activities going on in his life."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This famous book is as flawed as it is fascinating. Basically an historical narrative about how a small Orthodox Jewish community in New York City coped with the strains of World War II, the horrifying revelations about the Holocaust, and the unexpected and dramatic rise of the State of Israel, the book reads like a literary newsreel. Were it not for the fascination of the historical events themselves, however, the book would be quite boring. The characters are shallow and stereotypical in both their words and actions. Much of the book is long winded narrative and preachy monologue. It is almost like a 300 page religious discourse. Some of the book's more serious flaws are listed below.(1) The main character's father, Rabbi David Malter, provides a long explanation to his son, Reuven, for the rise of the Hassidic movement that splintered Jewish Orthodoxy into rival sects back in the 1700s. He describes the founder of Hassidism, Israel Ba'al Shem Tov, as a genuine spiritualist, whose miracle cures were accomplished via his practical knowledge of healing plants and herbs, not via superstitious incantations and mystical powers as later legends would report. But the father's attitude to subsequent generations of Hassidic leaders is considerably less charitable, depicting them as greedy powerbrokers preying on the fears and superstitions of their followers.(2) This jaundiced view, however, is contradicted by the Hassidic rabbi, Reb Saunders, who is father of the other main character, Danny. This man is extremely erudite and seems to differ from Rabbi Malter only in dress and outward comportment, not in matters of substantive belief or knowledge.(3) The only serious point of contention between the two rabbi-fathers concerns the Zionist movement, which Reb Saunders adamantly opposes due to its secular nature, while Rabbi Malter actually becomes one of the movement's major North American spokesmen. This leads to a two-year rupture in the friendship between the two teenagers, Reuven and Danny.(4) Unfortunately, the author Potok allows his own enthusiasm for Zionism to intrude here and fails to give a fair hearing to Reb Saunders' opposition to Zionism. Reb Saunders had a brilliant brother back in Europe who left the faith, became a secular Jewish intellectual and professor, and eventually was murdered in the Holocaust. Reb Saunders cannot accept Rabbi Malter's belief that the establishment of the State of Israel will serve as a vindication of the Holocaust victims, many if not most of whom were secular Jews, since that State too would be a secular entity. Reb Saunders' view is very reasonable, and it continues to be shared by many Hassidic adherents to this day (cf. the Naturay Karta Movement), but Potok fails to give it due consideration and seems to ridicule it as reflective of the kind of primitivism that evidently he feels characterizes Hassidism in general.(5) Potok's prejudice also shows when, following a series of Arab attacks on Jewish settlements in Palestine following Israel's unilateral declaration of independence in May 1948 (a declaration that actually violated the terms of the UN Partition Plan for Palestine), the Hassidim terminate their anti-Zionist campaign at the local yeshiva. I have known anti-Zionist Hassidim personally, and anti-Jewish Arab violence does not mitigate their own anti-Zionist beliefs at all. Rather it confirms to them that Zionism itself, as a destabilizing movement, alone bears responsibility for all the tragic violence in Palestine, whether Jew against Arab or Arab against Jew. Perhaps this depiction of the sudden silence of the anti-Zionist Hassidim reflects Potok's own experiences growing up, but the reader should not believe for one minute that anti-Jewish Arab atrocities alter in any way shape or form the anti-Zionist beliefs of Hassidic groups like Naturay Karta; indeed in many ways these atrocities actually strengthen their resolve to oppose the Zionist movement.(6) Conversely, while Rabbi Malter deplores instances of anti-British and anti-Arab violence committed by Jewish terror groups like the Irgun (Menachem Begin's organization), his disillusionment is ephemeral and within a few days he returns to his pro-Zionist lobbying efforts. Rabbi Malter's reaction is almost a caricature of Jews: wringing their hands over moral dilemmas but unable, in the end, to allow those dilemmas to catalyze within them a new perspective that will help them repudiate their ill-founded and unwarranted beliefs. Rabbi Malter stands exposed, in this regard, as a morally shallow person, making cynical utilitarian calculations without even being aware of it. And there is clear evidence that the more ruthless and cynical Zionist leaders, to this day, know that whatever crocodile tears ethical Jews like Rabbi Malter might shed, as soon as they wipe them away and dry their cheeks their enthusiasm for Zionism will return unabated, and indeed strengthened.(7) This is perhaps the most glaring example of Potok's own prejudices marring the novel, since Rabbi Malter emerges clearly as the hero of the book, which concludes with Reb Saunders retreating into a kind of self-imposed shell and appearing a much less self-confident and polished person, ill equipped to deal with the complexities of balancing traditional religious values and customs with the exigencies of the modern world.There admittedly is a lot of interesting material about the inner workings of Orthodox Jewish life: daily prayers, dietary laws, Sabbath and Festival celebrations, and most of all Yeshiva studies, including detailed depictions of Talmudic study and Talmud classes, with their unique culture of erudite exegesis. The book seems to assume a certain amount of Jewish background knowledge, however.If you are interested in a general depiction of Orthodox Jewish life that accurately characterizes today's Jewish communities, both in and out of Israel, this book is worthwhile reading, but be vigilant for the kinds of flaws and prejudices mentioned above."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book was class assigned, by my english teacher... and right away i thought, &quot;Oh God, class books are soooooo boring!&quot; But as soon as i finished the first page, i got really into it, and I ended up loving it. The friendship between Danny and Reuven is heart warming and inspiring. Their experiences can alter the way people view religion for years to come. Good Job Potok!!!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I'm 14-years-old, and I read this book for school and it was a great. It shared the bonds between father and son. It also explained about religion and other heated topics in a very interesting manner."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"A friendship is difficult to maintain, and good ones are always the hardest to find. For Reuven Malter half of the dilemma is already solved, he has been appointed a friend by that person&#65533;s father. But before he gets that far, he has to meet him first.Danny Saunders, a Hasidic Jewish boy, living merely four blocks away from Reuven, is introduced as an extremely &#65533;conservative&#65533; and radical follower of a Jewish sect. His father, Reb is the leader of a church and Danny himself is destined to become a rabbi for it is in his blood, &#65533;the family dynasty&#65533; as he puts it. Your assumption of Danny&#65533;s strict Hasidic rules and guidelines quickly diminish as Reuven and Danny&#65533;s friendship grows.The first words ever passed between the two are durin an asphalt baseball game were a little less than friendly. If you want to get on someone&#65533;s good side, chances are calling their denomination of religion an abomination to the basic fundamentals of the religion they practice probably isn&#65533;t the best choice of words.Well, anyway, to make an extremely great story a little shorter, Reuven pitches the ball to Danny, Danny hits it sending the ball flying towards Reuven&#65533;s head, nailing him in the eye and landing him in the hospital for a week. Many things happen to Reuven during his stay at the hospital, he meets two new people that become distinct, but not well developed characters. Danny visits Reuven in the hospital twice, this marks the beginning of a friendship throughout the entire book. Two characters who you would never dream would get along let alone develop a lifelong friendship filled with many conflicts and obstacles along the way.Reuven, the main character of the book is a moderately libral Jew, considering his friend Danny. His father offers him advice on the many problems his friendship with Danny brings up.Danny is a troubled character, on the outside it seems completely opposite. He is tortured day after day by his father&#65533;s methods of raising him. He wants to become a psychologist, he reads many books about the subject, and even learns German to read one in it&#65533;s original language. All of this he hides from his father.David Malter is Reuven&#65533;s father, he is a source of guidance for Reuven, Reuven is forbidden to see Danny when Reb Saunders discovers the fact of his pro Zionist ideals.Reb Saunders is the very stern father of Danny. He pressures him to study the Talmud and become a rabbi like himself. He doesn&#65533;t speak to his son unless they are studying the Talmud.Chaim Potok creates a novel moving on many levels. His style is somewhat simple in summarizing entire chapters in the last couple of sentences, almost like the very end of a great Wonder Years episode. All of the characters are extremely round and well developed. An extremely good book worth everyone&#65533;s time."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"If you missed this book in your childhood, it's not too late to read it right away. This remains one of my favorite books of all time. I can still remember almost every major scene -- who could forget these two friends meeting over a baseball accident that almost blinded Reuven Malter. Of all the books on relationships between kids, this is my favorite. It's extremely well written, and the way their friendship develops is incredibly touching. Even better, the reader will be taken inside some of the most interesting descriptions of Hasidism and orthodox Jewry to be found anywhere. In fact, when I first read this book, I got interested in Gematria, a Hebrew form of numerology and ended up years later writing a huge research paper on the topic. This book is a bit hard for 8th and 9th graders but strong readers should have no trouble. It's rare that a book this intellectual and this educational be so moving."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Don't know anything about this book. I bought it for my wife for a birthday gift. She has yet to read it!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The book, The chosen by Chaim Potok was a great novel telling about the lives of two different jewish boys. This book was fairly intesting because it told of the lives of two boys who have different religous beliefs. They live their lives happily as friends, not caring what anyone has to say about them. In a small part of the city of Brooklyn, New York, there are many types of jewish people. The book described what it was like to be a jewish boy in the big city. Chaim Potok titled it The Chosen because these two boys were the ones chosen to represent their jewish communities. The book told a lot of things that most people would not know about the jewish religion. The Chosen is a good teenagers book and might be a good novel for a family memberto read. I reccomend this for many people to read it is a great novel."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Although I didn't particularly like how the book was written, I did like the values Chaim Potok was trying to bring to the reader. In his book The Chosen he writes about two boys who at first don't care for each other at all, but work at their relationship and turn out to be best friends. Not only do they not like each othe at first, but one of them is a Hasidic Jew while the other one is a Orthodox Jew. Normally, the Hasidics are not very nice to the Orthodox Jews becasue they don't think that they practice the religion according to the Bible. But the two boys get around this obstacle. Chaim Potok conveys the message that no matter how different two people are they can still work together and become good friends. Another relationship that develops in the story is between the father and the son, especially between Reb and Danny Saunders. Reb, who is Danny's father, doesn'tspeak to him with wordes, but by example. So there really isn't much dialogue going on between Danny and Reb. This example show that people show affection for each other in different ways. Even if it doesn't seem as though somebody loves you, the person probably does but is showing it in a way you can't figure out. This is a bokk almost anyone can relate to and learn from."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"When I first heard of this book, I was a little skeptical, but after I'd read it, WOW!! I don't think I've ever read such a book in all of my life. I made want to laugh, cry, be angry... I've read it over and over again and I still can't get enough. I recommend this book to everyone, young and old."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"After recently viewing a public television special on Hasidic Jews, I found reading The Chosen to be a very special experience. The author depicts in a very sensitive manner the relationship between two teenagers who come from very different Jewish backgrounds. Also, Potok portrays beautifully the loving relationships between fathers and sons. He focuses on the pain parents and children must endure when children do not choose to follow the expectations of their parents. This is a wonderful coming of age book that I recommend for teenagers and adults alike."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I just loved all the irony in this book! Two boys, one an orthodox ad one an unorthodox Jew, become good friends in New York City. They both are in truth unorthodox, but almost everything else about them is different. Danny, the son of a tzaddik, an orthodox rabbi, does not wish to continue the rabbi &quot;dynasty&quot;. The other boy, Rueven, the son of a pro-Zionism demonstrater wishes to become a rabbi despite the fact that his father would perfer for him to be a university professor. Touching! Emotional! A true allegory as well!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Possibly one of the best books that I have read ever. It taught me a lot obout the joys and heartaches of a truly great friendship.

A truly inspiring book!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book is my second all-time favorite book! (George Orwell's 1984 is my favorite.) This should be read by anyone, especially people exposed to much diversity. Throughout the masterpiece, I would think in my mind what I thought would be the most effective cont nuation of the story from whereever I was, and I would say 99 times out of 100 (No exageration!) the book took the course that I thouught would be most effective.

Two jewish boys (one orthadox, the other reformed) form a special friendship. While they may start out as enemies, they end up with a friendship that takes us all the way through to their college years. While both value the bond that they share, one is controlled more by his father and his duties to the community, while the other is forced to just deal with it. I couldn't put it down. It truly stirs up every emotion a person can have. You feel as though you are right there with them and it is as if you are a part of the book. The story also describes to some degree the Jewish religion and the differences that the two kinds of jewish communtities can have and how it affects their friendship. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because it can drag at some points, but not for long. In my opinion this book is a must. It shows how we all have to take a stand in our lives and how we all need support to sometimes do it."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I must have cried at least four times reading this wonderful book.

Reuven Malter, the narrator of the story, is the son of a writer and scholar who follows modern methods of studying Judaism. Danny is the genius son of a Hasidic rabbi, whose people live completely within the bounds of traditional Jewish law. This novel is for almost anybody regardless of religion or race. Those who are Jewish will relate easier but those who follow other beliefs can relate the different relationships that happen in this book to their own lives. The main theme was the physical silences between characters that occurred throughout the novel.I enjoy this book because the novel is about friendships that are meant to happen.\\"Now, Reuven, listen very carefully to what I am going to tell you. Reb Saunders' son is a terribly torn and lonely boy. There is literally no one in the world he can talk to. He needs a friend. The accident with the baseball has bound him to you, and he has already sensed in you someone he can talk to without fear.\\" Chapter 6, p. 113. I believe that this is a book that is worth almost anyone's time. Also, read some of Chaim Potok's other books.\\"he Promise\\"\\"My Name is Asher Lev\\"\\"In the Beginning\\"\\"The Book of Lights\\"\\"Davita's Harp\\"\\"The Gift of Asher Lev\\"\\"I am the Clay\\"\\"Old men at Midnight\\""},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book was sensational it was a book that made you laugh and cry. it was the kind of book that made you wish you were there and stop all the wrong doing.

Mr. Potok brought me right into the soul of the characters in this book, and even though I know very little about Hasidic culture, I was certainly not at a loss to the plot.

I expected that the book would be very deep and meaningful, but I didn't expect it to come across so well.One thing that is minorly surprising is C.

The rest of my family also wants to read it."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I have just completed this book as a report for my school. Potok tells the interesting story of two boys, of completely different religions who againest all odds form a friendship like no other. The book takes place during Word War II in Brooklyn, New York. The two boys run into each other when they both play in a baseball game. Potok's ability to catch readers attention really shows when he writes the story of the baseball game. It just catches your attention and grasps your soul even after the story is through. This unique story of two boys who even though the parents dont want them to be friends it happens. Reading this story will be just like a roller coaster ride: there are scary parts in it and really exciting parts where you just dont want to put the book down. This book is an awesome story of friendship that i would recomend to everyone to read. After reading this book i have learned valuable lessons on friendship and more things about certain religions and the Holocaust that i reccoment it to everyone and give this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The novel, The Chosen, by Chaim Potok is an extraordinary novel, traveling through the lives of two individual boys, Danny Saunders and Rueven Malter, as well as their family and family lifestyles.

The book is about two Jewish teenagers and their fathers. Danny is a Chassidic boy who is the son of a great Rabbi. Reuven is modern orthodox and is the son of a teacher at a Yeshiva (Jewish school). This is a moving work of friendship, religion, and the obstacles which many teenagers encounter. As a teenager, I was able to relate to much of the problems and joys that Danny and Reuven went through in the novel. I was unable to put this book down; each page touches the heart and soul. Highly recommended!David ben Ami"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen is a fascinating book! Chaim Potok writes about two Jewish boys who develop a deep unexpected friendship from a rare incident. The book takes place in Brooklyn during World War I. The two boys, Danny and Reuven are completely different Jews. Danny is the heir to a Hasidic rabbi, while Reuven is an Orthodox Jew to a Zionist father. The book explores the struggles Danny and Reuven go through. Even though they both are Jewish they have many spiritual clashes with their fathers. Chaim Potok builds the two main characters to be very believable and realistic. As I read the book I felt I knew the characters and could feel what they were going through.I really enjoyed this book because I learned a lot about Jewish culture. This book put my life into a different perspective. I thought about my family and how much pressure I receive. I also thought about my relationships with my friends and how it compares to Danny and Reuven's relationship. I highly recommend this book to anyone. It does not matter if you are Jewish or not. I myself am a strong Catholic and found it interesting to learn about a different religion."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The positive outcome from reading The Chosen is that I learned about Hasidic Jews. I never knew much about these very unusual people , but after reading, I have come to understand them. In fact some of the issues they deal with, are common to many teenagers.

Because of reading this book I have a better understanding of what it is like to be a Hisadic and Orthedox Jew living in America. The book itself was very hard to get into. The first thirty pages of lthue book is a baseball game that moves slowly. Much of the book presents huge details about Jewish culture and history. These sections tend to get boring. Even though they are extremely educational, the reader tends to dirft off about half way through these. A couple of times I almost fell asleep. When the reader returns to the plot, the reader tends to lose interest. The story itself could also move along a little more quickly. The tempo of the story did not seem to flow either. One minute Reuven and Danny are talking about something and then another, the book discusses Jewish History. I would highly recomend this book to someone interested in Jewish Culture and religion."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"When I first saw that the Chosen was a book on religious background, I was not looking forward to it. I think it was because I never gave it a chance. It did not seem interesting at all, so I decided to give this book a chance. As I was reading it over the summer, I could develop in my mind a picture of the book. I could see two friends from different religious backgrounds end up being friends. The story is about two kids, Danny Saunders who is an Hasidic Jew, and Reuven Malter, who was also a Jew. Reuven however was not as religious as Danny was. An incident brought them together and became friends. This book helps me see that even though you are different, you can still be friends. It also teaches me the Jewish community and background. I never knew how tough it was; going to school for seven to eight hours, only studying the Talmud and not having time for friends. This happens to Danny because he is so smart people can not understand him. Reuven is convinced by his father to make Danny his friend. This turns out for the good and it was a great and educational book to read."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The book The Chosen By Chaim Potok, is an educational and touching story about two jewish teenage boys and thier frinedship.

Danny Suanders, one of the boys, is a Hasidic Jew. He is very religious and has to follow the family tradition of becoming a Rabbi. The other boy, Reuven Malter, is an Orthodox Jew who is not as religious as Danny. However they still are occasion best friends. I thought this is a very good book over all. Even though this book drags on a little it is still is educational and helpful if you want to learn more about the Jewish religion."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen by Chaim Potok is a story of two boys who become friends even though they have many differences. Reuven Malter and Danny Saunders both live in Brooklyn, in the 1940s. Danny and Reuven lived five blocks away from each other, their whole lives but did not know of each others existence. Reuven Malter is an Orthodox Jew and Danny is a Hasidic Jew. The Hasidic Jew is more extreme than the Orthodox Jew, meaning that Danny wares black pants, coat, shoes, and a hat. He also has earlocks and later in the story a beard. Reuven just wares regular clothes. Danny's father is the leader of the Hasidic Jews. Danny can not do the things Reuven can do because his father and his religion do not permit it. Danny can't read any other books except for books that have to do with his religion. He can not go to movies or listen to the radio. His father also has to approve of his friends. Danny has an arranged marriage. When he or any other Hasidic Jew are born the families arrange the marriage. The two children usually don't meet until they are married. At parties the males can not dance with the females and the females can not dance with the males. Reuven as an Orthodox Jew can do all of this. When Danny's father died he was expected to take his place as the rabbi. This is not his choice. Unlike Danny, Reuven gets to decide what he wants to do in life. Danny's dream was to go to college and become a psychologist and not a rabbi. When his father died he had to take his place and carry on the family tradition. Danny does not want to do this. One day he would tell his father. Reuven also wanted to go to college, but he wanted to be a rabbi. Both of the boys went to Hirsch College. Their relationship in college suffered. When Mr. Malter made a Zionist speech in Madison Squre Garden about how the Jews should build their capital in Palestine, Danny's father forbid him to talk to Reuven. Reb Saunders was an anti-Zionist. He believes that the messiah is going to come and tell them where to build the capital. Throughout the year at college Reuven and Danny did not speak to each other. This made them both sad. The second year of college started and Danny and Reuven still did not talk. It was not until Mr. Malter had a second heart that they resumed their friendship. In the last chapters of the book Danny must make a very difficult choice that will affect him for the rest of his life."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen, by Chaim Potok, is a great book filled with meaning. It also has its down times like most of the book. Waste would be a suitable word for describing most of the filler chapters in this book. However, this book is great for the little children or young adults to read because of its meaning and age of the characters. In my opinion, the plot was incredibly bad. The lessons and morals could have been expressed just the same in a book with a different, more exciting plot. However, overall, if you condensed the book to all its important parts all together, then you might have a quite decent school book. But then you still got the problem of the bad plot. And it would only be a couple of pages."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This masterpiece is not just a novel, it's an inside view of Jewish history from before the dark ages. It gives the reader not only a good story, but an insight into the various schools of thought, how they developed over history, and how it affects the Jewish Nation and the world today. This story isn't just for those of Jewish extract, it's a great and interesting story for anyone who enjoys history and an absorbing novel. It may have been published thirty years ago, but the events and characters are timeless. A fine addition to anyone's library!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"David Malter, Rueven's father, asks rethorically why the Hasidict Sect of the Saunders believe their Tzadikkim (religious leaders and holy men) must carry the weight of the world on their shoulders. In Jewish mythos, there are Tzadiks who do this, and they are the unselfish people of the world. I would not go so far as to say that Danny or his father are the Tzadiks I believe in, however they have taken on the pain of the world by choice. They see suffering and feel it as well, healing as best they can with Religion.Yet look closer, and you can see that the Chosen one is not Danny. He is a Tzadik because he was made to be one. There is another who is a Tzadik because he is needed to be one.His name is Rueven Malter."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I hadn't touched a copy of this book in thirty years, but I remember it with great fondness. And when I saw a stage production of this novel with Theodore Bikel as Reb Saunders, I felt I had to pick up a copy and reread it.This is the story of two boys growing up within the same religion, but with vastly different backgrounds, in a world that has become part of history, but which has not faded from the minds of men.Reuven Malter and Danny Saunders are, each in their own way, trying to become active members of the post-Holocaust world they find themselves in. Reuven has an easier time of it because of his father's opinions on the course world Jewry must take; Danny has a much more difficult time, because of his father's opinions on that same subject. Danny is also hampered because of his father's expectations for him, while Reuven's father is more accepting of his son's intentions.Potok takes these basic points and fashions a powerful story that comes along only once in a lifetime. In this case, twice in a lifetime - because its sequel, &quot;The Promise&quot;, is every bit as good as &quot;The Chosen&quot;."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This highly lauded book is a tale of fathers, sons, differing traditions, changing times, and ageless truths. Written in deceptively simple style and from the point of view of Rueven, a teen-aged Jewish boy in WWII era New York City, \\"The Chosen\\" is the story of his unlikely friendship with Danny, the son of a leader of Hasidic Jews in Williamsburg.Inextricably woven through the narrative is the study of the Talmud, which in terms of time and attention, is the center of both boys' lives.The two boys must work out their relationships among themselves and their fathers, and must find a way to pursue theircallings. Ironically, Danny's vocation is to become a \\"secular\\" psychologist rather than, as tradition dictates, a rabbi in thefootsteps of his father. Rueven is the one who senses a call to the rabbinate.Potok writes cleanly, never letting his style get in the way of the story. At its close you will know the hearts of its four major characters."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen is easily my favorite novel. The story is quite good, and the friendship between Reuven and Danny is well portrayed. However, the importance of the story lies in its deep understanding of the relationship between intellect, suffering, and compassion.Danny's father, especially through watching his brother, understands that intellect by itself is entirely bankrupt. A person whose intelligence is untempered by compassion will be unable to lead and to guide in the way they should. If it is your desire to lead, you need to know what it is to suffer just as you need to have knowledge.I am preparing to be a pastor, and this lesson has been of utmost importance for me through the years. If I want to love my church rightly, I must be willing to suffer for them and with them. I must be willing to experience all the pain of life and to cry for others as they experience it, because otherwise my heart will become a shell, cutting off the spark of compassion (to use Potok's imagery).This book will teach you to be a tzadik for the world. And the world needs a tzadik."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I found the cover intriguing on my way through the bookstore, and picked this one up. Being raised Catholic, I wasn't sure that I would relate, but the premise seemed interesting, so I bought it. This novel really turned me on to Potok's work, and I've since purchased all of his other books. I find this work the easiest to read by far, as those who are not familiar with the Jewish faith will still be able to follow it well."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"As a teacher, I use this book to teach 8th graders about history. Of course, it's lessons go so very deep. Fathers, sons, traditions, expectations, choices, responsibility to name so very few. Told against the backdrop of the the end of second World War and the founding of Israel, the story is timeless. Although it certainly doesn't hurt to be well versed in Jewish history, this book is about applicable to all young people (and the not so young). A beautiful tale of coming of age and learning."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I am a 17 year old Junior. This book was assigned as a summer reading project. It was excellent in every regard. I do not think this book would overwhelm or bore younger students, it is a simple, easy, and very enjoyable read. Not only was this book simple, it is inspirational. I feel this book has changed me, changed the way I look at life, change the way I approach life. I am not saying this will happen for everybody, I'm a teenager still looking for meaning in my life. But if it affects me this strongly, I am sure it can have at least the slightest beneficial influence on you."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Reuven Malter and Danny Saunders meet by fate at a disasterous baseball game in which Reuven's eye is shattered by Danny's ball, and they quickly befriend one another. The two come from opposite sides of Judiasm, Reuven is orthodox and Danny is Hasidic. Danny's father is a respected rabbi in the Hasid community and at first has trouble with his son's choice of friends, but soon Danny, his father, and Reuven are studying Torah together like old friends.But a great disagreement over Zionism leads Rabbi Saunders to forbid Danny to talk with Reuven again. The somewhat upbeat tone of the book takes a turn for the worst after this event and stays in a quite depressing mood until, almost two years later, Danny and Reuven are allowed to speak once again.In terms of plot line, The Chosen is one of the better books I've read, dealing with the tribulations of a true friendship. The problem that I found was that I felt that the rather downbeat tone that kept up for a number of chapters led me to yearn for the characters to do something more than do homework and study Talmud, obsessing over the non-communication that happens between Danny and Reuven.Read this book if you interested in a realistic view of seperate sects of Judiasm with slightly obsessive characters who are well developed. I enjoyed it, it teaches a good lesson and in a mature way, so I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"the chosen is a story about two young men who deal with the demands of their father. in addition to enlightening me on the traditions and customs of jews, it presented a quiet hope for the intelligence and decency of human beings. the characters in this book are smart and sensible. part of the reason the chosen is such a powerful book is that the characters seem like real people.all aspects of the chosen align and form a pitch-perfect note that only truly great art can accompolish. it is something that mozart did with music, and da vinci did with painting. the chosen does that with literature.i am in 7th grade now and i read this book when i was in 5th grade, so that should show you something about the reading level. the words and language may be hard for people my age to understand, but everything in this book is written with a clear and thoughtful intention.

The part of the city he lives in is heavily populated with Jewish sects. He had led a good life with little problems to worry about until an early June,s ball game. It was a Sunday afternoon and his team was scheduled to play the winning team of another neighborhood league with a reputation for having a wild offensive. The day he was hit with a baseball by one of the opposing team members, Danny Saunders. This marked the beginning of a beautiful relationship between Danny and Reuven even though they didn't share the same Jewish traditions and heritage. Something they also didn't have in common and plays a big part in the relationship between them and their fathers. The book then takes on challenging problems that friends encounter.This book is absorbing and will leave you wanting more. You will be able to relate to some of the reallife problems the book deals with. Although the book deals with a lot of Jewish heritage, it should not only intrigue adults but young readers too. The reallife problems and concepts of life are sure to make you want to read this book over and over again."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen was a good book. I chose it out of a list for school, then found it to be better than I had hoped. Since I normally don't read books that have to do with real life problems, this is quite a compliment. It is a book of great hate, and the will to overcome it, even without knowledge of Orthadox Judaism, I still could figure out what was going on :)"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Potok's \\"The Chosen\\" is a rare type of novel that can keep readers interested, as long as they are willing to pay attention. In the beginning, I was barely interested, but as I continued to read about the lives of the two boys, Reuven and Danny, I found myself yearning for Danny to gain confidence and speak up to his father, and hoping that Reuven would support him.This novel focuses on two teenage boys, Reuven and Danny that meet one day while playing on opposing teams in a softball game. Due to Danny being a Hassidic Jew and Reuven being Orthodox, the teams despised each other. After an accident involving a softball and a pair of glasses, Reuven and Danny come together and create what would become a magnificent friendship. The plot grows deeper when each of their fathers' differentiating beliefs come out through their actions and words. It appears the two adults couldn't be more different, in fact, it seems one of the only similarities is that each father deeply cares for his family.Although there are multiple themes used throughout the novel, the one that stuck out to me was Secular vs. the Religious. Through the majority of the novel, Danny searches for a way to talk to his father about his future. Throughout Danny's life, his future had been planned for him, but he wanted to go against tradition and pursue a career that would make him happier with the outcome. Another representation of this theme is shown in the beginning, when there is so much hostility between the Hasidic and Orthodox teams in the softball game. Although everyone on each team is Jewish, the Orthodox are less strict and more lenient when it comes to Jewish tradition, which is why the tension between the two groups was so intense. In a way, the Hasidic don't believe that the Orthodox truly follow Judaism.The whole novel was, to simply put it, fantastic. I enjoyed nearly every aspect of it, although there were a few things that made it less enjoyable. Each page was loaded with brilliant description, the problem was that it was all so detailed that it made it harder to grasp, at times. But, I've never been one for loads of description, some may love it! I truly took pleasure in the characters. They were all so well-developed and they each had their own personality, which made the story a lot more interesting.Along with this book, I've also enjoyed some other works that took place during the Second World War. If you read this novel, you'll possibly enjoy \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" by Anne Frank, along with \\"Night\\" by Elie Wiesel. He tells of his experiences inside Auschwitz with his father. I recommend all three of these beautiful pieces of literature. Potok has outdone himself. This novel shouldn't simply be recognized as an American classic, but a classic that will live on throughout the world.(Word Count-493)"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Reuven Malter is an Orthodox Jewish teenager living in Brooklyn during the end of World War II. At a softball game against a Hasidic school, he suffers a serious injury from a ball hit by another teenager named Danny Saunders. Ironically, this incident results in the two boys becoming good friends. The plot revolves around their friendships, their relationships to their fathers and their relationships to their brands of Judaism. Malter is more secular than Saunders and his father, also a devout Jew, is a biblical scholar and an activist of sorts, writing columns in a local newspaper that cover topics on Jews and Judaism. Saunders comes from the more confined world of the Hasidim and is the son and expected heir to his Rabbi father's synagogue and congregation. Both boys are extremely intelligent, well-read and highly mature. They both study the Talmud extensively and their profound knowledge is exhibited throughout the book. The Saunders boy, however, is undergoing a crisis as he has no desire to inherit his father's role but instead wants to study psychology. He is an avid reader who goes thru a book a day and has been reading material that is secular and potentially threatening to his faith. The story is about this struggle as well as Malter's struggle to make sense out of his friend's crisis and the relationship between his friend and his friend's father, which is lived out in a very unusual manner. There is a lot of Jewish history throughout as it plays a significant role in explaining different characters' mindsets and their place in the world. In a sense, the book is also a primer on how Orthodox and Hasidic Jews study the Talmud. Potok is a master storyteller and his writing strongly evokes the environment of Jewish Brooklyn in the 1940's, not only the physical environment but also the religious and emotional milieu of that time and place. This is a powerful story of friendship, the struggle for individuation from childhood to adulthood and of faith and its promises and failed expectations."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time and I love it just as much now as when I originally read it in the early 90's. My life has changed but the simple truths in this book are timeless.Potok is a master and I think every teenager should read this book."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"In Chaim Potok's, The Chosen friendship begins in an odd way. Danny Saunders, an Hasidic Jew, and Rueven Malter, an Orthodox Jew are playing baseball for their schools. Filled with hatred for the Orthodox team, Danny throws a baseball into Rueven's face sending him to the hospital. Shocked at the hatred that lives within himself, Danny visits Rueven in the hospital. They become friends.Raised in entirely different Jewish sects, community within the sect is sacred, contact with those outside of the sect is discouraged. Danny and Rueven's friendship is rare and dear.Potok delves deep into the Hasidic and Orthodox culture and religion making it not just a great story of friendship but an intriguing way to learn of the tradition, customs and culture of these two Jewish sects."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This short novel is a story of two fathers and two sons; one son, Reuven, is a fairly conservative Jew, perhaps even Orthodox, but with a modern outlook. His father is a noted academic, Talmud critical scholar, and Zionist. The other young man, Danny, is the son of a Hassidic rebbe, who is the leader of a tightly-knit, isolated Russian immigrant community who came to United States fleeing antisemitic persecution.Written clearly and straightforwardly, Reuven, narrating in first person, tells us about his experiences and interactions with Danny and how each other's father had a decisive influence over each child, even though the fathers themselves never personally met each other.Potok captures the differences between the conservatives and the ultra-Orthodox without going into technical dissertations. Instead, Potok presents us with what each branch of Judaism does instead of jumping into long dogmatic compare-and-contrast narratives.The result is enchanting. I only notionally knew about the different schools of Jewish thought and practice but in Potok's portrayal, the reader can see readily the differences and that these differences are anything but nuanced.I find Potok's more effective than many primers in Judaism that I've read: Potok told me what each group thought of each other against the momentous event that lead to the founding of the State of Israel in 1948. Conventional wisdom would lead one to believe that all Jews wanted their own state in Palestine, yet one is surprised to learn that this wasn't the case. Many among the Ultra-Orthodox decried the founding of Israel on theological grounds. For, according to them only the Messiah could reestablish the People in the Land of Israel, whereas more secularized Jews either dismissed that idea or, better still, wanted to seized the initiative from God - with no disrespect intended to the Deity.Potok's story transcends religious boundaries. It is the story about fathers and sons. I passed along the book to my eldest son who devoured it and enjoyed it. It also added to his level of awareness about other people's beliefs and chosen way of life. Get The Chosen. I recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Title: The Chosen by Chaim PotokPages: 271Time spent on the \\"To Read\\" shelf: 2-3 years I think.Days spent \\"reading\\" it: 10.75 hours in a car (more like \\"listening\\" to it).Why I read it: One friend of mine recommended Chaim Potok to me a long time ago. He actually read My Name is Asher Lev. I thought the premise for The Chosen sounded interesting enough, so I picked it up somewhere. I started it during a 5 hour trip to Willard, OH for a youth group trip. I made the kids listen to it. They hated it. Except one of them, and he only tolerated it. I finished it up this week as I traveled again to Willard, OH.Brief Review: OY VEY! During the first 3/4 of this book I was not sure if I liked it or not. The first chapter was a never ending baseball game described in too much detail. That same sort of problem occurs occasionally through the book. However, there are many great elements in The Chosen as well.The Chosen revolves around the friendship of two boys--Danny and Reuven--who meet because Danny drills a baseball into Reuven's eye during this epic baseball game. There are wonderful themes of friendship, father-son relationships, struggles with growing up, struggles with tradition, struggles with God. The time backdrop for the book is from World War II to the creation of the physical nation of Israel (another interest of mine).The cons: extensive discussions on Freud (Danny is interested in psychoanaylsis) and that interminable baseball game.The pros: Danny and Reuven's relationship, Reuven's relationship with both his own father and Danny's father. I personally enjoyed the multiple discussions about how the Talmud is analyzed and argued by the students. I also love stories about prodigies, Danny happens to have a photographic memory, this fascinates me to no end. I think I wish I was a prodigy (sometimes I imagine I am!).One thing about listening to this book (instead of reading it), was that during the climatic scene between Reuven, Danny, and Danny's father, I felt like I was actually listening to the conversation. I felt like Danny's father was talking to me. That was very powerful moment (and worth wading through some of the book to reach).I ended up really enjoying this book. The characters are lovingly portrayed. There are complicated characters (like Reb Saunders, Danny's father, who is an Hasidic Rabbi and can be overly criticial), there are compassionate characters, like Reuven's father who helps Reuven and Danny through their difficult friendship. I loved the themes in this book. I loved the way I was drawn into this jewish community and all of its idiosyncracies. There were moments that were boring or drawn out, but in the end I think this book delivers, and would recommend to many readers with the caveat that it can drag and may not be for everyone.Favorite quote from the book:'Reuven, do you know what the rabbis tell us God said to Moses when he was about to die?'I stared at him. 'No,' I heard myself say.'He said to Moses, 'You have toiled and labored, now you are worthy of rest.' . . .'A life filled with meaning is worthy of rest. I want to be worthy of rest when I am no longer here.'Stars: 3.5 out of 5.The Final Word: Kosher."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This past couple weeks, I've really enjoyed listening to The Chosen, by Chaim Potok. It's one of those classic books that I thought I should catch up on, especially after Potok's works kept popping up in various conversations lately. (The most surprising and random was last Sunday, when I asked at family dinner if anyone had read any Potok. Turns out my mother was also in the middle of The Chosen, having picked it up on a sale table at the bookstore, not knowing anything about it.) The story follows an unlikely friendship between two boys in 1940's Brooklyn through high school and college. Though they live just a few blocks apart, Danny, a Hasidic orthodox Jew (black caftan, beard, earlocks), and Reuven, a modern orthodox Jew, had never crossed paths until Danny nearly took out Reuven's eye in a baseball game. I enjoyed learning much about Hasidic Judaism that I didn't know, their history, their distinctive practices (like dynastic leaders), as it unfolded in the two boys getting to know each other, and their distinct experiences of their \\"common\\" faith. The backdrop of the story exposed the events of World War II and the founding of Israel, which while well known events, was made fresh in the way these people experienced it at the moment. The story also contemplated father-son relationships, contrasting the close relationship Reuven had with his father (a teacher and later a Zionist activist), versus Danny's silent relationship with his father (the tzadik of his community, a position to be inherited by Danny). The narrator, Jonathan Davis, did a great job reading this book, properly pronouncing all the Hebrew and Yiddish words, and all with a good Longg Island accent. His voicing was given wing, I think, by Potok's great ear for natural dialog with these characters. An opening epigram in the book really stayed with me, a description of how a trout fights when it is hooked, and how the other trout swimming by see its struggle but don't understand it because they can't see the hook and the line. The book is a real lesson in empathy and compassion, as well as Jewish history."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Potok's look at how different sects of Judaism mistrust and sometimes actively dislike each other is spot-on accurate. I know because my family is representative of the Jewish sects depicted in Potok's book. One of my siblings has grown up to be Orthodox, another is Conservative, I'm reformed, and two other siblings are pretty agnostic. Potok's look at how two kids from differing sects become friends against the wishes of others in their communities is heartfelt, and full of moving scenes, set in such varied places as baseball fields, hospitals, synagogues, and college. The two main characters are very likable, and the scenes where they develop into friends are written magnificently.However, Potok had another mission in mind. He uses the characters' fathers as vehicles to deliver lectures on the history of Judaism, and those portions of the text can be difficult to read through. That's why there's a Cliff's Notes version of this book. Because the main characters sit through the lectures delivered by their fathers, so must the rest of us readers.Overall, this is an excellent book. It is worth reading/skimming through the lectures to get to the heart of the text."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I only read this book in 4 days while I was on a road trip and those 4 days could not have been better spent than reading The Chosen. It was superb (the best way to put it).The book is about a Jewish teenager in the 1940's. He's not a traditional Jew, he's more of a modern world. One day, this kid DOES meet up with a traditional Jew and they eventually become best of friends. Their friendship becomes dampered because the traditional Jewish way of thinking is to never mingle with people who are corrupted, which, of course, is everyone but themselves. It gets even worse because his father is a Rabbi.I truly enjoyed this book for its beautiful content and a great story. I give it full marks!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"this book is what fiction should be like. although it's intelligent, historical, meaningful, thematic, complex, what's at the core tying all these things together is sympathy, such that these characters can sneeze or look at the yard and you're totally enthralled. How much better then when they're unusually interesting people involved in fascinating things. life is made and shown to be deeply fascinating. you ride along in their lives as if they are alternate lives of your own, and afterward feel that you yourself truly have lived through something. This book is what happens when someone has a true genius for his art - there's no need for him to show off, you're simply swept along."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen is very well-written and contains a very moving story. I have always been interested in history; religion, wars, whatever. It facinates me. This book offers a wonderful view of two boys with exceptional differences that create a great friendship. Even though this book does not offer a lot of action, it is so well written that it just captivates you into the story. Kudos to Potok."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book was pretty good. I thought the beginning was the best part of the whole story. I am not Jewish, so I did not understand all the terminology. I think Jewish people would be able to understand and connect better to it. But it did send out good messages and themes. Although at many points I found myself forcing myself to go back to reading it, I was assigned to read it for Honors English. It was boring at some parts, to the point where once or twice I awoke to find that I had fallen asleep while reading it. But other parts are very interesting, like the beginning, for example."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Chaim Potok wrote one of the most memorable books I have ever read. &quot;The Chosen&quot; clearly displays the effect of religion on teenagers. The two main characters, Danny Saunders and Reuven Malter, meet during the most unusual of circumstances. Danny actually injured Reuven while playing in a baseball game. Throughout the years, they developed a long-lasting friendship. The respect and devotion they show towards one another display the coming of age of two young men. This novel is perfect for anyone who enjoys reading about the importance of maturing over time."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book is an overall incredible novel. However, what struck me about it was its symbolism. You can look at one page alone and find up to 50 references about eyes, vision, or something having to do with the two of those. I have read the book many times and continue to be mesmerized."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book is terrific. It's about two boys, both Jewish, who meet in not-so friendly circumstaces. It really appealed to be because, being a very observant jew, I can relate to both of them. Its a good read."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"&quot;The Chosen&quot; is a book that I typically would not read. It has subtle ways of making you think about what happens in a religion that can also be split. I enjoyed the relationship between the two main characters, I felt they grew through time. They both gave eachother what the other needed"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This story explains the relationship that a young Hasid man has with his father. It portrays to us the feelings of rage that he experiences when ever he is around his father. The relationship that he has with Danny gives him release from his father- the silence that is between them. Simply a marvelous piece of literature!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen tells a wonderful story about two Jewish boys that are reaching manhood. Danny is from a strict Jewish family, while Rueven is from a more liberal Jewish background. It is through an accident that these two become friends and form a bond that will last them forever. Danny is able to &quot;choose&quot; what he wants in life with the support of Rueven. This book will open up your mind and your soul into a world most of us are not accustomed to."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I read \\"The Promise\\" first and loved it, so I ordered \\"The Chosen\\". I should have read \\"The Chosen\\" first as they run in sequence telling the story of Jewish immigrants on the Lower East Side of NYC and Brooklyn. It is page-turning, heartbreaking, loving just a good read."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I have my book club to thank for this one. I'd never heard of it, or even the author, before. Of course, starting with the two main characters playing baseball together was sure to make me love the book from the start.What I loved so much about the story was the reflections it gave me on friendship and being a father to my son. I just hope I can have the kind of communication with my son that Reuven's dad has with him. It is also a beautiful reminder to be circumspect in one's judgement of others."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"It was a slow start but definitely picked up as I progressed. I was intrigued with the contrast of the two religious sects of Judaism. The relationship between the characters was interesting due to the contrast of their personalities, family life and religious rites. I would suggest this as a read...."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I have never read a book with more power and symbolism in it. The way Chaim Potok sets it up is just Incredible. I didn't know anything about Jewish culture before reading this book. it has given me a great view on Jewish society."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"this book is one of the most powerful pieces of literature written about the pain of being a man, a father, trying to mold one's son into a man. what more needs be said? oh yeah-the monologue at the end, spoken by the rabbi: wow. it is immense. read it. then read it again. then once more just to catch some other wrinkles that may have escaped you the first 2 readings!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"In Chaim Potok's, The Chosen friendship begins in an odd way. Danny Saunders, an Hasidic Jew, and Rueven Malter, an Orthodox Jew are playing baseball for their schools. Filled with hatred for the Orthodox team, Danny throws a baseball into Rueven's face sending him to the hospital. Shocked at the hatred that lives within himself, Danny visits Rueven in the hospital. They become friends.Raised in entirely different Jewish sects, community within the sect is sacred, contact with those outside of the sect is discouraged. Danny and Rueven's friendship is rare and dear.Potok delves deep into the Hasidic and Orthodox culture and religion making it not just a great story of friendship but an intriguing way to learn of the tradition, customs and culture of these two Jewish sects."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This was the first book by Chaim Potok that I have read. Since then I have been working my way through his other novels. I find them all excellent, and once you finish \\"The Chosen\\", I would recommend the sequel \\"The Promise.\\" The Asher Lev series is also outstanding."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I love getting books in the mail. I got it after forgetting I ordered it. Awesome...nice and used...Sarah Porter, thank you for writing your name inside the front cover.Seriously, great book...inspired to buy it after watching an episode of \\"Lost.\\""},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I expected The Chosen to be a great novel, after all it's been selling steadily since it was released decades ago. What I didn't expect is that it would educate me about my own religion, its history, mystic and intellectual traditions, schisms and divisions, background on the founding of Israel, and more. I also didn't expect it to be so ambitious: it takes some very profound issues in a very clear, straightforward way: in short, it will make you think about questions that really matter. And, yes, I was right, The Chosen is a great read: Chaim Potok is a masterful storyteller and has a great command of tension, suspense, pacing, plot twists, payoff at the end, and so on. And yet the story doesn't seem contrived, in fact, sometimes I felt a bit uncomfortable because it felt so much like I was reading a memoir of one chapter of Mr. Potok's life, and it felt a bit odd to be reading it disguised as fiction. (I don't know if I am right; it is just the sense I got very strongly.) My only other comment is that it is simply written, something high school students could definitely read, or even middle-schoolers. The writing style is simple also, no literary fireworks here, but workmanlike and consistently excellent. I would admit he's not a stylist, he's not, say, Ian McEwan or Isaac Bashevis Singer in his literary prowess, but he managed to write a great book nevertheless. And I've heard this one isn't even his best. I have ordered The Promise and Asher Lev. I certainly want to read more or Mr. Potok."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This is an awesome soul searching novel that helps others look into themselves and gives people some insight into the Jewish experience."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I think that Chaim Potok's novel The Chosen is one of the few novels out today that a young adult can relate to. As a young adult from a different country coming to this society has been not only hard on me but my parents, because I am confronted with different pressures of todays society, while they still believe in their traditional ways of up bringing. I would have never read Mr. Potoks book if it hadn't been for my english teacher telling me to research Chaim Potok For my research paper. I am grateful she did to because this book has expressed my feelings so much that I feel I am one of the characters. I really can relate to Danny Saunders the most because not only do my parents want me to follow my religion carefully, I also want to go into psychology, plus my father and I are not communicating very much!And that is something that has started happening since I was a teenager!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I read this book as part of a required reading course in my English honors class. I had been expecting another one of the usual boring books we're required to read, but after the first chapter, I quickly realized that wasn't going to be the case with The Chosen. The character developments, their relationships with each other and the point of view of the American Jewry during World War II; all add up to make this an extremely interesting book. And if you like this one, I would also highly recommend the sequel, The Promise. Both are highly insightful, moving books that should be enjoyed by anyone who likes to read, no matter your age or religion. Defintely five stars!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"It is a shame that some teachers assign this book without preparing their classes with a basic understanding of Judaism. However, because one does not understand a book at first try does not mean the book has no meaning. Reading The Chosen is an opportunity to gain some insight into another culture, as well as another time and place. The characterizations are very rich and the themes are universal."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I first read this book more than 25 years ago, and it still resonates with me. The characters and the world they inhabit are spellbinding."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"&quot; The Chosen&quot; is a delightful book about two jewish boys. Reuven Malter is a Orthodox Jew and Danny Saunders is a Hasidic Jew. The two boys meet while playing a game of baseball, Danny hits Reuven in the head with the baseball. When Danny comes to visit Reuven at the hospital, they become closed friends. Even though their religion beliefs are so different. The Hasidic Jew is more extreme than the Orthodox Jew. While the two boys attending Hirsch College, Reuven's father make a Zionist speech in Madison Square Garden about how Jews should build their capital in Palestine. Danny's father find out about the speech and forbids Danny from seeing Reuven. Reb Saunders is anti-Zionist. While the relationship suffers, Reuven's father has a heart attack. Danny, the son of a Tzaddik, an Othodox Rabbi, must make a choice that can effect him for the rest of his natural life."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"i also had to read this book for school, and i think its superbly written and a very emotional and touching story.

I put the book off for several weeks and when I decided to read it I read it all at once. It started me reading again after about 2 years. I want to read The Promise now!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Well, this book was a reading assiment that I got in the 7th grade. I normally hate all of the books that the english teachers make us read, so I thought that this one would be no different. Then I started to read it about two nights before it was due. I stayed up all night reading it until I was done. This book is not just about religion or whatever, it's about friendship. A friendship that cannot be broken. The kind of friendship you have forever. It makes you think and believe in your friends more, and it was one of the best books I have ever read in my life!!!!! I even stole a copy of it from my english teacher (shhhhh don't tell) so I could read it over and over again."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I read this book for the first time in college and could not put it down. I finished it in a matter of hours. In my opinion, none of the other Potok books that I have read can hold a candle to this one, and that list includes The Promise, My Name is Asher Lev, The Gift of Asher Lev, and In The Beginning. As a student of Judaism, I found this book to extremely beatiful and moving."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This book is one of the best books around today. I read it for a school assignment in tenth grade, and it is now one of my favourite books. Chaim Potok's writing is magnificent, and the theme of the book is universal. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"i think that this was my favorite book by LJ Smith!! I liked the irony of a vampire that OTHER vampires think as cold and ruthless falling in love with a feared vampire hunter.

I mean, one day she'll be 60 or something and Quinn will be 18. what will he(and other characters do) when their mortal soulmates die? there was never any hint that the other humans are Old Souls. so whats up? Other than that i really loved this book and all the others in the series. i can't wait till Strange Fate comes out!!!"},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"The Chosen by Chiam Potok is a very deep novel with many subtle points being made and messages being sent just below the surface. Practices of Jewish and Gentile alike are challenged and the reasoning behind them is forced into the light.Silence. Listen to the sound of complete and utter silence. It's cold, quiet, entirely devoid of life. Such is the relationship between Danny and his father, especially in the light of the warm relationship between Reuvan and Mr. Malter. The distance between Danny and is father is only closed during their debates over the Talmud. It's no mere coincidence that Reuvan is present at many of these occasions, as he is a means of breaking the silence.These debates display the many ways which Danny's silence is broken. The competitive nature of the sessions provides Danny with a voice to speak his mind. Faith in his religion also helps him connect with his father like never before. This silence is later echoed in Danny and Reuvan's brief separation, but is ultimately conquered.The concept of conformity and submission to authority is also heavily portrayed throughout the book. His family, both nuclear and the very memory of his ancestors, compel Danny into the rabbinate, but his heart leads him to the field of psychology. Conversely, Reuvan feels the urge to become a Rabbi while his father silently wishes him to enter the realm of mathematics. While Danny is very vocal about being highly pressured by the expectations of his parents and family tradition, Reuvan bears his burden of self-truth with quiet dignity and grace; however, it is a result of Reuvan's presence that inspires Danny to confront his family, and in essence Danny is \\"drawing\\" his strength from Reuvan.In certain regard Danny can be seen as the \\"savior\\", or the \\"messiah\\" if you will. His family, his teachers, and his father's entire congregation look to him to take Reb Saunders' place and continue to teach and enlighten. He is seen as the all-knowing, the all wise, and the be-all and end-all of ethical and moral expertise. Reuvan in return is the unsung hero, the source of Danny's power. He is Danny's rock, his mountain in fact, without Reuvan Danny would be a mere seed unable to bloom. It is somewhat ironic that a good Hassidim like Danny would find his strength in an apikorsim like Reuvan."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"This novel was one of those iffy books. Its theme was really interesting and true to life. The characters' development were intriguing in that you could see how they reached what they were to become. However, I didn't like this book. The theme was very good, but it was something that was already known to me. It didn't have that much an impact on me. But people who don't understand life in the way that is shown in the book would find it very interesting. I would recommend this book to anybody. This book is worth a try. I did not like it all that much, but other people will find it very interesting through its theme and the way the author tried to reach his theme."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"Reuven Malther and Danny Saunders are two 15 year old boys who share a friendship while growing up in Brooklyn during World War 2. At first it seems that they are quite different as Danny is a Hasidic Jew while Reuven is merely a Orthodox Jew, but actually they are quite similar. Both boys spend hours each day studying, debating and dissecting the Talmud, an ancient book of Jewish wisdom. They are both fixated on the past to the extent that one wonders if they are aware of what is happening in the city around them. The Talmud is everything to them and its value is unquestioned.Although the relationship between Danny and his father is what we would now call dysfunctional Danny has great respect for the man, distant, cold and unsympathetic tho he may be. Later we learn why Danny's father shows no love for his son. Danny's father sees religion, morality and redemption as an all or nothing sort of a thing. Everything is either black or white, there are no shades of gray. A person either has God's favor or he does not. There is no in between, no middle ground and no matter of degrees. Most importantly there no sympathy for anyone who is anything less than perfect. Love would only weaken the boy, or so Danny's father believes.It has been said that religion is the cruelest form of tyranny because it is tyranny of the mind. After reading this book I would agree. Danny is able to reject his arranged marriage to follow his dream of becoming a psychologist. But just like Michael Jackson, Bobby Fisher and Macaulay Culkin, Danny never experienced a normal childhood so what sort of psychologist could he be? I wouldn't take my problems to him."},{"Title":"The Chosen","review":"I am not under 13, in fact I'm 22.

In a baseball match, his ball hit an opponent and hurt him. They took him to a hospital and after a while, the two boys became good friends.

The first chapter describing a heated baseball game had potential for capturing a young readers attention.

What does it mean to have to suffer so much if our lives are nothing more than the blink of an eye? I learned a long time ago, Reuven, that a blink of an eye itself is nothing. But the eye that blinks, that is something. A span of life is nothing, but the man who lives that span, HE is something. He can fill that tiny span with meaning, so its quality is immeasurable though its quantity may be insignificant. Do you understand what I am saying? A man must fill his life with meaning, meaning is not automatically given to life. It is hard work to fill one's life with meaning. That I do not think you understand yet.

When I received it there was no damage done to it."},{"Title":"Alluvial Geoarchaeology: Floodplain Archaeology and Environmental Change (Cambridge Manuals in Archaeology)","review":"This is a difficult one. I did find the book interesting, and I did learn from it. I still gave it a \\"3,\\" however, because I'm not sure it lives up to the likely expectations of its apparent intended audience.A. G. Brown's book, Alluvial Geoarchaeology: Floodplain Archaeology and Environmental Change, is certainly an interesting book. I have studied geology, paleontology and zooarchaeology, so the book was a natural for me. Also because it is written by a British author, although there are North American examples of the effects of fluvial processes on landscape and cultural and physical remains, most of them are taken from European sites in the British Isles and Europe. Since, in my experience, so few of these latter occur in US texts, I found them interesting and enlightening.That said I have to say that Professor Brown does not go into enough detail regarding the sedimentary processes that produce the structural environment that an archaeologist is likely to encounter. In short, he fails to get down to the nitty-gritty of what such an individual is likely to actually see when he looks at sedimentary structures on site. One might legitimately counter, however, that much of this information only comes through a hands-on field experience guided by an experienced sedimentary geologist, but I still think that more might have been done by way of photos.Unfortunately, many of the photos in the text come across very poorly. Most are in black and white, which is probably the best way for details to be visualized, but the quality of the black and white photography (or of their reproduction) is very grainy which defeats the purpose of black and white photos to begin with. I found this very frustrating in my attempt to see what the author was trying to describe in the body of the text or in the passages accompanying the photos. Furthermore, most of the photos were distance shots that showed almost too much, rather than honing in on specific details like grain size, unconformities, evidence of post depositional rounding, etc. that are the meat of the subject.If the book is intended as a text for archaeologists, I can't help but feel it fails to provide them with really useful field information beyond that that an archaeological handbook might have offered and perhaps better. Especially recently, most such books place an great emphasis on the taphonomy of bone and cultural material and the pitfalls that interpretation of physical remains can provide if post depositional history is not taken into consideration.Part of the problem with this book, and probably with the field in general, is that archaeology and geology are still such distinct specialties, that though efforts at consiliance have been made, the two disciplines still have not learned how to talk to one another effectively. Neither addresses the specifics of what the other needs to know to say something coherent about a site and its meaning. This is unfortunate, since archaeology, unless it's done as a surface survey or a ground probing project, is very destructive of sites and data. With limited funds and with many sites requiring interpretation before they are buried beneath yet another housing project, shopping mall or freeway, every scrap of information needs to be collected and correctly interpreted or be lost forever.Interesting to a casual reader with an interest in sedimentary processes and archeology, but not necessarily useful for training of future or current professionals in the field."},{"Title":"New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation with Blondie, Iggy Pop and Others 1974-1981","review":"Actually I'd probably give it 2 and a half stars. I did finish it. But inbetween I read a true crime murder story. I found the style of writing a bit elementary and hard follow. Especially the first 2 years with Blondie. Lots of blank spaces in this book, so maybe it really does live up to the title."},{"Title":"New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation with Blondie, Iggy Pop and Others 1974-1981","review":"The problem with all the Blondie books up til now has been that each one was written with too distinct a bias. Lester Bangs's 1980 \\"Blondie\\" was a venemous attack that barely concealed Lester's own jealous envy (he was in a band of his own), the Fred Schruers mini bio \\"Headliners: Blondie\\" while more objective, was too short to provide a comprehensive biography of the band,1982's \\"Making Tracks\\" is a great book but was written by Debbie Harry & Chris Stein themselves, and therefore only tells half a story. Cathay Che's Debbie Harry bio \\"Platinum Blonde\\" along with the more recent \\"Blondie From Punk to Present\\" are more like fan love-letters than biographies.That leaves us with Mr. Valentine, who played bass for only two years, 1975-1977. These were, however, the pivotal years of the band's inception and early development, and therefore are the most interesting and crucial to read about. His accounts of living and playing with Debbie and Chris are niether spiteful nor ingratiating, and provide what might be the first objective insights on what being in Blondie was really like. Nobody comes off worse for wear, even though many eccentricities, insensitivites and downright hypocrasies are revealed. Rather, it makes them more interesting and human than ever.In any summary of a life or career, it's fair to say that nobody owns the truth. There are many subjective truths. But Gary's literary voice rings true, you get the feeling he's being honest in his accounts. He's neither trying to turn you against the Blondies (like Lester) nor kissing their collective ass (like Ms Che). He's just telling it like it was from his persepctive, and the result is a fascinating account of the whole scene.The pix are quite good, mostly rare, and capture a Blondie that most folks probably don't even remember. A must have for any fan of Blondie and/or the NYC punk era."},{"Title":"New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation with Blondie, Iggy Pop and Others 1974-1981","review":"I've been a fan of the band Blondie for quite some time and I read everything I can get my hands on about this band. Gary Valentine's book is by far the best look at Blondie's early years. It's a witty, funny, insightful view of the New York rock scene of the 1970's. Since Gary was a member of Blondie during their early days he has all the stories you could hope for about life with the band when they were just beginning and he lends insight into the creativity that went into the writing of his two most notable Blondie contributions - X Offender and Presence, Dear. Just about everyone you'd be interested in from this time period makes some sort of appearance in this book - Johnny Thunders, David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Patti Smith, Richard Hell, Captain Sensible, Tom Verlaine, etc. I will read this one over and over again. Gary takes a good long look at what differentiated the New York, London and LA punk scenes and it's one fun and fascinating read. If you are a fan of Blondie or the 70's glam or punk scene or the early 80's new wave scene then you must get this one!"},{"Title":"New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation with Blondie, Iggy Pop and Others 1974-1981","review":"Complete FUN from start to finish. Valentine kicks off his rock and roll autobiography by dropping the reader off in his late teens when he discovered a bohemian lifestyle in the glitter days of The New York Dolls, and the fact that he was young and innocent at the time makes his adventures quite amusing. Although he was more of a bookworm than a musician, he soon found himself playing bass in a struggling bar band called Blondie. There are tons of great stories regarding the famous punk hangouts CBGB's, Max's Kansas City, and later Hurrah, as well as a plethora of anecdotes regarding peers, friends, and enemies, who have since become punk rock royalty; Patti Smith, Tom Verlaine, Richard Hell, The Ramones, Suicide, Talking Heads, The Germs, Wayne County, etc., Valentine's insight is told as a very keen observer to the freakish lifestyle of the entire scene and he constantly adds touches of winking humor that makes the book more and more enjoyable with the turn of every page.His tenure with Blondie is the center of the book, as this is where he found fame but not fortune. As a roommate to the first couple of New Wave, Debbie Harry and Chris Stein, he enjoyed a strange friendship with them while at the same time being accused of trying to upstage them. Although it may somtimes appear that he is tossing sour grapes at them, he is really just giving his point of view of certain situations. Many of the Blondie stories have been told before, but a different point of view is always refreshing. Valentine never rakes the band over the coals, despite being jilted from their reunion during the late 90's.The book does not just cover the New York punk scene, but extends to the West Coast as well when Valentine leaves Blondie and forms The Know. For anyone who thought he dropped off the musical radar after Blondie, his adventures continued, proving that he was no Pete Best (the lost Beatle). He wraps up the book with a sex and substance drenched tour with Iggy Pop and his involvement in the early stages of the Blondie reunion in 1996. From start to finish, NEW YORK ROCKER is an incredibly well written account of the punk movement and a very welcome addition to the growing library of books on the topic."},{"Title":"New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation with Blondie, Iggy Pop and Others 1974-1981","review":"This is a good book. I don't know if its objective or not, because it was written by Gary Valentine, who was a founding member of Blondie, but he didn't last long with the band. Also, when the band re-united in the 90's, he wasn't asked to re-unite. So consider that when you read it. He did contribute the song \\"X Offender\\" and maybe 1 or 2 others to the band.Gary Valentine was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame along with the other founding members of Blondie, back in 2006. He is a \\"pretty-good\\" author, this book covers mainly Blondie, but also briefly covers some others such as Iggy Pop and some of the CBGB New York bands.Overall, its an interesting book to read, and Gary does have some personal insights into early Blondie, and their founding members."},{"Title":"New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation with Blondie, Iggy Pop and Others 1974-1981","review":"If you are one of the millions of Blondie fans who ever wondered what happened to Gary Valentine (the composer of Blondie classics \\"Sex Offender\\" and \\"I'm Always Touched By Your Presence Dear\\") after mysteriously disappearing from the lineup in between the eponymous debut LP and Plastic Letters--and if you wondered why Valentine looked so uncomfortable being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame next to Debbie Harry and Chris Stein -- then this is the book for you. Valentine spent ensuing years as a writer and it shows in this gripping, insightful and informative book. Though there are some awkward misspellings--like Ric Ocasek of the Cars' name-- this is an absorbing, entertaining and anecdotal account of the birth of punk, the malaise of latter-day new wave, and the rivalry within a classic band--by someone who lived it every step of the way."},{"Title":"New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation with Blondie, Iggy Pop and Others 1974-1981","review":"It would be almost impossible to have lived through the time period and cultural place that Valentine did and not have a few interesting stories to tell. Unfortunately he reveals himself as a not very likable character. He credits himself with Blondie's success - although he only played on their first album. Nasty jabs at the other members of Blondie, as well as complete disregard for a former girlfriend and sick child, make for very unpleasant reading at times - vitriol and envy seem to be the driving force behind his writing. Still, it's a least a better book thanTurn Off Your Mind: The Mystic Sixties and the Dark Side of the Age of Aquarius, which is a completly embarassing, amateur mess. Not sure how it's possible to make such fascinating subjects boring and repetitive, but Valentine manages to do it. 'New York Rocker' is certainly interesting, but it leaves a bitter taste."},{"Title":"New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation with Blondie, Iggy Pop and Others 1974-1981","review":"I thought this book was an excellent account of the birth of an era. I found it wonderfully subjective and the account felt honest and real. His voice was straightforward and the stories were humorous as seen through a young man's eyes; it all seemed so new and fascinating to him and hinted at some hero worship from Gary to Chris and others. I consider him to be a fine writer with a personal touch to his credit. During that era, I played music in a different scene and declined most offers to visit there but always wondered what I had missed. Witnessing it through Gary's eyes put me there and it felt delighful to associate my personal memories along with it."},{"Title":"New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation with Blondie, Iggy Pop and Others 1974-1981","review":"Blondie is one of my all time favorite bands so I'll enjoy virtually anything written about the band. True to form I blazed through New York Rocker in a day. While the book contained no major surprises, with the exception of how the song X-Offender was inspired (Making Tracks tells the story but changes the names to protect the innocent), just learning the small details about their lives during this period and reliving some of the band's early experiences was very gratifying. For a first time author the book is also very readable.With that said to me Valentine seemed oddly detached from the scene he writes about and ostensibly experienced first hand. Even as a member of Blondie he seemed on the periphery of the New York punk scene. There are precious few direct insights or interactions with virtually any of the principle players in the New York music scene. Whereas Debbie Harry or Chris Stein were mainstays in the scene, Valentine was seemingly a comparatively minor player who was really just passing through. A memoir from Chris Stein or especially Debbie Harry would be a much richer story. Similarly, while Valentine offers some opinions about other performers, often this information comes from other sources, such as Heylin's history of American punk rock. And even things that would be very interesting in detail, such as his first performance with the band at CBGB's, get passed over too quickly.As to his tenure with the band and why he got kicked out/quit, Valentine presents the usual creative and personality differences. The main source of personality conflict according to Valentine was not Debbie Harry (who Valentine is honest enough without saying so outright to recognize as the star of the band) but Chris Stein. Valentine questions Stein's musicianship and presents him as tempermental. In this there is nothing exceptional in comparision to myriad other band break-up stories, but it is still worth remembering that this is the point of view of one individual in a two-sided tale. By his own admission, as later events Valentine candidly discusses show, Valentine had his own share of eccentricities and was a willful individual in his own right. Valentine also mentions creative differences, but Blondie's rise to superstardom after his departure compared to his own limited success with his own band, The Know, puts these differences in perspective. Finally Valentine offers an entertaining account of touring with Iggy Pop as a member of his band after his time with Blondie.In sum, while I would not recommend this as a history of the New York punk rock scene, the book makes no claim to be anything other than a musical biography. As a personal chronicle of the early history of Blondie, it is a book that any fan of the band will enjoy. I may not have learned much that was new, but even reading a different perspective on events I already knew about was worth while."},{"Title":"New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation with Blondie, Iggy Pop and Others 1974-1981","review":"I got this book the other day here on Amazon and I couldn't put it down. Especially during his years with Blondie which were from my point of view the most interesting stories in this book. He has a lot of crazy, funny, scary, and sad stories to tell in this book and they are very entertaining and gripping to read. I couldn't put it down. I had to know more. I love his insight into the whole scene from that period. He links the glitter period to the punk period and back again very well.Read this book."},{"Title":"New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation with Blondie, Iggy Pop and Others 1974-1981","review":"Extremely readable memoir of Mr Valentine when he arrives to NYC as a young teenager. What's makes the book a worthy read is that he has a knack for offering interesting details about what it was like being part of the music scene in NYC in the late 70's. Even when he wasnt in a band he was a active \\"fan\\" and part of the scene. The book is well-edited and it moves along at a nice pace. As some of the other reviewers point out, the writer isnt particularly nasty in his opinions but he also doest shrink from saying what he feels about other folks he knew at that time. There was prodigious drug use going on around him and it was eye-opening for me that so many rockers where sticking needles in their arms in those days. If you like NYC Punk, this is quite an intersting and informative read."},{"Title":"The Monstrous and the Marvelous","review":"Rikki Ducornet's \\"The Monstrous and the Marvelous\\" is a collection of fourteen previously published essays that challenge comfortable intellectual and imaginative categories, forcing the reader to think in new ways, to embrace the savage, eccentric and strange beauty of the world in all its \\"Otherness\\". It is, in short, a book not for the intellectually faint of heart, Ducornet's richly allusive prose streaming through interpretive tropes that constantly demand the reader's utmost attention and imaginative empathy. And while this wide-ranging collection appropriately has been compared to a kind of intellectual \\"wunderkammern\\" or \\"cabinet of wonders\\", Ducornet imaginatively demonstrates in these essays that the world cannot be contained within the artificial bounds of the \\"wunderkammern\\", for ultimately its contents are \\"topsy turvy and promiscuous.\\"In the essay \\"Optical Terror\\", Ducornet sets the stage for the essays to follow, discussing the great Renaissance voyages of discovery, voyages \\"which revealed a sprawling world, infinitely stranger than previously imagined.\\" The curiosities that came from these voyages, the stuff of the \\"wunderkammern\\", challenged accepted notions of the world, generating the intellectual unease which ultimately led to the Enlightenment.

This short and readable book does a wonderful job of explaining the transformation of a production plant to the Toyota apporach to lean manufacturing. Reading this you will learn about a number of the lean \\"tools\\" but the book is not about lean tools, it is about why those tools are needed and why they work. It is also good to see a lean manufacturing book that recognizes the issues and problems of traditional cost accounting. I recommend this excellent book to anyone on the lean journey."},{"Title":"Andy & Me: Crisis and Transformation on the Lean Journey","review":"YES read \\"Andy & Me\\" for a quick overview and high-level understanding of the LEAN process. The book will not tell you how to create the LEAN process but will give you a basic understanding to build on and insight into the questions you may need to ask for your particular situation."},{"Title":"Andy & Me: Crisis and Transformation on the Lean Journey","review":"I had hoped this book would provide more detail on TPS, but it is very light on any detail and glosses over many points. After you have read The Goal and are use to its style of teaching manufacturing principles in the context of a novel, this book leaves you feeling really disappointed."},{"Title":"Andy & Me: Crisis and Transformation on the Lean Journey","review":"Highly recommended. I just received this and tore through it. The book is a quick and light read, although you'll want to stop and let some of the TPS concepts sink in and re-read certain sections and illustrations. The story in this business novel is about on par with \\"The Goal\\", but it's easy enough to skip over the storyline (divorced Plant Manager fighting to see his kids, etc.) to read the real meat of the story -- insights and real day to day examples of PDCA and leadership models of lean/TPS. This book focuses on Hoshin planning and day-to-day leadership of a plant going through the lean transformation. The only reasons I give this 4 stars instead of 5 are A) the storyline in business novels like this always seem a bit forced and B) the book tends to shortchange the change management challenges -- people in the book tend to jump on board with the TPS immediately, testament I guess to the leadership of the Plant Manager and the Toyota Sensei, but not typical of all lean implementations. Details such as \\"I had to get rid of some people\\" are somewhat glossed over and could have been fleshed out in more detail (this is a short book). Still, this is a good complement to The Toyota Way and other detailed books on lean tools and practices."},{"Title":"Andy & Me: Crisis and Transformation on the Lean Journey","review":"It a lean framework with a bit of novel draped over it. It's a quick easy read, and maybe being fictional makes is an easier read. There were some new presentations of lean concepts that I hadn't seen before, so that was somewhat helpful.

Lots of good example of lean methods, just not the same old kanban Mistake proofing, SMED materials. One lean method that really stood out was the example of Policy Deployment and how it was tied to daily management (A3 Sheets). I also like how it showed the leaders involvement from the standpoint of taking responsibility for providing training and stability. Too bad it was a spin of the Goal."},{"Title":"Andy & Me: Crisis and Transformation on the Lean Journey","review":"This is a good book once you get over the similarities to 'The Goal'. Very much of it starts and tracks too much of the same scenario, but this time using the 'Lean' approach. With that aside, it does a good job tracking the emotions, excitement, frustrations, challenges and success of a lean journey in a manufacturing and assembly business. Not many lean tools are really described aside of the root cause and corrective action approach, but it provides a pretty realistic look at what happens inside a larger plant once the journey begins and people engage themselves. Andy and Me is a quick read and good for the novice or someone needing to \`whet their whistle' on the lean approach."},{"Title":"Andy & Me: Crisis and Transformation on the Lean Journey","review":"Great book for the novice looking to understand the very beginnings of how lean principals can transform any business.

The LEAN portion of the book was vague with little explanation, the characters were shallow and unrealistic, and the details in the book were pretty pointless for the most part.

It is the best written lean business novel I have seen (though I also like \\"Who's Counting\\" by Jerry Solomon - available on Amazon.com). The book launches straight into the lean journey and presents the issues and challenges well. It is a good introductory read to help you get to grips with the ideas. My problem with it is that it doesn't go into any detail. There is no explanation of how the culture is changed to support involvement on problem solving; or how to do 5S, or kaizen; or how to map the value stream. But it provides a great overview and it is upbeat in tone - great for getting your energy up on the start of the lean journey, or to refresh your spirits when problems arise. Easy to read on the train or plane too.

I'm curious to see how many antizionists will, realizing how bad she makes them look, claim that she is a Zionist plant.Given the title, I wondered if the book might be innocent and humorous. But it turned out otherwise. The author says she is concerned about human rights. It seems to me that if she gets her way, she'll get rid of those rights. Here's some of what she says about Israel:\\"The State of Israel has a racist ideology in Zionism, happily played the role of modern colonial oppressor, and bullied the Middle East. Israel represents all that is evil in the world today. All freedom-loving individuals with a sense of human rights and social justice are ethically obliged to hate the oppression and injustice that Israel perpetuates and executes.\\"This puts Gandhi-Ganesh at odds with me. I'm a Pagan and a Polytheist. And I am a strong supporter of truth, justice, and human rights. That's why I am a Zionist. Zionism is simply Jewish nationalism. As such, it demands human rights for all, including Jews.The author tells us that Zionism is racist and oppressive. But that's a lie. She then argues that non-Jews do not belong in Israel, which makes it racist. But that's not true either. She also falsely accuses Israel of threatening World War Three, and she falsely accuses Zionism of being responsible for the mass murder of Jews in World War Two. Overlooked in all this is the right of people, even if they are Jews, to live on this planet and to move to new homes. I would make this right even stronger when the homes are in the homeland of that people, where the main language is of that people.Gandhi-Ganesh then says that Israel oppresses Catholics and Muslims. Wow. Considering the difference in sizes of these groups and the historical record, that's like saying that a weak lynch mob victim is the one who is oppressing the lynch mob. She praises the anti-Israeli stance of the Vatican. She praises \\"resistance\\" to Israel by the Arabs. I wonder what she thinks of the German National Socialists, and their willingness to, um, stand up to the Jews just a little more than six decades ago.She's a Hindu, and I would have hoped that she would be against bigotry by the Catholic Church. But that bigotry is directed against Jews and against Israel, so she likes it.Her history of the conflict is way off. She implies that there was a Levantine Arab state which was destroyed by modern Israel. But there wasn't. She says that Jews could have returned to Jerusalem after 70 AD, but chose not to. In fact, Jews always found ways to return to Jerusalem. After all, it was the Jewish capital, and they found ways to keep a presence there, no matter how strongly they were persecuted. And in the 1870s, Jews became a majority in Jerusalem, even though there were very few Jews in the rest of the Levant. By the time of the UN partition of the British Mandate, Jews were a bigger majority in Jerusalem (which the UN wanted to set aside for ten years as a neutral city), and Jews were a majority in the Jewish portion of the partitioned Mandate territory.The author says that Arabs are magnanimous, have always treated the Jewish minority in the Levant kindly, and are willing to share land, while the Jews are stingy. That's false. She implies that the Israeli Jews are some sort of fanatical demons, whose only desire is to launch a suicidal attack on innocent Levantine Arabs. But in fact, allowing Jews to have rights would not infringe on the rights of Arabs. And the truth is that the Jews simply want to exist and want to have the rights of life, liberty and property. They came to the Levant and worked hard to make the land more valuable, draining swamps and making the deserts bloom. Peace and cooperation would be a big victory for the Jews and they know it. That's what Gandhi-Ganesh is fighting against. And she loves to single out the Israelis for condemnation, while dismissing all charges against those who are real problems.Some people mention that there has been a long history of attacks on Jews by European Christians. So does the author. But she has the nerve to boast about it! Rather than conclude that all this bigotry is counterproductive, she concludes that Jews ought to give up now! Well, if a big and wicked gang were after me (or, say, against all Pagans), intent on depriving me of my property, liberty, and life, I would not give up. Even if the odds were against me, I'd try to find some decent people who could become allies. And one day, we might fight back and even win equal rights for ourselves.Gandhi-Ganesh has a closing chapter about bullying. That is topical. I can not stand bullies. And I will not apologize for my opposition to lies, injustice, and tyranny. I'm more than a little annoyed to see the arrogant way in which the Arab world, often with the support of the European Union and much of the rest of the international community singles out Israel, bans Jews from living in much of the Middle East, boycotts Israeli goods, lies about Israel in the media, bans Israeli athletes from the Mediterranean Games, applauds anti-Israeli terror, teaches anti-Israeli lies in schoolbooks and college texts, and threatens Israel for daring to exist and for permitting Jews to have human rights there.The author is a bully who is taunting those who support social justice and human rights."},{"Title":"Why I Hate Israel: a Candid Account (Hardcover)","review":"I really liked this book because of its fundamental support of global peace. Ms. Gandhi-Ganesh has a frank writing style that is no-nonsense. She pinpoints problem areas and offers practical suggestions for solution. Given that the British Prime Minister Tony Blair is calling for an international conference regarding the founding of the Palestinian State in a few months, this book is very timely. Hopefully, Mr. Blair will read this book and implement the suggestions found in this book. This book is critical for all who desire peace in the Middle East.

I really can't understand how could anyone say they support a country to exist in a land that has always been known by another name and to belong to a completely different race of people (check ANY map before israel's creation, this region was called palastine and was predominantly arab).The world condemned apartheid, but failed to condemn zionism, which is NOT about human rights as one reviewer stated, and ask any orthodox rabbi by the way. He will clearly tell you that zionism is a secular movement created to allow jews to dominate over other people. Zionism is a purely racist movement which gives a jew supremacy over 'gentiles' i.e anyone non-jew.The world is certainly a better place with this book, as the story of the massacred arab families in Palestine, Syria and Lebanon MUST be told, and the 4 million palastenian refugees must be heard.

I grew up in church believing that Israel was the chosen land for God chosen people. I started to open my and see the true nature if Israel several years ago before this book when I had to write a research paper in College. This book really put things into better perspective for me. I was already at odds with my parents, church, and pastor over Israel. It still upsets me when I see Jews manipulation bible scripture and using the Christian faith to raise funds on Sunday morning TV. They don't believe in Jesus Christ, but yet they talk on TV like evangelical Christians and use our faith for their own fulfillment. It is time that we Americans and Christians open our eyes and see we have been manipulated for years. APIAC has too much control over our government.

As we near the celebration of Memorial Day, we need to think about this: is it righteous to stand with Israel? Because if it is not righteous, then the soldiers who will die in future wars will die for vain. We have to remember that World War 2 was fought to defend America because Germany was about to overtake England and was on its way to America. Furthermore, Germany made an alliance with Japan and Japan attacked America, so USA was looking at potentially a two front war -- from the Atlantic and from the Pacific. War against Germany in WW2 was to defend America. So, the death of soliders were worth-it in terms of safety of the USA.This book shows that Israel has been horrible in treating Palestinians -- both Christians and Muslim. It is an unethical state. They will go to extreme lengths to ensure that a qualified Palestinian will not get the job he wants because he is Palestinian. Such similarities are found in the USA context where many Jews block Christians from entering the Ivy League because -- merely because they are Christians. The Calvalry Chapel High School in California is suffering the same thing -- the University of California is refusing to admit the students because they go to a Christian school.When Jews are practicing such injustice, should America defend Israel?

Claiming that \\"Gandhi-Ganesh argues from Hinduism, Christianity, International Human Rights, and ethics why her hatred is justified and even encouraged,\\" is despicable.

Jews have led America in pushing immorality and laws that hurt Christianity. Don't you know a Jewish lawyer in your town? I rest my case. Protecting Christian America means converting Jews to Christianity. There are other alternatives, but I would support converting Jews. America is under threat -- it's the Jewish fault. Terrorist use America's \\"support\\" of Israel as an excuse for their attack. After reading this book, I realized the damage that Jews have done to the security of America with their Jewish lobby groups pushing for support Israel. I did not know much about the Jewish State before reading this book.

Do not support Israel because it is an immoral nation! As a Bible-believing Christian, I agree. Read the book of Jeremiah in the Old Testament. It clearly commands God's destruction of Israel. God will use an unbelieving nation like Babylon (present day Iran) to destroy Israel and kill those who live in it. This is the Word of God. American leaders cannot go against the proclamation of the Word of God. That includes the Christian clergy in our country who preach on Sundays. Just like there were false prophets recorded in Jeremiah who proclaimed that God will protect Israel, there are false preachers today. Christians in the pews must hold clergy to account when they try to support Israel because it goes against the teaching in Jeremiah and Amos which clearly states that God will destroy Israel. This is divine prophecy. After reading this book, I began to understand that today's Israel is like the Israel in Jeremiah's time.

That is what it is. And to claim that your best friends are Jewish and that they also hate Israel, or that you hate Israel and not Jews as such does not change the fact that if you hate Israel and Israelis you are a RACIST. Anybody who is prejudiced against Israel and Israelis is as much a bigot as someone who is prejudiced against Jews per se, or for that matter against Blacks, Gays, Indians, Chinese, Moslems etc. And do not say that you hate the State of Israel and not it's people, because the state is the sum total of it's people.As Judea Pearl says: \\"As a form of racism, anti-Zionism is worse than anti-Semitism. It targets the most vulnerable part of the Jewish people, namely, the people of Israel, who rely on the sovereignty of their state for physical safety, national identity and personal dignity. To put it more bluntly, anti-Zionism condemns 5 million human beings, mostly refugees or children of refugees, to eternal statelessness, traumatized by historical images of persecution and genocide\\".Anti-Zionists claim that they are not anti-Semites but that the only state they want to dismember is the Jewish state. Anti-Zionists claim they are not anti-Semites but the only people who are not entitled to human rights are the Jews of the Levant. Anti-Zionists claim that they are not anti-Semites but that the only children who it is justified to bomb, shoot, murder and maim are Jewish children. So much for the 'We are anti-Zionist but NOT anti-Semitic' crowd of hypocrites who noly enjoy the killing of 'Zionist' children. Not only do the rabid anti-Zionists who boycott and demonize Israel display gross and racist anti-Semitism , but they also responsible to a large extent for terror against Israeli women and children.It is entirely in keeping in the character of Islamists or rabidly leftist anti-Zionists that they should carry a rabid hatred of Israel to the point of defending the killers of Israeli children. Author Jacques Givet , in his remarkable bookThe Anti-Zionist Complexrefers to the massacres of Israeli children at Ma'alot and Kiryat Shmona in 1974 by the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The author points out how prejudiced and unfair condemmnation of Israel in the United Nations has led to deeds: 'For moral denigration encourages physical elimination; a few days after the adoption of the resolution of November 1975, challenging the very existence of Israel, a bomb killed six young people (all of them refugees from Arab countries) in Jerusalem. The PLO forthwith claimed the credit for this feat, justifying it by reference to the United Nations resolution...\\"In more recent years, Irish poet Tom Paulin explicitly called for the killing of Jewish civillians in Israel. A few days later , a five year old Jewish girl, Danielle Shefi, was shot dead in the Jewish village of Adura, by Arab terrorists , as she cowered under her bed. They also shot her baby brother. Journalists on the far left website indymedia openly gloated over and celebrated this murder. In 2002 leftist anti-Zionist journalist, Richard Calland , wrote in South Africa's far left Mail&Guardian; that he \\"quietly celebrates Israeli casualties\\". Charlotte Kates , a law lecturer at Rutger University in New Jersey and an 'activist' of the pro-terror'International Solidarity Movement' has endorsed the killing of Israeli children by Arab terrorists, calling Israeli children 'fair game'.The same way, that the dehumanization of Jews by Hitler Goebbels and Der Sterner laid the way for the holocaust, I believe that the purpose of anti-Zionist propaganda is to pave the way for the genocide of Israel's Jews. This book is racist hate speech just like Meim Kampf, Protocols of the Elders of Zion or Birth of a Nation, and should be known for what it is.

I advise you: if you are a true Star Wars fan, you will not read this book full of false information"},{"Title":"The Lost City of the Jedi (Star Wars Jedi Prince, Book 2)","review":"If you go into this book, or any part of the series expecting more than a lighthearted (simple and silly) storyline aimed for kids somewhere around 6-8 years old, you will be disappointed. My review is sort of a mashup of the first 3 books since together they are almost the same length as a regular novel, and that was as far as I could read without feeling the urge to remove them my digital library. They are also all done by the same two authors, Paul Davids and Hollace Davids so the 'feel' is much the same throughout. I am going to do my best not to hate on this series, but I will give quite a few examples why this was the worst set of books I have read in years. I think the authors knowledge of the Star Wars universe consists of having watched the original trilogy once when it was first in theaters over 30 years ago, and then by brushing up by quickly flipping through an abridged Star Wars dictionary for a few characters names and places.Many of the main characters like Luke and Han just feel like different people with the same name. They do and say things that are out of character. In the second book, after finding the lost city of the Jedi, Han exclaims &#34;My Correlian buddies are not going to believe this&#34;. This makes no sense. Han never had many friends and seing as how the author knows Han is from Corellia, makes assumptions. In the movies and in many of the books, Han had few friends, and the ones he did were made after he joined the Alliance, or were known by first name, like Luke, or Lando. He never had so many friends that they were known as his buddies. Second, Han is also not the type of character to just brag about everything he does. If he is that type of person, it would be about a specific accomplishment, like say, helping the alliance twice blow up the Death Star. Even if he had all these miscellanious buddies the author talks about, why wouldn't they beleive him? He stumbled upon some lost city that also happens to be on a moon that has some Jedi or force using history. I would think they would have more trouble beleiving that he shot Darth Vaders tie fighter down.The author does something that every write who delves into Sci-fi and fantasy knows not to. He makes references to real life things on more than one occasion. In the second book, there is kid talking about finding cats and dogs that are noted in the Jedi archives. Later on the author talks about a Bantha as being the size of an elephant. Maybe that is how kids books are written, but I found it to be piss-poor writing. He also mentions 'computer notebook'. There are many ways to say 'portable computer' and still sound sci-fi ish. He may as well say that an X-Wing is half the size of a NASA shuttle or that the stormtroopers rifle shoots through armor as well as an AK-47. You simply do not mix reality with fantasy as it ruins the illusion. Many Star Wars books have done it better, such as the word &#34;Coffeine&#34;, which is a mashup between coffee and caffeiene. You know what what it is and even if you eyeroll a little on the combination, it is still not a direct link to something so real. It is also done very well in other books like on the word flimsiplast, or flimsi. This is meant to be paper, or some type of thin material to write on, but still keeps you immersed in the Star Wars universe without a mundane explanation or some realistic comparison.Next up we have simple unoriginality. In the first book there is reference to two different aliens with 3 eyes. The names are Triclops and Trioculous. Yeah. I guess it is a good thing there wasn't a 3rd three eye alien or it would be named Triumph or Triceratops or something else equally unoriginal. There is also quite alot of acronyms used. Yes, this is a regular thing in the Star Wars universe, but it feels overboard. From TNT's to SPIN. The acronyms are not only bad, but spelled out telling you &#34;SPIN is short for Senate's Planetary Intelligence Network&#34;. A decent author is able to work in an acronym's long name without spelling it out directly. There are also HSD's (Housekeeping specialist droids) and JDT's (Jawa Droid Traders). I mean really, why not just say Jawas? Though this is a kids book so I suppose I will be lenient on this one. There is also a Homework Correction droid... ugh. There was alaso a reference to a secret code in one of the books JE-99-DI-88-FOR-00-CE. Again, I suppose I have to cut it some slack for being a kids book, but I did a major eyeroll on this one.Next up we have continuity problems - Darth vader has an indestructible glove? Ummm, ok, sure why not. Banthas on Yavin? I suppose that is possible, though unlikely. There is a reference to a few neighboring towns near the Alliance temple on Yavin. I suppose a small village might be set up but for the most part, Yavin was a jungle world with no indigenous sentient life forms and was a pretty secret place to begin with. The fact that there would be a few well populated towns nearby seems a bit overstated. In the 3rd book it talks about Jabba's palace and how when Jabba died the palace was turned into a retirement home for aged aliens by the government of Tatooine. Really, the palace was taken back by the B'omarr monks, and I would highly doubt anyone wanting to live their last years in peace would want to do that in a place like that, that also happens to be quite a long distance away from any well populated area. And then the idea that there is an actual government for all of Tatooine? Possible but again, doubtful.Overall the writing is simple and silly and truly meant for very young children. Much of the continuity does not align well with other books and too many times as I was reading this I laughed out loud at either the absurdity of plot or character actions, to cringing at how bad the writing was. The Star Wars fan in me wants to keep reading the last 3 books but quality issues aside, this is too far out of the normal Star Wars universe to be considered extended extended universe or even alternate universe."},{"Title":"The Lost City of the Jedi (Star Wars Jedi Prince, Book 2)","review":"I can't believe people would pick on this book.There could be a hundred reasons why Luke skywalker was flying in a y wing fighter and it never says that there can't be more than one grand moff.And most kids wont care."},{"Title":"The Lost City of the Jedi (Star Wars Jedi Prince, Book 2)","review":"This book had lots of action and excitement.

Riffs is not a book of sheet music for other people's riffs, tho'it has lots of famous rock riffs described (and if you don't know how Smoke on the Water or Purple Haze sound, where have you been?). Rooksby has found a way to group riffs by type so you can understand what makes them work. I read this book and had a better idea of not only famous riffs but how my band's riffs work. I've looked at a lot of guitar books and this one is IMO unique in what it does. If you don't read music that's cool anyway cos the 30 made-up riffs are tabbed out and on the CD. This is a great book for anyone who wants to understand riffs, not just copy them."},{"Title":"Riffs - How to Create and Play Great Guitar Riffs Book/CD","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. There is some useful info/discussion in it, if your an absolute beginner to music theory but it is way too lean for someone who is anywhere beyond a couple of introductory lessons and way too confusing/meandering for someone who is a beginner. Your time would be better spent reading something else...Like the other reviewer, I was extremely annoyed by the fact that while Rooksby has a seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of Guitar Riff History (he cites an insanely large and diverse number of artists and songs when discussing various points) and cites a huge number of examples, NONE of those examples are presented in musical format. They are discussed verbally at a high level with little technical detail and, as such, it is rarely clear which portion of the song Rooksby is referring to or why it is related to the chapter's core concept since he quotes no actual music. The closest he gets when discussing examples is he will sometimes mention a chord change in the riff he's trying to cite. I mean this is a joke. The artists and songs cited are so diverse as to be obscure, also. So, you'll certainly be unfamiliar with many of the pieces discussed.Oh yes, and I would estimate well over half of the book consists of these confusing, vague non-examples. The actual theory is very thin. Rooksby seems to have confused intervals with riffs in the first half of the book and scales in the second half. It's sort of ridiculous actually that this even managed to get published. The title is extremely misleading and the concept of a 'Riff' that is presented here is not really what I think most other guitarists even consider it to be (most players I know think Riff == &quot;Rhythm Figure&quot;).Another HUGE problem: Technique is COMPLETELY ignored. Things like Palm Muting, Drone tones, Harmonics, etc, and their contribution to Riffery is completely lost in this book.The few examples that are presented in musical format are absolutely trivial (non copyrighted) things like the major scale intervals and patterns. Rooksby's Songwriting book is authored in exactly the same way... like some sort of bizarre muscic appreciation class that has nothing to do with actual guitar playing or composition.The companion &quot;CD&quot; takes the examples to the point of embarassment: With examples like &quot;let's play two notes a whole step apart&quot; and &quot;let's listen to someone play one position of the A pentatonic scale&quot;. Again: You can get past this point in the First Chapter of Guitar for Dummies or after two lessons with a competent instructor.Really this book would be funny if I had shoplifted it but the fact that I wasted hard earned cash just annoys me. Avoid this and Rooksby's Songwriting book like the plague. :("},{"Title":"Riffs - How to Create and Play Great Guitar Riffs Book/CD","review":"The description of the book &quot;illustrate them with 150 inspired examples&quot; is very misleading.

This book gives a very comprehensive, though somewhat dated, step by step procedure for building a PC, that starts with the selection of all the components. Very helpful to beginners. Although the book covers all the basics, be prepared to do some serious research on the net to supplement the data found in the book and needed in the areas of current hard drives and there setup, with particular regard to size vs cluster allocations. The book is not really good in addressing the new Fat 32 partitioning formats, or in dealing with Windows 98 issues in general. If your going to build a system with a moderate size hard drive, and install Windows 95 as your OS, this book will get you there in great shape. At the end of each construction segment you test your system and if it doesn't respond properly, the book is very good about outlining possible causes and cures. This feature saved me on a couple of occasions. I would like to see the author put out a supplement based on current hardware, setup(Fat32)and OS software now available. I'd buy it in flash!"},{"Title":"Build Your Own PC Pocket Reference","review":"When I built my own PC back in the summer of 1999, I relied upon this book as my primary resource. Certainly, it is somewhat out-of-date now (but what computer book isn't by the time it reaches the shelves), but the fact remains that the primary steps and considerations in building a computer are basically unchanged. You have to choose a CPU, a hard drive, a case, a floppy drive, a CD/DVD drive, a modem, a video card, a sound card, speakers, and a mouse. Bigelow walks you through the process of making these individual decisions within the context of your primary objective. He then walks you through assembling the parts into your very own new computer. In terms of covering the basics, I would still rank this book among the best, especially for non-technical readers. Certainly, the information on installing an operating system deals mainly with Windows 95 but I had no trouble installing Windows 98. Anyone installing Windows NT/2000/XP will need to refer to other reference material, but this book strikes me as being intended mainly for home users looking to build or update a system of their own--even now, most such users will be looking at installing 98 or ME. Also, I would consider the installation of an OS as somewhat separate from actually building a system, and it is the latter pursuit toward which this book is geared.I believe that anyone, including those with little or no computer experience, can build a computer with the help of this book. Furthermore, one can learn what to look for in deciding between different hardware options in terms of a PC's basic components. I would not depend solely on this book for my reference material, but anyone wishing to build a PC or to decide whether or not they want to attempt such a rewarding endeavor would benefit from the guidance Mr. Bigelow provides here.

But he had such a great heart that he became a phenomenal race horse when he was well past the age that he should have even been able to race, even after he had been put to heavy work as a utility animal.

However, this is not an ordinary OO book. This is the first book that I have ever seen that explains concepts of object-oriented frameworks using many simple and small C++ examples. What I like about the book that it also covers CORBA programming (in C++) in the context of design patterns and frameworks. This is done very convincingly. I found the Notes, and Sidebars in the chapters very useful. However, I recommend this book only for professional C++ programmers because the book presents ideas at advanced level. A must for those C++ programmers who understands polymorphism, reuse and inheritance very well, and want to know more about as to how to use these ideas in implementing design patterns and OO frameworks. Another good thing about this book is that unlike other OO books, this book presents a good deal of examples to back the theories. Not a verbose book; just uses many C++ examples to get to the point."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Frameworks Using C++ and CORBA Gold Book: The Must-have Guide to CORBA for Developers and Programmers","review":"Of ~550 pages, the first 270 are a light overview of various C++ features, STL, UML, patterns, and frameworks.The CORBA part starts on page 271 and includes a light overview of the OMG, OMA, and CORBA, a little bit about IDL and how it's mapped into C++ (but only very superficial), two chapters on dynamic aspects (Any, TypeCode, IFR, DII), one chapter with an overview of CORBA services and a short example on the Naming Service.The last four chapters talk about frameworks. They talk about design patterns, metadata, a bit about services and facilities, and refactoring.Overall, I was disappointed. For one, the book is out of date. (For example, there is no mention of the POA). But more importantly, the lack of focus was disturbing to me. It seems to be a case of a little bit of everything and nothing in detail. I didn't see the point of the first half of the book in particular. What's the point of explaining what the new operator does or how a virtual function works? That's basic stuff that everyone who uses C++ will know as a matter of course. Yet, at the same time, there isn't enough info to actually learn C++ if you don't know it already.To me, the first half of the book was largely a waste because its neither here nor there. (There are many better books on C++ that explain these things properly if you need to learn C++). Of course, I'm severely biased when it comes to the second half of the book, so take this with a grain of salt. But I was left with the impression that lack of focus was the main problem. If you don't know CORBA with C++ already, you are not told enough to learn it.

Foner and Brown allows the historians out there to view the Reconstruction Era through a new fresh narrative. This new narrative finally includes the most active of the actors, the newly freed. Brown takes the reader into the war of images during this time. Surely, if you are interested in one of the most refreshing times in the history of the States, this is a must have."},{"Title":"Forever Free: The Story of Emancipation and Reconstruction","review":"This is an excellent depiction of building interracial democracy on the ashes of the Old South.A unique feature of the book are essays by Joshua Brown on visual images involving artwork of the period and pertinent books and movies. There's a lot of history to be learned from cartoons of every epoch. There is a somewhat ambivalent credit to the ideas of W.E.B. Dubois.For some strange reason Foner chooses to skirt the Confiscation Acts, resulting in confusion about the status of freed slaves. Butler's characterization of slaves as contrabands only applied to those engaged in activities helpful to the Confederate war effort. Negro women and children shown as contrabands in the picture on page 45 wouldn't qualify as contrabands until after the Confiscation Acts. The picture doesn't match the text. The E.P. later changed the legal status of these slaves who were largely free by their own efforts.Foner's organization of the Reconstruction era into Presidential (1865-7) and Congressional (1867-77) Reconstruction is very helpful. The book is especially informative on the actions and motivations of Andrew Johnson. Foner is one sided and negative about AJ, citing his political incompetence as well as intemperate speeches that aggravated friends and foes alike. The book shows, perhaps better than any other how AJ alienated first Radicals, then his former supporters by over lenient policies designed to favor former rebels over the interests of the former slaves. It does show the attempt, albeit incompetent, of AJ to follow what he thought were Lincoln's policies on Reconstruction, poorly undefined as they were at Lincoln's death. There is the obligatory speculation on what Lincoln might have done. Foner doesn't assign any responsibility to Lincoln's legacy for the selection of AJ in 1864.There are especially interesting roles of individual ex-slaves turned politicians, Robert Smalls who piloted a Confederate warship, lawyer John S. Roach, Hiram Revels, the first black senator (Mississippi), Writer John R. Lynch who challenged popular views of Reconstruction.and many others. The book tells how administrative power in some areas was balanced by disenfranchisement and racial segregation in many other locals as the Southern states invoked Jim Crow laws to keep blacks off the ballot and out of the voting booth. Foner describes legislative history such as creation of the Freeman's Bureau and Civil Rights Act as well as Supreme Court cases involving largely the Fourteenth Amendment. Prominent are the Slaughterhouse Cases and Plassey v. Ferguson. He covers riots and lynchings and development of the KKK. He points out how the election of Hays in 1876 spelled the demise of the Reconstruction effortFoner ends his book with what he calls the Second Reconstruction involving civil rights movements of the 1960s. He covers the careers of Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks and others. He concludes with the optimistic idea that, in spite of initial failure, Reconstruction kindled the inspiration to forge a society of interracial democracy and social justice."},{"Title":"Forever Free: The Story of Emancipation and Reconstruction","review":"It is a tough subject to discuss in class, but this book is a very helpful.

Finally, a balanced account of what happened after slavery until today."},{"Title":"Forever Free: The Story of Emancipation and Reconstruction","review":"Sorry couldn't resist the pun. Eric Foner is one of those maddening scholars whose work is brilliant but who never seems to produce a lot of new research. I suppose if I produced two works as important as \\"Free Soil Free Labor Free Men\\" and \\"Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution\\" I would feel pretty content too. As the title suggest this book feels like Foner is coasting. I debated about giving it four or three stars but I opted for four because I think Foner gives a very good overview of the end of slavery and reconstruction. If you want an introduction to that period this will be a very good book. On the other hand if you've already read a bit about that period, including Foners other book \\"Reconstruction\\", then very little of this will seem new. That's what I mean by coasting. Foner's written a very readable book but there seems to be little new scholarship to it."},{"Title":"Forever Free: The Story of Emancipation and Reconstruction","review":"Author Eric Foner's Forever Free: The Story of Emancipation and Reconstruction focuses on the period of United States history from before the Civil War through the period of Reconstruction, with an epilogue that speaks to Civil Rights in the modern era. Throughout the text are six essays written and illustrated by Joshua Brown, the executive director of the American Social History Project. Five distinctive areas are highlighted throughout the text which include the following: the period before the Civil War, mainly concentrating on slavery and the lives of slaves; the Civil War itself, including Abraham Lincoln's strategies and the Emancipation Proclamation; Presidential Reconstruction with President Andrew Johnson; Radical Reconstruction directed by Congress and President Ulysses S. Grant; and the aforementioned Civil Rights in the modern era. Essays written by Brown highlight artwork and photography of the era and attempt to show the mood of the print media with regards to racism and the struggle to integrate American society. Noteworthy is the fact that the book was written in the politically correct times of the early twenty-first century when blacks are described as African-Americans, though Caucasians are described as whites and other ethnic groups like Asian-Americans are described as Chinese.The life of the average slave is correctly described as dismal throughout the opening chapters. \\"The Peculiar Institution,\\" as it is called, focused on plantations where slave labor \\"...was far more demanding than in household slavery, and the death rate among slaves much higher.\\" Descriptions of slavery permeate the text, even listing the hardships slaves endured while being transported to the United States from Africa. One such passage states that the decks on the ships were \\"\`...only 18 inches, so that the unfortunate human beings could not turn around, or even on their sides...and here they are usually chained to the decks by their necks and legs.'\\"Battles and atrocities of the war itself are not mentioned in much detail; rather the political battles are the point of focus. On the opening page of the text, General William T. Sherman's \\"March to the Sea\\" is described thusly: \\"Less than three weeks earlier, Sherman, at the head...had captured the city [Savannah] completing his March to the Sea, which cut a swath of destruction....\\" Not mentioned is the mayhem and criminal behavior exerted by his army which most historians regard as fact. Although many believe the Civil War was exclusively about slavery, Foner does point out that even Lincoln was slow to embrace emancipation and could not support a biracial living arrangement post-war with black leaders. He suggested emigration to Central America or the Caribbean and in December 1861 \\"...signed an agreement with a shady entrepreneur to settle former slaves on an island off the coast of Haiti.\\" Moreover, the Emancipation Proclamation, \\"...perhaps the most misunderstood important document in American history,\\" does not have a purpose. Due to Constitutional constraints, it only freed slaves who were held in areas controlled by the Confederacy. It did not free slaves in Border States that did not secede from the Union but still practiced slavery.Following the surrender of Confederate forces in April 1865, the period termed \\"Presidential Reconstruction\\" began in 1865 and ran until 1868. This was President Andrew Johnson's, \\"...promise of a quick restoration of the Union... [and] a return to normality....\\" Since Johnson was a Southerner and a true federalist, not much changed under his leadership. Johnson's failures led to a period known as \\"Radical Reconstruction\\" and lasted until 1877. This tumultuous period was \\"...the only attempt by a national government in league with emancipated slaves to fashion an interracial democracy from a slave society.\\" During Radical Reconstruction, three Constitutional amendments were passed; the President of the United States was impeached for the first time in the nation's history; and the radical group named the Ku Klux Klan was formed. Furthermore, the federal government gained the ability to override states' rights with regards to the principle of equal civil rights.Forever Free concludes with an assessment of the failure of the Reconstruction era, saying that blacks briefly left the servitude of slavery, then quietly returned, being only slightly better off than before. Segregation and discrimination still remained throughout the country, but was especially strong in the south. This failure to properly develop the country in a biracial way has caused many of the issues that are still faced by the United States, including segregation that lasted until the 1960s and discrimination that still exists to this day. The author attempts to show that the failures of Reconstruction are the causes of racial tensions and the reasons for failures of blacks to attain equality. Unfortunately, he fails to hold the black community accountable for some of its own shortcomings, like the high out-of-wedlock birthrate, the greater occurrences of fatherless homes, and the increasing high school dropout rate. The \\"Second Reconstruction\\" of the mid-1960s was abandoned just as the first Reconstruction was due to economic and political necessity with still more work to be done.Overall, one cannot help but feel that Reconstruction was an abysmal failure and that many whites in the South were outright racists. It is difficult to imagine how another civil war did not take place, albeit on a smaller scale, during the two years immediately following the cessation of hostilities based upon the climate that existed in the South. Although Forever Free details events during the almost twenty year period from the beginnings of the Civil War to the end of Reconstruction, very little is written about that is positive. Further, fuller explanations of certain events are not included. For example, as mentioned earlier, Sherman's \\"March to the Sea\\" is only referred to casually without descriptions of the pure horror his army unleashed on parts of the south that might have affected the behavior by some Southerners after the war. Foner also fails to fully expand upon Andrew Johnson's impeachment, a historically significant event which led to the loss of power by the president and for all practical purposes, the country being run by Congress. This resulted in the election of another corrupt president, Ulysses S. Grant, in 1868. Finally, one is struck by the negative portrayals of black Americans throughout the period. According to Brown, there was little, if any, artwork or photographic images of blacks that did not exploit them or show them as lazy or less than intelligent. The tone of the book was negative and will lead those who are unknowledgeable about Reconstruction to believe that very little good came of it."},{"Title":"Forever Free: The Story of Emancipation and Reconstruction","review":"This is a rehash of Foner's earlier books on Reconstruction. Nothing new there, except that his Marxism is finally out of the closet. (His main criticism of Reconstruction is that it was not seized as an opportunity for land redistribution and the introduction of socialism in the US). The alternating chapters on photos by Joshua Brown are, in pleasant contrast, fascinating, new and well-done. Foner chapters: 0 stars; Brown chapters: 5 stars; thus average rating."},{"Title":"Forever Free: The Story of Emancipation and Reconstruction","review":"Somewhere deep in the recesses of my mind I remember reading about emancipation and reconstruction in my high school history class. To the best of my recollection, the sum total of the coverage devoted to these issues in that high school textbook might have been a dozen pages or so. My ideas about these issues, formed about four decades ago, have pretty much remained with me to this day. In his new book \\"Forever Free: The Story of Emancipation and Reconstruction\\" Eric Foner, a Professor of History at Columbia University, shatters most of my pre-concieved notions about these monumental events in American history. It just wasn't that simple. Drawing on a wide range of long-neglected documents, Foner illustrates how African-Americans actually played a much more pivotal role in the events that were unfolding than was previously thought. \\"Forever Free\\" is a real eye-opener!Although the reality is that employment opportunities for the vast majority of African-Americans would continue to be quite limited during the period of Reconstruction I was surprised to learn just how many former slaves would go on to positions of responsibility and prominence during this period. At the conclusion of the Civil War large numbers of former slaves poured into cities and towns all over the South. Once there these black men and women quickly established their own schools, churches, hospitals and fraternal societies. Some of the men harbored political aspirations and many were elected to posts at all levels of government. Still others dreamed of owning and working their own piece of land. These people knew what they wanted. All over America the perception of Black Americans was changing and for the most part changing for the better.What makes \\"Forever Free\\" a truly unique book are the six visual essays offered by Joshua Brown. Each of these essays includes important illustrations and photographs from the period. These images will impress upon the reader that as time went on African-Americans were being taken much more seriously not only by local and national newspapers and magazines but also by large segments of the public at large as well. I particularly appreciated the powerful images of the legendary Harper's Weekly cartoonist Thomas Nast. For the first time in American history, black people were becoming a force to be reckoned with. For an all too brief period of time the future looked cautiously optimistic. \\"Forever Free: The Story of Emancipation and Reconstruction\\" is a thoughtful and well written book that challenges much of what most of us learned in school. In my view this is is book well worth investing your time in. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Forever Free: The Story of Emancipation and Reconstruction","review":"This is a powerful and insightful history of the emancipation of the slaves at the end of the Civil War, and the subsequent period of Reconstruction. Eric Foner contends that Reconstruction is probably the most misunderstood era of American history, as commonly accepted pronouncements about the period were mostly from hostile opponents of the sweeping social changes that the government tried to enact at the time. In fact, as Foner ably demonstrates, Reconstruction was actually an intensive program to include former slaves in the political and economic life of the South, and to quickly implement a wholesale replacement for the ruined slave economy that previously dominated the region. It actually worked for about a decade, with the emergence of many Black politicians and community leaders. But unfortunately the system was overthrown by the White power elite who yearned for a return to the system of economic and social subjugation, leading to the shameful Jim Crow system that was an embarrassment for America's democratic goals until the Civil Rights era.This outstanding work of historical research by Foner uncovers the true issues behind the efforts of African Americans to achieve equal political and economic rights, and he also adds many insights on how deep outstanding issues from the Emancipation, Reconstruction and Civil Rights eras are still relevant to racial equality today. (Plus, an interesting bonus in Foner's work is the realization that the Democratic and Republican parties, when it comes to everything from race relations to fiscal policy, have completely reversed their positions since the late 1800s, and have effectively replaced each other.) Also, this book is very richly illustrated, and be sure to check out the essays contributed by Joshua Brown, who in an especially eye-opening way examines the representation of African Americans, and civil rights issues, in public art from different periods. The picture is often ugly, but this book brings the knowledge that extinguishes ignorance. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"Forever Free: The Story of Emancipation and Reconstruction","review":"... in Eric Foner and Joshua Brown's brilliant new book, \\"Forever Free\\". The U.S. has long heard the story of Reconstruction through the eyes of prejudice and misinformation, not allowing all groups a voice in the story . Foner and Brown attempt to correct the picture by providing an incredibly well-rounded view of this time, through the eyes of newly freed people who were promised the world, only to have it ripped out from underneath them.Forever Free is really two books in one. Foner's story of slavery, and eventual emancipation, is the history lesson. He brings to the story great scholarship. Quite early on, it's evident that he has researched more than the usual story. By looking at authentic sources of information, such as black owned newspapers, diaries and oral histories, he successfully brings to light their story. As a slight scholar of this time myself, I was pleasantly surprised at the information he brought to light; for example, the slaves in South Carolina who created their own society after being freed, only to have to give it up immediately upon an ill-fated decision by President Andrew Johnson. Little gems of information like this are constantly mined throughout Foner's sections.Joshua Brown's contribution is equally as vivid. He traces a visual history of African-Americans throughout the time. It is through his chapters that Foner's points of discrimination and stereotypes are emphasizes. Brown provides endless cartoons, photographs, and other art forms that serve to illuminate the book as a whole. To bounce from Foner to Brown is not disjointing at all; they have successfully married the two to form one united, powerful book.Forever Free should be required reading for all history students, high school students, and teachers who continue to propagate the incorrect story of Reconstruction. It is clearly in Reconstruction that the need of our amazing Civil Rights movement was born. It is in those decisions made so recklessly, so based on misunderstanding and prejudice that endure today. As noted in the book, famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass had it right; \\"Peace among the whites\\" was paved with the shards of African-Americans' broken dreams of genuine equality and full citizenship."},{"Title":"Forever Free: The Story of Emancipation and Reconstruction","review":"As a result of Ken Burns's famous television series, \\"The Civil War\\" many Americans learned about this seminal event in our history. For all its virtues, Burns's series was properly criticized for deemphasizing the role of slavery in the conflict and for not focusing on the impact of the Civil War on African Americans.Eric Foner's \\"Forever Free\\" is part of an ambitious project designed to carry forward the Civil War story with emphasis on Emancipation an on the attempt to reconstruct the South to produce a true multi-racial society. The book is part of an ongoing effort by the Forever Free Foundation to produce a film to make the story of Reconstruction accessible and understandable to a broad audience. Foner is Professor of History at Columbia University and the author of among other things, \\"Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863 -- 1877 a detailed scholarly study of this controversial period. He is assisted in this book by Joshua Brown, executive director of the American Social History Project/Center for Media and Learning at the City University of New York. In the book, Brown complements Foner's text with six chapters of photographs, drawings and other artifacts of popular American culture illustrating the changing perception of African Americans.Until relatively recently, many historians treating Reconstruction saw it as a tragic mistake -- as an attempt by Radical Republicans to foist corrupt governments on the defeated South dominated by unscrupulous whites and uneducated African Americans and to take vengeance on the South for the Civil War. The African American historian W.E.B. DuBois was among the first to challenge this view with his book \\"Black Reconstruction\\" and Foner, and many contemporary historians, follow in his footsteps. While recognizing the failings of Reconstruction, Foner sees it as a noble effort to end slavery and to give all Americans, white and African Americans, political and economic rights and to create, for the first time, a society truly approximating ideals of equality. Reconstruction ultimately failed due to the war-weariness and indifference of the North and to resistance and frequently terrorism within the white South.Foner tells a complex story simply and clearly. This is not a book that breaks new scholarly ground. The book is intended for a large public which, in general, lacks a detailed understanding of our Nation's history. Foner begins with a brief discussion of slavery in the pre-War South and follows this with a discussion of the Civil War focusing on President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation (January 1, 1863), its importance and its effect. But the heart of the story lies in the Reconstruction years, as Foner describes President Andrew Johnson's conciliatory policy of Presidential Reconstruction followed by the Constitutional Amendments of the Reconstruction years and Congressional Reconstruction's attempt to give meaning to ideals of freedom and equality. The story draws upon difficult events on the national arena and on complex events in each of the Southern states. Ultimately, Reconstruction was defeated, or rather postponed, following the disputed Presidential election of 1876 and the Compromise of 1877. Foner describes the reinstitution of Jim Crow in the South which aimed to keep African Americans in subjection. An all too brief concluding section discusses the Civil Rights movement and America's ongoing struggle to secure racial equality.The photographic commentary, both in Foner's text and in Brown's essays, adds a great deal of immediacy to the book, not the least of which derives from showing the reader some of the popular culture of the day. Many will find this unfamiliar and fascinating.The Reconstruction era remains a too-little known and highly controversial area of our history. It will encourage the reader to engage with the topic and to think about freedom and its significance and of the promise of America. The book includes a brief bibliography for those moved to further reading and study.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Forever Free: The Story of Emancipation and Reconstruction","review":"Absolutely wonderful.

While not as detailed as his book on Reconstruction, or even as detailed as his Short History of Reconstruction, Foner's Forever Free does a good job introducing the reader to the struggles the freed blacks faced after emancipation in the 1860s, and the hardships they faced through a hundred years of Jim Crow and intimidation, north and south, to the Civil Rights Movement of the mid-20th Century."},{"Title":"Forever Free: The Story of Emancipation and Reconstruction","review":"Forever Free is an excellent and detailed introduction to a new narrative about the Reconstuction period in the American South. For too long the American public has seen the Reconstruction largely through myths perpetrated by Southern Whites and given great publicity through such films as The Birth of a Nation and Gone With the Wind. Eric Foner is a prominent and leading voice in giving a more accurate account of the accomplishments of the Reconstruction and the struggles of Southern Blacks to form a government true to the principles of the American Constitution. His detailed stories of the period, its struggle for racial freedom and equality before the law, which was already losing momentum by 1876, is accompanied by images of American Blacks in the press during that time, showing how Blacks saw themselves and the general public saw them over the course of these developments. The Reconstruction was not a failed experiment. This book shows in words and pictures how the period laid the groundwork (in such measures as introducing public education to the South)for later positive developments in freedom for all Americans regardless of race."},{"Title":"Visa for Avalon","review":"I was interested in this book in part because I'd heard of Bryher in connection with the poet H.D., and in part because it was recommended by the author of Reading Lolita in Tehran, Azar Nafisi, who, I figured, gets a lot out of her reading. She's definitely right about Visa for Avalon. It's half suspense/half political allegory, about several friends who belatedly realize that their (unnamed) country has been taken over by a totalitarian movement while they were involved in their own lives. They decide to leave for another country called Avalon, which they don't know much about, and set about to get visas and to get out before the borders shut down. It is beautifully written -- lyrical, observant, and concise. It reminds me a bit of Coetzee.The novel apparently draws on Bryher's experience in helping Jews escape the Nazis -- she lived in Switzerland in the early part of the war and helped many people escape Germany. And the book clearly resonates in the politics of the world today."},{"Title":"Visa for Avalon","review":"I stumbled across VISA FOR AVALON almost by accident. Like many I have read very little by Bryher and know almost nothing about her, but I remember my grandmother delighting in her historical novels of British and Celtic bygone ages. This book on the other hand is a modern day thriller, seemingly very much influenced by the spy thrillers of Nicholas Blake, the poet C Day Lewis, particularly his famous anti-Fascist tale THE SMILER WITH THE KNIFE. Orson Welles planned to make TSWTF as a vehicle for Lucille Ball when he still had an office at RKO; it would have turned Lucille Ball into an anti-Fascist sculptress caught up in a very Graham Greene predicament.As a bonus we get a fine introduction by the poet (SWIRL) and scholar (CINEMATIC MODERNISM: MODERNIST POETRY AND FILM) Susan McCabe, who teaches at USC and who plans to write a full biography of the novelist Bryher. Not only that, but we get an afterword also by McCabe which puts this novel into context in any number of senses, linking this book to Bryher's other fiction, and seeing the parallels between the age in which it was written (the 1960s) and the Hitler era in which Bryher used her money the right way. And today when so many of our civil liberties are being torn away from us one by one.VISA FOR AVALON grabs you from the very first word and won't let you go until the twisty end."},{"Title":"Visa for Avalon","review":"VISA FOR AVALON is a slim book - Audrey Hepburn slim, with all that implies. The plot is seemingly simple (and filmic). Basically, within the space of a week and for different reasons, seven people decide to try to leave their country (a close copy of England), the only home most of them have ever known, before it is too late to do so, and go to a place that's little more than a rumor. (\\"'Avalon? ... It's very unfashionable these days.'\\") The sweet, confused, comic, desperate, disparate world that Bryher conjures in her novella is a pre-dystopia. Her story depicts what things might have been like - might be like - at the edge, just before.... Before the books start getting burned, before soma is ingested, before history gets revisioned, before reading becomes a criminal act.... Just before escape is impossible, just before Mordred claims victory. Faintly futuristic with Arthurian teases and political squints, VISA FOR AVALON is also subliminally Delphic, recalling that oracle's confounding challenge: know thyself."},{"Title":"Visa for Avalon","review":"I'm thinking it's a good time to re-read \\"Visa For Avalon\\" in light of some of the current political principles we're dealing with today. Written by Bryher (born Annie Winifred Ellerman in 1894) the author presents a landscape that is not unlike our present. We follow a group of emigrants, some from a coastal town where their homes have been selected for a bypass a la Hitchhikers Guide. They have secured visas to Avalon an enigmatic shelter where they hope to be free from all worries.We're never really sure of the geography of the coastal town, the mid-point or the destination. We're not told who the people driving this new congress of thought are or why they are doing it. So much resides in the mind of the reader but that opens the story to interpretation based on our current and personal realities.My favorite passage is: \\"To be free was to be responsible but the people who were driving Lillian and himself into exile, dreaded personal decisions more than slavery. How ironical life was! They now possessed a knowledge of the inner workings of the mind no other centuries had known and it was precisely against such understanding that the revolution was directed. Anything but wisdom was the slogan they would chalk up on the walls. Search, except within narrow limits, was a new word for sin.\\"Well written, prophetic, stunning in its grasp of current politics to be written so long ago. A Must Read."},{"Title":"Visa for Avalon","review":"A woman is informed by the government that her property willbe expropriated in order to build a factory, presumably aprivately owned facility.

The histories of each pigment are well thought out, and unlike many older books on this subject, the collective authors have not neglected the non-western world. From the perspective of someone who is active in living history groups and calligraphy societies, the lists of who used these pigments, along with when and where, is a welcome feature. As someone who hunts down minerals to make them into paint, the information on IR and X-ray diffraction data, along with color plates of the pigments examined with polarized-light and scanning electron microscopy are a welcome change compared to most other books on historical pigment use. As a scientist, the analytical info is worth the price of the book all by itself, from my point of view. Much of the discussion on the occurence and art history of the mineral pigments has found its way into geology and mineralogy classes I have taught.Some of the material in this volume can also be found in Gettens and Stout almost word for word, though in the articles where this is most conspicuous, Gettens is always first or second author. To be fair, the editors of this series have never pretended that the articles were new material - though much of it has been new to me - but rather revised and updated material from the journal _Studies in Conservation_. Since the venerable Gettens was deceased by the time this volume was published, he may not have had the opportunity to revise his own material. Gettens was one of the instigators of the Artists' Pigment series, and since most of his research has not been superceded as far as I can tell, it's a small complaint and certainly not grounds to avoid this book. Don't avoid this book! Out of the three volumes in this series, this volume (Vol. 2) is the one I like best, probably because it covers most of the mineral pigments and some of the artificial pigments that I find or make. And unlike some other books on pigments, written by armchair scholars, it is obvious that the collective authors of this volume got down and dirty and played with the paints. The hands-on experience really shines through.As someone who barely has time to keep up with the literature in my own field, I found the Artists' Pigments series a welcome addition to my library - a lot of well-researched and well-written material all in one place. I must admit that my favorable opinion of this series is partly based on the wealth of scientific analyses therein, which may not help a non-nerd evaluate this book, but I will point out that all my art-fiend friends, some of whom make their living in the fine arts, are constantly trying to borrow it."},{"Title":"Artists' Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics Volume 2","review":"This information is impossible to find elsewhere, at least compiled as it is here.

Some discussion of an RDBMS other that Sybase would have been nice, considering maybe 80% of PS installations run Oracle. That and the lack of performance tuning discussion of any kind, peopletools included, really kinda left me amazed.

But as unrest in the lands sends his father, Owen, to fight in the wars, Rhodri has to take up the responsiblities of the man of the house, much to his disappointment. Over the next few years, Rhodri is haunted by a fourtune he heard at a fair and one day, he ventures into the forest against his parents wishes, where he comes upon a blind hermit named Tantallon. Tantallon guides him in the ways of magic and shows him the Telling Pool, a place where Rhodri sees what's happening to his father. When Rhodri discovers that his father has been enchanted by a witch namd Homeira, it's up to him to find the fabled sword Excalibur, the sword once held by King Arthur himself, to break the curse. On his journey, Rhodri discovers secrets about his family history. It's up to Rhodri to use his wits carefully before he gets enchanted too.I really liked the Telling Pool. I took a while to get into the story; the beginning was a bit slow, but necessary to tie into the story. I'm fascinated with stories relating to King Arthur and Guenviere, so I enjoyed that aspect of the novel. The story was also cleverly set during the Third Crusade, and it's hard to find novels set at the time period. Being a fan of historical fiction, I really liked this new time. The magical element of the novel was fun as well. Clement-Davies did a good job of mixing history, old legends, magic, and even a bit of romance. I'd recommend this novel to anyone.Reviewed by a student reviewer for Flamingnet Book Reviewswww.flamingnet.comPreteen, teen, and young adult book reviews and recommendations"},{"Title":"The Telling Pool","review":"The Telling Pool was a very good book. Of the books David Clement Davies has written, it isn't my favorite, but that is most certainly NOT saying that I didn't enjoy it very much.It is a wonderful blend of medieval fantasy, coming of age, and romance. As you can see, by what the other reviews say, there is a small religious aspect in the story. However, I think other reviewers may have been overreacting a little bit over the matter. David Clement Davies neither puts down one religion or states anything about one being better than another. He simply writes about them, and tells how a person of that religion would think or what they beleive. He doesn't even go into depth about any of them. Speaking of the religions, as far as I can tell, was essential to the story,(Because the war in the story was a religious crusade.) but was certainly not the main point of it. The story overall is a medieval fantasy.Here is a summary of the plot: Rhodri, a 12 year old boy lives with his mother and his father, who is a master falconer. (One who trains and keeps falcons as pets.) During a fair he meets an old fortune teller who reads the tarot cards for him and tells him of a great destiny he is to have. Shortly afterwards, his father is called upon to go to war to fight for the return of the Holy lands. After his father leaves, Rhodri meets a blind hermit who is the guardian of a magical pool that can show Rhodri what he most wishes to see. Through the pool, he discovers his destiny, and eventually, upon the return of his distraught father, he embarks on a wonderful journey to make things right again.David Clement Davies, has written a great book (yet again) with great voice, wonderful character developement, and he has even managed to make an original story out of what could have easily not been original. I would highly reccomend this, as well as his other works, The Sight, and Firebringer! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Telling Pool","review":"Archetypal fantasy novels involving sorcerers, swords and magical odysseys often walk a fine line between having a classic, timeless quality and being generic and clich&eacute;. While famed British author David Clement-Davies straddles this line with The Telling Pool, ultimately the novel satisfies with a skilled blend of fantasy, historical fiction and Arthurian legend.Set in late 12th century England, The Telling Pool tells the coming-of-age story of Rhodri, a young Welsh falconer whose father, Owen, is sent away to join the Third Crusade. During this time, he meets Tantallon, a blind, elderly blacksmith who leads him to a magical pool deep in the forest, where he witnesses the hardships his father endures on the battlefield, and his seduction at the hands of the evil enchantress Homeira. He's also able to see in the past, and he witnesses the fall of King Arthur and the tryst between Guinevere and Lancelot. When his father returns from war in the grips of a malevolent curse, Rhodri leaves home and embarks on a journey to free him, armed with the legendary sword Excalibur and his trained rock falcon.Although it contributes to the coming-of-age theme of the novel, and parallels the affairs of Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot, too much time is spent relating the love triangle between Rhodri, his friend William and a neighbor girl named Sarah. This subplot quickly becomes tiresome, and the novel's pacing improves significantly once Owen's return sets the main plot in motion. The other, more effective uses of archetypes are the Merlin and Morgan le Fay figures of Tantallon and Homeira, respectively.The strength in the novel's historical element lies in its educational content regarding the Crusades and the corruption of the Albion Christian Church, which young readers may consider a history lesson made fun. A subplot involving a Jewish girl, Rebecca, fleeing persecution with her father calls attention to the social issues of the time and place. Chances are this would be an effective book for middle and high school students studying British history and/or mythology, and it will likely spur an interest that will lead to reading works such as The Faerie Queen and Gawain and the Green Knight.If you're looking for an entertaining escapist fantasy that draws on classic tales, The Telling Pool would provide some degree of satisfaction. David Clement-Davies has written better, yet compared to his other novels, this one is a pretty light read that can be enjoyed at a reader's leisure.You can read this and other reviews at my blog: [....]"},{"Title":"The Telling Pool","review":"I really loved this. It is different to Mr Clement-Davies's other books but it's so full of great stuff. Magic and adventure and the bond between Rhodri and all his friends.

I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"The Telling Pool","review":"It was a bit young and simple, but I still loved this book. It had a familiar plot that was made original, though I did think that it had a rather abrubt ending. Things didn't really speed up until the last 50 or so pages, though the long beginning wasn't boring. It was surprisingly a lot different from Firebringer and the Sight, which had similar plots. Rhodri, after finding the Telling Pool, needs to find the sword Excaliber to free his father's heart. It takes place after King Arthur's age, where he is only a story. All in all, it was pretty good, if rather rushed."},{"Title":"The Telling Pool","review":"The story is well told. But the reviews and jacket information tell only part of the story. Parents need to know for their children that this book has not only themes of adventure but also very strong themes of spirituality. Jesus is portrayed not only as a myth but also as simply a man who married Mary Magdelene and had children. Wiccan is protrayed as the most powerful faith - that of the God and Goddess. And it is ultimately the Wiccan beliefs that help Rhodri the main character.The story is well told and certainly the author is free to express whatever he wants in terms of beliefs but for parents there does need to be information regarding the spiritual themes in order to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish their young children to read this book/"},{"Title":"The Telling Pool","review":"The Telling Pool does overtly examine questions of belief and spirituality, especially in the context of a religious crusade, but it neither states that Christ was an ordinary man nor that Wiccan is the only way, only that that is what some believe. Since it is dealing with beliefs, but in a story that allows for the existence of magic, it necessarily posits the idea of a magical force, and one profoundly rooted in nature. That is the association of Merlin with nature magic in Arthurian legend, which is a legend cycle that has both pagan and Christian roots. But in essence it is about real relationships and a boy's journey to adulthood, which allows him to test many of the religious and cultural assumptions that divided his society then, and the real people within it, and which have such dangerous echoes today. If parents think that this is dangerous for children, then there is a worrying moral censorship at work that the author profoundly disputes."},{"Title":"The Telling Pool","review":"Ok. This book, briefly described, is about a boy who lives with his mother and father (religious family). The boy soon finds a hermit who shows him the telling pool. The Pool shows him images of war among other things. The boy then has to go out on a quest to fufill his destiny that he see's inside The Telling Pool yet does not know that it was his destiny.My problems with this book is this. The Beggining drags on way too long. It really only talks about the boy's life, honestly why would we care about that. Also the book talks a lot about war in a medieval kind of way. It talks about it a lot and I find it rather umm boring.Of course later on in the book you'll get more accustomed to it. When the boy is at the telling pool for example, it gets somewhat more interesting from there on. Gets even better on the last 7 chapters (out of 18). But still I have seen much more exciting books. This gets a 3, it pales in comparison to Firebringer which is why I got this book because of how good Firebringer was. Not highly recommended. Artemis Fowl, The Guardians Of Time Trilogy, The Sight, and Firebringer are highly recommended books."},{"Title":"The Telling Pool","review":"I'll just go ahead and label myself so some can dismiss my opinion: I am a Bible-believing homeschooling mom.My 12 year old son reads voraciously and he likes to share his books with me so we can talk about them. This book started out good. I liked the writing style and story-telling. We had read the author's book \\"Firebringer\\" which was a total rip-off of one of our favorite books \\"Watership Down\\". \\"The Telling Pool\\" *****SPOILER ALERT***** lacks action and a coherant plot. The boy merely sits and gazes into a magical pool where he learns everything he needs to know. When he finally commences on his quest, I couldn't help feeling like I was reading a Disney cartoon. Bad witch captures man's heart, puts it in a casket. (reminds me of The Little Mermaid when the bad witch stole Ariel's voice).The proseletyzing for the Wiccan religion and the overt preaching turned me off. Yah, yah, yah, I know: animals are wonderful, people are bad, Nature is the true power....blah blah blah. Even without the spiritual confusion, the plot was just strange, silly, non-compelling. Too bad, it could have been much better."},{"Title":"The Telling Pool","review":"This is my first Clement-Davies book and as a grandmother and fantasy book lover, I read books for enjoyment and to be able to \\"connect\\" with my grandchildren through books. I thought the writing to be interesting but not a page-turner; goes a bit slowly. I will not share this book with my grandchildren. As most fantasy books, there is magic and wizardry, but this one specifically targets Jesus and Christianity and I cannot recommend for Christian families with children. As a whole book, it is not even entertaining enough to recommend period. I will read one of this other books for a fair comparison of his writing skills."},{"Title":"The Epistle to the Romans 1-8 (Vol. 1) (International Critical Commentary Series)","review":"This is simply the best technical exegetical commentary on Romans out there. Even though it is not brand new, it is still the best. Cranfield's treatment of the Greek text is excellent and exhaustive. He presents supporting arguments for most of his grammatical decisions which many commentators neglect to do. The author however is a Barthian neo-orthodox theologian, and his theological conclusions must be read with skepticism, and his desire to draw neo-orthodox conclusions does impact his exegesis at times."},{"Title":"Nurse Practitioner Secrets, 1e","review":"What a major disappointment but I guess its because anything with a title related to secrets lures one to buy expecting that but it seems like ninety percent of this book has little but rehashed knowledge that can found in many other source books. What one would expect at least is that there should be sections on the major disorders like hypertension, diabetes, thyroid problems, seizure disorders, and so forth. There are none. The contract stuff and the icd coding can be found online and printed from many sites. Furthermore, most computer programs do the icd coding automatically now so the attention to this is debatable versus other things not included. I cannot tell you how much I feel like I wasted my money. There's even seemingly 'serendipity' sections on lesbian care and borderline disorder as if from out of the blue which might lead one to expect a section on homosexual care or even male care problems and more about psych problems. I don't understand the gaps and deletions. Maybe they should have named it Some Nurse Practitioner Secrets About Some Things but even that would be stretching the truth. It certainly seems incomplete and misdirected in its scope and so far the main secret I've found but as of yet haven't found an answer for is why the title uses the word secrets! Save your money. The person who is asking for three hundred dollars of so for this used copy is way off in my opinion. I paid 24.99 and still feel cheated!!!"},{"Title":"Corporate medium-term notes (Finance and economics discussion series)","review":"A great story, well written, easily read.

However, when it comes to the details and the tutorials, this book breaks down. I found a dozen errors in the few few pages, some crucial errors. I wrote to the publisher listing a lot of the errors and asked if there was an online update. Their reply was basically to wait for the 2007 edition.I think Apress rushed this book out before Microsoft even finished delivering the product because some features of the software don't even exist - Microsoft changed direction and does not support SQL Server Express Manager, for example. So, I'm stuck trying to figure out alternative techniques and procedures to accomplish certain tasks so I can stay up with the tutorials.I think by the time I'm finished I could probably write my own tutorial. I've found myself going back and forth between the Wrox book and the Apress book in an attempt to piece things together.

It appears that the proof reading was done by someone without a math background, as many of the errors are obvious, such as an equal sign being omitted, turning an equality into a product.

Although there are essential technical terms, such as Advaita, Atman, Brahman, Maya and Satchidananda, the author Swami Shraddhananda does not overload the reader with a barrel full of Sanskrit terms. And he draws his authority from the Upanishads, Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda. Shakespeare and the Bible are also quoted. The author explains the \\"what\\" the \\"how\\" and the \\"why\\" and brings in a small but powerful dose of scriptural authority.Swami Shraddhananda, with a B.Sc in chemistry before he joined the Ramakrishna monastic order, was a brilliant interpreter because he knew how to engage the modern rational mind. The detailed index aids study. This is not a textbook, but more enjoyable and useful because the chapters are short, about 5 pages, on specific topics; such as Rosary for Japa and The Healing Power of Silence. The writing is warm and friendly, coherent and gently forceful.

I was surprised to receive only the tape (especially for $29.00). It has some good, if not always very understandable, native speakers of various dialects of Great Britain on it -- and without the transcriptions it is hard to grasp all the changes. I guess now I'll order the book and wait three weeks for that. It is a good resource for samples of some of the regional dialects not easily found in the major dialect source books."},{"Title":"English Accents and Dialects : An Introduction to Social and Regional Varieties of English in the British Isles (cassette sold separately)","review":"Wonderful introduction into studying dialects and accents.

The set will be valuable for students of English as a foreign language to prevent the shock of facing authentic casual speech, which may seem unintelligible to unprepared non-native speakers. Although it is not rich in theoretical issues, the book presents good material organization and easy to read text. The material presented in non-technical manner, lacks nuances, and mainly focuses on sound distinctions, mentioning intonation, stylistic appropriateness, cultural and historical grounds aside.

This story certainly makes one a believer after meeting Winter, an old man who also happens to be very grumpy. His morning goes from bad to worse as he wakes up in a bad mood, misplaces his hat, misses breakfast, and struggles with the eternal question, &quot;Why do I always have to go to work?&quot;. His day is &quot;saved&quot;, however, when he crashes to the ground into the world of a little girl who thinks of him as very improtant. She even defends him from her teasing playmates and makes Winter feel special again. With friends like this one, one can hardly stay grumpy for long- not even Winter! The pictures are absolutely hilarious. From the cowboy-like Winter, sporting a handlebar mustache and a ten-gallon hat, to his snow-creating dump truck, one cannto help but smile. The splashes of color and white, done in pastels, pencils, and watercolors, make the reader feel like he or she has run right into Old Man Winter- Brrrr!"},{"Title":"Is That You, Winter?","review":"The story, Is that you, Winter?, is about a petulant, old man who brings snow to the land from the back of his truck. He questions and grumbles about why he has to go to work, but foremost, he wonders for whom he makes it snow. The tale in itself, though brief and concise, has a heart-warming ending. The art work in the book paints vivid images of the wintry landscape. The illustrations, done in colored pencils and watercolors, are a thrown-together mixture of light and dark shades. The swirling colors provide the rough, scratchy text with more meaning than the words could possibly convey on their own. The child may only see pretty pictures and hear an interesting story, but deeper meanings could be contrived from the story itself. The tale shows that no matter how disdainfully a person views their work, they may generate the snow that warms someone's heart. The book is excellent, and I recommend it to anyone who wishes to read an intriguing story."},{"Title":"Is That You, Winter?","review":"The lettering bespoke this characters emotions wonderfully and the art work coincided to the story , like a match made in heaven!!

Stephen Gammell provides an interesting explanation in his book \\"Is That You, Winter?\\" We discover that Old Man Winter is an ornery old cuss, who releases his icy blasts from the back of his truck. But Old Man Winter has a question: \\"Who do I make it snow for?\\" The answer is to be found in this book and you will not be surprised to learn it is an answer that makes even Old Man Winter happy.How much you like this illustrated children's book is probably going to depend on how much you like Gammell's artwork, which strikes me and my limited knowledge of art as something of an impressionistic cartoon. Certainly the work is stylized and I would be willing to bet that children are going to find it more acceptable that some adults. I sort of like the way he depicts the snowstorm and you have to admit it is pretty distinctive."},{"Title":"Is That You, Winter?","review":"Is That You, Winter?

Upon returning from his long day of work, he has a terrible accident and finds himself lying helpless in the snow. While the story in this book is amusing and well written, the illustrations do not seem to add to the experience of reading this book. The artwork appears to have been done by a five-year old. The colors seem to have been simply thrown onto the paper with no concern for what it is meant to look like. At times, the illustrations convey no sense of the emotions in the corresponding pages, and overall it seems that the illustrations were a mere afterthought thrown onto the pages in a rush. Perhaps a different method of illustrating would have added more to the telling of this book's story.

Take the worst trends of society right now and that's where this book starts. This is the sequel to Space Merchants and in some ways it's a redrafting of that story. Excellent."},{"Title":"The Merchant's War","review":"Pohl's satirical predecessor, Space Merchants, was written in the 50s but lost its momentum halfway through and unraveled into an incoherent ending. Fast forward 30 years and Pohl writes a sequel named Merchants War, which didn't let me down as its predecessor did. Merchants War is chalked full of wonderful satire, the same way in which Space Merchant's started but never finished. The satirical momentum never lets up and includes political, religious, advertisement, cultural and military satire wrapped up in a cozy sci-fi blanket. These satirical jabs are delightful the whole way through.The plot is progressive and the happenings are whimsical. This pace of plot is rarely seen in modern sci-fi and seems to fit perfectly for this type of novel. Pohl has a wicked sense of humor and is at times a sadist when involving his characters in crazy schemes or just laying on the perpetual hardships for Tennison. You can easily manage a sympathetic smile for such a kicked-when-down character. Below Tennison, there are even more characters which can be recognized through the general satire - everyone has a tyrannical boss, or a gopher assistant, or a manically possessive roommate, or an obese addict for a friend, or a unicycling presidential hopeful. What?Pohl's continual quirky wit, colorful imagination and bold/cold stabs at all things satirical provide a one-of-a-kind novel which is now prized on my sci-fi bookshelf among his other great novels like Gateway, Man-Plus and Starburst."},{"Title":"The Merchant's War","review":"Tennison Tarb who works at the Earth embassy on Venus whose colonization was sold to an overpopulated Earth. Tennison, an undercover agent in disguise of diplomat, who tries to recruit pro-Venus people to the advertising side. In a guerrilla incident, he and her beloved one Mitzi gets almost killed. Tennison is called back to Earth. He finds the rules of advertising have changed. The advertising takes him unguarded and he becomes addicted to Moke-Coke. He becomes persona non-grata in his previous job; an unreliable who can be seduced to do anything just to get his daily dose every 6 hour. In spite of his star grade status, he is sentenced to sell intangibles: religion and politics. Tennison soon learns that Mitzi is not in fact Mitzi, but a Veenie agent who took her place after the accident. The underground movement wants to stop Earth from interfering in the affairs of Venus. Tennison is recruited to their cause.This book published in 1984 is sequel toThe Space Merchantspublished in 1953. It's remarkable that in spite of 30 years in between, the exact style of the original book has been preserved. The strong satire and drive of underground movement is duplicated in this second book like it was in the first one.Two (2) stars. What's the difference between the first an second book? There lies the problem: there isn't much to add to the story started in the first. The second book shows much more mature writing, but the satire that held up the first book isn't fresh any more in the second. We still see no character development, we read the same plot twists as in the first one, and the \\"war\\" is over in 10 pages at the end of the book. In some sense this book is more subtle and avoids some of the excess of the first, but overall the first one is better in its originality."},{"Title":"The Merchant's War","review":"THE MERCHANT'S WAR (1984) is the hilarious sequal to the classic THE SPACE MERCHANTS (1952). While THE SPACE MERCHANTS is the better known of these two books, THE MERCHANT'S WAR stands up better to the passing of years, as most of the bold predictions in THE SPACE MERCHANTS don't hold up well over time.The story takes up about 30 years after where THE SPACE MERCHANTS left off, with the \\"Conservationists\\" having gotten a foothold on colonizint Venus, and with Earth even more over-populated (40Bln people), and more over-commercialized.Well, what really impressed me about THE MERCHANT'S WAR was the situations that the befuddled main character Tennison Tarb gets himself into... at first, I thought that \\"Tenny\\" was just another unlikeable main character - for example, when he and his girlfriend are out exploring the old Russina Venera landing site on Venus, \\"Tenny\\" gets bored, and lets air out of his oxygen tanks, so that the two must head back inside... but later, the situations that continue to happen to Tenny start to get you laughing at him... Tenny reminds me of this Program Manager at my work, and I could imagine these things happening to him, and I just started to laugh at loud, and on a number of occasions.One of the things that happens to Tenny, is that he quickly becomes driven to buy and be addicted to \\"Mokie-Coke\\"...

Volume two: The New Testament","review":"I bought this book on a lark: Isaac Asimov the science fiction writer? A secular history of the bible? Riiight...Actually, Asimov was a very accomplished scientist, philosopher, and writer of both fiction and non-fiction. His 2 volume book set on the Bible is, as he makes it clear from the start, NOT a criticism of the Bible nor is it new work. It is a scholarly exploration, chapter by chapter of the most up to date (at the time) understanding of the history of the Ancient Middle East and how that relates to the English language version(s) of the Bible.Exquisite detail is used to identify, explain, and cross-reverence the empires, nations, battles, names, etc, necessary to make sense of these complex histories/stories. He swiftly sums up, without judging, several confusing differences in spelling and dynasty orders that clog up part of the OT. Dozens of maps help to make locations and relationships between nations much more clear. Even when he points out that a story cannot be historical, he does so with straightforward explanations and direct references to previous parts of the volume itself where they were discussed. Where appropriate he also compares different translations, book/chapter titles, and canon versions.Personally, I found his exploration of the \\"apocrypha\\" most enlightening. He does not waste time on why something was included or not included by goes directly to whether it has anything to teach us about history or the societies that wrote it an criticized it."},{"Title":"Asimov's guide to the Bible. Volume two: The New Testament","review":"Isaac Asimov may be best known for his extensive science fiction works, but he also wrote on many other subjects that drew his interest, and fortunately for us the Bible drew his interest. His commentaries analyze almost everything in the Bible that merits further attention, asking questions, re-evaluating meanings, discussing the context from many angles including historical, linguistic, archeological, and other scientific views. If you want a history of Alexander and the four generals that divided his empire or have questions on any \\"unsolved mysteries\\" from the Bible like the Star of Bethlehem or why various apochrypha (books like Enoch that were left out of the official Bible) were disputed, Asimov covers such topics. He does so in great detail, requiring two separate books on the Old and New Testaments of the Bible - but I am reviewing the pair as one because they go hand in hand and most readers interested in one will also want the other.One item that really got my attention was his theory on Noah's Flood. On pages 40-42 of his Old Testament commentary, Asimov discusses the possibility that it was not all from rain: \\"There may have been a sudden rise in the water level of the Persian Gulf... It has occurred to me recently that a possible explanation for such an invasion of the sea would be the unlucky strike of a large meteorite in the nearly landlocked Persian Gulf...\\" He points out Genesis 7:11 notes that \\"'the fountains of the great deep [were] broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.' A tidal wave plus rain, in other words.\\" Later he suggests: \\"The tradition that the ark came to rest in Ararat some six hundred miles northwest of Sumeria again speaks in favor of the tidal-wave theory of the Flood. Ordinary river flooding would sweep floating objects downstream - southeastward into the Persian Gulf. A huge tidal wave would sweep them upstream - northwestward towards Ararat.\\" My copy of Asimov's book is from 1968. In 2006, the Holocene Impact Working Group announced their findings on Burckle Crater, a huge impact crater about 18 miles in diameter at the bottom of the Indian Ocean. They believe a huge meteorite or small comet crashed into the ocean approximately 4900 years ago, creating mega-tsunamis. When I read about that impact, I remembered what Asimov had written....In his New Testament commentary, I found his section on Christmas quite informative. One easy way to tell that no one celebrated the birth of Jesus in late December until centuries had passed by is that all Hebrew holidays are based on a lunar calendar. This is why Passover, Hanukkah, and even Easter don't have a fixed date on our modern (solar) calendar. Roman holidays made use of the solar calendar used by Rome. Of course the Romans already had a holiday (several, actually) around the winter solstice in December, and as Christianity grew in numbers they simply claimed these holidays for Christ. \\"The mere fact that Christmas is celebrated on December 25 every year and that the date never varies on our calendar is enough to show that it was not established as a religious festival until after A.D. 300.\\" (p. 272)Countless Bible commentaries have been written by religious scholars. Asimov was not religious, just a very broadly educated, highly intelligent man who offers us a sensible, in-depth analysis of the entire Bible. I found it informative as a young man reading it long ago, and I found it useful when I read it again more recently, taking many notes while researching my own book on End Times prophecy."},{"Title":"Asimov's guide to the Bible.

ENGINE SUMMER was actually the first novel John Crowley ever completed; the ms. then sat in a draw for years while he honed his craft with THE DEEP and BEASTS. The original draft was then rewritten. You thus have a unique combination of an author's most central concerns, his fundamental, primal Tale (always in the first novel), with the skills and knowledge of a mature artist.Civilization has fallen apart and humanity has returned to a primitive way of life. It's one of the oldest ideas in science fiction, but ENGINE SUMMER is unlike any other post-holocaust novel ever written. Rather than a harsh existence and a struggle to return to former glories, Crowley has imagined a veritable utopian existence -- in a world which knows there can be no going back. This is the long &quot;Engine Summer&quot; (&quot;Indian Summer&quot; misremembered) of the world, and winter is coming. It's a setting of unbelievable poignance.Rush That Speaks, an adolescent boy, finds himself in a strange place. An unfamiliar woman asks him to tell his story.

As Rush tells his remarkable tale, the special (and unbearably poignant) circumstance of that telling gradually becomes clear to the reader. ENGINE SUMMER is ultimately a story *about* Story, about the human ability to be moved by tales like this and about our desire to know what happens next. I would say more, but I don't want to even hint at what is going on here.THE DEEP retells the story of the English Civil War in a unique setting which seems to be genre fantasy but turns out to be something very different. At the time it was published, I thought it was flawed but showed extraordinary promise. That promise was fulfilled in BEASTS, a novel I thought was the best sf novel of its year and one (I'm very proud to say!) I cited, in print, as evidence of Crowley's greatness before ENGINE SUMMER and LITTLE, BIG were ever published. You'll notice I made no attempt to summarize its plot. It's like that."},{"Title":"Three Novels: The Deep, Engine Summer, and Beasts","review":"John Crowley leads up to his first masterpiece Engine Summer, with two earlier, less well known works of fantasy.

This is one weird book, let me put it that way and not weird like mindblowingly weird but just . . . weird. I don't know, I can't explain it but the book feels like it takes place in a fever dream, there's this unreal quality about everything. The plot then. Someone has apparently constructed a giant disk in space and attached a long cord to it (so they say) and there are people on the top of the disc and they endlessly fight in this war of succession. To this mess comes a Visitor who doesn't remember why he came here or even who made him and for most of the story he serves as an observer to the events going on. The only problem I had with this was some of the characters are hard to keep straight because they aren't given proper names, you've got &quot;Red Senlen&quot; and &quot;Red Senlen's Son&quot; and Redhand and Old Redhand and Younger Redhand and Learned Redhand and King Little Black and Black Harrah and Young Harrah . . . you can see the problem. That's a fairly minor quibble though, this is a book that deserves to be tracked down and read. Crowley's writing is amazing, especially since this was his first novel, it's entirely poetic without getting long winded, with a few words he paints brilliant pictures. The premise is utterly unique in its presentation (for the record, I believe that the folks on the disc are reenacting the War of the Roses) and the plot winds along nicely, there aren't many &quot;explosions&quot; but you just snake along, caught up in the dream. The ending is also totally unexpected and completely fits in with the tone of the novel. This is one of the few totally satisifying books I had read, I had expected a lot out of this guy because of the reputation I had heard and he blew away everything I expected. And he only got better. My advice then, get everything you can by this guy, it might take some effort but I have a feeling it'll be worth it. Again, the fact that this brilliant author is out of print and many many many lesser lights are kept in print is beyond me.

Apostoli, a frequent host on the Eternal Word Television Network, demonstrates his ability to present a complicated topic with clarity and depth. His first two chapters are rich with scriptural references on the mission of Jesus. Next, we learn of the Holy Spirit's mission as implied in Jesus' promise to the apostles that \\"another Paraclete\\" would come and be their advocate forever. The role of the second Paraclete, according to scripture, consists of witnessing on Jesus' behalf; proving the world wrong about sin, justice, and condemnation; and \\"guiding you in all truth.\\"In later chapters the author addresses the Spirit's guidance of pastors and the laity. The laity, he explains, share the threefold mission of Jesus. The lay interpretation of Jesus' priestly role is primarily to pray and to offer \\"spiritual sacrifices,\\" in their daily activities and relationships. The laity participate in Jesus' kingly office by imitating Him and serving others as He did. Finally, lay persons are called to the prophetic office through giving witness directly and by example; recognizing truth and error in matters of faith and morals; and exercising \\"the grace of the word,\\" being open to God's word and sharing it with others.In his introduction to \\"Paraclete,\\" Fr.

It is one of the most fascinating books I have read about Hitler. The book is made up of first hand accounts by three members of Hitler's inner circle: secretary Traudl Junge, aides-de-camp Otto Guensche, and pilot Hans Baur. About 95% of the account comes from Junge who was hired as one of Hitler's private secretaries in January 1943 (just in time for the tenth anniversary of Hitler's coming to power and less than two and one half years before the end of the Nazi regime). During much of this time, Junge's duties were primarily social. She accompanied Hitler for meals and relaxation almost daily. Her viewpoint is, admittedly, from an isolated world with one set of beliefs and a \\"puppet master\\" who controlled her day-to-day life and thoughts. She describes Hitler's demeanor and routine at the Wolf's Lair (Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia), at the Berghof (his mountain retreat), and finally in the bunker as Berlin was being surrounded. She offers a unique perspective on many aspects of the dictator's life: his dietary habits, his outlook on the war, his after-dinner small talk with such intimates as Eva Braun, etc. Junge also describes how Hitler was affected by the July 1944 bomb plot and how he handled himself as he neared his suicide. Finally, Junge, Guensche, and Baur each offer their experiences trying to escape war-torn Berlin. Many top Nazis are included in Junge's account: Goebbels, Himmler, Albert Speer, etc. Hitler comes out looking very human in this book as Junge's perspective is from one in an isolated world where Hitler was the charming host who played with his dog and cared about his loyal friends and employees. As the authors state in the introduction: \\"It is generally agreed today that the most shattering feature of those who commit genocide is not that they are monsters, but that they are just like many other people.\\" My only complaint is that the book leaves me wanting more. It is only 166 pages with many short chapters and two sections of black and white photos. Junge died fairly recently at the age of 81 and I've read that she completed a book The Final Hour before her death. I have yet to find this book but, if it is an expanded version of Voices in the Bunker, it will be excellent."},{"Title":"Voices from the Bunker","review":"From the former secretary of the fuhrer comes a unique story which is easily believable because of the author herself. I've seen many interviews of Ms. Junge and have concluded that she is of high moral standard and has led a truly unique life because of the &quot;Nazi nerve-center&quot; she was a part of. Voices from the bunker illustrates the last few weeks of Hitler's life, aswell as the escape(s) of the surviving bunker dwellers. Because of her daily proximity to Hitler and the goings-on of the Fuhrer-bunker, the author offers a uniquely special rendition of the final days of Naziism. Covered in this book are the author's appointment to Hitler's staff, the activities of the &quot;center of power&quot; within the reich, circumstances leading to the eventuall downfall, Hitler's death and the escape from the bunker amidst Russian bombardment. This book is a light read, but filled with capturing discriptions of the last few weeks of the underground bunker which served as the command center of Adolf Hitler."},{"Title":"Voices from the Bunker","review":"Somewhat misleadingly titled, *Voices from the Bunker* is only partly about Hitler's final days in his underground Berlin headquarters where, as the Russians and Americans closed in from every side, he eventually shot himself at the end of April 1945. The book is more accurately a retelling of Traudl Junge's two years as one of the Fuhrer's personal secretaries, part of an entourage of aides, guards, generals, and Nazi officials who comprised Hitler's support team as he conducted the war from a variety of heavily fortified locations in the forests and mountains of an increasingly beleaguered Germany. Nonetheless the book offers an often fascinating glimpse of a Hitler one isn't often allowed to consider: Adolf Hitler as a human being--and, even more disturbing--a man one might actually find oneself liking!The Hitler we see in these pages is a man often funny, charming, gracious, affectionate, and thoughtful. A Hitler who suffered deeply and genuinely the pain his country and his people were enduring when the tide of war turned against him. A Hitler who steadfastly and, yes, courageously, refused the option of escaping to the south of Germany when it became apparent that Berlin was lost--or the chance to flee the country altogether and conduct the war from exile ((some sympathetic Middle Eastern countries were apparently an option)).Having only recently read *Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar,* I was struck by the similarities and differences between the two dictators. Both were not only committed to victory even if it cost them their last drop of blood, but they truly and unquestioningly believed in the rightness of their cause. They asked of their soldiers nothing more than they were prepared to give themselves: total sacrifice. And they both felt betrayed when those around them showed more of a penchant for self-survival.Curiously, both men were driven to almost identical states of complete mental and physical collapse as their respective countries teetered on the brink of annihilation. And even stranger it was to find oneself even sympathizing with these two men as you saw their dreams--albeit nightmares for so many millions--dying with each appallingly costly military defeat. There's something in the human biological make-up that can't help empathy, the same instinct that enables us to watch Oedipus or Macbeth topple from pride to pity.If one had to pick the main difference between the two tyrants...one would surprisingly have to say that Hitler was actually the nicer of the two. Unlike Stalin, Hitler doesn't come off as a raging paranoiac, even after an assassination attempt that only narrowly fails to kill him. Hitler didn't strike the kind of terror that Stalin struck into his most trusted confidantes with constant purges, arrests, tortures, and wholesale executions of even those closest to him. Instead, the Hitler in these pages seems almost a doting employer--paternalistic, loyal, solicitous, and indulgent to those close to him. A megalomaniac in some regards, he could be surprisingly self-effacing in others, embarrassed, for instance, at the interruption of an opera to pay him tribute. \\"It was,\\" he said, \\"disrespectful to the performers.\\" Remember, too, that this was a guy who apparently had enough of whatever it takes, even as a doddering 56-year-old wreck of a man, to inspire a young and pretty woman, over Hitler's own objections, to join him in the bunker and marry him on the next to last day of his life. Then commit suicide beside him the next day. And this wasn't the Hitler who was rocking Germany like the Beatles, but a broken, powerless, and soon-to-be-dead-and-forever-disgraced-and-reviled failure. How many men can say they've ever known that kind of unconditional love and devotion from a woman? Well, one might indeed sacrifice the regard of all the world and all of history for a love such as that, no?Anyway, to paraphrase Marc Antony, I haven't come to praise Hitler but to review *Voices from the Bunker.*Junge was in her early twenties when the events she recounts in *Voices from the Bunker* took place and one wonders just how accurate her extraordinarily detailed memory can possibly be after all this time...and how much the authors credited with actually writing this book added to round out her account. One also can't help but speculate on how much revisionism Junge is engaging in, conscious or unconscious, to justify her past, although, for the most part, one gets the feeling that her account is pretty even-handed and no apologia for Hitler, Nazism, or herself. Her story of her escape from the bunker through the ruins of Soviet-occupied Berlin is riveting, the kind of episode that makes you forget to swallow for pages at a time until you realize your mouth is dry. Her avowal that she, like most Germans, had no idea that the Jews were being exterminated since most of the camps were located outside of an increasingly isolated Germany is partly credible and partly incredible. Could it possibly be true? After two years at the very hub of Nazi power, in the presence of Uncle Adolf himself...could she really have heard not even a rumor of the millions being exterminated?Equal parts adventure, gossip, and history, *Voices from the Bunker* is a remarkable personal testament that sits you elbow-to-elbow at table with one of the great villains of all time. It's unsettling to hear how politely he asks you to pass the salt."},{"Title":"Voices from the Bunker","review":"There's considerable material here on his personal life, social skills, and relations with Eva and others. You won't find this material in standard history books. My one regret is that the author, a secretary to Hitler, probably couldn't really reveal her feelings about her boss considering the outcome of that war. Hitler had four main secretaries - two of them declined to write or discuss Hitler out of admiration and respect after his death, and the fourth did write a book I haven't read."},{"Title":"Voices from the Bunker","review":"\\"Voices from the Bunker\\" by Pierre Galante, consists of basically the (then) unpublished accounts written by of one of Hitler's junior secretaries, Traudl Junge, supplemented by comments from one of his aides-de-camp, Otto Guensche, and his personal pilot Hans Baur, during the 2 and one-half years Junge spent as Hitler's secretary, as well as some post-war accounts from all three. But the vast majority of the book is from Frau Junge.Frau Junge was interviewed and subsequently hired to be one of Hitler's four secretaries in January 1943, while only 22 years old. Her duties, as well as those for the other secretaries, were basically to type up speeches, reports, and occasionally take dictation from Hitler. However, she was not involved in the daily military conferences or anything other than routine office work. But, the secretaries were expected to eat lunch and dinner with Hitler, to provide him with some non-stressful company, and where he basically acted as a host rather than as the German leader. So her narrative basically shows the human, non-military side of Hitler.She describes how, due to his charisma and strong oratory skills, most people meeting him fell under his spell. Although most of what she shows about Hitler can be considered as background information about him, or perhaps even \\"fluff\\", the Hitler she describes is part of the whole. While there was much she did not see, she was there for some important events, such as she seeing Hitler shortly after the July 1944 assassination attempt, and was with him in Berlin until his suicide. She denies knowing anything about the mass executions, murders, or other genocidal aspects of his rule, and is probably telling the truth, as Hitler liked relaxing with his intimates and secretaries and refused to discuss military matters during these times.Frau Junge eventually published her memoirs under the title \\"Until the Final Hour\\". While I haven't read that book, comments I've seen indicate that the two books are similar though not exactly the same, so if you have one book, you may not need to buy the other. She was also the subject of a film \\"Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary\\", where two Austrian filmmakers interviewed her in 2002 about her time with Hitler. I have seen that movie (subtitled in English), and this book more-or-less tracks with the movie.This is an interesting book written by someone who saw a different side to Hitler than his officers and aides, although perhaps only a relatively superficial side, and gives an insider's account to some of the important events of the war."},{"Title":"Voices from the Bunker","review":"Very informative about the enter workings of Hilter's headquarters, and his final death.

While Hitler was a villain, history seems to avoid telling the \\"in-depth\\" story, preferring to cater to the general view of the masses. In this book, we see a more human side of Hitler as the \\"boss\\" of his secretarial staff. We see a young woman (Traudle Junge) who can only see Hitler as a caring, fatherly figure (during the war) as opposed to the deranged Dictator that we have come to know through written History. This book takes us into the day to day lives of Hitler's staff during the final days of the Reich. If you are a WWII History buff, this book is a must read. This book will certainly enhance your understanding of the complex character that we have come to know as \\"Der Fuhrer.\\""},{"Title":"Story of General Dann and Mara's Daughter, Griot and the Snow Dog: A Novel","review":"I am currently reading \\"The Story of General Dann and Mara's Daughter, Griot and the Snow Dog: A Novel.\\" It's the sequel to Mara and Dann which is number one on my favorites list. This book reads in typical Lessing fashion; propelled by stream of consciousness of the main character. Dann's dilemma, observations and musings, presented in omniscient third person, is the sole narrative. The first chapters seem to be using the spare voice of one re-telling an ancient fable or distant memory. There are few adjectives and detail is saved for seemingly random moments and Dann's inner dialogue. I've already read five years of Dann's life and I still don't feel that the story has begun. There is only the barest of character investment. Seemingly important characters are introduced and discarded within pages. If you have not read the first book then I doubt you would feel any character sympathy at all. As it is, I am familiar with the world Dann inhabits and I am excited to return.This isn't the desperate, fast paced adventure that \\"Mara and Dann\\" was but it does explore some interesting themes. For instance, Dann is obsessed with what he does not know. He is constantly tantalized by fragments of knowledge and remnants of truth. He is frustrated by the complacent incuriosity of those around him and it begs the question: When are we satisfied with our knowledge, world, condition? When do we stop asking questions? It has me examining my own desire to learn and I can empathize with his frustration of apathy.I haven't finished the book. As I said I am still waiting for the story to begin but I've had that same anticipatory feeling in other Lessing novels and found that I was missing the story, the crux, because I was expecting something else. Once I realized this I could settle down and appreciate the challenge and story she was sharing with the reader. She is a unique writer and her style defies stereotype. Doris Lessing is a true artist whose talent and method of conveyance would be impossible to teach.On a lighter note a \\"snow dog\\" has been introduced as a central character and I like stories that have fuzzy animal friends.Read it if you are a Lessing fan but not as an introduction to her work."},{"Title":"Story of General Dann and Mara's Daughter, Griot and the Snow Dog: A Novel","review":"In \\"the Story of General Dann and Mara's Daughter, Griot and The Snow Dog\\", acclaimed Nobel Prize-winning novelist Doris Lessing has rendered a most captivating tale about friendship, loss and love, set sometime in Planet Earth's distant future; a time when the world has been plunged anew in yet another great Ice Age that has entombed much of the Northern Hemisphere in great ice sheets. Humanity's great cities are but a distant, almost forgotten, memory, buried under these thick ice sheets or submerged in seas and oceans. In her latest novel, a sequel to her 1999 \\"Mara and Dann\\", Lessing focuses upon the trials and tribulations of the adult Dann, now General Dann, and the leader of a great army in the barren wastes of northern Africa. Dann must contend with news of the sudden, tragic death of his sister Mara, and comes to terms with her newborn daughter, and with his own wife and newborn child. It is an emotional, intensely psychological journey that Dann undertakes, and one in which he nearly fails, over the course of years that are so elegantly collapsed within the relatively terse confines of Lessing's novel. Lessing's prose has never been better, and she has crafted such a mesmerizing tale that I found almost impossible to set aside, even for brief moments of time. For those wondering why Doris Lessing deserved the Nobel Prize for her excellent science fiction and fantasy literature, then reading this elegant little novel may provide you with some intriguing, perhaps delightful, answers."},{"Title":"Story of General Dann and Mara's Daughter, Griot and the Snow Dog: A Novel","review":"\\"Mara and Dann,\\" this tale's haunting predecessor (and, I think, one of Lessing's most powerful and imaginative and accessible books), followed its brother-and-sister heroes as they traversed the African continent at the end of an Ice Age many millennia in the future. Their harrowing adventures brought them to a farm within walking distance of the Rocky Gates (Straits of Gibraltar), the Western Sea (Atlantic), and the rapidly filling cavernous expanse of the Middle Sea (Mediterranean).The sequel begins nine months later, when Dann decides to fulfill his dream of exploring the Middle Sea to see for himself the ice-covered continent of Europe and ultimately to confront the demons that assailed him during his trek through the desert. The subsequent narrative expands upon two subjects from the first book: the lust for knowledge that fueled Mara and Dann's transcontinental journey and the drug-stimulated schizophrenia that inexorably worsens Dann's ability to lead, as a reluctant \\"general,\\" the refugees who make up his slapdash army. During Dann's period of incapacity, the task of running the army devolves to a sidekick named Griot; like many messianic figures, Dann requires a loyal administrator to smooth over the public perception of his bipolar outbursts.Although \\"The Story of General Dann\\" will make little sense if you haven't read the earlier book, as a sequel it is both satisfying (tying up loose ends and expanding on earlier themes) and frustrating (leaving just as many loose ends). The book's pacing is admittedly slower and the plot is slighter: this is more a character study than an adventure story. Significant portions of the book deal with Dann's psychological breakdowns, with Griot's hunger for Dann's approval, and with their obsession with finding out as much as they can about the mysteries of the past. This sequel seems, in fact, to be a bridge to a yet-to-be-published finale.Yet Lessing still conveys her preoccupations with the frailty of knowledge and our continual need to recreate the discoveries of the past: \\"it's likes seeing the worlds of ghosts.... We are looking at words that were copied from others, written by people who lived long before them.\\" In an interview with John Freeman, Lessing spoke about this theme: \\"What pains me is that everything the human race has created has happened in the last 10,000 years, you know, and most of it in the recent years. An ice age would just wipe that out. It would. Then we have to begin again then, don't we, which is what we always do.\\" The Mara and Dann books, then, are not simply disturbing fantasies disguised as adventures stories, but parables on the tenuousness and persistence of human civilization."},{"Title":"Story of General Dann and Mara's Daughter, Griot and the Snow Dog: A Novel","review":"General Dann doesn't understand the point of rebuilding because what they achieve will be lost and someone will have to rebuild again someday. Griot wishes Dann would act. The people still love Dann anyway. The book ends.This was the type of book that I finished because I was hoping the ending would be worth it somehow. It wasn't, and I wanted to throw the book across the room when I had finished. The best that can be said is that it embodies Dann's sense of futility in engaging in any action. And boy, does that NOT make for good reading."},{"Title":"Story of General Dann and Mara's Daughter, Griot and the Snow Dog: A Novel","review":"Mrs Lessing continues telling the story of Mara and Dann whom we left at the Farm in Ifrik in \\"Mara and Dann\\". Dann soon returns to the Centre together with Griot - who had been a soldier under General Dann back in Agre - Ali, her daughter Tamar and the snow dog called Ruff. They plan to rescue as many refugees from the south as possible and turn them into the Red Blanket army. At the Centre, they assemble all the technical knowledge left there by the long extinct civilisations of Yerrup because the place is slowly sinking into the marshland. Finally they make their way for a city in the Tundra where they hope to set up a community based on the knowledge the scribes and savants studied and collected at the Centre.It is a slightly disappointing sequel to \\"Mara and Dann\\" which lacks the latter's intensity because the plot is sluggish and less like the adventure the reader enjoyed in the first novel."},{"Title":"Story of General Dann and Mara's Daughter, Griot and the Snow Dog: A Novel","review":"While not as excellent and Mara and Dann, the sequel should also be read, since it reveals the remainder of the long trek of the two."},{"Title":"Story of General Dann and Mara's Daughter, Griot and the Snow Dog: A Novel","review":"Where Mara and Dann is more concerned with survival in a post-second-Ice-Age world, this sequel focuses on the preservation of information --what little of it remains-- against losing odds.Lessing's stripped-down writing style leaves me wanting more sometimes in this novel (which makes it a slightly-less-great read than its predecessor), but by the book's end I wondered if it was meant to mimic Dann's shy attempts at storytelling."},{"Title":"Story of General Dann and Mara's Daughter, Griot and the Snow Dog: A Novel","review":"This is a sequel to Mara and Dann, Doris Lessing's 2002 adventure story about a brother and sister trying to survive in a world where weather rules--and there's a lot of it. As is said of so many sequels, you don't need to have read the first book to get the second-- to simply follow and understand the story, that is. On a deeper level, the reader who hasn't read Mara and Dann, won't get much more out of this story than just that: a story. I'll go even further--without having read at least some of Lessing's voluminous works, I have a feeling this book will seem mighty thin. Themes and philosophies Lessing has been exploring almost obsessively for fifty years are merely touched on here, and it's possible the virgin Lessing reader won't even recognize them sailing by.I'm referring to Lessing's preoccupation with consciousness: individual versus collective consciousness; the evolution of human consciousness (past, present and future); animal and even alien consciousness. She's also still fretting about all the waste and destruction of \\"what we've been landed with\\" (see The Four Gated City). Now she's particularly aggrieved over what we've done to the planet with which we've been landed.Compared to the nonstop perils that Mara and Dann constantly struggled against, not that much happens in the sequel, other than the interactions between the characters. The most interesting of these is the relationship between Dann and Ruff, the snow dog he rescues from drowning as a pup. Lessing has written much about cats, but this is her first foray into dog consciousness. She is rarely sentimental, and makes no exception here--yet I defy readers to remain dry-eyed during certain passages involving Ruff.Little did I know when I picked up A Proper Marriage nearly 35 years ago that I was being introduced to an author whose work would stimulate and nourish me for a lifetime. While this may not be my favorite of her work, I hope nothing I've said will dissuade anyone from reading it,or any of her other more than thirty books."},{"Title":"Story of General Dann and Mara's Daughter, Griot and the Snow Dog: A Novel","review":"After the first novel, \\"Mara and Dan,\\" which was a stimulating foray into the Earth's future, this novel was a disappointment. It seems as if Lessing had a gun held to her head forcing her to write a sequel or else, when in fact she had nothing new to say about these characters or the setting."},{"Title":"Story of General Dann and Mara's Daughter, Griot and the Snow Dog: A Novel","review":"This novel was jumped on in anticipation of picking up my travels with Mara and Dann. Unfortunately Doris Lessing had other plans for a major character. While this book is a good read in that it does allow one to follow onward with a good story, because a major character is missing-the book is not as rich as the first book \\"Mara and Dann\\". Once again we study mental illness in a world unsettled as the darkness of a child's youth always surfaces to haunt him. While Doris Lessing is a wonderful writer, this story could have been told better...more like the first...But its fluidity is missing...Still an all right red."},{"Title":"Java Servlets (Enterprise Computing)","review":"The author obviously knows what he is talking about.

For example, the author spends some time in explaining HTML form submission, and CGI POST and GET methods. These are all very elementary and really only necessary for beginners who have not even written a single CGI program in perl or C. Fortunately, the author does not waste time on quickly introducing JDBC in one chapter, to the point where he actually shows us how to do database connection pooling. A few publicly available articles on servlets miss out this important issue for thread-safe processing of a servlet (where a single servlet can actually handle multiple services at the same time due to the multiple threading nature of servlets). However, one issue that the author does not spend enough time on is maintaining session information. This is very important for writing, for example, a shopping cart servlet for E-commerce."},{"Title":"Java Servlets (Enterprise Computing)","review":"This book not only gives you a great introduction to programming servlets (including hosting and configuration, chaining, etc.) but also delves into related topics such as HTTP tunneling and using introspection to simplify servlet programming. I especially liked the amount of JDBC/RMI information included in the book since many servlets written will want to interface to other Java servers or databases. Having written an article on servlets for BYTE, I was pleased to find this much information packed in the book. My only disappointment is that the author didn't include more on managing state with servlets (e.g. through cookies) and about the future of servlets (covering developments such as Servlet Beans, and the impact, if any, of EJB on the servlet standard). All in all, a great servlet book!"},{"Title":"Java Servlets (Enterprise Computing)","review":"This is a great book on Servlets. I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews on this book.

There is a lot of coverage of JDBC in the book. It is definitely the best book on servlets that I have seen out there. My only criticism of the book is that, while it covers lots of JDBC, it barely covers session management, cookies, and some of the other issues that servlet authors need to be aware of in using the web as a communication medium.

However, there is a lack of thoroughness and research on the authors' part to cover some of the more glaring examples of mispronunciation, most of which are places in the Up Country. For example, there is no mention of the Edgefield County town of Trenton, yet this is one of the most frequently mispronounced names in the state (by the way, it is pronounced &quot;TREN-nun&quot;; the middle &quot;t&quot; is silent).On the other hand, the Laurens County town of Clinton (correctly pronounced as &quot;KLIN-nun&quot; by the residents of that fine town; similar to Trenton - the middle &quot;t&quot; is silent) is mentioned, but incorrectly pronounced by the authors as &quot;KLIN-tun&quot;. In addition, although the authors do point that Lancaster, my hometown, is often mispronounced as &quot;LAN-KAS-ter&quot;, they also miss the point by mispronouncing it as &quot;LANG-kus-tuh&quot;, instead of &quot;LANGK-ester&quot; (spoken almost as one syllable). Such seemingly inconsequential differences are like night and day to the folks who live there. In another case, the authors state that Catawba can only be pronounced correctly as &quot;kuh-TAW-buh&quot;, and definitely not as &quot;kuh-TAH-buh&quot;. Having spent more than 18 years within three miles from the Catawba River, I can assure the authors that both pronunciations are correct, accepted, and are used equally by the residents of Chester, Fairfield, Lancaster, and York Counties, whose boundaries abut this river.There also appears to be a definite Low Country bias towards pronunciation of names and places that end in &quot;er&quot;; (i.e., Chester, Haltiwanger, Eastover, etc.). The authors cite, as the definitive pronunciation, the Low Country habit of slurring &quot;ers&quot; to become &quot;uhs&quot;; (i.e., CHES-tuh, HAWL-ti-WAHNG-uh, EEST-OE-vuh). These pronunciations, unfortunately, couldn't be further from the truth for most South Carolinians. The Low Country dialect is only present in a fairly small segment of South Carolinians; the vast majority pronounce using the hard &quot;er&quot;. Perhaps this provincial view is continuing evidence, by the authors, of the controversial Low Country arrogance that has persisted in South Carolina for all 300 + years of its existence (note: Mr. Neuffer's - pronounced &quot;KNIFE-er&quot;- ancestors were originally from Charleston; Ms. Neuffer's were the LaBordes, also originally from Charleston). At the very least, in cases such as the above, the authors should acknowledge both Up Country and Low Country dialectic pronunciations as being correct, or err to the majority, instead of smugly rendering only one geographic area of the state. More research on the Up Country is recommended, since information on this area in the book is woefully inadequate. A little less name-dropping would be advisable as well.To their benefit, the authors do a very good job to cover most all of the wealth of French Huguenot names that remain in South Carolina and are most often mispronounced by residents and out-of-staters alike. Although the authors do cover some interesting facts of previous place names, such as Prosperity previously being named Frog Level, they miss several other equally prominent ones, such as Great Falls and Flopeye, Ridge Springs and Shake Rag, and Monetta as Who-de-peck. Hopefully, they will be included in later revisions and printings of this book.Acknowledging that an exhaustive book on this subject would be difficult, what the authors have presented here is an extremely readable and interesting book, albeit subjective, for all Palmetto State residents, of all ages. Read the book for what it is - entertainment, not cited historical research - and you will find yourself pleasantly informed. Y'all enjoy....Reviewed by D.

It has 256 pages,most of which consist of an excellent choice of photographs.It is presented in 6 Chapters;BeginningsExubernceWarBlue SkiesHot Wars and Cold WarsandMaturityThere is a substantial index,a list of Picture Credits and 7 Double Page Flight Blueprints , each with a detailed,cut-away illustration with each part identified by a number along with its name or description.To give an idea of the detail given;the Boeing B-52G bomber with cruise missile,has 200 parts identified. Even the Spitfire fighter has 134 parts detailed. In all there are Flight Blueprints for;Spitfire fighterBoeing B-17G bomberMesserschmitt Me-262 jet fighterLocheed Constellation airlinerBoeing B-52G bomber with cruise missileand ,Concorde supersonic airlinerThere are over 300 photographs,all excellent,historical and stunning.As one would expect in a book such as this,the earlier photographs are B&W;,and the more recent are in color.With so much to choose from,it is an extremely difficult to make choices,and only a small sampling could be included.Don't be disappointed if some of your favorite machines have not been included, they can't all be there.When you finish the book ,you can't be but amazed how much of an impact competition,be it for peaceful flight or for wartime advantage ,had in the development of flight machines;and how quickly it all happened.This book is listed here in two versions.The one I have was published by Carlton Books,on August 1,2003.It is ISBN 1-84442-903-2,Hardcover glossy surface plus dustjacket,256 pages,4.29 pounds,11.5 X 11.6 inches,and a List Price of $45.The other one listed is published by Firefly Books,on November 2,2004.

There is not one that I can honestly say that I haven't liked.This one is up there on my list of favorite Nora Roberts books.Not being a person who enjoys horse racing, looking at horses, riding horses, or horses in general, I expected to find this one of my least favorites. However, because of the author, I decided to try and was thrilled I did.Kelsey and Gale and true to life love, what a wonderful combination. What an interesting beginning to find that her mother who she though was dead is alive. It grabbed my attention and kept it through out the whole book.This book is not to be missed."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Once again Nora Robert's give's the reader all they could want from a novel. A truly believable character emerged into the seductive world of horse racing, who wouldn't love it. The plot twists keep you guessing until the very end, while the character's find their way into your heart. You find yourself longing to know what happens next, so read on. It only gets better from here."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"This was my second Nora Roberts novel. I have to admit, I did have a hard time getting started, but once I did, I couldn't put it down. The whole time I was reading it, I kept getting these aweful flash backs of my ex-husbands Grandmother every time they mentioned the Father's Mother. The lies and the deceitfulness, made me depise the woman and made me realize why I despised my ex's Grandmother. Thanks for the great books. I would like to recommend to other Nora Robert's fans, you HAVE to read &quot;Divine Evil&quot;. It has to be the best."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"It arrived timely.

Read the book."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Even though this book has been around for some time, I decided to read it because I am a fan of Nora's books. There are plenty of reviews to give you a good idea what the books about. My intelligence was insulted however, with the last quarter of the book. Particularly, I did not like how it all fell together. Too many people tied to the grandmother was not realistic nor was the police investigations. We must think police are stupid to believe this ending. No one would let the guiltiest of persons to go free. The police would not put it together on their own is a fantasy of it's own. So much better are other books written by Nora Roberts."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Nora Roberts at her best. This book was exciting and suspenseful. Kept me reading for hours.

Until the end you wondered who was behind the deaths.

I guess I was expecting/hoping for her usual violence, murder, mystery, with a love story intertwined package. The \\"mystery\\" was not there - just high school sweethearts reuniting after some time of being forced apart. Underwhelmed by this book - sorry Nora."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.

This book was wonderful, great plot, interesting characters, and more. Like all of the books that I have read by Nora Roberts, this one keeps you coming back for more.

I was surprised at the ending of this book,I was expecting the villian to be who they were. Excellent characters and action,suspense and also I fell in love with a few of the horses that were talked about. Nora, would you write a sequel about Kelsey and Gabe. Love this book. I will be reading more Nora books."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"There's just nothing that I don't like about Nora Robert's writing. She's descriptive without being boring. She pulls you into her stories before you get past the first page. Her plots grab you and her characters hold you.True Betrayals is no exception. The idea of receiving a letter from someone you thought was dead intrigues me. Especially, if it's a parent. And from there the intricate interweaving of family, friend, and enemy relationships leads the reader into a story that you'll remember for a long time.But, of course, the romance between Kelsey and Gabe was the glue that held the story together and kept me reading."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I never knew much about the triple crown until I sat down and read this book. I love the way Nora Roberts develops the characters. I thought the scandalous plot was a little corny, but the overall book is quite well-written and entertaining. A little corniness is okay as long as the plot develops, which it does."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"This is the first Nora Roberts \\"mystery\\" that I have read. In the past I have read her more traditionally romantic books, and I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. There is a breadth of information and a depth of characters here that puts this above many of her other books for me. I was genuinely interested in Kelsey and Naiomi's relationship, and pleased with the way that both of them, and Kelsey's father as well, seem to learn and grow in the course of the book. The supporting characters are also good, and there is enough detail to the descrptions of the world of horse racing to make the story feel realistic.Interestingly enough, I think the weakest character in the novel is Gabe, who seems fraught with contradictions that I think should have bothered Kelsey, given her concern for ethics and rights and wrongs. I am not disturbed by Gabe's background at all, but I am puzzled by the acceptance of him as a \\"gambler,\\" which sometimes seems to feed into some of the stereotypes abotu racing that the novel seems to be trying to contradict.Overall, I think this is a good vacation read. I enjoyed it and will look for mor eNora Roberts books from this sub-genre."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I started reading and thought it was familier. It was so good I kept on reading until I was finished. I had read it before but that was many years ago."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"It's a great book. Really enjoyed it. Kelsey should've been told the truth when she was a little younger/ let her make her decision instead of finding out the way she did."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"This book starts with a woman named Kelsey who is trying to get over her divorce, she gets a letter in the mail and finds out the mother who she thought was dead is really alive. She goes to Naomi's farm and finds out that her mother was in prison for killing a man. She decides to stay go and stay at the farm to get to know her mother, she meets a man and starts to date him. Various things start going wrong and old enemies start coming back. I liked this book; it was a quick entertaining read for me. It's a love story with a little bit of mystery thrown in. It's not just about a romance though it's the story of a woman who is finally learning who she really is. While the heroin meant to go and connect with her mother what she really does is find out how strong she is and what she is capable of. She learns that she can stand on her own two feet and a person's history is not always the way it looks on paper. This is a good book to read when you want to sit back and relax."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Enjoyed the book very much. Fast reading and I always love Nora Roberts novels. Highly recommend this book for your easy reading pleasure."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Nora Roberts does it again - no surprises there. She combines mystery, romance and murder and a good story set in a backdrop of horse racing in the south. It was easy to sit down and get wrapped up in the lives of the characters in this story - I could not get to the next page soon enough. The twistes and turns of this story made it more than just another NR book. Nora Roberts has the ability to weave a tail that can hold you from start to finish - definately worth you time."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I really liked this book. I don't usually read Nora Roberts but this book was worth reading. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"No one is better than Nora Roberts in combining romance and suspense. I absolutely love this novel. I purchased it some time ago in hard back and I have re-read the whole books or only certain passages so many times it is ridiculous. Ms. Robert's character development is so good that any author could take notes and pointers for her. The main characters of Kelsey and Gabe are so well thought out and so well written that by the end of the novel you feel as though they are real people that you have known forever. Roberts brings you into the world of horse racing and you get so involved that you would swear you are working at on of the two ranches featured in the novel. The minor characters are also well thought out and provide complete purpose to the novel. The love story that is the main premise of the book burns slowly and with purpose until the two characters finally collide and fall passionately in love. Roberts does a great job of making them friends first and allowing them to get to know each other. Once they fall in love the support and understanding between the two characters is sweet and incredibly honest and sincere. This is a food read. I whole-heartedly recommend the book for any current Nora Roberts fans or for anyone considering starting to read her books. This is Nora at her finest."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Love her books. Although a little predictable, it was still entertaining.This is a nice vacation book because it is a feel good book. Could of read this book all day."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"This is a story of a mother and daughter who were reunited after 20 + years and the ill feelings between the 2 families. It also has a good look into the horse racing life. Lots of adventure, murder and of course Nora's usual doses of sex and intrigue. It's not the most exciting of her books, but very worth the read."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I love this book! I am a big horse lover, and I have a family member in the racing industry, so this book really caught my attention. If you have any interest in horses, or have ever read a Nora Roberts book, this is a book for you!"},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Ms. Roberts provides a fascinating insight into the world of thoroughbred racing and the human commitment involved in racing.Her characters come to life and it's a pleasure to watch them deal with a truly creative story problem. The setting drew me in as well.This is a solid read that I have enjoyed each of the three times I've read it."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"True Betrayals is yet another hit from Roberts, although this time, she has inserted the unique element of a Thoroughbred farm into the mix. Kelsey, our heroine, is out of sorts with her life, lacking direction or true purpose - insert the long-lost mother, who she previously believed was dead. Gabe, the hero, is a gambler turned breeder, bent on rising above his bad boy past to succeed in his one true passion, horse racing.Gabe and Kelsey share the typical Nora Roberts romance - nothing to scoff at, but with a little dash of humor, and a lot of well-written chemistry, they're drawn together. What sets this book apart is the detailed description of Thoroughbred horse racing, seen from the breeder/owner point of view. Thoroughbred racing is not a subject I claim to know much about, so I don't know if Roberts was accurate in her descriptions or not. What I do know is that there was enough believable detail that the horse racing scene, and horses themselves, were integral parts of the overall storyline; this romance would not have been a success without them.If you're a horse breeder yourself, you may or may not enjoy this book - Roberts is detailed enough that you might find yourself picking apart the details and not paying attention to the story. If you're not, I highly recommend this book to both new and old Roberts fans. The villain is pretty well known from the start, but there is enough suspense to keep you intrigued, and of course, its hard not to fall in love with either Naomi or the horses. Kelsey can get annoying with her constant dwelling on her life purpose, but Gabe is a likeable enough character for both of them. Can't miss with this one."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"This was my first Nora Roberts book. I've had it for a couple years before I had time to start a new book. Once I opened it I was hooked. It has murder, lust, and suspense. It's a total page turner. I finished the book within the week and now want to read other books by her."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"DELIGHTFUL TO READ A NORA ROBERTS' THAT NOT FULL OF REPETITION AND SAME-OLD, SAME-OLD. STORY WAS WORTH READING AND REREADING SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE. CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT MANY BOOKS. SHE PAINTED AN ENJOYABLE PICTURE OF THE RACING WORLD AND FAMILY TIES. THE VILLIAN IS OBVIOUS, BUT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE STORY AND THE CHARACTERS ARE WELL-DEVELOPED AND VERY LIKABLE."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I'm a big fun of N.R.'s work but this book got me!I loved every part of it!Could not stop reading it...When you read too much from one author somewhere in the journey you'll start to identify a pattern in the stories and if you're a \\"fault finder\\" you can be tempted to look for something different ... So there I was at the store looking for a new book to read... tried to look for a different author when the cover of True Betrays caught my eyes and I ended up buying it... anyway I loved. This book is different from the other ones I read from N.R. it was a very nice surprise... the romance was there, but also lot's of family stuff that you can identify with, day by day situations, mystery and everything else you want to see in a good book!Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"This is one special book! Not only has Ms Roberts written a beautiful romance, but what makes this book outstanding is the portrayal of a mother's love and the sacrifices she makes and has made for her daughter. While many, like myself, would have wanted to see the real villain punished for the many misdeeds at the end, the fact that this does not happen only gives the book more strength. Wonderful, Ms Roberts, and thank you for writing this beautiful book."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Kelsey Byden didn't quite know what she wanted to do with her life, but that was before her mother came back from the dead. Soon Kelsey is voluntarily moved from her high end Georgetown apartment and into the new world of Virigina horse farms and the racing elite to be with the mother she never knew -- a mother who spent ten years in prison for a crime she may or may not have been justified in committing. In Virginia Kelsey meets Gabe, a high rolling horse owner with just enough luck on his side to escape a horrible past. Then there's Kelsey's grandmother, who is not pleased with recent developments....The story is entertaining, if not exactly logical in terms of the horse racing details. Kelsey certainly finds herself in the horse world, becoming a spokesperson and budding assistant trainer in the course of several short months. In short, it's a guilty pleasure. If the mother-daughter relationship won't hook readers at the beginning, the developing romance will. After all, it's horses and romance. What better combination is there?"},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"This is a great book. Takes you behind the world of horse racing. Lots of twists and turns. Really enjoyed this book!"},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Definatly a page turner and book to keep you interested (and inside) on these hot summer days. Kelsey and Gabe are easy to like and the story easier to fall into. The characters are real and complex and the overall theme on horseracing and life on a horse farm is endearing and only adds to the overall enjoyment of this book. Highly reccommended to Robert's fans."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I read this novel about 3 years ago when I was a freshmen in high school and I know it may seem a bit advanced for my age at the time but I was totally blown by the plot. Without giving away to much for those who hadn't read I would just like to say that is worth it at and not to pass up based on the reviews of others who didn't like it. Currently I'm in looking into purchasing more novels by Nora Roberts."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"While I loved the drama and action that always accompany a Roberts novel, I was particularly intrigued by the setting of this one. Horse ranches and thoroughbred racing... I was instantly enchanted. Made me yearn for triple crown time.Kelsey has just divorced her husband when she learns that the mother she thought had died 20 years earlier is alive and well in Northern Virginia. Through a muddle of her own feelings, she decides to take an extended vacation of sorts and get to know her mother... and thats where the adventure begins."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I read this book in two day for the simple fact I could not put it down. Kelsey &amp; Gabe, That was the best love story I think I have ever read. I just can't get the book out of my mind."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I think Nora Roberts has a fantasy with horses and horse farms, as we've seen in her books Irish Thoroughbred, Irish Rebel and now True Betrayals which was written in 1996. Unlike the other two, True Betrayals is not pure romantic fiction but a blend of several genres. To me, it was very interesting and kept me amused and entertained for several hours.Kelsey Byden was led to believe that her mother, Naomi Chadwick, had been dead for quite a few years and when she received a letter from her mother asking if she'd come visit her, she was an emotional wreck. It seems the real reason her mother wasn't a part of her life as she grew up was the fact that she had been in prison for killing her lover. Talk about shock value! Kelsey decides to visit her mother to try to come to terms with her emotions - Kelsey had recently divorced and just finding out her dead mother was very much alive was enough to make anyone emotionally unstable and made Kelsey question everything in her life.Naomi has a working horse farm in Virginia and Kelsey goes to try to make sense out of her life. Sounds like a typical plot line, right? Well, sort of, but if Nora Roberts is writing it, you can bet there are a few twists and turns along the way. Like Kelsey being thrown into a situation that could result in another murder.Can the trainer who works for her mother be the answer to Kelsey's broken heart? Can Kelsey ever trust her mother again after being deceived by her for so many years? Will Kelsey ever believe in herself again? I won't give away any of the plot, you'll have to read and enjoy this one for yourself!I do have to say that the plot is not the part of the book that I enjoyed the most - sure there's a little mystery thrown in just to keep things interesting. Sure there is lots of romance and sorting of feelings toward the mother-daughter relationship. But what I enjoyed the most were the descriptions of the horse ranch, the surrounding areas, actual workings of the ranch, etc. Nora Roberts is first rate at painting a very vivid mental image and I found myself slipping off to Virginia and owning a ranch of my own in my imagination while reading this book. The lush green landscape, the openness of the working ranch, the racetrack - ah, it sounded like pure heaven.The plot is very predictable: everyone lives happily-ever-after, mother and daughter are reunited, true love waits for Kelsey, etc., etc. What makes the story enjoyable is the mix that Roberts has perfected - not just pure romance, but a little mystery and intrigue also."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Kelsey Byden thought she knew her life, but was devastated when she received a letter from the mother that she thought was dead. Naomi thought it best since she was in jail for murder, but now that she is out and found a life of her own, she wants to see her daughter. When Kelsey visits her mother at her horse farm, her life changes forever. It is there that she has to come to terms with Naomi, and meets her future in Gabe.This was a well-written book with a lot of information about horses and horse racing. The interaction between Naomi and Kelsey was very intense, but I found the character Gabe lacking."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"&quot;True Betrayals&quot; is a fabulous book that will definitely keep you reading. Kelsey &amp; Gabe are great main characters, both well-developed and likeable.Kelsey has been told for her entire life that her mother died when she was a child, but she finds out differently one day when a letter shows up from her supposedly deceased mother! After getting over the initial shock, Kelsey decides to travel to her mother's thoroughbred farm in Nothern Virginia. Kelsey has to deal with her family's strong disapproval, especially from her grandmother, but decides that she really must meet the woman who gave her life. Kelsey arrives on the farm and slowly begins to bond with her mother and the handsome man who owns the neighbouring farm, Gabe. This story is full of betrayal, sabotage, romance, and excitement. Overall, a highly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I'm a Nora Roberts fan and a horse-lover, so my expectations for this book were high. The book didn't disappoint, providing an entertaining story, strong characters to love and hate, and some mystery as well. Although she obviously did her homework about horse racing and the horse world, there were still inaccuracies that got in the way of my enjoyment of the story. Additionally, I found the analagies and puns about card-playing and roulette and other forms of gambling to be overbearing -- one of those times you just want to say &quot;We get the point, OK? He's a gambler.&quot; Perhaps BECAUSE my expectations were so high, it doesn't rate 5 stars, but still it was a good story and worthy of staying in the bookshelf."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"THIS WAS MY FIRST NORA ROBERTS READ! WHAT A GREAT ONE IT WAS. THE CHARACTERS ARE WELL DEVELOPED AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH KELSEY AND GABE.IT SATISFIED MY OWN LOVE FOR THE HORSE WORLD, LOVE AND MYSTERY! I ACTUALLY CRIED IN THE END AND WAS SAD TO HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE TO THE CHARACTERS!THIS IS A MUST READ. I ONLY WISH NORA ROBERTS WOULD DELIGHT US AND PRODUCE ANOTHER NOVEL DELVING INTO THE FUTURE WORLD OF THE CHADWICKS AND BYDENS, AND NEW SLATER FAMILY."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"This book was aptly named. First, the heroine was betrayed byher family that her mother's dead, when she was actually in prison formurder. When she actually meets her mother, that's when the storypicks up. Though I like horses, the story behind horse racing never really caught my interest. There's a lot of sabotage in the horse racing industry that I never knew about. Nora made it a little more interesting to me. I felt the romance between the hero and the heroine was a bit swift. By the end of the story, the true betrayal will have you saying, &quot;No, it can't be!&quot; The action and drama was enough to keep me flipping the pages."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"I just finished reading True Betrayals and then went and purchased two more of Nora Roberts books. The lady just keeps you wanting to read more and more. Where she gets her wealth of information is a wonder, but she certainly does a fine job. I have yet to read one of her books that I haven't loved. This one fell right in line. If the writer doesn't cry, the reader probably won't either. I wonder if these books get to her in that way. I hope she never quits. I will pass this book on to my reading friends."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"True Betrayals was an exciting story with lots of romance and suspense. One of Roberts' best. It gave me an interesting look into the world of horse racing and an intriguing romance between Gabe Slater and Kelsey Byden and I am a sucker for a good romance. I have a tendency to enjoy her older work more than her current work and right now I'm reading Sacred Sins which has Ben Paris, who is maybe a bit more of a handful than Slater. All in all, a good read. One that's hard to put down."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Excellent story - a real treat and the typical Nora Roberts novel that I have come to love. If you enjoy race horses, romance, adventure and mystery, True Betrayals is your book. To summarize, 26 year-old Kelsey Byden, recently divorced, and definitely raised with the upper crust, receives a letter from a mother she thought was long dead. Her father, Phillip Byden and Grandmother, Millicent raised her to believe that her mother had died when she was a baby. Her grandmother is a hard-core social climber, expecting no less from her granddaughter. Her dad is an English Professor at Georgetown University, very kind and soft-spoken and very much under the rule of his controlling mother. Kelsey confronts her father as he admits that her mother had asked him to tell their daughter (who was only three years old at the time) she died after she was arrested and sent to prison for killing a man. The story begins to unfold as Kelsey decides to meet her mother, Naomi Chadwick, who owns a thoroughbred horse farm, Three Willows, in Virginia. There, Kelsey connects immediately, heart and soul, creating a new life, one of hard work, long days and many rewards, completely opposite the elite socially correct life her grandmother expects of her. She falls head-over-heels with the horses and begins to understand and become attached to the mother she never even knew existed. Along with this new life comes a new love, rugged Gabe Slater, a man raised on the wrong side of the tracks by a dead-beat father. Gabe is a gambler and has overcome the odds to make something of him and his horse farm, Longshot. The more Kelsey is drawn to the life of a thoroughbred caretaker, the more she is determined to delve into the somewhat vague facts of her mother's trial 23 years ago. Some things come full circle and along with the excitement of the Kentucky Derby and the race at Belmont, all leading to a Triple Crown event for one of Gabe's prize horses, Double or Nothing, comes murder, blackmail and cut throat tactics by men who are willing to do anything to win the golden purse. Connections of murder and greed begin to unravel in both past and present occurrences. True Betrayals is a story that keeps the reader hooked until the very last page. The characters are completely likeable and the storytelling comes with many surprises. It's a book that is hard to put down, leaving the reader sorry to see it come to an end."},{"Title":"True Betrayals","review":"Though I enjoyed Nora Roberts' novels, I took a sabbatical from them as too often one novel had too many similarities with the next. Needing escapism reading, I picked up some of her books again. I have found the same issue with some of the trilogies, but True Betrayals stands on its own. Characters are well developed. When trouble occurs in two of the horse farms, the culprit or culprits are not obvious and do not become apparent until revealed later in the book. There is a well developed connection between characters. I think it is one of her better novels and highly recommend it to anyone - especially Roberts fans."},{"Title":"Microsoft Ole Db 2.0 Programmer's Reference and Data Access Sdk (Microsoft Professional Editions)","review":"This book is simply a bound version of the VC help on OLEDB 2.0. However, it is so lame that it does not cover any of the new Consumer templates which are included with VC6. If you already have VC6, then I would NOT reccommend this book. The Templates provided with VC6 are very powerful, but VERY poorly documented. However, this book will not remedy the problem. Also, what code examples there are(VERY few), are rarely correct in their syntax. In my mind, that is unacceptable in a book that is supposed to help you in using new, cutting-edge technology. The opnly good thing about the book is that it does cover the data type enums and other various enumerated types. This is nice, since it is difficult to find adequate help on these topics using the online help.Overall, I believe this is NOT the book to get if you want to use OLEDB 2.0!"},{"Title":"Microsoft Ole Db 2.0 Programmer's Reference and Data Access Sdk (Microsoft Professional Editions)","review":"I'm pretty new to DataBase programming, and this book is taking me nowhere.

The first 254 pages provides the model and descriptive information. The rest is the OLE DB Reference. The book is more ungainly to handle than the earlier OLE DB 1.1 Programmer's Reference and SDK (which was only 700pp, including 165pp of description).The CD-ROM has quite a bit of material and for me is the most valuable part of the combination, even though much of it is available separately through Microsoft Web sites and other product CD-ROMS. The README.TXT provides this information:&quot;The Microsoft Data Access Components CD contains the 2.0 release of the Microsoft Data Access Components (ADO, OLE DB and ODBC) so you can begin developing solutions today. In addition to the technology contained on this CD, white papers and other documentation is included to help you get started.&quot;There are 41.5 MB of material on the CD-ROM.A 5.33MB directory in Help-file Format includes an on-line version of the specifications and documentation for the SDK. The HTML HELP Format requires that you have IE 4.0x or that you install the Help viewer that will operate with the Microsoft *.chm help-file format. You can access the documentation on the CD-ROM or copy it to your own system for usage. Documentation covers several OLE DB 2.0 providers and a toolkit for rolling your own simple providers. There is also documentation for OLE DB Test Tools and Samples. Since the complete OLE DB 2.0 specification is included here in a searchable, HTML-formatted cross-linked form as a hyperdocument, this is a valuable substitute for the book and appears well-integrated with the SDK and supplemental documentation.The promised supplemental information and white papers include a conformance testing suite and guidelines for achieving a desirable level of conformance."},{"Title":"Microsoft Ole Db 2.0 Programmer's Reference and Data Access Sdk (Microsoft Professional Editions)","review":"The Microsoft Ole Db 2.0 Programmer's Reference and Data Access Sdk is an occasionally useful guide to using this particular piece of technology and access method, particularly when you are playing around with database servers, or were playing around with database servers at the time.Done in the usual Microsoft reference book style."},{"Title":"Microsoft Ole Db 2.0 Programmer's Reference and Data Access Sdk (Microsoft Professional Editions)","review":"Please stop emailing me about books on OLE DB, I have NOT found any better books.

He not only has thousands of entries in each half of the dictionary (English-Amharic, Amharic-English), he also gives extensive notes on grammatical usage, such as whether an Amharic verb takes a direct object suffix, or an indirect object suffix. The entries cover a wide variety of topics: tools, holidays, body parts, etc. There are other dictionaries available, but they are very difficult to find in most countries: Dr. Amsalu Aklilu's excellent work published in Ethiopia and Ahmed Zekaria's published in India. Kane's 2 vol. Amharic- English dictionary is too expensive for most people, and has no English-Amharic section. If you need an Amharic-English-Amharic dictionary, this is a fine book.

I was rather fascinated by the deep rich culture. This dictionary is just plain amazing. It includes both English-Amharic and Amharic-English sections, and utilizes the actual Ethiopian alphabet and phonetic guide.For an English speaker, I would recommend getting copy of the alphabet displayed in grid format, and run though memorization of the alphabet with an indigenous speaker.

So, it is an invaluable help in understanding anything written in Amharic. It is very good that one not has to learn the Amharic alphabet to use the English-Amharic part; all words are written in full using the Latin alphabet, describing the sound of the words.

Wolf Leslau was a pioneer in Ethiopic studies and this dictionary is one of the most enduring monuments to his amazing lifetime of work. Pluses include a very reliable system of phonetic transcription to complement (rather than replace) the Amharic writing system, a very nice and readable Amharic typeface, and portability with this paperback edition. Students coming to Amharic from other Semitic languages, beware of one thing: the 'q' used in the system of transcription is not the Arabic 'qaf' (although Amharic loanwards from Arabic with 'q' morph into the Amharic 'q', which is an ejective consonant, of which in Amharic there are several.

In fact, it's a &quot;must have&quot; for your web library. Adobe hit a home run when it released the program, but if Dan didn't get a grand slam with ImageStyler in Depth, I don't know what would. I teach web design and web graphics on a daily basis, and Dan's book shortend my learning curve considerably. I think so much of this book, I'm buying copies for my students and distributing them in class. Get it. You won't be disappointed. Maybe the best features of the book are in the back.

Its CD ROM adds some useful demos, styles and shapes, but the b/w appendices of thumbnails is not all that useful. Some important Imagestyler techniques are missed altogether (esp. Aliasing), and the book starts with the classic 'Here are the program's menus and icons...' this is what they stand for', which overwhelms the reader with the software's commands, instructions and menus from the beginning before moving on. There is slightly too much digression as well in my view, and it is padded out with some pointless illustrations.

Walters' leadership style and approach closely mirrors my own. While the book is very short and compact, the lessons and principles are vast and timeless. There are quotable passages throughout the writing, and while the approach is simple, it is far from simplistic. Walters breaks up leadership into what it is and what it is not. For example, he notes that leadership is not an ego game, but it is responsibility, self sacrifice, service, loyalty, intuition, flexible, action oriented, supportive and mentoring. Each of these topics is discussed in a separate chapter, with each chapter neatly summarized in a series of rules to live by.The other emphasis made by Walters is that leadership is an art, not a science - and perfection is a direction not an attainment. These concepts emphasize continuous improvement, but understanding - a trait that many leaders need to develop.A great little book that belongs in any library."},{"Title":"The Art of Supportive Leadership","review":"I saw this book at a local Barnes and Nobles and was going to pick it up, but figured I'd be better off getting the Kindle version.This book is a great handbook for any would be leader, its simple, short and to the point, no non-sense.

I highly recommend getting this book."},{"Title":"Guide to Southern California Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"The book is really helpful if you want to go for a family off-road trip. Has detail information and definetly worth the money."},{"Title":"Guide to Southern California Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"This is the third of Mr. Wells' books that I have purchased. As best I can tell, all have been spot on in their detail as of the time that they were written. Unfortunately, politics and weather can cause some rapid changes. Mr. Wells usually makes comments on this and he can't be blamed for something that he cannot control. Make sure to check the current route conditions before you go or you may be disappointed to find that it is closed.My reason for giving the book only 4-stars is that there is little ancillary information given about the routes. There is a bit of information about mines and photo opportunities along the routes but I was hoping for a bit more information. Knowing why and when the routes were built would be nice knowledge to have."},{"Title":"Guide to Southern California Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"The content is great. Very easy to follow, distances are +/- .1 mile in my experience. However, before you even open the book, take it to Staples and get it spiral bound. It only costs about $5.00, and keeps the pages from flying out of the jeep when the wind picks up."},{"Title":"Guide to Southern California Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"I offroad a modified Jeep. I only use fireroads as highways to get to the fun stuff. And then it's airdown, disconnect and slap that baby into 4Lo. This book is a good one for everyone who needs good way points and a little background on the local trails. It is conservative. I think that's a good idea. Some trails listed as difficult were not a problem for my Jeep when it was stock. (But then again, it's a Jeep.) I would prefer a book be conservative rather than see some less than capable vehicles or less than experienced drivers get out there and get into trouble. As for flaws, trails change with weather and popularity. This book has been a good friend. Especially in the middle of the night when we lost the entrance to John Bull. (Ok, one flaw...needs to be spiral bound. My pages have all come undone in the current form.)"},{"Title":"Guide to Southern California Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"This book is very detailed and the content is excellent. There are two main flaws. The first, the quality of the book binding is some of the worst I have ever seen. Forget taking the book with you on the trail. I have now had two of these books and both times the book fell apart with casual use within the first two times of flipping through it for trails.Although the appendix does give phone numbers for the forestry service offices for the various trail areas, the biggest problem is many of the trails in this book are closed indefinitely (more than just seasonal closures) according to the forestry offices. This is not a fault of the book, but a result of the southern california fires. The desert roads are mostly open, but forget the mountain and foothill routes for a while. Great book, but be aware before you buy that many of these routes are not legally accessible anymore."},{"Title":"Guide to Southern California Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"Here's another great book from Charles Wells to make four-wheeling less a stressful shot in the dark and more fun. When you can put more of your attention on the \`wheeling, the scenery and the companionship of friends and family, and less to not getting lost, the trip is always more enjoyable. I've used and reviewed all of Well's books and this one lives up to his usual high standard of accuracy, utility and value. In most cases, I've had a chance to take the book on a trip and spot check Well's work. I've almost given up trying to catch a mistake... because I haven't yet!. While I'm way too far east right now to spot check this time, I know parts of the area covered in this book very well and in those areas, I know he hit a bulls eye. The best part of Well's guides is the value for dollar. There's a lot of info packed into these books, from basic vehicle and trip prep, a primer on off-highway driving as well as specialized tips on the local areas. There's also a section on GPS and, of course, the maps and routes to some of the best four-wheeling SoCal has to offer. Guide to Southern California Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails is the fifth book by Wells on some of the best four-wheeling areas in the USA. May yours become as dog-eared and trail dusty as mine have become!"},{"Title":"Guide to Southern California Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"Very good book with easy to read maps and detailed information about the backcountry driving roads. The binding is terrible and the book starts to fall apart during the first use and deteriorates. After two returns, we resorted to buying a 3-ring binder, hole punched all the pages and use the book this way."},{"Title":"Guide to Southern California Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"This is a great book for off-roading! My husband, our 2 golden retrievers and I have been on many of the trails. All the mileage markers are right on and easy to follow (especially if you have a GPS system). One MAJOR flaw in the book is it's terrible binding. Our first book literally fell apart on the second use, only held together by a big rubber band. I bought another one (is this the author's intention, you think?)and after receiving it, immediately took it to Kinko's where they spiral bound it for under $5.00 in just 5 minutes. It's even better than the original, because it will lay flat for easier use. I've purchased a total of 4 of these (for other off-roading friends!)."},{"Title":"Guide to Southern California Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"I agree with the other posters- the book is made very poorly.

I have gone to many of the places in the book since I bought it, many of which I did not even know about.

I don't have any issues with the toughness of the book, it looks and feels just like any other paperback of it's size that I have. I guess time will tell whether it falls apart faster, I don't know. For the price (currently 16) I have no problem with the quality at all though. Recently I was out quad riding with the family in the Truckhaven area of Ocotillo Wells. We came across an older couple in a Jeep and talked to them for a bit. The guy was telling me about this book he had and he went and got it and sure enough it was the same book I just bought. He said he's been using it for years, which by the highlighting he had in it I didn't doubt. The structural quality of it seemed great, it was more used and flexible than my brand-new book but nothing was coming apart at all. I asked him about his experience with the trail accuracy and he said it's been great, he's had no problems at all. Now I'm sure he hasn't ridden every SoCal trail in this book and I don't doubt there are some issues with some of the trails, as other reviewers have stated, having changed some over the years. But he's clearly don't a lot of 4-wheel driving with it, especially in the Anza-Borrego area, and really liked the book. That made me feel very good about my purchase and I'll make sure to keep the book with me on our drives."},{"Title":"Guide to Southern California Backroads & 4-Wheel Drive Trails","review":"This is a GREAT book. I have ridden on most of the trails, from Arrowhead, Big Bear to the Anza Borrego Dersert. With variety this wide, you can ride all year long, deserts in the winter, mountains in the summer.

I think I own every book Charles Wells has published. The information contained in these books is definitely the best you can buy. The trail descriptions, maps and helpful tips are invaluable when you are out on the trail. We have certainly enjoyed putting these books to good use.My two Colorado books and especially the Moab book are dog-eared and well worn from many happy days on the trails. I too was surprised when pages fell out of the California book. I called the 800 number listed in all of the books and was surprised when the author answered the phone. I can tell you he was genuinely embarrassed by the quality problems in this printing. He told me he has since changed printers and the way the books are bound. He immediately offered to send me a new copy from the new printing at no charge! I asked if he had ever thought about a spiral bound version. He liked the idea and sent me a custom-made spiral bound version, and only asked that I let him know what I thought.Mr. Wells, I wanted to tell you publicly that your customer service is the best I have ever encountered! My navigator, who is also my wife, said she really likes the spiral bound version and she hopes you bring those out for all your books.

I like the way the lessons are written out-very easy to understand and to follow. It is a book for beginners, which is exactaly what i needed. When I look at my flamenco videos now, I can better understand what the foot work the dancers are performining.

I am very happy with the beginner book."},{"Title":"Flamenco Basics","review":"This 14.95 PAMPHLET is totally overpriced. This zine is so basic that its almost not even like learning flamenco at all. Its a bit like trying to learn flamenco from someone who studied it by watching a video tape frame by frame and is trying to describe the steps to you. The castenets section looks usable, but then i do not know how to play the castenets. Also irritating is the fact that its not worth 14.95! At 3 dollars, this would be a decent extremely general introduction to the dance,...its a total ripoff. The wait time is probably so that the printer can run off a copy on threr inkjet machine and send it out. (its a PAMPHLET!) ps yes i take flamenco classes, hoping this would be a good complement.

Now again, if you have already taken flamenco classes this book is useless.

If so, hes got a lot to live up to as this is an excellent work!The author begins as Earth's first manned interstellar craft \\"Asia\\" is about to reach its target star system. Shortly after reaching orbit, \\"Asia\\" suddenly looses contact with Earth. After a little research the crew discover they are stranded. It appears a test of a spacecraft engine similar to theirs blew up in Earth orbit.At this time, the story breaks into two segments. One is the \\"Asia\\" commander's efforts to figure out exactly what happened back home by sending the young slacker Peter Zolotin back in an exploration satellite called \\"Traveller\\". While Zolotin flys home, civil war breaks out between the long term inhabitants of \\"Asia\\" and a scientific team that were pulled out of suspended animation upon entry into the new star system.Although the story is short, the author does an excellent job of developing the characters. At times one of the segments of the stroy line will slow down but the other one more than takes up the slack when this happens. All in all a good first showing.I read this book many years ago and it appears the book is out of print. Take it from me, its worth it to search hard for this gem!"},{"Title":"Burster","review":"This variation on a post-apocalyptic tale has battling factions amongst the last humans trying to make a go at colonizing a not terribly friendly system.

For example, on page 10, Mr. Wilkins says:&quot;Users who decide to hide software by renaming the EXE file will have no luck in their attempt to avoid detection, as the file header won't lie. Files can also be collected and then stored on the site server. (Ouch! I guess noontime game playing is out.)&quot;This passage has a few problems. First, it's trying to describe a nuance of software inventory that doesn't belong in the introduction. Second, the file collection idea is out of context here. Last, of course, the first person comment about games is not only silly, but in bad taste.The book, at least the portions I got through before returning it, is filled with things like this. Cute comments can be distracting to a serious reader. Here's another (page 2):&quot;...SMS works tirelessly in the background, providing administrative support, and to the best of my knowledge, it will not ask for a raise or quit on you suddenly.&quot;Get serious - SMS is simply a product; it doesn't deserve to have personality ascribed to it. These attempts at casual tone are far too overt and serve no purpose.Another obvious problem is a relatively shallow depth of understanding. How about this quote (page xvii):&quot;For years, [Novell's] IPX protocol had been the standard in the computer industry.&quot;Right there I question just about everything else in the book, which has the feel of being generated based on other documents rather than real experience. You have to dig to find hard facts, and dig further to find those facts accurately described or applied.For this book, I'd wait for the second edition if you're looking to actually be an SMS administrator. It may be okay for non-administrators who are interested in the topic, but other titles are sure to give more concrete information to admins who are in the trenches day to day."},{"Title":"Administering SMS","review":"I am managing a SMS Site.

They have to hit the market asap after the release of a software- or they are outdated (especially with MS) in 6 months. But it did lack a good editor.The author does give conflicting info, and also try to find specifics in the book! What is the chipset that is the minimum required by MS! He mentions in passing maybe a 166? Then states you need a 450. Well which is it. He could have used a better format as other books do- state the required MS hardware, then give the recommended real life needs. He also goes of on tangents that are not imperative to my knowledge of SMS- why explain for pages Windows 2000 and it's use of trees, forests... etc.The book is not a quick read- I want something that says what SMS is, what it will do, and how to do it in the fewest words possible. I have a stack of books to read and by gosh don't need filler! This book could easily have been half the size it is, and not lost the content.Ok it is also not something I would consider remotely being a book to pass the MS exams either. There are better books for that.Basically, if you have time to just read about SMS, the book is good info. But it is not concise in it's approach.

I was in high school in New Jersey in the early '70's and had friends in Harlem so I visited often. To read such a vivid portrait of a young life at that time in New York City felt real for me. Claude Brown's writing influenced me at an early age. This work is a masterpiece and will stand the test of time."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"I highly recommend this book. It tells the story of the post World War II Black American urban experience through the eyes of a very smart, confident Black 8 year old. In many ways this book reminds me of Mark Twain's Huck Finn. In both books, very clever, independent young American boys take the world as it is and they push to assert themselves and they are man child's with a great sense of adventure.While other reviewers have noted the harsh, violent incidents of the book, I felt it was more balanced. Claude Brown's New York City of the 1940s and 1950s was certainly a rough place, especially when hard drugs were coming in, but it was also tough and loving in a good way. Claude Brown had tough teachers in his public school that cared about him and there was also a truant officer that would chase after Claude and the other boys who were skipping school. This White truant officer was one of my favorite characters in the book and Claude took great interest in him as a very important enemy. Claude cautioned the other boys who wanted to skip not to try to outrun this White truant officer - because he had great foot-speed (got to admire a White guy with the courage to out run and chase down and catch Black boys in their own Harlem neighborhood :-)I also enjoyed seeing the different Black cultural mix in Harlem from Blacks in the rural South to street savvy urban Blacks. Claude Brown's father isn't in to politics or hustling, he came to the city for economic opportunities and generally respects the social order of police, teachers, job bosses. Claude's father used to have to beat little Claude to get him to go to school, then later in life Claude wants to go to do graduate school work instead of taking down a steady paying job. This just doesn't fit with the country values of Claude's father.In any event, this book takes you into the heart and soul of Black urban America and it isn't propaganda - it shows Black American culture with all of it's dirty laundry. The ghetto can be a rough place, we need good, strong tough people to clean up these places and make them safe, good places for smart, adventuresome boys like Claude or a Huck Finn."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"loved this! cant believe they make you write more it totally seems pointless! but this is a good book :)"},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"Got this book for a penny and shipping - best penny i spent on a great classic - love the fact that u can get older books at such a great price such a great deal!!!"},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"This is an awesome book and I thought that I would never find it, but was so happy that I did because it was in wonderful shape."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"I like reading this kind of material as it gives insight to a way of life that I am not familiar with."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"&quot;Manchild in the Promised Land&quot; is a rare achievement: an autobiography written in clear, lucid prose without an ounce of self-pity, self-justification, or moralizing. While Claude Brown's life was difficult, dangerous, and violent, and he shows all of that in unflinching detail, he also recalls much of his childhood with pleasure and a good measure of pride that he survived.Most of all, for me, Brown's memoir is filled with regret for the many from his Harlem neighborhood who died, victims of crime, poverty, alcoholism and drug addiction. Indeed, one could say that one of the major characters of his story is heroin, which Brown describes as the scourge of his generation. The power of heroin to destroy is most poignantly described in Brown's recounting of his relationship with his younger brother. Claude took his responsibilities as an older brother seriously, but his younger brother fell victim to addiction, and Brown was forced to admit that he had lost him.As the book develops, an interesting change occurs in Brown's narrative voice. In the early stages, he describes with a defiant pride his wild exploits as a child and adolescent, which landed him in juvenile homes, and nearly got him killed. As he describes himself getting older and he eventually leaves Harlem, Brown's voice takes on a mixture of affection and regret as he talks about going back to the neighborhood and seeing old friends, many of whom had fallen on hard times.In the end, Brown's story is one of achievement. While he escapes the poverty of his youth, he refuses to forget his roots. In this sense, &quot;Manchild&quot;'s spiritual descendant is Sandra Cisneros' great novella, &quot;The House on Mango Street,&quot; whose main character realizes that one must &quot;go away to come back.&quot; Brown forges an inspirational story that overcomes despair in its power to shape memory and find meaning in a difficult life."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"This was without doubt the most important book I read as a teenager. I moved to NYC from California when I was twelve and was pretty naive in the workings of the city. Reading this book when I was 13 helped me immensely. It was a street-wise primer for survival at the time (we're talking 1964). But I would hold that the subject matter is just as relevant today. If you don't know about a &quot;Jones&quot; or what makes a three-card-monty mark want to come back for more, then I suggest you are just as vulnerable as I was. It's also one of the all-time cautionary tales (without being preachy) about drug addiction. I did a lot of drugs in the late 60's, early 70's, but never touched heroin, primarily from reading this book. The writing, while maybe not on the level of Richard Wright, surpasses Malcom X's and Eldridge Cleaver's memoirs, and that's saying something, as those were both powerful works as well."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"Claude Brown's slightly fictionalized autobiography recounts his childhood and early adulthood throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Manchild in the Promised Land also documents the changing atmosphere of Harlem and the people it affected. Brown tells stories of himself as a hell-raiser, involved in theft and drug dealing, and spending time in juvenile detention centers like Wiltwyck and Warwick. He was able to establish a feared and respected name for himself both among the streetwalkers of Harlem and the inmates of the reform schools. Lacking formal education (resulting from years of playing hooky) and idolizing the criminal elements around him, he seemed to be heading down a short road of vice and danger.Only after Brown moved to Greenwich Village shortly before turning twenty was he able to begin viewing Harlem with a more objective eye, and see the factors that led him down the downward spiral he had been traveling. One of the main reasons Brown believes he and his friends were wrought with such violence and recklessness is due to the mentality imported by their parents from the South. The thing that mattered most to them was fighting: for one's money, girl/family, and manhood (Brown 260). He feels that that rural mentality had been brought to a crowded city life that was not only incompatible with the setting, but also destructive. He laments, \\"it seems as though if I had stayed in Harlem all my life, I might have never known that there was anything else to life other than sex, religion, liquor, and violence\\" (Brown 281).As a youth, Brown excelled in these very base attributes. It wasn't until the introduction of heroine, or \\"horse,\\" as it was first introduced in the early 1950s, that he feels Harlem truly became unable to cope with their values. Instead of young men fighting for honor, they were killing and robbing for money to sustain their overwhelming addictions, introducing more guns into the neighborhood with desperate people wielding them. He witnessed his friends begin to fade away into scratching, nodding junkies. However, by this time Brown was able to leave and slowly break away from the crumbling Harlem he once knew, watching from afar many of the individuals he once hustled with fall victim to the crimes they themselves would perpetrate.Many opted instead to stay in Harlem and live the street life. He attributes this to the attitudes of whites outside Harlem and the racism they encountered. To live a \\"clean\\" life usually meant to work for a white man who underpaid, referred to them in a racially derogatory manner, and made them perform the most labor intensive tasks. When it came to these prospects, most understandably chose the life of a self-employed drug dealer in Harlem over the self-effacing menial work elsewhere, despite the danger (Brown 287).Where some people turned to drugs or religion to deal with these problems, Brown found his calling through more established and secular means. Education and music became outlets for him to express himself, gain a self-pride through non-criminal means, and eventually lead to a promising career as a lawyer and author.One of the things that make this autobiography interesting is its use of language. Brown writes in a notable street dialect, however, the language itself evolves with the character. For instance, \\"cat\\" slowly comes into use around page 67 and is used throughout, though it receives less use towards the end. More notably, on page 109 the young Claude begins idolizing a street pimp named Johnny: \\"To Johnny, every chick was a b*tch. Even mothers were b*tches.\\" And so on page 114 Brown writes \\"Jackie was a beautiful black b*tch.\\" From then on women are regularly referred to as \\"b*tches\\" until the character matures enough to treat women with more respect, and Johnny's spell seems to have completely worn off by the time Brown falls in love with a fellow student. Likewise, the sentence structures become less erratic and grow in sophistication as the book goes on, using less slang chapter by chapter when he begins to change. This seems to be by design.Claude Brown's personal accounts are no doubt fictionalized to some degree, for his characters go on exhaustive speeches several times, and he certainly didn't tape record them for every word. However, Brown's intentions are to present Harlem and its difficulties in approachable and creative ways. To allow readers (such as white-suburban-me) an inside look into the ways of urban life it invites an understanding and, hopefully, sympathy for the situations of the junkies, prostitutes, and drug dealers that we pass on the street. He shows them in a way that cannot be easily neglected, in intimate, personal relationships that reveal the influences and regrets that have placed them in those situations. These factors were not unique to the 1940s and 1950s. They existed before and do so today. Brown allows insight into the hardships while telling an encouraging tale of one who made it out. By personal drive and education, through art and self-expression (as this book is), he shows that the situation is not dire, but attitudes must change before the world will follow."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"this book changed my life in a way... not that i have similar experiences or grew up in that time because i'm only 24. This was an excellent book all the way but it did a little more for me. This is one of those books that touched me and will always get praise. My mother was an addict and up until i read this book i held a grudge because she left me at the age of 5. This book made me understand the mind of an addict and that she would have probably the best mother in the world if it were not for the drugs. I understood the control drugs had over people and my mom. The book wasnt just about drugs but you can overcome and rise from the evils of the world. But for me this book made me forgive my mother."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"This is one classic Harlem Renaissance autobiography that is simply well constructed. Brown is a masterful genius in that he does not sugarcoat his life experiences with prolific and monstrous words, but rather gives the reader an indepth view of what life was like in the ghetto of Harlem, New York. Moreover, Brown emphasizes the essential theme of this story over and over again to the reader and even proves it by becoming a successful lawyer despite the fact he came from a torn-broken ghetto induced with violence, sex, and drugs.This novel is a must read for all ages and it gives the reader a chance to get inside the mind of a brillant person who overcame a number of economic, racial, and personal obstacles to become a leading attorney in New York. In short one can soon surmise that this autobiography is one of the rarest of its kind and holds the attention span of the reader with much thrill, suspense, and excitement. It is truly a timeless classic with many great assets."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"Mr. Brown has written a novel that brings home to all that have been raised in a big city how some have it tougher than themselves. I was raised in the same era in Detroit but it was a different experience. Hard drugs had not arrived on the white streets yet. Crime was at the fringes of our society and some youths did, some didn't. At the conclusion of the novel I was sincerely touched as he thought of his friends that hadn't made it and the the ones that had. We all have surely had the same thoughts and I sometimes wonder of the few of us that did well in our lives how many of the others didn't receive the same breaks. They were still our friends, and would be today if we seen them. They live forever in our minds and hearts and we do hope for the best of a good life, at least close to what we have had but there are probably more sad storys than not,better we don't know the pain could be to great. A striking novel and I will recommend to all I know."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"At the beginning of Manchild, Claude Brown describes how Harlem came to be populated by people of color. He continues by describing how he struggled with and adapted to this enviornment and eventually escaped it. This reads like a story of alienation and exile and the author's struggle to find the place where he fit and was comfortable.I enjoyed reading this book, but was left wondering if Claude Brown ever found his niche. Where did he land? Did he ever find a place that felt like home? He talks at the very end about how much he loved the street life of Harlem, but that he hadn't lived there for several years at the time of writing.I'd like an update of where the Manchild is now, what he's doing and how Harlem looks to him 50 years later---a sequel perhaps?"},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"Reading Man Child in the Promised land is inspiring. It is a story about hopelessness, and struggle. It is a story where a man who shouldn't go anywhere but to jail, or a one way road to hell finds his way out of Harlem, and makes to a law school. The book explains everything in detail though, it is sensed that Mr. Brown doesn't really regret what he did because it got him where it did, and as such is an inspiration for other black boys in the ghetto, knowing that they can amount to something better.This is one of the few stories that brought me to tears for reasons other then sadness."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"This beautiful piece of work was written in 1965, but seems to flow from the pages of yesterday's NY Times. I've purchased adleast 30 copies and just given them away-It rivals anything done by Baldwin, Wright or Ellison. Manchild is an ideal introduction to the world of words and must reading for the planet Earth!"},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"Although this book was written in the 1960s, it is, still, very relevant today. This book was recommended to me back in 1983 or 1984 when I was in the military. I bought it with a number of other books. It took me twenty years to read it. I should have read it alot sooner; but, the rigors of life and the fact that a good many other books I bought kept pushing this one further back on the reading list. I grew up in the streets of NYC and saw his life being played out in a number of guys and gals I hung out with at that time. I didn't get caught up in the drug scene nor in the gangsta scene but, like the author, there was a lot going on outside the walls of the house to keep me outside nearly all day. Yeah this world was much newer for me then rather than now but I had to see what was going on within and without my neighborhood. As a parent looking at my kid, I know this world is new to them, which I can't shelter them from. As my kids look at me as their parent, they are constantly telling me to get out of their way. I want to see what is going out there. This only helps me to keep life real for them with a dose of non-reality here and there. Fortunately for Claude Brown, the street made him wise and through his book some of us can reminesce about those days and explain to others what urban life was like for us and how it made us what we are today. For others who have not experienced this urban lifestyle, take the book for what it is and re-evaluate your own experiences in hopes of passing on a reality check of your own life to your children."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"Manchild in the Promised Land is a classic and great read about growing up in Harlem and overcoming the obstacles of growing up in a neighborhood of crime and apathy.."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"Such an amazing, hardcore look at the trappings of the inner city.

The book served as an uncompromising indictment of society and my choices, and how they both failed me.Mr. Brown like myself, lived a very rough life, and it was through the navigation of the day to day hysteria that lessons were to be learned. This title was the first of its kind in my life up to this point which caused me to look at myself real closely and wonder what my life was to become.Like my autobiography \\"Survivor\\" I Changed the Rules Part 1, Mr. Browns life story is inspiring, and disturbing, but too real to be ignored.This was a very great read! for almost close two decades I can honestly say i've read the book atleast 8 times."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"I'd recommend this to anyone young person in America.

It is a well told story of one's transition from being a boy to a man while trying to survive an break out of Harlem's trap. I had some trouble getting interested in the book in the beginning but once I did, I couldn't put it down. Realistic and compelling."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"This book for me is the most startling and important autobiography regarding black inner city life even when compared to Malcom X's. When I was a teenager growing up in the inner city in the eighties, the older black middle class generation spoke to us &quot;youngbloods&quot; as if we invented crime. The sickness of self hate, envy, disrespect in our community existed for a long time before it became fashionable to parade these ailments in front of mass media for profit. Manchild details these problems through a teenager growing up in the fourties in an inner city environment who luckily makes a turn for the better at the right time before becoming an adult. This is an American story, not just a black one, and one that details why blind conservative patriotism and easy fix liberal solutions still continue to be difficult to swallow for youth attempting to survive an institutionalized system designed to almost guarantee their failure in life."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"When this book came out in 1965, the NAACP's magazine &quot;The Crisis&quot; and other middle-class blacks criticized this book because it's raw and unsentimental portrait of ghetto life was seen as threatening to the entry of Black Americans into mainstream positions in America at the time. Too bad so many people tuned out it's message. Many of the things Claude Brown spoke of in this book about the Harlem of the mid-20th century came to pass in far more communities than Harlem (massive drug addiction, lunatic Black nationalist cults, massive disrespect of women, mindless violece, etc). Had more people listened to Claude Brown (RIP) at the time, perhaps Black America may have united to rid our communities of these evils instead of irrelevant &quot;issues&quot; like the Confederate Flag so that these things would not have become the plauge that they are today. As George Santayana said, &quot;Those who don't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&quot;"},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"Brown leaves no stone unturned when it comes to his life in New York. The Howard University graduate covers the story of the first generation of Southerners (his parents) that left to New York-the \\"promised land\\" where they expected to enjoy equality and prosperity. Instead, they were forced to deal with overcrowded living spaces and violent ghettos. He paints a picture of his rugged coming of age with vivid recollections of how he gained his rep as a brawler, the friendships gained and lost due to drugs and violence, as well as his fight to escape the seemingly hopeless condition that Harlem was trapped in at the time. After surviving run-ins with the law, brutal fights and the ravages of drug abuse, one can only hope to have half the mental toughness that Brown had to rise above his circumstances."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"Claude Brown quite literally puts his life time between the paper's line[just to quote Mobb Deep] exposing us to the world of Harlem circa the early 1950's. The story definately has universal appeal to all children that have been spawned from the depths of ghetto despair. What Claude reveals to the general reader is that even a ghetto child destined to either a prison block or pine box can rise above and accomplish what they will.The book functions as a autobigraphical novel,socilogical story,and psychological observation. All the following can be gleaned from Claude's Manchild in the Promised Land. Every other view we get of the ghetto comes from exagerated gangsta rap lyrics or second hand suburban reserchers. Clude provides us with a realistic depiction from single parent households down to street hustlers that flood the block with heroin.The Harlem of the 50's-60's definately sounds alot like the inner city realities of today even at 2007. While Claude was able to escape the trap, you have to wonder how many ghetto youth today are just simply a victim of their own enviroment. How many Claude Browns are there in every inner city that don't live to tell their story or do so behind iron bars? The sadness is that such conditions have only became worse since Manchild in the Promised Land was published in the 60's.Before Brown's death he planned a sequel to his previous work detailing experiances of the 80's generation and how crack cocaine devistated Harlem much like heroin did in the 50's-70's."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"The man knows how to write and tell his story with all the passion, spirit, and gusto that only the ghettos of Harlem can produce!

This semester I had the opportunity to teach a remedial English class that consisted of many students who had never read a book before. . .they were a tough and rugged bunch with a lot of undirected, raw energy. The course objective was to get them to become more comfortable with reading. It was a beautiful and incredible experience to watch Claude Brown humble them, and then turn them into anxious readers. When they began to discuss the book on days when we weren't scheduled to discuss it, I knew I was on to something--Manchild in the Promise Land is a must read. It changed mine and my student's lives. . .It's full of spirit, soul, and that raw primordial energy that moves us whether we like it or not."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"I was ready to put this book down after reading 25 pages. It was depressing as all get out. It was just one negative behavior after the other. I know part of my dislike for the book and all the characters is that I am not smypathetic (sp) towards self destructive people. However, since the book got so many reviews I decided to give it one more try and I began reading from the very last page forward. I managed to get through the book. Unfortunately, I still did not care for it. Sonny and his cohorts were predators in the neighborhood. I am a Black woman and I vaguely familiar with how a few people can wreck havoc on a neighborhood and cause they good people to want to flee.There were a few things that stuck with me out of all the violence and self destruction. One was Sonny's attitude towards his parents. He ridiculed them because of their southern ways. Did he expect them to leave North Carolina and move to New York City and act as though they had a lobotomy and forget their past? New York City and Sonny's criminal past will be a part of him till he dies no matter where he lives.I did understand Sonny's frustation at times to communicate with his parents when he became older. Sometimes talking with your parents can be just like talking to a wall. It is a useless and painful effort.His assessment of the Muslims, their behavior, and origins was really interesting. I already knew what type of folks where generally a part of the group. I agree with his assessment.If Manchild was published today it would definitely be under the urban/hood genre. What I got out of this book is \\"thanky Lord I wasn't raised in that environment!\\" Would I recommend this book? My answer is to go with the majority of readers who loved it. As you can see, I am the odd woman out."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"Manchild In The Promised Land is, unlike Tookie's diatribe, the real deal.A facinating insight into the lifestyle and politics that dumped so many of our minority communities into a civil rights wasteland of tragedy, economic strangulation, academic failure and political correctness.A classic that deserves to be on every young person's reading list. It is a message that has meaning in Beverly Hills and in the Bronx.The author is one of the very few who can write the story in the first person, but, with the enhanced vision of someone who has risen above the narrow confines of his neighborhood to experience the best of American education.What is especially refreshing within this tragedy is that the author is content to tell the story without seeking to shakedown your pocketbook or heart. The net effect is of course to create a much deeper sadness for those who experience the \\"inner city\\".For those on the inside it gives a glimpse of the exerience of someone who breaks free, but whose heart remains attached. For those who have never experienced streets where people avoid eye contact and yet are always alert for the next threat and the elderly and infirmed only venture out in the middle of the day this is the painful, tragic reality."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"I read this book when I was 14 and again when I was 17 when I had my first boyfriend who was going down the same road as Sonny. He was selling drugs and was getting caught up in the life of crime. I urged him to read it and he did. He agreed that it was a great book. Unfortunately, he missed the point and made a hero out of Sonny. But I still recommend this book to young boys. I've been trying to find a copy for years for my young nephew. Adults its our duty to give a copy to all the youths that we know."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"I am an African American male. I first read Manchild when I was 13 years old.

At the age of 43, I have just finished reading Manchild for the 5th time in my lifetime. Like the first time, I was mesmerized as I walked the streets of Harlem with Sonny. Though written years ago, most of Claude Brown's observations are as relevant today as they were then.

The autobiography, written in narrative form, walks the reader through the childhood and early manhood of Sonny, Claude Brown. The writer pulls no punches as he hits the page with an intense anger of the circumstances that created the culture of Harlem in the 1940s and 1950s, and to great extent contribute to the same chaos today. Written in 1965, &quot;Manchild in the Promised Land&quot; could be referred to as a streetwise primer. It's clear, lucid prose gives unflinching detail to the black man's experience living in the ghetto. Brown recalls his childhood with pleasure and pride, a childhood defined by violence, crime and drug addiction. This honest pride is evidenced in many reverse values from &quot;traditional&quot; society, of those living outside the ghetto. Brown shows how these opposite values come about naturally, giving the living conditions, and how they become survival techniques that make sense. In the 1950s, no one actually lived in Harlem, they survived or died, according to Brown's account. Touted as the story of one who made it out of Harlem successfully, Claude Brown's &quot;Manchild in the Promised Land&quot; is the story of Sonny, a man who stands where a manchild ran."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"Claude tells us without self pity, regret, or justification about his dangerous, difficult, violent childhood (if you can call it that) growing up in Harlem during the 1940s and 50s. In this narrative autobiography Claude or Sonny as he is known around Harlem and it's juvenile centers begins going down the wrong path at the age of seven (7). At this tender young age he began shooting hooky from school in order to hang out with the older kids who were going around fighting, stealing, and everything else. There were absolutely no good influences in the neighborhood during this time. Everyone was either selling drugs, using drugs, or thinking up schemes to cheat people out of their hard earned money. There is one paragraph that sums up the childhood that a child experienced during that time and it reads &quot;There ain't no kids in Harlem. I ain't never seen any. I've seen some real small people actin' like kids. They were too small to be grown, and they might've looked like kids, but they don't have any kids in Harlem, because nobody has time for a childhood.&quot; &quot; Kids are happy, kids laugh, kids are secure. They ain't scared-a nothin'. I don't never remember bein' happy and not scared.&quot; You will have to read MANCHILD IN THE PROMISED LAND to find out about about Sonny's childhood with his family and friends and his coming of age during a time where it's believed that kids didn't exist in Harlem. You should read this book because it will open your eyes to experiences that you may or may not know exist. While reading this book I was shown a glimpse of a life that I'm not sure I would be able to endure and I learned some things from Sonny. I'm sure if you read MANCHILD IN THE PROMISED LAND you will also learn something."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"Throughout Brown's narrative you will experience the hardships of the ghetto life though a child's eyes. It is an inspirational story about a young man who ovecame a life of poverty and crime, and who later became a successful lawyer. Although this book was written from a black man's experiences' in the 1950's much of what he experienced still exist today. It will make you think about life, and the social and cultural situations that surround us today. This book will make have a meaningful impact on everyone who reads it."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"This book is a vital book to read for those in search of an inner strength. The true story of Claude Brown growing up in the tough streets of NYC makes you think how well you have it going for all those living in a quaint sheltered life that doesn't have to deal with guns and murder everyday."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"I first read Manchild in the Promise Land when I was sixteen. At fifty-six - I have finished reading the book for a second time. From a child's eyes this book showed me why one should never use drugs and I never did. From an adults view it taught me how to deal with a family member that is actually using drugs. This is one of the best books ever written on young-boy's street life. In and out of boys homes, poverty, seeing his best friends drugged, this book should be required reading for all young male and females. It even teaches readers the transverse of some males into homosexuality, and his acceptance of this shocking revelation in the black community is honestly portrayed.Just when it seemed that Sonny was headed towards the destructive path his friends were on, he pulled himself out, which is surprising because Sonny was the baddest kid in his community. I think mentors like group home professional, Papanek and his mother paved the way for Sonny to have optimism in life. It was sad to see that when Sonny got out of the boys home, he actually missed being there. Once home, he'd actually get on the \\"jail bus\\" to go back to the home, if for nothing else to have a conversation with his mentors.His young love relationship with a girl that ended up on Heroin was very touching to me. \\"Nodding\\" was not something Sonny wanted to see any of his friends or loved ones do and when he sees his brother Pimp nodding for the first time, that literally changed my life. This was and always will be the book that kept me from ever using or sampling drugs.Manchild in the Promised LandI even had an inkling to what street life was about. It's Claude Brown and Manchild in the Promise Land. Kudos to you my brother. May you rest in peace."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"This powerful memoir by an ex-street hustler is alternately raw, enlightening, harsh, hopeful, and depressing. Claude Sonny Brown (1937-2002) grew up stealing, fighting, scamming, playing hookey and dealing drugs - before he was a teen. So did many of his Harlem peers, in a community where role models were often junkies, thieves, whores and thugs. As a young boy Sonny disliked going inside for supper because he might miss something - like a fight or stabbing. And this was New York City in the late 1940's & early 1950's, when non-skilled jobs were more plentiful and black families more intact (Sonny lived with both parents). At 16 after stints in reformatories, Sonny quit hustling, got a job, and enrolled in night school (eventually becoming an attorney). Why the change? Sonny confesses maturity and fear - many of his criminal pals were dead, junkies, or in prison. But Sonny couldn't keep his brother from becoming a heroin addict nor serving time for armed robbery. Sonny also describes community players like the Coptic Church, Black Muslims, helpful counselors and ministers, plus negative street attitudes towards whites, Jews, and females (degraded even then as \\"B*tches\\").Many credit Sonny for arising from his harsh ghetto upbringing. I do too, but cannot credit his contempt for his parents (who tried steering him straight) nor how his remorse extends to his dead & imprisoned predatory pals but seldom to his victims. This book arrived in 1965 as did another famous street memoir (Autobiography of Malcolm X), and just before Martin Luther King launched open housing marches in northern cities against often-fierce opposition by fearful working-class whites. Given the rampant crime and ghetto horrors described in these pages, some readers may find it hard not to sympathize with those whites - a sentiment others may disdain. What seems beyond debate is that this book is raw, depressing and powerful."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"This gripping memoir of life as a Harlem street hustler is powerful, raw, depressing, enlightening, and one of the most memorable books ever penned. Claude Sonny Brown (1937-2002) describes his life as a thief, hustler, dealer, fighter and troublemaker - much of it before he even reached his teens. Together with his pals, Sonny played hookey from school, stole repeatedly from stores, and looked for suckers to scam. As Sonny admits in the last page, the streets of Harlem were so filled with action (fights, stabbings, etc.) that he seldom wanted to go inside for supper. According to Sonny, all of this was normalcy in Harlem in the 1940-50's, a neighborhood filled with drug addicts, hookers, pimps, pushers, thugs, and other ghetto role models. Ironically, this was in an era when more black families were intact (Sonny came from a two-parent home) and many decent-paying industrial jobs still existed for the unskilled. Sonny also describes how at about 16 he decided to quit the street life, find a job, and return to high school (he eventually became an attorney). Why? Perhaps maturity, two stints in reformatories, or seeing so many pals end up dead, in prison, or as junkies. But despite his best efforts, Sonny couldn't keep his younger brother from heroin addiction and serving time for armed robbery.Many reviewers praise this book and Sonny for escaping the street life, but I was not as impressed. Sonny was obviously very talented, yet remained contemptuous of his naive parents (who tried to steer him right) and many whites - whom he sees as controlling overseers. Also, Sonny's regret for the outcomes of his peers (death, prison, heroin addiction) seems not to extend to the many victims of his thieving and other sordid activities.This book arrived in 1965 as Martin Luther King was launching open housing marches in northern cities to oft-fierce opposition. Given the ghetto environment that Sonny describes, that opposition seems understandable - although some might debate the point. What is non-debatable is that this is a raw, depressing, very powerful read."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"Claude Brown's \\"Manchild in the Promised Land\\" is an American story, a story of urban community, living in it and surviving it.

Claude Brown tells his life story with honesty and open truth reminiscent of Miles Davis's autobiography. He discusses his encounters with girls, especially Sugar, who is ugly and has messed up teeth but still a certain charm about her, and his experiences at various reform schools. I found the relationship he had with his father to be especially interesting because of the constant rivalry they had. Claude also had lots of problems with drugs, especially heroin, cocaine and reefer. One admirable quality of Claude is that he holds none of this back and readily admits what he went through, no matter how ashamed he may have been. The gangs he rolled with are also interesting because of the way he often lead them, with an iron fist but still with a certain amount of care and mutual respect for every member. Also, Claude's life was positively influenced by jazz saxophone legends Sonny Rollins and Charlie Parker (the Charlie Parker With Strings album is even mentioned. He gets high while listening to \\"Summertime\\"). Eventually, Claude gave up the street life and started playing piano for large amounts of time. He straightened his life out, and got out of the ghetto. Of course, being a lawyer isn't much of an improvement. It just is a safer way to make money. I read this book in 10th grade and was very motivated by it. Claude died recently, in February of 2002, which was a tragic loss. He truly was a great writer and is very missed."},{"Title":"Manchild in the promised land","review":"I read this book a little while before Claude Brown passed away. I loved this book.

Both conclusions challenge the premises of the Jesus Seminar and other recent scholars that Thomas was originally written in Greek and predates the canonical Gospels. Although intended for academic audiences, Perrin's book is surprisingly accessible to non-specialists and well-educated laymen.The Gospel of Thomas is a collection of 114 sayings attributed to Jesus contained in a 4th century Coptic manuscript that came to light in 1948. In addition, Thomas is attested in three Greek fragments that were discovered in 1898 and dated to the 2nd century. About half of its sayings parallel those in the New Testament, but others are quite different. Although scholars initially assigned the original composition of Thomas to the early-to-mid 2nd century, a recent trend in certain scholarly circles is to situate Thomas as early as 50 A.D., making it one of the earliest sources for early Christianity and the historical Jesus. As a result, Thomas has become very important in recent times.Perrin approaches Thomas from a different angle, by concentrating on its original language of composition and using that to assess Thomas's origin. He makes a powerful case that Thomas was originally written in Syriac, an eastern dialect of Aramaic (Jesus spoke a western dialect). Perrin begins by surveying scholarship on Thomas's language of composition and notes several places where certain oddities in Thomas can be readily explained by an Aramaic or Syriac intermediary. Building on the observation that Thomas appears to be organized by catchwords (similarly sounding words that link one saying to the next), Perrin next investigates whether each saying can be connected by Syriac catchwords. He finds that Thomas has 502 potential catchwords in Syriac, but only 263 in Greek and 269 in Coptic. In addition, all but three of the sayings can be linked by a Syriac catchword to its neighboring sayings, and some of the repeated catchwords are based on puns that only work in Syriac. Perrin's case is compelling and fits very neatly with other scholars' findings that Thomas reflects an eastern Syrian provenance.Perrin's second point, that Thomas is dependent on Tatian's Diatessaron, is less thoroughly established. Unfortunately, Perrin did not do a detailed comparison of each saying in Thomas with corresponding passages in the Diatessaron. Rather, Perrin argued that Thomas must have had written sources and the Diatessaron, as the first known source of Gospel tradition in Syriac, is the best candidate to be one of those sources. Although this argument is very suggestive and Perrin did point out a few contacts in Thomas with the Diatessaron in his initial survey, a full judgment on this issue must be withheld until the detailed comparison is made.Those seriously interested in the Gospel of Thomas will find Perrin's book intriguing and thought-provoking. Knowledge of Syriac is not necessary to follow his arguments."},{"Title":"Thomas and Tatian","review":"In \\"Thomas and Tatian\\", Nicholas Perrin sets out to prove four hypotheses whose cumulative effect would lead one to conclude that the Gospel of Thomas had Tatian's Diatessaron as its primary source and therefore must be dated between 170 and 200 AD. Perrin is not the first to draw a connection between the Gospel of Thomas (GT) and the Diatessaron or the first to claim that GT was originally composed in Syriac, but he undertakes a more thorough examination of the issue than has been done in the past. The four points which he proposes to demonstrate are:(1) GT was originally written in Syriac. (2) The GT text is unified, not a disjointed list of sayings. (3) The Syriac original was based primarily on written, not oral, sources. (4) The primary source was Tatian's Diatessaron. Scholarship of the Gospel of Thomas has tended to arrive at two possibilities regarding its origins: Thomas is either dependent upon the synoptic gospels or independent of them. Perrin sees a third possibility: Thomas is indirectly dependent upon the synoptic gospels, through a semitic intermediate document, which he believes to be the Diatessaron. After providing the reader with a summary of scholarship that bears upon his thesis, he lays out his evidence.First, Perrin argues for a Syriac original by demonstrating that differences between the synoptic gospels and GT can often be resolved by postulating a Syriac substratum. Second, he analyzes GT for catchwords (\\"a catchword is any word which can be semantically, etymologically, or phonologically associated with another word found in an adjacent logion\\"). He's looking for rhymes and puns. Perrin has constructed a table of the text of GT that compares English translation to the (alleged) catchwords in Coptic and in their conjectured equivalents in Greek and Syriac. He concludes that there are twice as many catchwords in Syriac than in Greek or Coptic, supporting a Syriac origin. Third, he looks at variants that are unique to Thomas in light of Syriac catchwords.The obvious conclusion, if Perrin has correctly identified catchwords, is that GT was composed by a single author at a particular point in time, and that author manipulated the text for stylistic purposes. It would also explain why the order of the sayings in GT sometimes departs from that of the synoptic gospels. But does this mean that the Syriac source was necessarily the Diatessaron? Perrin thinks it does, as the Diatessaron is the only known source of the synoptic tradition in Syriac at that time. I was not entirely convinced by that last step, but the analysis of catchwords in fascinating. I read no Syriac so cannot judge the plausibility of the catchwords for myself, but I think that anyone interested in the Gospel of Thomas will want to consider Perrin's theory."},{"Title":"Fatal Romance: A True Story of Obsession and Murder (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"Many romance readers and writers awoke to shocking news June 6, 1999 headlined in papers from coast to coast: \\"Romance Novelist Slain. Police Say Husband Killed Writer, Self.\\" (Washington Post headline 6/7/99). As we mourned the loss of Nancy Richards-Akers, a popular author and friend, we were left with the big question, \\"How could such an intelligent person have allowed this to happen?\\" As more details emerged including Nancy having apparently taken a lover over 20 years her junior and leaving her home and two young children, there were more questions than answers.Author Lisa Pulitzer attempts to answer these questions by relating the story of Nancy and her estranged husband, Jeremy Akers, showing how the Scarsdale, NY debutante fell under the spell of the handsome but volatile, Vietnam vet from a small town in Alabama, now a successful DC attorney.There are no easy answers here as stories of Nancy's abuse differ. But one thing appears clear. Jeremy Akers couldn't live with the shame and embarrassment of his wife's abandonment.Pulitzer relates the story of Nancy's involvement with the Washington Romance Writers including starting the now yearly Harpers Ferry Writers' Retreat and her struggle to become published. Several romance writer friends are mentioned in the book as well.But don't go thinking the entire book is complimentary towards Nancy and negative toward Jeremy. Nancy is portrayed as a sloppy housekeeper who irritated some with her snobbery and name-dropping. Pulitzer describes Jeremy as a loving (although strict) father who surprised friends by being so gentle with his children. There is no question though as to how much they loved their three children who remain the very real and living victims of this horrific crimeEven those who don't usually read true crime will be interested in reading FATAL ROMANCE although it is sometimes difficult to read. Those acquainted with Nancy may even wish to skip chapter 2 that includes details not for the faint of heart. The two biggest complaints I have with this book is in their choice of pictures. First of all, the photo on the cover depicts a woman that seems rather brash, not the lovely lady I remember meeting; and secondly, the back cover advertises \\"8 pages of powerful photos!\\" when there are pretty blah photos of Nancy and her husband, and of their homes. Thankfully though, the publisher and/or author chose not to use photos of the children and, at all times, appeared to have portrayed them in the best interests of the children.Pulitzer has researched her subject well as she tells this disturbing and sad story of obsession and murder in an objective manner. The book, it has to be reiterated, is not for everyone, but those who do try it will find it impossible to put down.."},{"Title":"Fatal Romance: A True Story of Obsession and Murder (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"Nancy Richards-Akers was a volunteer at Mount Vernon College, her alma mater, while I worked there and we got to be good friends. I think that this book suffers from the author's only having interviewed a limited range of sources and very few close friends of Nancy's.

After having read this book, I have to say that I will never look the same way at any true crime book every again, knowing easily the story can be manipulated by the selection of the sources."},{"Title":"Fatal Romance: A True Story of Obsession and Murder (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"Lisa Pulitzer has done it again!

I whole-heartedly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fatal Romance: A True Story of Obsession and Murder (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"I have read this book over and over, and I love it. The portrait of Nancy is not always flattering, but the book shows that she was raised in a very different world from the average American, and her priorities were a bit skewed. She grew up with servants, but couldn't afford her own. She went to private schools, but couldn't afford the same for her own children. She and Jeremy were hounded by bill collectors, yet she filled her home with expensive items and only wore Laura Ashley dresses. She struggled, as an adult, to re-create the privileged world she grew up in, only to fall short of her own expectations. She had to beg for help from her parents to pay her children's tuition. She could be snobbish and vain, and her flaws made her a somewhat less than sympathetic, but still very human, victim.Jeremy, her betrayed husband,killed her in a jealous rage. He committed a hideous crime in front of his children, but Nancy seems almost to have driven him to it. His wife abandoned him for a truck driver young enough to be her son, then shack up with the truck driver right down the street from the home she shared with her family. Nancy accused Jeremy of physical abuse, yet she left their young children with him when she left. Her claims of abuse are obviously attempts to excuse what she has done, and to gain sympathy. Nancy fights for custody of her abandoned children, yet she is living in a one-bedroom basement apartment with her boyfriend. What I like so much about this book is that the killer and the victim are 3-dimensional characters, with strengths as well as flaws. Nobody is all good, and nobody is all evil, which makes them more interesting."},{"Title":"Fatal Romance: A True Story of Obsession and Murder (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"I totally agree with the reader's from Galena, Alaska and Canada.this was one of the worse true crime books I have ever read.

Finally she just leaves her children and moves in with her boy friend whose mother is the same age as she is. Her husband was a jurk but she never should have left her kids.

It completely glosses over vital facts."},{"Title":"Fatal Romance: A True Story of Obsession and Murder (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"In \\"Fatal Romance\\" Lisa Pulitzer presented both Nancy and Jeremy Akers as strange people, but in attempting to create a fair and balanced picture of both spouses, missed delving into the obvious personality disorder which led to Jeremy shooting Nancy to death in front of two of their children. While it is refreshing that Nancy was not presented as a saint, but as a creative person who could also be pretentious and snobbish, the author seemed reluctant to admit that Nancy suffered mental if not physical abuse for years. Jeremy, who had the education and potential as an attorney to support his family, refused to do so, only paying for housing and refusing to pay the family's bills. He demanded that Nancy pay the household expenses, yet frustratingly refused to let her work outside the home. He spent huge amounts of money on trips, clothing, and sports equipment for himself, while Nancy stayed home with the three children, the phone constantly ringing from collection agencies calling and stacks of past-due bills coming daily in the mail. Nancy was an unsympathetic victim who possessed a sense of entitlement, insisting that her children go to expensive private schools, and only dressing in Laura Ashley dresses and undergarments from Victoria's Secret. It was clear that Jeremy, who presented himself to other women as powerful, successful, and charismatic, had affairs, and the Jeremy that only Nancy knew was spinning out of control: he became a packrat and cheapskate who picked through neighbors' garbage and filled the house with stacks of old newspapers and other junk, making it impossible for Nancy to keep a decent house. When company came over Jeremy relished blaming Nancy for being a bad housekeeper. Jeremy, who had been a marine, was big on physical fitness and discipline, and treated Nancy, who he forced into the role of a harried, overweight housewife, with complete contempt. He loved to insult her in front of others. Nancy made some feeble attempts to negotiate change in her marriage, but Jeremy, using the classic defense mechanisms of the narcissist, always managed to maintain the upper hand. After years in this miserable situation, Nancy met a younger man online, an uneducated truck driver, who viewed Nancy as sophisticated and successful due to her wealthy background and modest success as a romance writer. Everyone involved seemed determined to ignore the warning signs of Jeremy's instability. Even Nancy, who had lived with Jeremy for twenty years, failed to realize that the outward signs of eccentricity displayed by her husband were only the tip of the iceburg: his distorted pride and arrogance had grown into a malignancy which would not allow him to ever accept losing, especially to a man he considered far below him, and Nancy, a mere woman he had devalued for years. While Pulitzer provided a lot of detail about the lives of this troubled couple, Ann Rule would have done a better job with this story, which lacked psychological depth and fell flat. It would have been easy to give this story the direction and drive it needed to be a really excellent book. It was clear from Jeremy's actions that he suffered severe psychological disorders for years, yet the author did not make clear the most important element of the story: the progression of Jeremy's psychological state from the pride and self-discipline of his youth, the worsening narcissistic personality disorder during the course of his marriage, finally culminating in murder and suicide when he could not keep Nancy under his thumb and \\"win\\". If the book had emphasized the progression of Jeremy's personality disorders, and made it clear that Jeremy and Nancy were not simply equally strange, disfunctional people, it would have given the story more direction and urgency. As written, the book generated little outrage against the murderer and not much sympathy for the victim."},{"Title":"Fatal Romance: A True Story of Obsession and Murder (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"What more is there to say?

Lewis to one of his closest friends, Arthur Greeves. Besides the usual day to day chat, Lewis lets Arthur in on the three things he thinks should go into a letter: a person's readings, thinkings, and doings. Not only was this correspondence fun to read, but several specimens are as good as anything I've read in the way of sage advice to aspiring writers. Lewis's letters are candid, often whimsical and full of good humor, and entertaining in giving insightful commentary on the books he read. Walter Hooper has done a fine job of editing the correspondence and I strongly recommend obtaining a copy of the book if you can get hold of one."},{"Title":"They Stand Together: The Letters of C.S. Lewis to Arthur Greeves (1914-1963)","review":"I looked for this book for quite a while before I finally got a library copy. I read it all, but was glad I hadn't actually bought it. (Note that I own more than 20 books by Lewis, including Letters and Letters to Children, and have read about 30 of his books; so one could safely say I am a fan.)The book's idea is very interesting--letters from a man who wrote good letters, written to his lifelong best friend. Since Lewis greatly valued friendship (as I do), I wanted to see what he said. But the introduction was disappointing: Hooper spends pages telling Lewis's brother's faults in detail to the world, and only God knows whether he has done so honestly. It was also disappointing that Hooper chose to \\"scientifically restore\\" passages in the letters that talk about the correspondents' youthful indiscretions, passages that Greeves had carefully crossed out. In other words, the book fails to appropriately respect either Lewis's friendship or his loyalty to his brother--tabloid editing even if the restorations are accurate.But the letters themselves are interesting and tell Lewis's story from a different angle than his other books. I'd say it's worth 3 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"They Stand Together: The Letters of C.S. Lewis to Arthur Greeves (1914-1963)","review":"Why this collection of letters is not in print is a mystery. The writer whose letters this contains (C.S. Lewis)has sold books by now in excess of (estimated) two hundred million copies. And this is a collection of his writings,in this case to a boyhood friend, Arthur Greeves, from the time he was 17 until a couple of months before his death. Like reading C.S. Lewis? Like to know more about his life? This is the ultimate first hand account. Granted, most of the letters are before 1945 and most recount his own own academic and literary interests, and so will be of special interest to those of similar mind; still it is his letters to his lifelong friend that contain autobiographical details one can find in print nowhere else. Read lots of Lewis and want to read more? His letters -- the total number exceeding by one estimate &quot;War and Peace&quot; -- are the place to turn. If you love reading the man, this volume is indispensible. He never shared so much with anyone else in print."},{"Title":"They Stand Together: The Letters of C.S. Lewis to Arthur Greeves (1914-1963)","review":"I received a copy of the 1976 edition in the mail a few weeks ago, and have spent most of my free time reading this book. For those unfamiliar with what this is, \\"They Stand Together\\" is a compilation of letters written by C.S. Lewis to his greatest lifelong friend, Arthur Greeves. (Albeit, however, there are five letters of Arthur's strewn in as well.)I'll have to admit that I have a certain bias, as I'm very much a fan of C.S. Lewis and his writings. His philosophical and theological views have always kept me intrigued and pushed me into continuous vigil on anything that may give insight to the man behind the works. So, after finding this, I thought it would provide a wonderful revelation. For the most part, I wasn't let down. I will warn you, though, that if you're not one devoted to C.S. Lewis the man, you may not find this book very interesting.Concerning the content, this is, to date, the most extensive compilation between Lewis and his friend, ranging from 1914, the year that they met, to 1963, the year Lewis died. As you read, you can see the development of Lewis as both a friend and as a man progressing through his own beliefs. From atheism to spiritualism, deism and finally Christianity, these letters cover the transition through them all. There are also other things to be found, such as rough drafts of writings Lewis wanted Arthur to read, including much poetry. Plenty of book criticisms can be found as well.(I thought it interesting to note that there are even letters written from the battlefront when Lewis became part of the British infantry in World War One. Even in the midst of war, he remained devoted to his friend!)It must be noted that there is some controversy concerning the editing of this compilation. Certain things that Arthur Greeves crossed out in some letters, which some have argued to be too personal to be put in print, has been restored by editor Walter Hooper. Arthur's confusion regarding his own sexuality, instances concerning Lewis and his questioned relation with his caretaker and self-adopted mother, Mrs. Moore, and conversations concerning Warnie, Lewis's brother, and his drinking binges; all of these are found restored here and, while certainly insightful to the life of Lewis, may be questioned by some as indecent of Mr. Hooper.All in all, this five-hundred page volume is certainly a read, and I found it to be a very interesting insight into the maturing of C.S. Lewis. I personally have no qualms concerning the editing, which may have marked down the rating for some reviewers, so I will give my honest opinion and rate it a five out of five.Overall: A hearty and good-proportioned volume for those interested in the life and history behind C.S. Lewis, but those who aren't entirely devoted or find exposing into personal matters 'iffy', you might want to refrain from purchasing this."},{"Title":"Emotional Experience and Religious Understanding: Integrating Perception, Conception and Feeling","review":"Emotional Experience and Religious Understanding: Integrating Perception, Conception and Feeling by Mark Wynn (Cambridge University Press) (Hardcover) In this book Mark Wynn argues that the landscape of philosophical theology looks rather different from the perspective of a reconceived theory of emotion. In matters of religion, we do not need to opt for objective content over emotional form or vice versa. On the contrary, these strategies are mistaken at root, since form and content are not properly separable here - because 'inwardness' may contribute to \`thought-content', or because (to use the vocabulary of the book) emotional feelings can themselves constitute thoughts; or because, to put the point another way, in religious contexts, perception and conception are often infused by feeling. Wynn uses this perspective to forge a distinctive approach to a range of established topics in philosophy of religion, notably: religious experience; the problem of evil; the relationship of religion and ethics, and religion and art; and in general, the connection of 'feeling' to doctrine and tradition.Why consider the significance of the emotions in religious contexts? In the course of this book, Wynn provides quite a number of reasons for doing so, by showing how the landscape of philosophical theology and philosophy of religion looks rather different from the perspective of a reconceived theory of emotion. But even casual reflection will reveal that arguments about the cognitive status of religious belief often turn on some understanding of the significance of the emotions. Here, for example, is John Macquarrie's summing up of a central strand of the naturalistic critique of religious belief in the nineteenth century and later:'In the nineteenth century the drift of philosophy had been increasingly in the direction of a mechanistic and materialistic world view, and in England this was powerfully advocated by such thinkers as Bertrand Russell, and, later, Alfred Ayer. The natural sciences were taken to furnish the only basis for assured knowledge, and anything that smacked of religion or mysticism was treated as non-cognitive and banished to the region of \\"mere emotion\\".'One might try to evade this critique by keeping emotion out of religion, or at any rate by separating the cognitive bit of religion from the emotional bit - but any serious examination of the psychology of religious belief formation will reveal, will it not, the shaping influence of various kinds of emotional commitment? On this point, Ayer and other critics of religion are surely right.The proposal of this book offers another response again, one which privileges neither the 'what' (as the first response) nor the 'how' (as the second) : in matters of religion, we do not need to opt for (emotional) form over (objective) content, the 'how' over the 'what'; nor do we need to rid ourselves of the 'how' to retain the 'what'. On the contrary, these strategies are mistaken at root, since form and content are not properly separable here - because 'inwardness' may contribute to \`thought-content', or because (to use the vocabulary of this book) emotional feelings are intrinsically intentional (themselves constitute thoughts). Or because, to put the point in yet another way, in matters of religion, perception and conception are often infused by feeling. So in response to the question of why we should study the significance of the emotions in religious contexts, we might say: such a study offers the prospect of an account which is at once sensitive to the psychology of religious belief formation, germane to the key assumption of one central tradition of religious scepticism, and attentive to the possibility that the \`how' and the 'what' of religious thought are not always separable.This book is also animated by the thought that a discussion of these questions is especially opportune just now. In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in the emotions in a variety of fields, and most notably, for our purposes, in philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology. The central theme of this book is that these developments are potentially of far-reaching importance for our understanding of the significance of the emotions in religious contexts. Of course, there are a number of recent monographs in the philosophy of religion which consider the epistemic importance of the emotions.The outstanding example is perhaps William Wainwright's Reason and the Heart. However, this work was published before the most recent developments in philosophical treatments of the emotions to which I have just alluded. Petri Jarvelainen's A Study on Religious Emotions is a helpful discussion which does engage with these developments, but his interests are rather different from mine.' There are also various texts which seek to integrate affective experience within a larger account of the epistemology of religious belief without placing the emotions at the centre of their analysis. A good example of this strategy is William Abraham's defence of 'soft rationalism'. This is a stance which retains a role for evidence and argument (unlike 'fideism') while also assigning cognitive significance to personal, affectively toned experience (unlike 'hard rationalism'). The discussion of this book could be read as a filling out of the 'soft rationalist' option in ways that give particular weight to the epistemic contribution of emotional experience.As I have suggested, the book can also be read as a reworking of various established topics in philosophical theology and philosophy of religion in the light of recent developments in the philosophy (and psychology and neuroscience) of the emotions. The key themes of the book are these:Emotional feelings can function as modes of value perception - in relation to God, the world, and individual human beings; and the idea that feelings, conceptions, and perceptions may contribute to complex wholes which cannot be understood reductively as simply the sum of their parts, that emotional feelings can themselves carry intellectual content. I also argue that in some cases, this content may not be otherwise available, in which case feeling's role may be not just constructive, but indispensable. The upshot of the discussion is that we need to see religious understanding as a commitment of the person in their intellectual-behavioural-affective integrity discussions, including questions such as 'Why should the phenomenology of religious experience not be more easily describable?' (an issue for Alston) and 'Why should the understanding of God that is achieved in religious experience not be more easily describable?' (an issue for Newman).Wynn seeks to re-examine the topics of: religious experience, the relationship of religion and ethics, and the 'problem of evil' (Chapters 1-3). Wynn brings into fruitful relationship three strands of reflection: on the one side, John McDowell's cognitivist reading of value experience and, on the other side, the view of affectively toned theistic experience that is expounded in the writings of John Henry Newman and William Alston.The question of the relationship between religion and morality has a long and controverted history Wynn suggests that the work of Raimond Gaita advocates a new and more fruitful conception of this relationship than is implied in the currently dominant theories of ethics. If Gaita is right that our moral categories are properly founded upon the quality of our felt responses, and specifically the responses of love and remorse (and not upon notions such as happiness, autonomy, flourishing, rights, and the like), then our relationship to others is to be understood in terms of a broadly similar conceptual framework, whether our perspective is that of morality or that of theistic religion (and perhaps more specifically, that afforded by the Christian faith). More controversially, Wynn argues that Gaita's scheme invites completion in religious terms, in so far as the impartial love of the saints points ultimately to a religiously serious appropriation of the language of divine parental love. Finally, Wynn argues that Gaita's scheme needs elaboration in at least one respect if it is to prove fully consistent with the demands of a certain kind of religiously committed ethic. After Wynn examines the possibility of an affectively toned perception of God and of other human beings, he deals with the possibility of an affectively toned perception, or at least assessment, of the world. Wynn argues that there is some reason to suppose that this sort of assessment is possible (appealing to the models of Smith and Schleiermacher, and Tugwell's discussion of St Francis). Wynn suggests that our discursive enquiries into questions of theodicy should be conducted with humility. Wynn attempts to clarify the sense in which the insights made available in feeling admit of certitude, are enduringly available, and are capable of embodiment and communication to others. Finally, Wynn considered how emotional attachments may also help to constitute certain values, and how this possibility may contribute to a reassessment of the problem of evil, by pointing to a larger connection between vulnerability and the fundamental value of things mattering at all.Emotional feelings can also function as 'paradigms', and can therefore properly direct the development of our discursive understanding, in religious and other contexts as for example in the idea that 'feeling' may run ahead of 'doctrine' in the way suggested by William James and others (Chapters 4-5). Wynn elaborates four models of the relationship between emotional feeling and understanding, considering how those models may be placed in a larger context, and to some degree further specified and corroborated, by reference to recent work in psychology, neurophysiology, and philosophy. In brief, these models are those of Deigh (primitive affects may be intrinsically intentional and may be infused by a growing conceptual appreciation of the world); Goldie (feeling may take further the understanding achieved by discursive reflection, in ways that perhaps escape verbal articulation); de Sousa (feeling may present a kind of paradigm that can help to govern the unfolding of our reflective enquiries); and Maddell (feeling may be targeted at some as yet unrealised but anticipated consummation). The first two of these models offer an elaboration of the understanding of feeling that Wynn has been assuming in his previous accounts of emotions; the last two present a rather different account, although one that is still founded on the idea of feeling as revelatory of value. Wynn attempts to show that all of these models can make a real claim on our attention. These four models are securely enough established as to provide a worthwhile basis for further reflection. Next Wynn considers how the four models might be applied to the question of the relationship between emotional feeling and religious understanding in particular.Wynn argues that feeling can enjoy a kind of priority vis-&agrave;-vis doctrine, as James supposes. However, the relationship is, more fundamentally, one of reciprocal influence, and sometimes it is doctrine that comes first. Doctrine may sponsor new forms of feeling; and doctrine and feeling may join together to constitute unified states of mind which depend for their intentionality upon the contribution of both, and in such a way that neither can claim temporal or any other kind of precedence.Someone might think this picture too messy: surely we need to come down on one side or the other (\`doctrine' or \`feeling'), if only as a generalization? I would resist this thought. With James, Wynn is inclined to think that but for religious feeling, we would not have religious movements and the bodies of doctrine that they have developed. In this sense, feeling has a certain explanatory priority when we consider religion as a sociological phenomenon: the doctrines only get going because of the feelings. And it is this fact (supposing it is a fact) that makes the subject matter of this book worthy of attention: if the doxastic commitments of religious believers are profoundly shaped by feeling, then the epistemic standing of those commitments may well depend upon the capacity of feeling to bear a positive cognitive significance. However, even if feeling has priority in this sense, there is no reason to suppose that religion would have persisted but for the ability of discursive thought to articulate doctrines which possess at least a measure of theoretical plausibility, and which in turn are able to engage and give shape to feeling. And in practice, no doubt there are bits of doctrine which cannot be traced to any particular precedent feeling, but which engender religious feeling, just as there are feelings which do not owe their origin (in their most basic form) to conceptualization and which help to stimulate discursive thought about religious questions. In short, the messiness is to some extent intrinsic to the subject matter: to speak in general terms, religion depends on discursive thought and also on feeling; and to speak of particular cases, it is sometimes thought which comes first, sometimes feeling, and sometimes neither.If there is a figure who emerges as the hero of this discussion, it is Newman. His thought anticipates (and sometimes simply articulates) each of the four models prposed, and Wynn draws upon the Grammar of Assent to provide illustrations of what is at stake in each case. Newman admits (at least in passing) the possibility of a \`primitive' affectively toned sense of God. He allows for the possibility that feeling may be infused by prior doctrinal commitments while building upon and deepening those commitments (this is his favored view). He grants that feelings may properly shape our reading of evidence; and he speaks eloquently of the 'wounds of the soul' and the 'earnest desire' for revelation, and at least by implication he takes these states to provide a proleptic, affectively toned sense of the goal of human life. If not a messy, this is at any rate a somewhat complicated picture, but at least we know that nothing less complicated will do if we are to understand the workings of religious belief with proper epistemic and psychological nuance - allowing that in this context epistemic and psychological considerations are not to be sharply distinguished, because of the various ways in which religious content, and its cognitive significance, may be grounded in feeling.Clearly, not all representations of the divine work in the way that Wynn describes. God can be characterized in purely abstract terms, as the first cause, for example, and in this sort of case, the representation surely does not require any aesthetic or affective mediation. (And following Newman, we may suppose that a characterization of God whose content is rightly understood in part by way of affective response may in fact be apprehended in purely notional terms.) However, there is good reason to think that in practice, religious traditions make quite extensive use of the sort of representation that Wynn discusses. Certainly, they have an abundant supply of the requisite means: in the course of human history, most art has had a religious provenance, and even traditions which prohibit any figurative representation of the divine have been a prolific source of abstractly decorative and other kinds of art. Moreover, religious traditions also have the requisite motive. For they are interested in inculcating a 'real image' of God or, more generally, a motivationally effective sense of the sacred - and aesthetic representation of the sacred achieves just this, by offering a symbol of the divine whose content can be grasped only by way of an affectively engaged response to the symbol and the world. If all of this is true, then there is good reason to suppose that the kind of representation that we have been exploring is quite commonly exemplified in religious traditions.Representations of 'the gods' can be understood by analogy with representation in the arts by examining the relationship of religion and art and the working of religious language. To put the point in the terms of Dufrenne's model, as Wynn develops it, the art of a particular tradition may engender feelings that befit the world, or outstrip the feelings that are properly elicited by the world; and thereby a particular work may represent, or at least allude to, God in the various ways I have been describing. Moreover, artworks may themselves help to shape our sense of which feelings befit the world, by constituting an affective world and making possible a correlative affectively toned mode of perception. (These are respectively the two central themes we have taken from Dufrenne, of course.)The possibility of this sort of representation is beautifully illustrated in the passage from Weil. On hearing the women's singing, she is reminded of, or perhaps discovers with the aid of the 'artwork', the meaning of the world (she comprehends its heart-rending 'affective essence'). And thereby she comes to a new understanding of the Christian God (as the God of slaves) and of her own Christian identity. It is worth emphasizing once more that the affective-aesthetic dimension of Weil's state of mind is not to be viewed in isolation. It may be true that Weil grasps the religious meaning of the women's behavior without understanding the words of the hymns they sing; but her sense that Christianity is the religion of slaves is, surely, doctrinally informed, so that feeling's role here is to provide a more integrative, self-involving way of apprehending what has been grasped in notional terms, rather than a purely non-discursive route to religious insight. But at the same time, Weil's example suggests (along with our discussion of the pasque flower, for instance) that religiously suggestive art need not be religiously explicit in content. Other kinds of art, including non-representational art, are also capable of bearing a religious meaning, providing that they elicit feelings which can be mapped onto those befitting the world in the various ways described above.If this is the right way to think about how religious representation (and accordingly, religious understanding) works in at least many cases, then it follows that philosophy of religion may need an expanded sense of the kinds of epistemic 'failure' which lie at the root of non-belief. Philosophers have, naturally, wondered about the kind of non-belief that is grounded in an inability to see the evidential force of certain arguments (or, even, an inability to grasp the reasons for thinking that religious belief need not be evidence-dependent). The account of religious representation that Wynn considers suggests that the inability to participate in a religious tradition may have other sources, also epistemic in their way, but at the same time profoundly related to questions of sentiment and personality.First of all, one may be unable to participate in a religious tradition if its art fails to engender in me the right kind of affective response. Moreover, even if one understands the art of a religious tradition in this sense, one may still be unable to participate in the tradition if one cannot share in its affectively toned sense of the world's human significance. Remember that religious representation on Dufrenne's model depends upon an appropriate mapping of the feelings elicited by the artwork onto those elicited by the world; and accordingly, a representation may fail to work in either of these ways - that is, either because it does not elicit the requisite feelings, or because the world does not. (Again, these achievements are related, in as much as understanding an artwork may enable me to inhabit a correlative affective world that will in turn provide a new, affectively toned mode of perception of the sensory world.) In both of these ways, then, a person may find themselves unable to participate in a religious tradition, for cognitive-cum-affective reasons. So Dufrenne's model, as applied to representations of the gods, invites us to revisit some familiar issues concerning the working of religious language, and the kind of epistemic achievement that is implied in religious commitment.Wynn has considered various models of the relationship between emotional experience and religious understanding. Wynn reflects on some religiously motivated objections to the idea that affects can be assigned this sort of significance, and here Wynn argued that his approach is in sympathy with at least one influential tradition of spiritual formation. Wynn argues that we can take emotional feelings to be cognitively important without supposing that they are important in proportion to the degree of their felt intensity, or that they are to be cultivated for their own sake, or that they invite the kind of self-absorption that is reflected in his decision to withdraw from the world. Nor need they imply mere 'subjectivism' and the forsaking of doctrine'. The burden of this book is that, on the contrary, emotional feelings can provide tradition-grounded ways of reading doctrines in depth, so that they acquire action-guiding force, and take root in a larger self 'of which our intellectualizing is only the thinnest of surfaces'.\\" In these ways, emotional feelings are indispensable to the life of faith both cognitively and practically. Indeed, they point to a mode of understanding which is at once both cognitive and practical - one in which perception, conception, and feeling are bound together inseparably."},{"Title":"Strength and Power for Young Athletes","review":"As a former Olympic Athlete I appreciate the importance of keeping children healthy and strong.

Humanity today is facing challenges that, in order to manage successfully, will require fundemental changes in the way we precieve and act. We cannot afford to make decisions based solely on belief, or under the deforming influenence of emotional needs not being met.

It's been years since I read SYATT, and it seemed a good starting book for my new goal of reading at least 30 min of personal development books each day.The book is structured like a staircase, with the idea that if you build on the foundations of each step before moving to the next one, then you will eventually make it to the Top and find success. The early steps are about self-image and attitude and goal setting. This is all good stuff, though not really anything you have never heard before if you have ever read a self help book.Unfortunately, I found myself skimming the last 30% or so, as Zig talks about habits and work. This revised version has a lot of ranting about drug use and wife swapping and immoral television. Don't forget the godless communists, too. In fact, he inserts a whole chapter at the end about how we need to be ever vigilant that the slow communist takeover than began with social programs in the 1930s doesn't eventually make us all slaves of Communism. If I were reading Mark Levin or Glenn Beck, then this last third of the book would not shock me. But with this book, the reactionary politics are so tacked onto what started as a good personal development book.A lot of it was added in the later revisions, too. He mentions South Park and American Pie, for instance, as well as the Reagan-created miracle of the Berlin Wall falling. (the book was originally published in the 1970s) Plus, original versions of the book used to have \\"for further reading\\" lists at the end of each chapter. Those lists are now gone. I can only speculate as to why. Perhaps the writers were not Christian enough for this later superevangelical Ziglar? Or maybe it's simple business -- \\"Why should I sell their books, when I could be pushing mine?\\" Whatever the reason, a fine resource has been lost.I give the book an overly-generous three stars because the first 2/3 are still pretty solid and useful. As well, I want to recognize that it's a classic of the genre.

Zig Ziglar is one of the world's best known, prolific speakers and authors on topics such as selling and motivation.

Cultivate good habits, see the good in yourself and others. Life life fully and live it \\"right\\".This is not a \\"sales\\" oriented book, like many of Ziglar's works.

Zig encourages us that his See You at the Top philosophy and concepts will FOR you if you take deliberate action to work WITH them.I'd also like to highlight Zig's concept of taking what you have and working with it. Taking the wonderful and unique gifts that God has granted you as a developing human being and using them as leverage. This book, especially the portion on developing a positive self-image, is perfect for someone without the highest esteem, or someone who feels he or she was born with average ability. Guess what? Ziglar was born with average abilities from a variety of standpoints. However it did not stop him from making more sales dollars than any man whoever lived.Finally, Zig is admirably undaunted by the threat of criticism he might have received for his perpetual Biblical references.

Unlike many motivational, self-help authors who serve up insipid clich&eacute;s and warmed-over mush, Ziglar offers worthy, inspiring - if simplistic - ideas on improving your life and achieving your goals.

His chapters on goal-setting are some of the best I've read on the topic.

It has made me realize that I must have a plan for my life, and that I can't just be a \\"wandering generality,\\" as Mr. Ziglar says in his book.I picked this book up from my mom. I was going through a really hard time at the beginning of the year this year, and she brought this book in, along with \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People,\\" by Dale Carnegie, for me. I read the Carnegie book first, and found that I really liked his. My problems at the time were mainly social, and since the title of his book had to do with friends, it was natural for me to pick up. I shied away from Mr. Ziglar's book at first because my mom told me it was about success, and I didn't want some cheesy-sounding book to read about that.When I finally picked it up, I realized that it was glued to my hands. I couldn't let go of it. I kept turning page after page, gulping down every bit of wisdom that Mr. Ziglar threw at me. Then I decided to go through it a second time, and take notes.This is my recommendation if you are going to read this book: get two highlighters, of different colors each. With one color, highlight every bit of useful information you find in there, such as tidbits of wisdom. With the other color, highlight the steps to things that Mr. Ziglar tells you to do. After you get through the book the first time, go through it a second, and organize your information according to each step to success (self-image, your relationship with others, goals, attitude, ect.).

I highly recommend it for that. However, Zig gets a little preachy when he starts telling us we should spank children to discipline them, as well as his religious views. The final chapter is basically just thrown in to tell you his views. The main problem I have with the book is how Zig refers to homosexuality as a \\"bad habit\\" and how he equates \\"homosexual\\" literature with pornography.

Are they fictional, lies or true?

It is not accidental but deliberate and takes hard work.1) Success starts with self-image because you are the only one who can make that possible. Before you convince anyone else, you have to convince yourself.2) Successful people are &iexcl;Good Finders&iexcl;; they look for the good in other people. &iexcl;You can have anything in your life, if you help others get what they want&iexcl;. (page 57)3) No goals = no game. Activity is not accomplishment. Don&iexcl;t be a wandering generality. Goals should be big, long range, daily and specific.4) Unlimited possibilities. Records were meant to be broken. Until Roger Bannister ran the four-minute mile, most thought it was physically impossible. After his achievement, people broke the record constantly.5) Work as a team. There is a limit to what you can accomplish by yourself. Example: Geese fly 72% farther by flying together.6) Attitude is everything. It determines the outcome. While you cannot control the environment, you (and only you) can control your attitude. The pessimist says. &iexcl;I will believe it when I see it.&iexcl; The optimist says, &iexcl;I will see it when I believe it.&iexcl; (page 206)7) Create good habits because habits define our lives. Example: The average teenage student watches 17,000 hours of television before they graduate high school.8) Successful people enjoy their work.9) Keep going. \\"The price of success is less than the price of failure\\".

Although this book is about philosophy, but only a little theory involved. The concept of this book is easy to understand. The main theme of this book is the six steps to the top. Here is the summary of the book:Step 1 Self-image: If you have a positive image, you can do everything well.Step 2 Your relationship with others: The way you see them is the way you treat them. So, you better find the &iexcl;good&iexcl; in other people and in every situation.Step 3 Goals: Everyone should have at least one goal. The goal should be fulfilled four requirements: i.Big Goals, ii. Goals must be Long-range, iii. Goals must be daily, iv.Goals must be specific.Step 4 Attitude: A right mental attitude helps you to build a positive life attitude.Step 5 Work: Most successful people are really enjoyed their job.Step 6 Desire: People have their own desire will became more successful.These 6 steps are really useful in our daily life. The concepts of this book are practical and positive. It teaches us how to built a better future. After I read this book, I really feel more confident to my work. It was because this book teaches us that we should believe the concept of &iexcl;I CAN&iexcl;. Once you believe in yourself, you can do everything well.The only bad point of this book is too much emphasis on religion. I am not fully understood some stories are about religion. Some sentences are even directly copied from the Bible. All in all, I do really like to read this book."},{"Title":"See You at the Top","review":"I had the pleasure of hearing Zig Ziglar in person at a success 90 something seminar in Indianapolis, In. The audio cassette, See You at the Top is absolutely the best motivational tape I've ever heard. Zig has a knack for story telling and you can't help but fall in love with his southern charm. I have recommended this tape to dozens of co-workers and we are adding it to our current collection at work. You will more than get your money's worth on this one. I am planning on adding as many titles of Zig's to my personal collection as possible."},{"Title":"See You at the Top","review":"I read this book again &quot;for the first time&quot; (as an old commercial goes) and could not put it down. Zig's no-nonsense, old-fashioned approach to success is timeless! It is a worthwhile book to read for those who want to learn success from the soul outward. Some may consider the style and manner of this book as trite and arcane but in this day and age of guerilla business tactics this book is a still a breath of fresh air. This is one book you will come back to time and time again."},{"Title":"See You at the Top","review":"If you only buy one book about success this should be it! Zig Ziglar is a man of faith and positive vision. His philosophy is summarized in the idea that we are born to help others. Furthermore, by helping others we will be able to achieve our own goals. Zig writes in an anecdotal style that is delightful and easy to read. His writing will challenge you, make you laugh and shine the light of introspection upon your priorities. What is it you want to accomplish? Zig will show you the steps of procession that will guide you to the top and to your ultimate life goal. I could not more highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"See You at the Top","review":"When I first heard Zig Ziglar, I was not a fan. To me, he came across more like a carnival barker. I really preferred Jim Rohn, Brian Tracy, Denis Waitley, Earl Nightingale and so on.But the more I listened to Zig Ziglar tapes and read his material, the more I liked him. The message was clear and he is very motivating.To some people, this is just plain old common sense. Perhaps. But is it common knowledge or better yet common practice?I heard recently that Zig Ziglar gets paid over $50,000 per appearance. That is a lot of money and after having heard Zig, he is worth every penny of it. And it helps make up for those thousands of speeches that Zig Ziglar made for FREE! And it is a small price to pay for the service he provides, empowering people to become all they can be.Thank you Zig, we needed this!"},{"Title":"See You at the Top","review":"This book is intended to improve Your Self -Steem, -Knoledge and -Confidence to its very roots. As you realize those as keys factor to success, it will become mandatory as a reading."},{"Title":"See You at the Top","review":"I found Zig Zigar's 'See you at the top' to be a most pleasurable read. The book is well written and easy to digest. Zig conveys his lessons in the form of short stories and personal experiences, all of which are easy to relate to and easy to identify with. The book is a good motivation read. If you want to make a change in you're life or just looking for that little inspiration, this book will provide it. As an overview the book concentrates on building \`YOU', by looking at self-image, relationships, desire, achievement and proactive-ness amongst other things. The only bad point is that I found certain sections too be slightly too religion biased, but this does not really detract from a quality and an inspiration read. I will be recommending this too my friends as, I feel they too will benefit from this."},{"Title":"See You at the Top","review":"In this classic book, Zig Ziglar present 9 principles that will get you to the top. It is written in an optimistic upbeat manner that will truly inspire you and Mr. Ziglar is always mindful of a holistic, balanced way of living that serves your real purposes. For example, at one point he says, \\"before you climb the ladder of success, make sure it is leaning up against the right wall.\\" These are the kinds of pearls of wisdom this book contains.There are many people who have written good reviews on the contents of this book, there is no need for me to repeat all of this hear. However, I want to comment on the spirit and style of how this great information is presented. Simply put, Zig Ziglar is a master story teller that walks his talk. He is one of the only people I knew who got the best of the \\"Sixty Minutes\\" team!If you are interested in making it to the top while preserving your values and not selling your soul, this could be a good roadmap for you. I discovered Zig Ziglar in my twenties, saw him speak and had a personal conversation with him.In my twenties when there was a recession and I was feeling despondent because I didn't have a lot of job experience and I couldn't get a job, Mr. Ziglar listened empathetically to me and that suggested that the recession is not out there. It's between your ears and he said, \\"let's you and I make an agreement not to participate in this recession. I know that I'm still making lots of money.\\" This really landed deeply and when I protested that I didn't have a lot of experience, he looked me in the eye and said, \\"you have twenty three years of experience being honest, open, communicating directly, keeping your agreements, etc.\\" If your lack of experience comes up in an interview, tell them this and add that anything else you need to learn is easy compared to building good character. I never forgot that moment and in my next interview I tried it and I landed a good job with Pharmakon Research International as an Associate Scientist. I credit Mr. Ziglar with having the empathy to really see me and tell me just the right thing that restored my confidence. This is the space this book is written from and if this sounds good to you, I think you will get a lot out of it.Some of the language of this book is old fashioned. However, the principles are really timeless and now that I am older, I realize he was right and that much of my success is the result of internalizing these principles and the principles of other good men that I have had the good fortune to know and be touched by."},{"Title":"See You at the Top","review":"Such a positive writer with shorter topics that areeasy to pickup to read ~ a few at a time.

Furet, who hails from the so called third generation of Annales School historians, was one of a few daring French scholars that attempted to bring political history back into a paradigm that was dominated by social, economic, and qualitative history in the post-World War II decades. Admitting that before any scholarship on the French Revolution can be taken seriously, an historian must first \\" show his colors,\\"...i.e....declare his political stand. Endorsing the earlier works of Alexis de Tocqueville and Augustin Cochin, Furet points to the substantial Socialist element that has existed in his homeland, and argues: the one trait that was unique to the French Revolution, was the fact that it was the first experiment with democracy. The result is a valiant political stand but a puzzling historical analysis.The book consists of four essays written at various times from 1971 to 1978. In \\"The Revolution is Over\\", Furet counters the Marxist argument that the French Revolution was the model for future Communists political uprisings, or liberations, specifically, the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Furet admits there were similarities between Joseph Stalin and Robespierre, Stalin's purges and the Terror, and Napoleon Bonaparte and Leon Trotsky, however, he emphasizes that the \\"Revolutionary Break\\" which separated the old from the contemporary French histories, ended at 9 Thermidor with absolute power coming full circle, this time, in the hands of society. In the process, Furet attempts to get to the root of such concepts as: \\"revolutionary ideology,\\" and it relationship to \\"plot,\\" and how the opinions of individuals transformed the \\"conscious will\\" of French society into conscious acts. In the second part of the book, Furet critiques the standard cause and effect history of Tocqueville and the \\"traditionalist\\" political history of the French Revolution as penned by Cochin. These historiographical essays are perhaps the strongest part of the book, and most beneficial to serious students of this era, yet overall, the book can be confusing to readers who are not extremely well versed in the history of the French Revolution. Furet's fragmented literary style (Undoubtedly, much has been lost in translation), and the absence of an index; makes the book exceedingly hard to follow. The author makes a number of interesting points, however, his contentions are scattered and do not flow evenly. Furet admits that the second part of the book was written first and perhaps would have made for an easier read had it been published in that order. Furet gears his analysis to an audience who is highly versed in this topic. Overall, the book utilizes an historical event to make a contemporary political stand against Marxism by a contemporary French historian. Not recommended for the beginner."},{"Title":"Microsoft(r) Liquid Motion(tm) by Design","review":"MS Liquid Motion by Design is a great book to get a person animating with Liquid Motion. It makes it easier to be up and running without the hassle of trial and erroring your way through the process. I, for one, found Front Page difficult to crasp the user concept.

The book has helped me understand how things can work better and what things still need work...for example in LM you cannot set up a custom color pallet and save it with the animation, I tried to find a way to do that, but the book clearly said that can not be done.

Chesterton objectively and poetically takes us through a journey of the Christian church, allowing us to see it from afar; thus more clearly----from a different perspective----to think outside the box (as Christ had us do). He brings forth good arguments as he takes the other side in order to get his point across. It is hard to garner the magnificence this book is. The use of metaphors sails right over my head at times, and I am far and away from fully comprehending this work; I understand the need to read it carefully to get his meaning.Chesterton discusses the mysticism that has so flourished since the beginning, (\\"but the first chapters of the romance have been torn out of the book; and we shall never read them\\") and paganism that leads to civilizations downfalls; every effort to confound God ends in disaster. But Christianity has toppled many times; it just shows how stable the foundation is.And as for the creation/evolution debate: Chesterton sets out to prove \\"the rationalist thesis is more irrational than ours\\", and \\"Sometimes the professor with his bone becomes almost as dangerous as a dog with his bone. And the dog at least does not deduce theory from it, proving that mankind is going to the dogs----or that it came from them\\". Primitive doesn't mean mystic or unintelligent nor does civilized mean rational or intellectual; \\"very probable it was exceedingly like the history we do know, except in the one detail that we do not know it. It is thus the very opposite of the pretentious prehistoric history, which professes to trace everything in a consistent course from the amoeba to the anthropod and from the anthropod to the agnostic\\".I do a disservice in trying to explain this difficult work; just read it.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"The case for Christianity is well given.This apologetic assumes the reader has a familiarity with criticisms of Christianity.

Readers family with Lewis will see some similarities but will find Chesterton a bit more difficult to follow.

His incite into human nature, truth and love are well worth reading despite the archaic phrasing."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I do indeed believe that it may be impossible for G.K. Chesterton to disappoint his readers. In his clear, quick-witted brilliance, Chesterton reflects in this text on the utter brilliance of humanity and the Church with respect to the rest of the world. The text, while marked by the major philosophical conversations of the time, remains highly applicable to the world today.His anthropological vision is centered on a polemic against (and dialogue with) biological / cultural evolutionism. While not refuting these claims, he does temper their arguments to a degree. With respect to biological evolution, he posits the fact that man stands starkly out against the background of every other creature. He does not refute the fact that an evolution of growing complexity has occurred the entire way to and including humanity. What he refutes is the notion that humanity is just an \\"ape.\\" Indeed, he is profoundly with Teillhard de Chardin's conviction that the crossing of the threshold of reflection gives the world its soul, for humanity is able to reflect upon perceptions and the self and thus love and sub-create. Culturally, he reflects on the evolutionary understanding of despotism and democracy as well as nomadism and settled life and their interrelationships and development (/non-development).His historic view is one which is wholly Christocentric, seeing the strivings of man in light of Christ. In many ways, Chesterton's reflections are oracular, for he sees the current trembling of Western Civilization far before the present day. Through the light of past mythological and philosophical musings of humanity, he outlines the foibles and follies which were ultimately answered in Christ. By means of this, he fulfills his desire to proclaim how Christianity is truly sane when viewed objectively (not with a hateful bias) from the outside as well as the inside. Additionally, he rails against those who would place Christ and the Church in the same categories as other religious/philosophical founders and their institutions.Ultimately, Chesterton's fantastic text is a standing testimony to the brilliance of humanity, Christ, and the Church in light of the larger picture of the rest of history and the world. The text is astute and witty, receiving my highest lauds and recommendations!"},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"The review is only concerning the physical copy of the book, not its content.This book is not formatted as a novel.

C. S. Lewis credited this book with bringing him to Christ. If you're considering Christianity but have intellectual objections, or if you're a Christian wondering how to explain your faith to inquiring friends, you must read this book.Chesterton himself was a Roman Catholic, but this book lies squarely in the mainstream of the Christian faith, as shared by Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, Evangelicals, and Pentecostals.

I read the first few chapters with due diligence, and found the style and content quite enjoyable. Chesterton does offer many unique turns of phrase and \\"quotable quotes\\". He supplies both humour and interesting thoughts.However, after some time I started getting impatient. My attention wandered as I became a bit fatigued of the style, which began to annoy me a bit as too long-winded. I started skimming rather than reading, then skipping pages, then chapters.This book would be better served as a captivating and brilliant series of lectures. However, in the written medium I prefer more fast-paced and straight-forward language - I read less to enjoy the style than to get the content. That is my own fault, not Chesterton's. As an original thinker and an entertaining wordsmith, he is certainly worthy of the faithful and enthusiastic following that he has commanded since his books were written."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"There seems to be many mistakes about chronology of Chesterton and Lewis. Chesterton died before C.S. Lewis's books really hit the scene. Chesterton 's writings were profoundly influential on Lewis as well- and The Everlasting Man is no exception. This is the definitive work of what might be called &quot;The Old Apologetics&quot; and as such it demands our attention. Chesterton's apologetic runs mostly not in an exegetical trail but in historical and literary ones and forces thinkers outside the field of theology and religion to pay heed to the exacting (and immensely consoling claims) of both Christ and his Church. It is through literary technigue that Chesterton is able to engage us in the topsy-turyvydom of Christ as a Child in the Cave and engages us in history to really confront our unspoken prejudice that the Roman Catholic Church did whatever was in its interest for power and greed. Chesterton asks us- If the Church was so interested in power why did it cast aside the Empire during the reign of Julain the Apostate and other Arians-the very political entity that had thrust the Church into the mainstream was refused a voice in determining its doctrines. So much for the theory that the bishops were just power hungry mongrels.The later chapters dealing with Christian history are especially adept at understanding the intellectual pendulum swings that accompany heresy. One quote should suffice in bringing to our attention teh gifted prose and insight which we all attribute to this great bombast of faith:Here he is speakign of the apparent historical &quot;deaths of the faith&quot;&quot;There are people who say they wish Christianity to remain as a spirit. They mean, very literally, that they wish it to remain a ghost. But it is not going to remain a ghost. What follows this process of an apparent death is not the lingering of the shade; it is the ressurection of the body. These people are quite prepared to shed pious tears and reverential tears over the Sepulchre of the Son of Man; what they are not prepared for is the Son of God walking once more upon this hills of morning. These people, and indeed most people, were indeed by this time quite accostumed to the idea that the old Christian candle-light would fade into the the light of common day. To many of them it did quite honestly appear like that pale yellow flame of when it is left burning in daylight. It was all the more unexpected, and therefore all the more unmistakable, that the seven-branched candle-stick suddently towered to heaven like a miraculous tree and flamed until the sun turned pale. But other ages have seen teh day conquer the candle-light and then the candle-light conquer the day.&quot;Surely this is the prose of one of the most gifted and unfortunately ignored writers of the past century. Chesterton has been called by some &quot;A Master without a Materpiece&quot; but after reading this book one wonders whether some Masterpieces could equal this Master's &quot;Significant Work&quot;"},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Like many other people who were taken in, I was shocked to discover that the entire Introduction had vanished \\"somewhere\\" --- terminated halfway down the first page with a question mark.The rest of the book is set in an awful font (think Courier 10) and riddled with typos --- to such an extent that you actually wonder whether you are getting Chesterton's thoughts.

It's his usual rapid-fire, turn-your-head-around thought, but it is not an easy introduction if you aren't already initiated into Chesterton's style.Still. His insights (in the first chapter) about evolution are so entertaining and sensible that it's worth the price of the book, and if both evolutionists and creationists would read it, it could put some of the fruitless antagonism between them to rest. They miss the main point. Chesterton always seems to point to the main point. Even if his positions are odd, he has a level head.If you're new to Chesterton, try ORTHODOXY first."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I had read two of Chesterton's works prior to Everlasting Man: Orthodoxy and St. Francis of Assisi. From the first paragraph of Orthodoxy I was hooked as Chesterton possesses a wry and ubiquitous wit. That wit, however, is rarer in Everlasting Man as the author employs different tools to separately refute the materialism of novelist HG Wells and the faddish social evolutionism of the era. What results is a history of human spiritual experience from cave paintings to paganism, from Christ to Catholicism.This is no easy read. Chesterton ranges freely through his well-honed arsenal of polemics which requires close attention by the reader and not a small amount of time. Patience applied, however, will reward readers with an elegant apologetic unlike any other they might find. Though Chesterton is directly addressing a contemporary target and a dated worldview, there are principles eternal in what he has to say. He presents the birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ as both the hinge of human history and the key that unlocks the door or, more precisely, the event that unites the philosopher and the theologian in all of us.Everlasting Man is a book with a sublime and invigorating message. It informs faith for, like all effective apologetics, it marries faith with reason. Valuable to believers and agnostics alike, this Chesteron effort, like all others I've read, easily merits 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"The Everlasting Man (1925) is a Christian apologetic by G. K. Chesterton. It is a two-part \\"superficial\\" history of humanity, Jesus Christ, and Christianity, in which Chesterton analyzes what makes humanity unique among species and what makes Christianity unique among faiths. C. S. Lewis has said that this book \\"baptized his intellect.\\"In part one, \\"On the Creature Called Man,\\" Chesterton responds to the arguments of H. G. Wells and others that mankind is really no different from any other animal. Chesterton counters that if so, he is certainly a bizarre and unusual one. Here, Chesterton, who does not deny evolution (he is more interested in dealing with the idea of the soul), cites the vast gaps in evidence between man and his supposed ancestors and points out how science is weak on prehistory, as well as how evolution is not experimental or explanatory.In a similar vein, in part two, \\"On the Man Called Christ,\\" Chesterton counters arguments that Jesus was just another moral teacher with the observation that he was a bizarre and unusual leader that inspired a bizarre and unusual Church that is fundamentally different from any other faith.The first several chapters of the book are absolutely brilliant. Chesterton completely and joyfully demolishes arguments of the evolutionists here, and it's delightful to read because it's obvious that Chesterton himself is having a great time. He moves on in part one to an in-depth examination of human history and culture; you're going to need a pretty extensive background in the humanities to get the full value (in the same way, part two expects the reader to have at least a passing familiarity with comparative religions).Chesterton is at his best when he is deconstructing silly arguments. His explorations into the depths of the classics are not nearly so interesting. His imagery and metaphor can get pretty thick, too.Chesterton demands a lot from his readers - sometimes more than the modern reader is used to giving. The Everlasting Man can be difficult to get through, but it is certainly worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Wilder publications ruined this classic.

He attempts to show the meaning and influence of Christianity upon human history while poking holes in the logic and navel-gazing of anthropologists and other scholars. For the most part, he succeeds in creating an insightful take on the Incarnation and Christianity in general. His sections dealing with the continual death and ressurection of the Church, the meaning and reality of the Incarnation, and the shift of consciousness from paganism to Christian consciousness are sections that should be read by every student of this topic. Chesterton occasionally wanders too much and sometimes is vague about cultural relationships and is a staunch critic and defender of traditional Western Civilization which may offend some readers. Still, he tries to cut through some B.S. and he refreshingly contextualizes Christianity as unique among world religions and as different from mere philosophies."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"A fantastic and must read work by the classic author G.

Do not buy books from Wilder Publications."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"This is a book that everyone ought to read two or three times at least. It is a crime that such nonsense as Conversations With God, or better but still relatively shallow introductions to comparative religion like Religions of Man, seem to be better known. Here you will find a description of Christianity and its relation to other faiths strong and fine as aged wine. I don't know of anyone who writes with this much class in the modern world. Having ordered the book for our college library, I tried not to mark it too much, but found myself putting ink dots on paragraph after paragraph of material I wanted to quote. He rambles a bit, but I think there is more wisdom, humor, and insight in a single page of this book than in whole volumes that are better known in our days. Imagine if, after reading David Barry and laughing your head off, you wanted to go out and kiss a blade of grass or be amazed by the water running in the river instead of (say) looking up at the sky to make sure there aren't any mackerel about to fall on you. G.K.Chesterton makes his readers laugh themselves sane. And sanity is a rare and wonderful thing in the modern world.Chesterton's archeology and contemporary references are a bit dated, of course. But even there, what goes around often comes around. Chesterton leads off with a story about Grant Allen, author of a piece of heresy of that time called &quot;Evolution of the Idea of God.&quot; More recently Karen Armstrong wrote a book with an almost identical title and thesis, &quot;History of God,&quot; and was greeted in the press as a bold thinker. Chesterton kindly and elegantly refuted her error, and those of many other modern skeptics, decades before they were born. Admirers of Bishop Spong in particular should read this book. Chesterton was not a scholar of comparative religions, of course, and he may have oversimplified a few things, but I think got the big things in true proportion better than anyone.The plan of the book is simple. In the first half, Chesterton describes man, particularly in his religious aspect. In particular, he explains four universal elements of human religion: mythology, philosophy, demonism, and an awareness of God that one finds in almost every culture around the world. The tendency in the modern world is to ignore the last two elements when they occur outside of Western culture. But I have found in my own studies of Asian cultures and religions that Chesterton's description of human religion fit the facts extremely well.The second half of the book is about Jesus and the movement he founded. I like what he says about Jesus best, and wish he had spent more time on that and proportionally less on European culture. A few of his racial or cultural assumptions do not come across well in our age. It is worth remembering how the face of Christianity has changed over the hundred years since this book was published. Then Christianity was almost exclusively a Western religion, while now two thirds of the believers in the world live in Africa, Latin American and Asia.If you are interested in a more detailed discussion of some of the points Chesterton brings up, I suggest Don Richardson's Eternity in Their Hearts, another of the most overlooked works of the 20th Century. I have also just written a book called Jesus and the Religions of Man, that covers in more detail (but undoubtedly with less style) much of the same territory.d.marshall@sun.ac.jp"},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I've reread this book after ten years and found it just as astonishing a work as I did the first time around. Chesterton is a consummate apologist, combining a sincere reverence for his subject matter with a devastating sense of humour and a true generalist's erudition. He has a wonderful ability of taking accepted secular dogmas, turning them completely on their heads, and in the process making Catholic dogmas, rejected for their lack of congruence with modernism, look sensible and enlightened. This polemical mastery is one of the enduring qualities of &quot;The Everlasting Man&quot;.Although much of the first part of the book may seem dated (it consists mostly of a friendly attack on H.G. Wells anti-Christian &quot;Outline of History&quot;) Chesterton's points are still well taken. Many of his musings on evolution can be put to use today against the adherents of creationism as well as the scientifically arrogant. Although he takes 50 pages to say it (he IS a bit of a windbag, but his blustery style and curmudgeonly wit makes it enjoyable all the while), his point about the anthropology of his day is that it is inherently incapable of explaining the irreconcilable chasm between man and the critters he may have materially evolved from. And this difference is constituted by Mind, or by man's soul, as manifested primarily (for Chesterton) in art and religion. One could add science. His illustrations on this point are hilarious. He draws the silly images of cows writing sonatas, sheep practising an elaborate form of ancestor worship, and dogs in solemn procession wearing canine mitres and swinging censers smouldering with dog-appealing scents. All to show the gap that separates us from the animals.When he moves to specifically Christian apologetics, Chesterton presents a theory of history that, though it bears an obvious resemblance to Augustine's philosophy of history, is remarkably unique and dramatically compelling. The chapter on the war of the gods and demons will assure that you never again think of the Punic Wars in the same way. It also puts to rest much nonsensical multi-culturalist cant.And indeed this constant struggle, in history, between two supernatural forces permeates Chesterton's sense of history; another similarity to Augustine. However, he is not by any means a Manichean. He is constantly pointing out the marvels of the salvation story and falls prostrate in stricken awe at the very idea of the Incarnation being a fact.And this is the point of the book; namely, to reinvigorate the awesomeness of that Idea and, more importantly, that Fact, by trying to tell it anew, and by asserting and demonstrating that nothing in modernity or before has ever been able to contradict it, nor to dissuade the millions who have pinned their hope to and derived their inspiration from it."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Everlasting Man had a decisive role in one of the most important conversions of the this century. C.S. Lewis described reading it in 1925 when he was still an atheist:Then I read Chesterton's Everlasting Man and for the first time saw the whole Christian outline of history set out in a form that seemed to me to make sense . . . I already thought Chesterton the most sensible man alive &quot;apart from his Christianity.&quot; Now, I veritably believe, I thought that Christianity itself was very sensible &quot;apart from its Christianity.&quot; (Surprised by Joy p.223)When asked what Christian writers had helped him, Lewis remarked in 1963, six months before he died, &quot;The contemporary book that has helped me the most is Chesterton's The Everlasting Man.&quot; (God in the Dock p.260.)The book has two parts. The first is titled &quot;On the Creature called Man.&quot; It uses the available evidence from paleontology, an! cient history, comparative religions, etc. but brings it together in remarkable ways. The questions he asks (and to some extent, answers) are the ones we continue to brood over: How is man different from other animals? Why are there so many religions? How do we make some sense out of our long and tumultuous human history?The questions raised in the first part receive a more definitive answer in the second: &quot;On the Man called Christ.&quot; It is not that Jesus gives a step by step response to each of the queries. Rather he begins by throwing us into an even more perplexing quandary. Chesterton asks what it would really be like to read the Gospel free of all preconceptions. The effect would not be &quot;gentle Jesus, meek and mild,&quot; but rather someone who jars our sensibilities. As Chesterton points out, the most honest response might be &quot;stark staring incredulity.&quot; Did he really do that? How could he say something so preposterous?Chesterton's genius ! is to help us face the paradox, the seeming contradiction. ! Really there are only two possible responses to the riddle of the Gospel. Either Jesus is a blashemer (as Caiphas charged) or he is who he claimed to be--and the apostles professed him to be. In that claim Jesus is unique. Mohamet did not suggest equality with Allah. Moses was never placed on a par with Yahweh. Buddha, Zoroaster, Confucius never made assertions of divinity. Those who did were megolomaniacs like Caligula or the unfortunate people we confine to insane asylums. Yet few consider that Jesus was that kind of person. Chesterton, like C.S. Lewis after him, helps us confront the incredible implications of this greatest of all paradoxes.He then asks the next logical question. Is the Church a continuation of Jesus or a breaking away from him? The first might seem hard to accept, but the second involves even greater difficulties. As a help to making the correct choice, Chesterton asks us to reflect on the analogy of a key. Its truth depends on whether it fits the lock! . You won't get very far analyzing its seemingly odd shape. What you have to is see if it opens the door.In reflecting on the key (the creed) Chesterton uses what he calls &quot;the witness of the heretics.&quot; (a.k.a. dissenters) Each one tried to reshape the key. The church has constantly resisted that. As Chesterton brilliantly illustrates, only if the key retains its shape will it unlock the door.In the final chapter Chesterton gives one of the most remarkable arguments for the truth of faith: the &quot;five deaths&quot; of the Church. We are not the first ones to live in an age which has concluded the church was moribund, pass&eacute;. But it has experienced some remarkable resurrections like a phoenix rising from its own ashes. Chesterton analyzes five times when that happened and offers his reflection on what that means for us today.I say &quot;today&quot; because even tho Everlasting Man was written almost 75 years ago, it addresses many concerns which are stil! l current: evolution, feminism, historicism, cultural relati! vism, economic and social determinism, etc. It is salutary to see that back in the 20's these issues were already &quot;old stuff.&quot; TV programs and magazine articles meant to be bold or shocking all of a sudden seem hackneyed.In addition to its other merits, this book has the value of being immensely entertaining. Not that it is an easy read. In fact it requires a lot of concentration. Chesterton sometimes piles paradox upon paradox in a way that one can feel dazzled and conclude he does not have substance behind his words. But that is a hasty conclusion. To read Chesterton requires a patience which is perhaps more difficult in our age. Yet to read him slowly and meditatively will bring great rewards."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Chesterton traces the development of religion from cave man to Christian in this comprehensive and compelling work of Catholic apologetics. He begins by convincingly (if somewhat repetitively) taking apart the theory of evolution, demonstrating that the evolutionist's coldly secular, sociological explanations of prehistoric man's religious development have no basis in fact. He next turns to the pagan world with a mesmerizing analysis of the supreme conflict between the Romans, who represented the best of paganism, and the Carthaginians, who represented the worst. A victorious Carthage would have plunged humanity into an abyss of devil-worshipping inhumanity; Rome, by fighting against all odds for an ennobling vision of man, family and society, established a civilization human enough to receive Jesus Christ. Upon turning to our Lord, Chesterton elegantly dismantles a variety of arguments against His divinity, showing how all interpretations of Jesus that are less than the Gospels are, in the end, less believable and less rational than the Gospels. The Church is then compared and contrasted to Hinduism, Confucianism, Islam, and Buddhism. In Chesterton's view, Islam is \\"militant but no church\\", and these other belief systems are essentially pagan mythologies; the critical point is none of these systems rises to the level of Christianity in terms of spiritual relevance and truth. He then delves deep into the Eastern mind, rooted in a changeless, cavernous past, contrasting it to Western mind, profoundly and utterly recast by the relatively recent Incarnation. His analysis culminates with magnificent insights on Christianity as a story: philosophies are static and circular, ending where they begin, whereas Christianity stands alone as a philosophy that moves, initially with the journey of Christ, and then with the spiritual journeys that we ourselves must make. Thus Christianity alone can inspire us and teach us how to move forward and upward, spiritually and in all other ways. It is a greater philosophy than all other philosophies for this reason, and it is a greater story than other stories because it is true. Great ideas and historical insights abound in this work. I can't imagine anyone, regardless of his religion or non-religion, reading this and not being moved somewhere, somehow."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"This may have been a fine work in its original form, but this edition (Wilder Publications, 2008) is so shoddy, it isn't worth the effort to try to read it.

Chesterton's introduction, a dozen pages long in another edition, ends abruptly six and a half sentences into the second paragraph with a question mark.Clearly the publisher did little more than scan another version into his computer, run OCR software, and click the print button. How can any publisher have so little respect for himself as to sell such an embarrassment? How can any literate human being have so little respect for G.K. Chesterton as to publish The Everlasting Man without so much as a single thorough reading? It is disgraceful.Buy another edition. If you try to read this, you will suffer the jarring experience of stumbling over sudden gibberish or silent omissions while trying to wrap your mind around Chesterton's deep arguments - again and again and again."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Chesterton is one of the great authors of our time and this book is no exception to the rule. Though I prefered the book St. Thomas Aquinas: the Dumb Ox, by him, The Everlasting Man is none-the-less a fantastic book.As an answer to G.B. Shaw and H.G. Wells, Chesterton skillfully defends the Catholic and Christian against the modernist attacks which claim that Science and Religion are in conflict. Aquinas would be proud himself of Chersterton's use of Aristotle, who even Darwin claimed to be &quot;the greatest biologist in history&quot;.I highly recommend any Chesterton book to any reader interested in the history of philosophy, theology and man's origens. Also, you don't need a doctorate or a thesaurus to read Chesterton's witty writing.Adam"},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I won't attempt so summarize this book, as other reviewers have done a very thorough job and anything I add will be superfluous. I can say that, having read HG Wells' Outline of History, it is thoroughly out of date, almost ridiculously so, while this book, equally old, is just as new in terms of ideas as the day it was published. Chesterton is simply the most amazing writer in terms of his originality that I have ever read. No wonder it has been so influentual over the years. Chesterton is extremely enjoyable to read just for the sake of reading. I remember having to read Chesterton in high school (St Francis of Assisi, I believe) and hating it, mostly because it was assigned work and not pleasure. If you read Chesterton, you have to enjoy great writing, as well as his great ideas and rather unique way of viewing reality."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I have never come across a book such as \\"The Everlasting Man\\" and I am profoundly thankful I did. CS Lewis said that this book \\"baptized his intellect,\\" and he was spot on. In a world where hundreds of stories are being told about mankind it is easy to unconsciously adopt many of the culture's erroneous views. Chesterton constructs a lucid picture of the story of mankind and how Christianity provides the key for understanding it. I highly recommend this book for someone who is struggling to reconcile his or her faith with increasing secular perspective of humanity. The book really does provide a key for understanding how evolution, ancient civilizations and history after Christ fit in with God's salvation history. What I loved most about Chesterton was the use of his logic, clear and unflinching, showing clear flaws in many of the attacks on the Christian faith. The Everlasting Man will provide a sane lens through which to view the world and deepen the roots of our Christian faith."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"This review is on the edition of this book, and not the content of the book itself. The font size is miniscule, the book is of an unmanageable size. It is a completely unpractical and useless edition of this (fantastic) book. Avoid at all costs."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"There were at least 100 typos, misspellings, punctuation and grammatical errors. It wasn't an easily read book for me anyhow, but these mistakes on nearly every page made it grueling. I've ordered the same book from a different publisher, as I really want to read it again without all the printing errors."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Chesterton is brilliant. His use of language, humor, and metaphor are great enough to garner him praise, but the ideas and philosophy are what keep me thinking late at night long past the final page of the day. He paints the entire picture of human history through a distinctly and believably Catholic view, one that he never compromises or attempts to hide. Each idea he puts forth has been thought about from every angle and argument. He has provided insight into faith and how this world has always been God's, from the first men to think and have belief. I particularly enjoyed his sections on the first evidence of cavemen, the schism between mythology and theology and how the two came to be combined in Christianity, as well as his discussion on how Christ should not be compared to other religious leaders because he is wholly different.However, despite his intelligence and wit present throughout, he can be difficult to read. I consider myself quite a quick reader, but I found myself struggling to finish each chapter. He packs so many new thoughts into each page that I have to stop and decompress what I have learned at almost every paragraph. That, coupled with the fact that his writing is understandably a bit archaic, made reading a bit of a chore. A compelling, insightful chore that I never wanted to stop, but a chore nonetheless. Also, a couple of his ideas are a bit antiquated; mostly his use of words towards China (the Orient) and Mohammed (Mahomet), and his use of the term of the \\"church militant,\\" which means something different to most modern readers. This may strike those modern readers unacquainted with older works as offensive. Overall, the difficulty of reading is nothing to be surprising given the work's age, and I recommend it to anyone interested in Christianity as a holistic way of viewing history, whether from a believer's viewpoint or a skeptic.Unfortunately this printing of Chesterton's work was mediocre. This is the sole reason for 3 stars. The pen I used to underline quotes had to also be employed to add punctuation. On almost every page there were mistakes. Occasionally there were misspelled words or incorrect spacing, but by far the most common was simply missing periods throughout. This is a shame, because the font size and shape, quality of paper and cover were all excellent. Also, it would have been beneficial for the date of original publication to be included in the work, simply so that potentially uninformed readers can know when the book was written."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Do not waste your money on this edition! Too many typos to count! I was unable to continue reading this edition, I have ordered the Oxford City Press edition. How can anyone with any morals, or ethics, offer such a poor quality book for sale to retailers?"},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Anything that Gilbert Keith Chesterton wrote is worth reading. He was capable of serious matters as well as humorous writings and his The Adventures of Father Brown as an 'amateur' detective are fascinating."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"The book is good so far. However the Kindle version has quite a few typos such as 'bad' instead of 'had', or 'be' instead of 'he'. It can get kind of annoying."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"G.K. Chesterton's work deserves a much better printing than this one offered by Wilder Publications. I purchased the paperback copy and was astounded by the number of typos and poor quality of printing. I have to wonder if anyone even proofread this edition before it was printed. Numerous words are spelled wrong throughout the text: \\"bad\\" for \\"had\\" and \\"modem\\" for \\"modern\\" are just two frequent examples. The type is close together and very difficult to read. Skip this edition and find a quality hardback copy from earlier printings (1950s or 1960s)."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Love this book, but this edition is filled with typographical errors. There is hardly a page that does not have punctuation errors--periods and commas appearting for no reason in the middle of phrases--words misspelled by typo--\\"band\\" substituted for \\"hand\\" in numerous places, \\"bad\\" substituted for \\"had\\" in many places. And worst of all, there are places where the entire sense of a sentence is completely lost--a thought is not finished or a sentence is left incomplete. It is a shame, because Chesterton has such a bravura command of the language that it is jarring to have to weed through so many mistakes. Unfortunately, some of the mistakes are not ones in which you can easily determine the original sense. This book is so good that if you can get it in no other form than this, it is still worth reading, but I would love to obtain an edition that is well edited and proofread. I bought this because there are some public domain editions online that have similar textual problems and I was hoping to obtain a clean text of the book by purchasing it--unfortunately this printed edition is worse than many of the online ones. Guess I'll be on the lookout for an original first edition."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Chesterton's book is absolutely wonderful...but this printing is dreadful. The 2008 Wilder Publications version of this classic book is ABRIDGED (whether on purpose or by mistake I cannot tell) and contains typographical errors.Several pages of text are missing from the introduction to this book. In the first chapter I found a question mark taking the place of a letter in the middle of a word, several puctuation marks missing, run-on sentances that were not in the author's original work, and paragraphs tied together without breaks.I really want to continue to read this book but the careless editing has made this version too difficult to read.I intend to return this book and purchase the 2011 Complete and Unabridged version from different publisher (The complete and unabridged paperback is also available from Amazon)."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"First, as expected, the book itself by Chesterton is astounding. He's one of the most insightful and inspiring Catholic writers of the twentieth century and in this book he is at his best. However, there are plenty of problems with the editing and publishing of this book.So that leads me to my second point: these people obviously did not proof read this book before selling it. They must have used OCR software which is never flawless, printed it to a page and made a book. At times it is even hard to read and I can't figure out what a sentence is supposed to mean. The letters \\"b\\" and \\"m\\" sometimes take the place of each other and \\"r\\" and \\"n\\" blend into \\"m.\\" So, for example, the word \\"modern\\" end up being printed as \\"modem.\\" There are also countless punctuation errors, missing or even repeated words, and occasionally there will even be a question mark right in the middle of the word where the software could not figure it out.In conclusion, I urge the customer to just go with a different publisher."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Now I know why C.S. Lewis loved this book so much. Sometimes the book is hard to read but other than that is great for the Christian Apologetic. It is a great feeling to know that G.K. Chesterton converted to the Catholic Church shortly after C.S.Lewis died. C.S. Lewis also, in my opinion, would have converted to the Catholic Church given more time(Considering his belief in Purgatory and other Catholic beliefs), they are both one of the greatest christian minds in History. Read C.S. Lewis &quot;letter to Malcolm&quot; and the &quot;Abolition of Man&quot;, and &quot;The problem of Evil&quot; to see other great Christian apologetics."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"This book opens up with a very strange discussion concerning our conventional assumptions regarding the &quot;cave man&quot;, primitive man, and Neanderthals in general. Chesterton seems to believe that these people were much more intelligent and sophisticated than we give them credit for being. I interpreted this to be a sort of refutation or denial of Darwinism, although Darwinism is rarely if ever mentioned specifically. By assuming the cave man to be a more sophisticated spiritual being than previously assumed, Chesterton seems to be implying that these people had a direct relationship with God. From this we must assume that the cave man does not represent the &quot;missing link&quot; or evolutionary transitory species that would be critical to upholding Darwinism. In other words, Chesterton is trying to refute Darwinism by uplifting the cave man closer to our current level of intelligence, rather than degrade him into a neo-primate type creature representing a transitional phase between archaic primates and man. I will leave it to the reader to decide if this denial of Darwinism is convincing. But all the objective scientific purists out there will probably not be convinced by much of what Chesterton has to say, because he does not provide much in the way of scientific proof or examples. For some this might be an unpardonable sin, but in my opinion, this book is enhanced by the fact that it doesn't get bogged down with boring empirical details. Chesterton's non-scientific approach is refreshing in that it it readable, free-flowing, speculative, and somewhat instinctual. Although Chesterton relies heavily on his gut-feelings, and is highly speculative in his conclusions, the witty and down-to-earth writing style more than makes up for any lack of boring, scientific methodology in supporting these conclusions.This book is ideal for people who want to find the right balance between a book that is informative and thought-provoking on the one hand, but readable and enjoyable on the other. Sometimes it is important to forgoe enjoyment in the name of uncovering unbiased, objective truth, and granted, Chesterton does not establish anything close to such an objective, empirical truth in this book. However, there is a need for a style of free-flowing speculation, uninhibited and unencumbered by scientific rigour. It makes for a more enjoyable philosophy, which can cover more ground by being more generalized and all-encompassing, and less narrowly focused and specialized. In the end, much of what Chesterton has to say is sensible, plausible, and believable. We should take this book seriously; just not TOO seriously. I highly recommend this book to someone who wants a down-to-earth philosophical chat with one of the most skilled English authors of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Chesterton was undoubtably a genius. I am certain that this book has great value and meaning but I found it beyond my ability to dig it out. The language is full of idoms and references from late nineteenth and early twentieth century England which I could not comprehend without tremendous effort. I gave up on it."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I am a beginner Catholic! this book was very hard for me to read, as I did not understand it. I did not read very much of it. Thanks"},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I have no additional comments. The book is in pristine condition. I look forward to reading it."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I don't think anyone, even the most enthusiastic disciple of Chesterton, can deny that this book dated badly.Then again, the task it undertook--justifying all of human history from a Christian perspective--was colossal, and Chesterton himself admits the discrepancy between it and this fairly short, often comic tract. It serves best as a refutation of certain other standpoints, many of which are so silly no even remembers them today (from Malthus to H.G. Wells, Chesterton's truth has certainly outlived that of many of his \\"opponents\\"--and while we still revere Shaw as a dramatist, we hardly revere him as a social critic), and many of the arguments it uses are ingenious, considered on their own. But the work as a whole is flawed.At the end of the Brothers Karamazov, in a heated court case, two criminal lawyers both accuse each other of weaving \\"romances\\" that, however appealing and sympathetic to human reason they may be, fail to confront the actual facts of the case--and I'm afraid that very often Chesterton veers from the territory of \\"good common sense\\" into outright romance. As evidence, there are few passages in Chesterton more brilliant, more evocative, more poetically stirring than his description of Rome at war with Carthage--and few passages with less connection to historical reality. The Carthaginians may or may not have practiced human sacrifice, but to portray them as a despotic, demoniacal power, Satan's headquarters in North Africa, is surely taking some liberty.Finally, I think that Chesterton's aim may have been somewhat flawed to begin with. A well-grounded Christian belief by no means requires that creation has been ordered, in every particular, in a certain way throughout history, or that all historic events (which are after all contingent on human will) fit in with a certain heavenly plan. People love nothing more than to sketch such plans, but imaginary \\"plans\\" is all they are--and Chesterton's, in the end, stands beside those of Marx and others as mere hypothesis, with no end of defects. What Chesterton says is often very plausible, and could be right--but other, conflicting accounts ring equally true. His view of the relations between paganism and Christianity, the \\"west\\" and the \\"orient,\\" civilization and barbarism, all deserve consideration; but they have no real authority. This leads his very clever apologetics somewhat astray, creating arguments that fail to resolve in the same organic way that they do in the much superior Orthodoxy. Chesterton's religious apologetics, merely as such, stand the test of time much better than his historical speculation.But finally--why is this book always wrapped in plastic whenever I see it on the shelf? Are they afraid it will injure customers? It's the only book I ever see that gets this treatment."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I can't help but smile while skimming over some of the previous criticisms and praises for Chesterton. They are what one should expect after having read this work. For instance, one reviewer (Sam) seems to be terribly confused about the issues. His claim that GK's argument in the beginning of the book is meaningless is based on his misunderstanding of important distinctions one must have upon reading this book. One, which was the whole point of his argument against materialistic evolution, was that the difference between the mind of a man and that of a different animal was one of KIND and not degree like Chesterton so emphatically and explicitly stated (for instance humans create art, think rationally, have the desire and the ability to write poetry, etc, etc). These are the things that did not start in the mind of an animal and grow \\"exponentially\\" into evolved species like man. These are the things that began in the mind of man, and did not exist previously whatsoever. These are the Creation of man, or rather the creation of God manifested in the mind of man. Sam attempts to refute this argument by showing that the minds of different animals differ in degree. This does not even touch Chesterton's argument. Neither does his point that GK doesn't take on the argument scientifically. But, why should he? This brings us to the next distinction one must understand. That is between a materialistic, godless evolution and merely evolution as a scientific explanation. Chesterton doesn't argue against the latter and even states he has no problem in believing it. What he does argue against is the former which is certainly a philosophical or metaphysical question. And this is where he takes it on.Secondly, I really think Chesterton would lament to find people considering him sarcastic and aggressive in a negative manner. For the truth is, nothing could be the reverse. This book is what Chesterton was: fun. He is too light hearted to be taken seriously when he is sarcastic. He is only sarcastic in a playful, jesting manner. And I believe he was driven to do so in order to keep his sanity from the millions of utterly silly criticisms he read and heard from so many people who were too lazy and dishonest to think things through before they hastily chastised the truth. Instead of getting angry, he laughed at their silliness and exposed it with so much wit as to make everyone join him in a merriment of laughter.This brings us to Chesterton's style, which some of those, who liked the purpose of the book, didn't enjoy. It is a shame because I prefer his style immeasurably to most authors I've read. It is almost my favorite part. I know when I read Chesterton I will learn many truths (and indeed the most unexpected and extraordinary ones which he instinctively pursued) but what I enjoy to a nearly equal measure is the manner in which they are conveyed. The shame is that his style is dead, which is why I think many people of our time do not appreciate it; they are completely unaccustomed to its alarming beauty. Although it is unique, Chesterton has a very classic style of writing as opposed to what is most common today... the practical, straightforward approach. GK writes like he is painting a picture, it is in fact because this is what he does and no one of our time writes non-fiction this way. He writes non-fiction as if it is a piece of literature filled with all the devices that make literature so enjoyable and moving. Chesterton remarked near the end of the book, that Christianity is the one religion where the two halves of the brain meet, where the philosopher and the priest kiss for the first time, where the art and imagination of a story coincides with rigorous rational thought and theology. Nothing could be more true of Chesterton's own writing. Some say he is a masterful logician. He is, but the beauty is that he is so much more. This book has the quality of being written both by a child and a sage. \\"Both a baby and an old man walk with difficulty; but he who shall expect the old gentleman to lie on his back, and kick joyfully instead, will be disappointed.\\" Chesterton refuted his own point, by his very life, for he did kick joyfully. His perspectives are all so fresh and new as if he sees the whole world for the first time coming out of his mother's womb. Combined with his \\"colossal genius\\" (as Bernard Shaw put it), his writing makes for this most sublime tandem. And this refutes the worst of all arguments made by a reviewer. That Chesterton tried to fit the facts in with his beliefs, that he was prejudiced and distasteful, as if it wasn't his aim to find truth. It is a well known fact that Chesterton did the very opposite, he came to the faith after reading nothing (philosophically that is) except skeptical writings. This is precisely why Chesterton is so good at apologetics. Most of the time he doesn't even need to be novel, he merely refutes the skeptics by the very arguments of the skeptics, and he does it with such alarming frequency.GK is driven to writing this book artistically and poetically not only because it is his style, and a better read, but because many of the points of this book are ones which are obvious to him but nevertheless very subtle, although important. Chesterton never rambles to no end. What he does is move in many directions in his scattered mind, almost errantly, but always coming back to a point, as sharp and piercing as a spear (to steal an analogy). He never in reality rambles, it is just that the picture is so large and filled with such rich subtlety that he moves in great lengths to paint the whole thing before it is done. This is why no paragraph, or even page, he writes should be read in isolation or great misinterpretations will naturally occur (especially by those who so naturally jump to criticize before being thoughtful and deliberate which is what Chesterton so clearly and passionately disliked). This is also why this book and much of his writing is very enjoyable and enriching to read many times over."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I was introduced to Chesterton after reading Gary Wills. While he is definately a good logician the part that I find somewhat annoying is the way in which he writes. I seriously do not understand why the other reviewers claim that he has such eloquence and style. Eloquence, yes, I can agree to that, style... maybe it's just my preference. The part that annoys is the way he includes around 3 similes to prove his point. Yes, he is a really good logician, particularly on how he argues against Evolution within the first part of the book. But it gets tiresome when that particular style goes on and on and on.The good part about the book would be his argument for Religion rather than for Christianity per say, although the second part would argue for Christianity he managed to tone it down to being logical rather than fundamental.It's interesting how he breaks up religious thought into 4 types (minus the church) God; the Gods; the Demons; the Philosophers. He goes on to expound on the differences and why ultimately, Christianity should be 'THE' way that one should follow.For a man of his time he did put in alot of effort in comparing other religions or rather using them as an example like how a cat would play with its food before devouring only part of it, to prove his point. His footnotes helped a little, particularly on the more obscure religious sects. Anyhow, it is someone unpalatable as a book due to his borderline sarcasm, which I would give him the benefit of the doubt by saying that he is a overly passionate writing about this topic, but still its not particularly intriguing or enlightening.Probably cause I live in a Muslim country, raised as a Catholic, studied Confucious in school and later Buddhism in university."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Chesterton is an old familiar name, and The Everlating Man, one of his better works. At first blush then there would appear to be no need, or at least a great need, to review this fine book. Yet, the Roman Catholic Church itself has fallen into error, and even heresy since Vatican II, and therefore 'The Everlasting Man' is a far greater book now than when it was published, because it presents the genuine viewpoint of Catholocism, not the 'feelgood' view so popular today. For those unfamiliar with the tumultuous controversy within the Catholic Church today, it must suffice that the Vatican quite literally abandoned the idea of objective truth as a doctrine, and replaced that doctrine with subjective truth. Everything is a point of view, we are told, because truth expands as man matures. Now, for Chesterton, a truth is a truth, and no comment on a truth, will stop a truth from remaining a truth. Therefore throughout the history of the Church, a doctrine, no matter how popular,no matter how well received, is always overthrown, when it is false. The magic of this book is reading of historical events with this point of view in the background. The rise of Islam and its defeat in Europe, the Arian heresy etc. But the important point of the book today is this: Though the Vatican II Church appears impregnantable, it will fail, and if history is a guide, it will fail rather quickly. For any Catholic who wishes to understand the genuine Catholic viewpoint, and therefore understand through implication the mistakes of Vatican II, this is the book to buy."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"The civilisation of antiquity was the whole world, and men no more dreamed of its ending than of the ending of daylight; yet the civilisation of that world has passed away, but the words of Christ have not passed away, according to G K Chesterton in this book. The book, which was first published in 1925, is a polemical response to the critics of Christianity, the Church and Christendom.In response to those who anticipate the imminent death of Christianity, Chesterton replies that Christianity has died many times and risen again. Christianity had become the emperor's religion under Constantine, but Julian, the last emperor in the Constantinian dynasty, killed off Christianity and restored paganism. However, the faith rose again. Two centuries later when Christianity was on the wane, missionaries from Ireland reignited the flame across Europe. The arrival of Islam looked certain to end Christianity, but the faith rose again. The paganism of the Renaissance was supposed to end Christianity, as was the humanism of the Enlightenment.It is interesting to note how little the grounds of argument have changed from those named by Chesterton more than 85 years ago. However, Chesterton's responses are steeped in the world of classical civilisation, and they assume that the reader has a good understanding of Greek and Roman history, philosophy and literature. Unfortunately this means that the book is heavy going for the typical modern reader."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"The book is great, the kindle format is odd. There are some places where there isaspacelacking between two - five words, or places where there is a space right in the mid dle of a wo rd. there are. also spots where there. are random periods in the middle of a sentence. None of these things make a book impossible to read but they do slow you down or remove your focus from the content and place in on the formatting and that will lose you a star."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Bottom line: Love the work, hate the editors and printers.This book (especially the first 30 pages) is rife with printing errors, misplaced punctuation, and phantom paragraphs. Who edited this book?!The work itself is truly brilliant. Evolutionary thought has come a long way from the theory of slow and rolling accent to punctuated equilibrium, but don't let the limited knowledge of science stop the argument. I think the brilliance of the work comes from the pure questioning of what science and the men of Chesterton's age are getting at. Chesterton is the gadfly."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I love the book and the logic. It is a glorious review of the way the world looks at things that are still relevant in the 21st Century. There are references which may be difficult for some readers because they are to some literary or political characters of the past but that can be overcome by doing a little research. However the one issue I had is that the Kindle Edition had a lot of problems, where the letter \\"h\\" appears as \\"b\\" and so I often had to reread a sentence if it weren't obvious at first. I hope that they correct this in future versions."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Don't get me wrong - it's a great book, but this edition is awful. It has amateur written all over it. There are far too many words per page. The font, line spacing, and margins are too small. This makes reading extremely tedious and annotations difficult. Second, there are an inexcusable number of typographical errors. Third, the page numbers are in the bottom center. Fourth, the cover is poorly designed. The front picture covers half the spine, and the font on the back blurb is disproportionately large."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I already owned a new hardback version of this book (the one that is widely available on Amazon) but I hated the cover, and the print was ugly and full of typos. I bought one of these older versions (1926) and I could not be more pleased. The aesthetics of the older book are much more in keeping with its content and, to me, it was worth every [extra] penny.On the off chance that you are looking for the collectible version of a book you have never read, know this: The Everlasting Man by G. K. Chesterton is one of the best works from one of the best writers the world has ever seen. The union of style, depth, entertainment value and original, authentic inspirational quality found in this work is truly monumental. Do not miss this book if you care about experiencing the full potential of life, and literature."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"The book itself is an excellent piece of literature; it is an insightful examination of civilization, religion, and philosophy. In my opinion, it is absolutely essential reading for any Christian studying comparative religion.Unfortunately, it is literally the most poorly edited book I have ever read. It appears that an old edition of the book was scanned into a computer, run through some OCR program, and then published, without ever having been proofread. I cannot imagine why someone would publish such a terrible piece of work; I cannot imagine why Amazon would sell it. In the two-paragraph preface, there are three obvious mistakes, one of which renders unintelligible the last sentence. I wish that this were an unfair sample, but the rest of the book continues the tradition of having two or three mistakes on every page, at the very least.Chesterton's words are, as usual, fantastic, but the absurdly shoddy editing makes it as hard to concentrate on them as would a mosquito buzzing in one's ear. Most people will find a few extra dollars for a halfway-decent edition to be fully justified."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"All of the reviews of this book are right on - it is a watershed in Christian and Catholic apologetics.EVERY CUSTOMER SHOULD KNOW, HOWEVER, THAT THIS BOOK HAS 5 TYPOS IN EVERY PARAGRAPH.

I would recommend another publisher."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"In this work by a great author of the early twentieth century, the story of Christ is examined closely, and his place in history evaluated. Chesterton argues that the Christian myth is different from other myths, most obviously because he declares it is true, but also for other reasons which he details throughout this work. In a painfully brief (as he himself admits) summary of the history of \`historic' mankind, Chesterton evaluates the evolution of pagan thought and outlines what, in his mind, prepared the world for the coming of the Son of Man.Chesterton's case is very strong. His thesis, essentially, is that the Christian \\"myth\\" is unfit to be held side by side with other myths, both because it is more believable and because it is more fantastic. With his daunting command of words and argument, Chesterton presents the case that Christianity is different because it is true, and for that reason it has not passed, as other systems of belief have.This book is most notable for the impact it had on CS Lewis, a great admirer of Chesterton. Lewis owed much of his belief, even part of his conversion, to Chesterton's work, and this one in particular. Fans of CS Lewis will enjoy this book, though they should be forewarned that it is not a case strictly for Christianity. Chesterton was a Catholic, and he does not stop with arguing for Christianity, but rather continues by arguing for the Catholic faith as well. I think he could have reached a broader audience by remaining aloof from denominational dispute, and for that reason I gave it four stars. Still, this is an excellent, thought-provoking work worthy of any student of Christian apology's attention."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Chesterton's purpose in writing this book is crucial to understanding what you are reading. Chesterton writes to an audience under the assumption that they are familiar with the people, places, events, philosophies, etc. that he cites. This book is not Chesterton's in-depth analysis of Christianity in contrast to other religions. It was written in response to H.G. Wells' \\"Outline of History,\\" in which Wells' gave an account of history from his philosophical standpoint. \\"The Everlasting Man\\" is Chesterton's account of history from his philosophical standpoint.\\"The Everlasting Man\\" is a challenge to the modern thinker to reassess what is considered to be common knowledge. The book is divided into two sections called \\"On The Creature Called Man\\" and \\"On The Man Called Christ,\\" which appear in that respective order. The main theme of the first section of the book is that the scientific mind does not see the true uniquity of man in contrast to the rest of the natural world, and that modern historians, in their assessments of history, tend to misunderstand and misinterpret those primary motivations (e.g. familiy, pleasure, religion) which have historically been most important to mankind; especially in the areas of religion and philosophy.The main theme of the second book is that the character of Christ is unique from other religious figures and gods in a way that those figures and gods are not even unique from one another. Chesterton argues that philosophy and religion are like two rivers which run alongside one another, unpurged, \\"until they meet in the sea of Christendom.\\" He argues that Christ is the catalyst to the mergence of philosophy and religion by being at once both man (corporeal, thus satisfying the philosopher) and God (metaphysical, thus satisfying the mystic) and that the person of Christ satisfies what pagan religions had been hinting at and looking for throughout history.Chesterton ends by noting the resilience of both the Christian Church and the person of Christ in history, and says that the outworkings of this resilience is the fulfillment of Christ's words, \\"Heaven and Earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.\\" (Matthew 24:35, NASB)Chesterton does not attempt to give a scrupulous apologetic, but rather argues from the perspective of the big-picture of history. He argues that history, when seen from the modern scientific or historical perspective, is incongruent with what we know of humanity and that when one takes into account what we do know of man, history looks much different than what is generally taught in the modern world.This is an excellent read. This book has, in many ways, helped me not only to see Christianity in a new light, but also helped me to understand where the pagan religions were coming from. I would reccomend this to anyone who wants to read a Christian interpretation of history that makes sense. The only major drawback for me is that Chesterton sometimes glosses over the atrocities of the Church and puts too much emphasis on the Church's purity without taking into account its bloody history. However, it is still an excellent read. I doubt many minds like Chesterton's, if any, will come again in our lifetimes. In all truthfulness, I would give this book a 5. I only gave it 4 stars in hopes that I will not be numbered among those who do not take an objective look at the book."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"This is the first Chesterton book that I have read. I have placed it in a special place on my bookshelf, along with the books that I like the most.Chesterton's sweeping glance at human history is amazing. His careful logic, side-splitting wit, and common sense make this an interesting read. He paints such great pictures with his words. Some of his words are really breathtaking."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"G.K. Chesterton is a wonderful and amazing writer. You simply must own and read and re-read Everlasting Man. However, it is imperative that you AVOID buying Wilder Publications' 2008 hardcover edition. I bought this thinking it would be a very nice addition to my library. I was expecting a high quality book that could be passed on to my children. As I sat down to read, my disappointment and frustration grew. I was able to get over the abysmal choice of font, even the spelling mistake on the first page didn't break my spirit, but when I reached the 'end' of the introduction and discovered that the final sentence ended mid-sentence I was very discouraged. After further investigation, online, I discovered that not only has the publisher left out most of the introduction (over 8 pages missing!) the book did not includes some very salient remarks by Chesterton entitled \\"Prefatory Note\\" which should have been included ahead of the introduction.By all means buy and read Everlasting Man but please DO NOT buy theThe Everlasting ManWilder Publications edition"},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Here is the book that inspired C.S Lewis to become a Christian. It is basically a poetic attempt at telling the story of the Catholic Church. Chesterton succeeds. Perhaps his greatest achievement is how his work makes the world seem new. He approaches the story as a human who had lived in this world and never known the Catholic Church. From this perspective, the reader is ennobled to see the Church for what it is - one of, if not the most, amazing institutions ever to exist upon the earth. Though at times I think he over-praises the Church, Chesterton does the impossible - he makes the obvious obvious."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"In a style and tone which could, at times, be misidentified as flippant, Chesterton casts illumination on historical reality from a perspective which might be considered fresh and new if this work had not been written more than eighty years ago. Regardless of its age, and perhaps due to is age, The Everlasting Man offers up topic for consideration that will almost certainly be new, or at least fresh, to a vast number of modern readers simply because of what it and its author were even in their own time. That is, the certainty and conviction with which Chesterton writes would appear to place him in one of two categories: insane or right. It can be imagined that now, as when this work was written, many would place him in the former category. However, it is precisely because the view he defended appeared to move in direct opposition to the tide of the time that he wrote this work, among others. This is also why this work is still relevant today.Sparing few feelings associated with the spirit of the age, Chesterton clearly, concisely, and, what seems to be, effortlessly presents history through a lens of emphasis as it would appear if God created, entered, educated, and saved the world. Chesterton maintained the truth of Christianity and approached an application of this to all of human history accordingly. In doing so he often attempts to assume a perspective of innocent ignorance, in an effort to demonstrate particular beliefs, and was later criticized for his apparent indifferent ignorance. The fact, however, remains that after reading and, perhaps, rereading this work, it is difficult to perceive Chesterton as anything other than a genius that is not only well aware of the implications of his every word, but also knows and believes that which he passionately writes about. It is no great wonder why C.S. Lewis attributed this work to his acceptance of theism.\\"Really, a young atheist cannot guard his faith too carefully. Dangers lie in wait for him on every side.\\" - C.S. Lewis,Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life"},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"G. K. Chesterton was certainly one of the greatest apologists of the 20th century. I can't hope to surpass the excellent reviews already documented here, so I'll simply praise Chesterton and his work. His ability to document the truth of Christianity with his typical wit makes him a must-study for all aspiring apologists. The Everlasting Man should be required reading for all seminary students. Chesterton is proof that one doesn't need to abandon reason to be a Christian. &quot;The Man at war with his time&quot; had more sense than all the atheists of his time combined. All skeptical atheists should stay away from Chesterton, unless they wish to lose their beliefs. Chesterton's orthodoxy, elucidated with Heretics and the aptly- named Orthodoxy, will inspire many for centuries to come. As Gilbert himself said, &quot;People always talk about orthodoxy as if it were something heavy, humdrum, and safe. In fact, there was never anything so perilous or exciting as orthodoxy.&quot; If you read Chesterton, don't come as a critic. The critics have already failed. Come as a seeker, and drink of his oasis of common sense in a desert of professional jargon and sheer craziness."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Chesterton's Everlasting Man is my favorite book. Its writing and argument are superb. Read Surprised By Joy, and you will learn how Everlasting Man was the crucial intellectual piece bringing C.S. Lewis back to Christianity.

Extremely inexpensive, it suffers from lack of editing. I suspect it was scanned without a fastidious proofreading.

A search for phrases from Everlasting on [...] gave me hits from this one from Wilder Publications and others. The \\"introduction\\" to The Everlasting Man from Wilder Pubs is truncated at \\"as if we should be any more free if all the police who shadowed ?\\" - while other editions have fully eight or nine more pages of the introduction. Throughout the book are errors that would seem to be the result of Editing While Intoxicated. A short list of examples includes whole words and phrases missing, periods showing up in the middle of sentences, and semicolons, periods, and other punctuation missing elsewhere, completely losing the sense of the original text and Chesterton's thought.I selected this one from Amazon because it was the cheapest, but I surely paid for it!"},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"G.K. Chesteron's book EVERLASTING MAN is an attempt to demonstrate that the Catholic Church, Western Civilization, and Christianity provided many of the answers to historical problems. Chesterton also condemned the attempt of some Westerners whose fads and attempt at something new worked to undermine Western Civilization and the philosophical concept of free will. Readers would do well to carefully read this book whether they are Catholic or not.Chesterton refutes the notion that somehow the Catholic Church has attempted to stifle thought. For example, the pre-historic caves in Lascaux, France were first discovered by a Catholic priest. If the Catholic authorities were engaged in preventing knowledge, they would have kept this discovery secret, and they would have silenced the priest who made this discovery.Chesteron was clear that ideas, passions, beliefs, etc. are as much realities as physical reality. In age of industrialism, mechanization of thought and culture, etc., Chesteron's comments require careful attention. The one early example Chesterton uses is the Second Punic War (218-202 BC). The Carthaginian commander, Hannibal (247-183 BC)and his men were phenominally successful when they invaded Rome. Hannibal's wealthy supporters were too impressed. These men thought that because Hannibal's men were so successful and the financial supporters spent so much, the Carthaginian financiers figured the Romans were defeated without further ado. Hannibal knew better. What the Carthaginian plutocrats did not realize was the fact that the Romans did not consider themselves defeated. The Carthaginians figured that with all the money spent and Hannibal's success, the war was over. Here Chesterton makes his case. The Carthaginians did not consider just how much Romans hated them. Chesterton correctly asscribes Roman victory to intangibles such determination to expel an alien civilization, serious concern for family and home, proud loyalty, etc. The Carthaginians thought apparent victory and wealth had won the day, and they did not consider that ideas and emotions were realities that eventually led to their defeat. In other words, the Carthaginians did not take into account what could not be tabulated on a balance sheet. As an aside, the Romans hated the Carthaginians' cruel rite of child sacrifice. The Carthaginians also underestimated the skill of the Roman commanders espeically that of Scipio Africanus (237-183 BC).Chesteron directs readers's attention of the rise of the Catholic Church and the fevor of the monks and religious to enthusiastically embrace the Faith and exert missionary efforts to spread the Faith. This was an important phenomenon. Modern \\"Experts\\" might consider the Dark Ages as one of pessimism where men just surrendered to fate and circumstances. Surprisingly, the Catholic Church not only saved Western Civilization but enhanced. It was the Catholic Church who preserved and expanded learning. It was the Catholic Church who gave men hope. Unlike some of the religious concepts of the East, men were not resign themselves to their status and suffer cruel fate. Unlike some of the ideas of Asia, Chesteron informs readers that Westerners were taught they had free will and could make decisions. This meant that ideas, thought, decisions (good or bad)were within the capacity of men. Men who accepted the Catholic Faith could make bad decisions, but the Faith gave men the hope and chance of restoration from evil decisions. In other words, Chesteron argues that the concept of Original Sin is not that men are depraved. It means that men can do better. Men are not all they can be.Readers would be interest in Chesteron's contrasts of the Catholic Faith and religious concepts which emerged in Asia including the Orient. Chesteron does not condemn these religions as much as he contrasts Catholic thinking with other views and indicates the logical inconsistencies of some of the non-Catholic views.Chesteron also showed his understanding of the debate between Realists and the Nominalists which took place in the Medieval universities. The Realists argued that ideas and concepts are universals and ultimate principles from which all thought must emerge. The Nominalists, one the other hand, argued there were no such universals, and basic a priori thinking was useless. To the Nominalists, concepts, ultimate ideas, etc. were merely words that men agreed upon. Chesteron warns his readers that such thinking is destructive and leads to useless skeptcisim and empty debate. One only has to read some of the Nominalists' arguements to see how inane they were.Chesterton's EVERLASTING MAN is not an easy book to read. This reviewer found that this book requires time and careful attention. Yet, this book is well worth the effort. Readers are not only exposed to concise,thoughtful reading, they can also learn again to appreciate Western Civiliztion."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"The Incarnation (the conception and birth of Christ) is the focal point, not just of the Christian creed, but of all of history.

If there is such a thing as an open minded atheist, read this work if only as an exercise in critical thinking.

It provides nothing of value to any discussion of Christianity.It is obvious from the outset that Chesterton's target audience with this book was never intended to be educated, critical thinkers. Indeed, the book opens with an unnecessary screed against skepticism. Or, rather, skeptics. He doesn't actually address any concerns any skeptics may have, though. He merely insults them repeatedly and paints them in broad strokes as stubborn idiots who prefer to keep their heads buried in the sand.He then unleashes his argument, which is so convoluted and full of holes, it could be a Michael Bay movie. It breaks down like this:We know God (i.e. Yahweh, the Judeo-Christian deity) because the universe looks designed (fallacy 1), and besides, lots of smart people over the course of human history have said God exists (fallacy 2).Before Jesus, there have been great men who have become mythologized, elevated from manhood to godhood. But these men probably really existed nonetheless. Then, about 2000 years ago, which happens to be right in the middle of recorded history (which is somehow significant), Jesus came along and declared himself the son of God. But Jesus is different because he started out as God and became man. Before Jesus came along, no one ever claimed to be a god (unless, of course, you count everyone who ever claimed to be a god). Jesus' claim of godhood was so unique and so revolutionary, that it just had to be true. Why, you ask? Well because it's so unlikely. And besides, Christianity has been around for 2000 years. That could only happen if it were based on fact (and if you ignore literally every other pre-Christian religion that exists).The Everlasting Man provides nothing new to the dialogue and only propagates bad history, bad science, and bad logic. It is utterly devoid of value and now sits comfortably on my Retarded Literature shelf next to my L Ron Hubbard collection and creationist handbook.If you're interested in Christianity, read the gospels. If you want self-indulgent sophistry, Chesterton's the man for you."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Chesterton explains his interesting and unique views on world history, mainly showing how world history has affected Christianity. I felt his views were more polemical and not so well founded on fact or research because he has only the barest of references to sources. Lots of interesting ideas, but I'm not sure how far I can trust his analysis because he doesn't put them in the context of the intellectual debate on the topics he surveys.."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"This book made almost no impression on me: a month later, I could barely remember having read it. The reason for the underwhelming impression is the loose structure of the book. Chesterton rambles all over the map, being pulled first one way and then the other by any association between topics that occurs to him. He is also given to broad, sweeping generalizations that often seem to stem from a desire for dramatic overstatement. The best analogy I can make is that reading this book is like listening to a voluble dinner guest who peppers his speech with pungent allusions to history, art, and religion, but who doesn't know when it is time to go home. The next day you can scarcely remember anything he said; all you remember is that he talked a lot.I was particularly appalled, after working my way through the main part of the book, to get to the end and find two Appendices in which Chesterton in effect tells the reader that he did a poor writing job. (Appendix I: &quot;On re-reading these pages I feel that I have tried in many places and with many words, to say something that might be said in one word.&quot;; Appendix II: &quot;... in some cases I find that my own loose fashion of allusion is rather misleading about my own meaning.&quot;) If Chesterton had had any respect for his readers, he would have rolled up his sleeves and done the hard work of improving the text, instead of just tacking on a few Appendices. But no, Chesterton had evidently reached a point in his career where he no longer worried about his readers, who were supposed to be grateful for any crumbs that fell from his pen. If an author has no interest in writing a book, why should I have an interest in reading it?"},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I've just struggled through the first chapter of this book, an anti-evolutionary screed, and simply cannot bring myself to read any further. The problem is the author tries to discredit evolutionary theory with a lot of flawed arguments that don't stand up under scrutiny. The crux of his case seems to be that man is so marvelous and complex that he couldn't possibly have evolved. This argument falters since the same argument could be applied to any living being such as birds, bees, plants, etc. Actually, it would have been a better case if he had said he fabric of the universe itself is so remarkable it couldn't have come about naturally, which is probably what the Intelligent Design folks are saying. However, that's not what he says - again, the core of his argument is that man is better than the animals due to art, sensitivity etc. I would suggest that animals can be sensitive - just ask anyoneone who owns a dog. As far as art, intelligence, self-awareness, being he exclusive province of men, I would suggest there are different degrees of cerebral function between species. For example, a cat's intelligence is exponentially greater than an worm's, just as man's intelligence is exponentially greater than a cat's; so that argument is meaningless. But one of the most problematic aspects to me is that Chesterton takes on the evolutianary debate from the prospective of popular conceptions about it, rather than the science. That's kind of like beating up on a little-league team and saying you've won the world series. For example, he immediately makes allusions to the so-called \\"popular\\" image of the caveman batting the the female over the head with a club and dragging her along by the hair; and suggests this image of the caveman is inaccurate by pointing out the beauty of the deer paintings done by \\"true\\" prehistoric man in caves discovered in France. He later sneakily superimposes that popular image on the scientific image by referring to the former as the \\"caveman of evolution\\". I would be interested to see any charactarization of specific behaviours of the \\"evolutionary caveman\\" that repudiates that cavemen were the authors of the deer-paintings. Moreover, Chesterton conveniently ignores that man is just as capable as any beast of committing horrific violence against fellow man and animals. It's this deceptive, propaganda-like approach that I find the most distasteful.The other problem is that once he identifies some path which he perceives to be favorable to his case, he beats it to death and back with a sarcastic, aggressive tone that is more remnicscent of the anti-religous lefties who despise religion so intensely.I was hoping to get some enlightenment from the book, but instead found my intelligence being assaulted and insulted. Having looked over some of the reviews, it may be possible that there are more useful and interesting chapters later on; but I suspect the same type of non-objective, partial, prejudiced thinking would predominate.I love objectivity and drawing conclusions from existing facts. The reverse, taking an existing conclusion and attempting to impose it on the facts, never works. Unfortaunately, this book is an example of just such an approach.Sam"},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I agree with an earlier reviewer who said that reading this book was like inviting someone to dinner who first fascinated you with his wit but eventually proved to be an overbearing windbag from whom you would gladly make your escape. Worse yet, he writes in defense of things that simply cannot be supported, except as private fantasies or wishful thinking. It is rather like reading an impassioned book, written about 1895, that \\"proved\\" that the Confederacy was morally right, that slavery was never anything but an expression of caring for Africans, and that the South would rise again. You read it and keep thinking, \\"But...*wait* a minute!\\"I do not mean, of course, that Chesterton writes specifically on American history or racial issues. His thesis is that man is unlike any other creature, that Jesus was unlike any other man, and that Christianity is unlike any other religion. In one sense, one is almost tempted to cheer for him against the modern tendency to boil everything down into a comfortable and tasteless broth of sameness. But facts, as John Adams once said, are stubborn things, and Chesterton could write as he did only by thumbing his nose at even as much scientific knowledge and scholarship as existed in his own day. He quite obviously takes great pleasure in poking fun at the researches of scientists and other learned men. If he remained true to this conviction, he would at least be consistent. But then, at the end of the book, he actually tries to deny this tendency on his part:\\"In this book which is merely meant as a popular criticism of popular fallacies, often indeed of very vulgar errors, I feel that I have sometimes given an impression of scoffing at serious scientific work. It was however the very reverse of my intentions. I am not arguing with the scientist who explains the elephant, but only with the sophist who explains it away. And as a matter of fact the sophist plays to the gallery, as he did in ancient Greece. He appeals to the ignorant, especially when he appeals to the learned. But I never meant my own criticism to be an impertinence to the truly learned.\\"Well baloney. The book could hardly be taken any other way. Chesterton was an interested layman who was annoyed at real scholars for knowing more than he did, and knowing things that made it impossible for any learned man to believe what he did. He spends this book poking fun at such people and then tries to deny that that was his intention. That is not only foolish but dishonest.There *are* some intriguing parts in this book, that tug at the heart of anyone with any moral sense. He talks about civilizations that institutionalize war on children, and he has a moral vision that involves standing in steadfastness and constancy as one witnesses to truths that transcend and even contradict the everyday order of things. Then, you realize that he is saying these things in defense of insitutional Christianity, whose faults are too notorious to be overlooked, and it is like reading an article purporting to prove to you that the CEO of Enron was really King Arthur and Gandhi rolled into one. And again, you find yourself saying, \\"But...*wait* a minute...\\" It seems no one ever said \\"But wait a minute\\" to Chesterton, no doubt because they couldn't get a word in edgewise. In any case, this book is interesting as an historical curiosity; it is as irrelevant to reaching any real conclusions about these issues as would have been a book written in the late 16th century purporting to show that the Copernican system was an unwarranted speculation and that the earth was really the center of the universe."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I have been marginally aware of G. K Chesterton, first through Robert W. Smith's works, and then later, discovering that a major character in the Sandman series by Neil Gaiman (Gilbert, aka Fiddler's Green) had been patterned after him. I have been reading a number of Infidels (Paine, Ingersoll, and Voltaire), and so am somewhat familiar w/this style of writing, and have somewhat become a fan of it.Unfortunately, when an author begins with attacking any rational and skeptical critic, insulting their intelligence, and inferring they are drooling idiots, then I am afraid my mind shuts down. As Ingersoll observed, since the Church has been deprived of its instruments of torture, only one weapon is left, and that is slander (paraphrase). To call any skeptic illiterate, or accuse them of what is essentially brainlessness, is but a sugarcoated, sarcastic version of the ad hominem attack (and if the reader actually INVESTIGATES the writings of these skeptics, past and present, they will find that they are INDEED literate, and intelligent). He says this, this one about the early matriarchies: \\"matriarchy was simply moral anarchy, in which the mother alone remained fixed because all the fathers were fugitive and irresponsible.\\" Who said this? Unknown. Sources cited? None. Moral Anarchy? I am not an advocate of political correctness, as I see it as subliminal censorship, but this coupled with his derisive trash about Asians, comparing Herodotus to a Chinaman, and saying the Asian is barely human (paraphrase)? And please, spare me the nonsense of societal antipathy. Bigot and sexist. He goes on to attack the evolutionist, making fun of forensic science (but excuses for G.K: he had no idea how useful this is in reconstructing a human being in today's CSI labs). Again, the worst sort of Antinomianism, covered with flowery prose. Some of his imagery is wonderful; the conclusion was quite beautiful. But this errant nonsense about the 5 deaths of the Church? Please. As if the Spanish (or Germans) were abandoning their crosses during the French revolution. The Vatican was on the verge of closing its doors? And this idiocy about instinctive worship? Again, spare me. A child isolated, raised by wolves, NEVER starts praying: indeed, said child will behave as its environment dictates. His history is unsound; his psychology is simple egomania (this is how I would be, ergo, everyone else will be); he glosses over the glaring contradictions in the Bible with barely a blurb, simply dismissing them with a poetic hand, never addressing them; nor does he address the rivers of blood that wash up on the feet of Christ. The early church didn't survive simply because it was the best: it survived by crushing the opposition, and gaining a foothold in the Roman Empire via Constantine (who was, irony of ironies, an Arianist on his deathbed). And the wonderful rubbish of martyrdom: while there were those who died in the name of their Lord (RIP), the Christians only endured 12 years of actual persecution; the Romans were remarkably tolerant of other beliefs, and after Justin's martyrdom, an entire craze sprang up in the Christian community where members ACTUALLY WENT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO GET MARTYRED. If C.S Lewis converted due to this long-winded, sophistic diatribe, then perhaps I shall skip reading anything by him. Words are but words, and rhetoric, however lofty and poetic, are not evidence of anything except that people will glorify the speaker if the words serve their best interest.In conclusion: I have read many apologists, and thus far, they have failed the litmus test: that of logic."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"The Everlasting Man is a Christian apologetic, that is, a reasoned attempted to defend and argue for Christian faith. An orthodox Catholic, Chesterton wrote The Everlasting Man in part to rebut H.G. Wells's Outline of History (which I have not read). As such, it is ostensibly structured to follow the history of the world. Published in 1925, it was in keeping with a general attempt to respond to Darwin's On the Origins of Species (published 66 years earlier) and a tremendous growth in scientific knowledge of the world with arguments more focused on providing a rationale basis for Christian belief than in the past. C.S. Lewis credited the Everlasting Man with in part leading to his conversion to Christianity and called it \\"the best popular apologetic I know\\" (although I would argue that the apologetic that Lewis went on to write, Mere Christianity, is better).Chesterton begins with pre-history. He notes that conjecture about pre-history is just that, given our lack of source materials, and gives perhaps his greatest insight of the book: the uniqueness and significance of pre-historic man one day waking up and deciding to make a cave-painting of the deer outside. The invention of art was a singularly human creation ludicrous to picture from any other animal on this earth.Chesterton takes a more favorable view than many toward early history and uses it to buttress his argument that barbarism and civilization are not necessarily successive stages. Even at the dawn of history (that is, written history), many societies were more advanced and much more civilized than many relatively modern societies. It should be self-evident to any student of history that progress is not strictly linear.Moving onto comparative religion, Chesterton divides belief systems into religions (Judaism, Christianity, etc.), mythology (pagan religions), and philosophy (most eastern religions). He also sub-divides mythology into the more innocuous sort and something akin to devil worship. He specifically points to ancient Carthage as an example of the latter. I'm skeptical, but I only know a little about the history of Carthage outside of its military campaigns against Rome. The key insight of this part of the book is just how exceptional the Hebrew faith was in a pagan world.Devoting significant attention to Jesus, Chesterton notes that Jesus revisionists tend to concentrate on a single facet of Jesus's life and teachings while ignoring the lion's share. He argues that it is just this detail, the ability of Jesus to be so many things to so many people, that made him remarkable. He counters arguments of the ordinariness of either Jesus or the church with the contention that, if the things they argue for and believe in are not true, then they are rather bizarre.Chesterton is a talented writer, and The Everlasting Man is replete with great turns of phrase. Metaphors and analogies are relied heavily to good effect.However, Chesterton's writing style is one better suited to a work of fiction than an attempt to lay out a logical argument. The writing also suffers from difficult language and out-of-date references and has not aged terribly well in general. It is well worth a read, but for a stronger Christian apologetic, pick up Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis.(Note that this review is of an older, paperback edition.)"},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"A stunning and brilliant work - Christ as the hinge of history and culture. When I was choosing btw books by Chesterton, I asked for advice from Fr. John McCloskey, then head of the Catholic Information Center in Washington, DC.

I've even run into one instance with a question mark in the middle of a word! At first I assumed it was possible Chesterton missed a word or two as he wrote the book, but question marks in the middle of a word? It's looking as though this edition was rushed and not proofread thoroughly. Too bad - it's the only knock I have on an otherwise fascinating book.

Deep spiritual reading."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Everlasting Man is perhaps the most definitive look at the Christian faith I have ever read. I can't say enough about how he frames not only the history of man, but also his relationship with God."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"In G. K. Chesterton's The Everlasting Man, we have an author of true genius and incredible literary ability covering an enormous range of subjects with the philosophical acumen of a Renaissance polymath. I, on the other hand, am an average fellow with decent reading skills and a rudimentary understanding of theology and philosophy. Therefore, it is fairly ludicrous for me to attempt a review of this book.But don't think that will stop me.I read 100% of The Everlasting Man. But I readily admit that if I understood 50% of it, I did well. Like much of Chesterton's work, the book is more like 40,000 aphorisms strung together than a systematic treatise on a single subject. In it, Chesterton attempts to parallel the celebrated Outline of History by H. G. Wells which had been published in 1919, some 5 years before. But while Wells's work was a materialist history that was criticized by Hillaire Belloc as giving less space to Christ than to the Persian campaign against the Greeks, Chesterton's work focuses on how the reality of Christ and the truth of Christianity has infused all of human history.As someone who already believes this thesis, Chesterton's work was mostly preaching to the choir in my case. So perhaps the book did not have the same impact on me as it might have on someone who subscribes to the materialist version of history going in. It certainly impacted C. S. Lewis, who gave the work a good bit of credit for his conversion to belief in Christianity.Chesterton makes the point repeatedly that Christianity is unique and should not be compared to other religions. Unlike Jesus, the founders of other religious traditions never claimed to actually be God. Chesterton writes: \\"Mahomedans did not misunderstand Mahomet and suppose he was Allah. Jews did not misinterpret Moses and identify him with Jehovah.\\" Instead, the claim made by Christ stands alone among philosophers and great lawgivers. Any others who actually did make such a claim, were deemed madman: \\"No one can imagine Aristotle claiming to be the father of gods and men, come down from the sky; though we might imagine some insane Roman Emperor like Caligula claiming it for him, or more probably, for himself.\\"And that leaves us with a dilemma that utterly demolishes the comforting popular notion that Jesus was merely a wise rabbi who passed on a moral code to his disciples. As C. S. Lewis would later put it more succinctly: \\"Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse.\\"There is so much more to this book than I can do justice to here. Rather than go on at length, I will simply give the reader a few choice quotes which will exhibit Chesterton's point of view and rhetorical style far better than my continued rambling:\\"Far away to the east there is a high civilization of vast antiquity in China; there are the remains of civilizations in Mexico and South America and other places, some of them apparently so high in civilization as to have reached the most refined forms of devil-worship.\\"\\"Now it is very right to rebuke our own race or religion for falling short of our own standards and ideals. But it is absurd to pretend that they fell lower than the other races and religions that professed the very opposite standards and ideals. There is a very real sense in which the Christian is worse than the heathen, the Spaniard worse than the Red Indian, or even the Roman potentially worse than the Carthaginian. But there is only one sense in which he is worse; and that is not in being positively worse. The Christian is only worse because it is his business to be better.\\"\\"The truth is that only men to whom the family is sacred will ever have a standard or a status by which to criticize the state. They alone can appeal to something more holy than the gods of the city; the gods of the hearth.\\"As should be readily appreciated from these quotes, there is much in this book that is directly applicable to our own times. But these are only the barest sample of Chesterton's wit and wisdom. Practically every fourth line of this book is quotable.In short, I heartily recommend The Everlasting Man. I give it only four stars here because it is written in such a way that few of us moderns, with our short attention spans, will ever be able to plow through it, let alone grasp it completely. Chesterton assumed a level of knowledge and intellectual patience that is quite honestly beyond most of us today. As a result, I found the book to be somewhat frustrating because so much of it is over my head. So, perhaps, if I were fair, I would take a star away from myself rather than from The Everlasting Man."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"The Everlasting Man has got to be on the list of the top five books I have ever read, on any subject, fiction or nonfiction. This, Chesterton's greatest work, is more than a mere apology; more than a mere outline of human history, though it is that. It covers the interior, one might say psychological, history of the human condition and the human experience, breaking our spiritual history into four columns -- monotheism, mythology, philosophy, and diabolism -- and shows how Christianity satisfies the mythic hunger for romance while at the same time satisfying the rational and philosophical hunger for truth. Chesterton is one of the sanest, most insightful, and wittiest authors I've ever read. His strength lies in seeing through popular illusions and fallacies and dispelling them, while salvaging everything in them that is good and truly human. Though he insists that Pagan religions are not really religions in the sense we mean today (\\"We know the meaning of all the myths. We know the last secret revealed to the perfect initiate. And it is not the voice of a priest or a prophet saying \`These things are.' It is the voice of a dreamer and an idealist crying, \`Why cannot these things be?'\\"), he nevertheless honors these old religions by holding up the healthy and human aspects which characterized them (\\"When we say that they also have temples and idols and priests and periodical festivals...we only mean that Pagans have more sense than Puritans\\"). Dismissing the comparative approach to mythology and folklore, Chesterton reasserts the romantic view and its essential nature as part of human identity and experience. This echoes such utterly sane and utterly delightful statements he has made in other books (\\"This elementary wonder, however, is not a mere fancy derived from the fairy tales; on the contrary, all the fire of the fairy tales is derived from this.\\" --Orthodoxy). The fascinating thing about Chesterton is that he satisfies all aspects of the reader's mind (largely because his subject does so as well), the rational and the emotional. He is a Liberal in the older, classical sense, and looks down upon conservatives and progressives alike. His wit is gymnastic and his insight and intellect piercing like a narrow sword. There is not much more I can say, save that if there is only one book on Christianity or religion or mythology that you ever read, this should be it."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I am not one to criticize others, but as a lover of audio books, I must comment that the quality of the reading of this book does not come close to matching the mastery of its writing. This is a great disappointment and leads me to wonder why a more professional reader wasn't chosen for such an important work. I have listened to the audio-book recording of Chesterton's Orthodoxy (read by Simon Vance and published by Hovel Audio) three time through and will likely listen a fourth time. However, the audio book recording of The Everlasting Man by Dale Ahlquist, published by Ignatius Press, falls quite below that standard. The reader pauses mid sentence again and again. The reading simply doesn't flow. I couldn't finish even one of the ten CD's that make up the box set before I gave up listening. It almost sounds as it the reader is site reading. It resembles a good piece of music made bad by a musician who didn't practice prior to performance. Certainly Mr. Ahlquist, as president of the American Chesterton Society, is a lover of Chesterton's writing, however, that makes him an \`amateur' not a professional recording artist."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I love most of Chesterton's works and this is no exception. The typos, however, made it hard to read a took away from the experience, it was very frustrating. I highly recommend that you read this book but urge you to get it from a different publisher."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"This, the Wilder Publications edition of The Everlasting Man, is an egregiously cheap and nasty edition of a great book. It is printed on oversize pages with very narrow margins in an apparent effort to reduce printing costs to a minimum. Overall, the production quality is on a par with an instruction manual that might come with a no-name hair dryer or computer part from East Asia, or, actually my first thought was off-brand Dungeons & Dragons extension materials circa 1976. You will be much happier with the Ignatius Press edition for only $1.00 more, which is the one I would have gone for had it been easier to locate on Amazon. I plan to return this and get the Ignatius Press version instead, or possibly Volume 2 of the Collected Works."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Chesterton drives home his points in captivating, intelligent and often hilarious ways. He is possibly one of the most intellectually honest writers of the last century. His influence has reached far and wide, including forays not only in the Catholic church, but in Protestant circles as well. C.S. Lewis read this book shortly before his conversion to Christianity. You'll not want to read this book with intellect alone (though it is intellectually very stimulating). The Everlasting Man is meaty enough to nourish your spirit and deepen your understanding."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"The book has become classical because, unlike other weighty apologetical books, it appeals to common sense reasoning. As he always does in his other books, Chesterton again shows in this book that truth, and the way we're supposed to obtain that truth, is actually not far away from how common people think in their daily life about day-to-day matters. And a thought or argument--deep as it is--that returns to daily experience will tend to endure and last longer. Over speculative arguments will indeed make a boisterous noise, but it will soon be forgotten.G.K.'s arguments look simple, and yet they appeal to sane mind. Why is it better off to believe in creation? G.K. would say: \\"isn't it easier to say that the world was created?\\" Why G.K. doesn't believe in evolution? Because human laughs. Why G.K. thinks that the story of Jesus in the Bible is true? Because no other groups of religion other than Christianity believes it is true. . . . To mention only few examples from the book.ridete et valete!"},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I picked up this \\"Wilder\\" 2008 edition because I was interested in Chesterton. The writing does not disappoint, but this edition does. Replete with typos and no helpful commentary, there must be better editions out there."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"The Everlasting Man is second in my series of books to fill my year with G. K. Chesterton. I continue to appreciate Chesterton for his wit, eloquence, and admiration for beauty and joy; while I am beginning to have some hesitation with his overall body of work.This particular title splits into two parts, divided by Christ's advent. Chesterton's first half focuses on the world before Jesus and the way in which its religions developed. He lists and describes many ancient religions, showing how they all paved the way for Christianity. In his words:\\"[T]he rivers of mythology and philosophy run parallel and do not mingle till they meet in the sea of Christendom. . . . The truth is that the Church was actually the first thing that ever tried to combine reason and religion. There had never before been any such union of the priests and the philosophers (Bk. 1, Ch. V).\\"Along those lines falls my favorite takeaway from The Everlasting Man: Chesterton's unique classification system, under which he catalogs the world's \\"religions.\\" As he writes, many of what we call religions would never have been called that by their founders or their followers. For that reason, Chesterton proposes a fourfold classification system: God, gods, demons, and philosophers. Every religion, says Chesterton, is best explained by fitting into one of those categories, based on what its followers worship.After the book's halfway point, Chesterton turns to the world after Christ. In Christmas, Chesterton sees the culmination of all the world had been yearning for in its ancient religions. As he puts it, Christianity contains all three elements that humanity has desired in its religion: The first is that heaven should be literal and nearly as local as a home, second that it is a philosophy larger than all others, and third, that it is a fight, that it is set deliberately in opposition to all error.In this book, Chesterton shows forth as a clear precursor to C. S. Lewis, whose later works like Mere Christianity and The Abolition of Man show the same philosophical-poetical approach to religion that Chesterton employs in The Everlasting Man. Chesterton, however, is much more difficult to pin down and understand than Lewis.Martin Luther once described reading Paul's epistles as a process of beating them until they leaked out something sensible, and that metaphor seems a good fit for Chesterton's Everlasting Man. Much of this book was compelling and insightful, but large portions were nearly impenetrable and erudite beyond my expectations.Chesterton writes with a poetic flair, which at times adds beauty but often leaves the reader befuddled. If a reader is willing to grab hold of this book and force it to give up meaning, the reader will be pleased with Chesterton's powerful summation of human history as a lead-up to Christ, but if one hopes for an easy look at religious history, you should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"This book is filled with typos. Most are easily discernable (e.g. modern becomes modem), but some cause the reader to stumble, need to pause and reread applying the word he thinks should be there (e.g. every he is be -- or is it the other way round?).

Chesterton's method of composition consisted of reading several books on a subject, then dictating his thoughts aloud to his secretary. Such a modus operandi, if true, would explain why Chesterton's works are sometimes a bit wordy, as though no one had edited them to prune the excess verbiage. The Everlasting Man is a loquacious monologue where the style is occasionally irritating, but if you can look past this minor shortcoming, The Everlasting Man is an outstanding apologetic for Christianity. It is a pleasure to recommend this book for consideration, because Chesterton had a real knack for revealing the truth in a surprising and often paradoxical method. His books are not &quot;dry&quot;, but lively, full of wit, fun, good humor, and fine reasoning. C.S. Lewis thought highly of The Everlasting Man, and after reading it, I can understand why."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"This will be brief. Buy the Ignatius edition.

Nevertheless I have never lost my intellectual fascination with Christianity and especially with its moral philosophy. This book is certainly the best, clearest, most enjoyable and cogent exposition I have come across about what it really means, intellectually and morally, to be a Christian. It did not convert me, but it certainly gave me a much clearer understanding of (and a much stronger respect for) what Christianity is about.

Go off and learn ten languages and do field work in Asia after graduating with your PhD. This is an _honestly_ popular book, a rare thing in these anti-science days of Dawkins and Creationism. As has been noted, Chesterton sets himself against Wells' Outline of History, and destroys it not with greater erudition, as there was never much to begin with in Wells' work, nor with a scientifically constructed anthropology, which would have been out of date a week after publishing the book anyhow, but by HUMOUR! Read it for that; laugh at the counter history he draws out, smile, and come to your own opinions."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Gilbert K. Chesterton's &quot;The Everlasting Man,&quot; is more than just a philosophy of history, in fact, it is more than the average run-of-the-mill Christian apologetic as well. It is a work vast in erudition and loaded with sharp witticism. It is a work brimming with insightful logic and religious lore; and it by far surpasses many works of its kind in the twentieth century...possibly since Augustine's &quot;City of God.&quot; The book begins upon a paradox: a history of the prehistory of man. Chesterton explains the very genesis of humankind as being strictly human. He expounds upon man's earliest religions from the cave all the way to the Incarnation, which is the central theme to this work. Chesterton also elaborates upon some of the prevalent heresies of the Early Church, shows how the Catholic Church was the church that Christ founded, and ends the book with captavating irony - the five deaths of the Faith...just look for yourself. This book is a timeless classic and a must have."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Very few books are worth reading with a pencil in hand. Most fit Stephen Donaldson's description of a novel as \\"throwing words at a short story.\\"The Everlasting Man demands to be annotated. Chesterton's prose is masterful, his wit and sarcasm are triumphant, but most fundamentally, his arguments are pointed and illuminating.Chesterton provides a method and a practical goal. His method is to examine preconceptions by going out of context; to picture our reality as if we were strangers. The goal is to compare the secularist, religious, and dogmatic views of man with this external picture.His conclusion is in the recognition of Christ as The Distinguishing Event which bears no contrast or comparison with history before or since. Along the way, he dices up comparitive religion, takes a poke or two at Spencer & Darwin, relegates Islam to a heresy (albeit a \\"respectable heresy\\") and thoroughly demolishes the concept of secularist rationality.Among the more profound of Chesterton's recognitions is in the strange continuity of the Church. A little apologetics is involved, but I get the impression that his discussions are intended more for comfort to the faithful than butressing his already-established arguments.Overall, a thoroughly engaging read. My only negative criticism of the book is the dexterity of Chesterton's references and citations. I probably missed more of his allusions than I caught. In some ways, it reminds me of Swift's Gulliver's Travels - we all get the \\"Big end/Little end\\" allusion to Protestant/Catholicism conflict, and the ancillary references to France/England, etc. But only by reading thorough criticism do we find that Swift was referring not only to massive social events, but also to specific individuals and practices. Without a key from contemporary society, there is no way for us to \\"get\\" Gulliver's Travels. And I fear that this is true of \\"The Everlasting Man\\" as well. Which only goes to prove some of the points of the book itself.I wonder if Chesterton planned it that way?Finally, I cannot help but cite the end of Part I as an example of the brilliance of the writing and the theme. Referring to the first Christians in Rome, and the Roman persecution, Chesterton writes: \\"And there shone on them in that dark hour a light that has never been darkened,; a white fire clinging to that group like an unearthly phosporescence, blazing its track through the twilights of history and confounding every effort to confound it with the mists of mythology and theory; that shaft of light or lightning by which the world itself has struck and isolated and crowned it; by which its own enemies have made it more illustrious and its own critics have made it more inexplicable: the halo of hatred around the Church of God.\\"Grand!"},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"This \\"publication\\" of Chesterton's classic work is a painful and lamentable thing. Its relentless typos render a real injustice to the tight, bright, aphoristic signature of G.K.'s writing style, not to mention a crime against the compelling content of his case. Perhaps this private basement scan-and-print operation had the good intentions of distributing Chesterton's masterpiece to more masses for less money. But I have my ungenerous suspicions that this slovenly reproduction of a most unslovenly book may be almost entirely a business interest. I don't know any better explanation for such an obviously and shamelessly horrendous printing than to suppose that whoever printed it had utterly no concern for what is written in it. A few more dollars spent for the Ignatius edition of The Everlasting Man (or Dale Ahlquist's reading of it) will save readers the constant frustration of plodding through a butchered text and have the added effects of both honoring publishing integrity and justly presenting this Chestertonian gem in all of its original coruscating cogency and genius. This book's too good to be treated so poorly.[Thankfully, Amazon makes the returns process quick and painless]."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"Chesterton is writing as a poet not as a philosopher, still much less a scientist. To reprove him for lack of technical data or \\"proofs\\" is therefore akin to reprimanding Shakespeare for historical inaccuracies in Julius Caesar. Shakespeare wasn't concerned with historical fact so much as painting a drama that lifts one to consider the sublime. And so Chesterton's use of metaphor isn't intended to prove anything. It's meant to draw one into considering possibilities that otherwise might be ignored. The poet, philosopher, and mathematician all speak of truth, but with differing tools. A young girl entering puberty may find herself being taught about sex by her pediatrician as well as her mother. The content of each conversation will be dramatically different however. What the physician relates in terms of physiology may be scientifically true and so may what the mother says regarding sex as the manifestation of love between a man and woman. From the mother's perspective the physician's words may ring hollow, while to the physician the mother's words may seem irrelevant. The physician and mother both speak of the same reality, but the purpose and content of the speech have little in common. Chesterton's portrait of history is not meant to be a scientific explanation of reality, but an insight into its meaning. That is not to say science cannot point to meaning or poetry cannot relate fact. The intention of the scientist and poet are just usually different. I can draw a map of how to get to the store or I can take someone by the hand and accompany him there. If I take someone by the hand, however, I don't need to draw him a map. Chesterton is attempting to take our hand.Those going to Chesterton for data or a pragmatic defense of Christianity will be disappointed. When reading him the worst thing you can ask yourself is, \\"What is this man's point!\\" or \\"Where is he going with this!\\" Just pretend you're on a Sunday drive through the mountains. If you keep asking yourself, \\"When are we going to get there!\\" you'll miss the mountains and frustrate the purpose of the drive."},{"Title":"The Everlasting Man","review":"I have read most of Chesterson's fiction and only a few of his more theologically oriented books.

As such, Fogg breaks a lot of new ground, giving a theoretical framework and practical advice for understanding how computers and the world-wide web work as persuasive media. Fogg wisely defines computers broadly: essentially, any interactive technology is a computing device, from the common desktop computer to a heart-rate monitor that gives feedback and analysis to the wearer.Of particular note: Chapter 7 deals with what makes a web-site believable, and should be required reading for any web designer or content developer who wants surfers to change an action or belief based on their site, whether that action is as simple as returning to that site again and again or as complicated as stopping smoking. This chapter alone will be worth having the entire book on your shelf.Another insight Fogg makes that struck me is how computers differ from traditional media in their ability to persuade: computers can adapt (within their programming of course) the message, its frequency and many other variables based on the response of the user. Television and print can't do that. This ability gives computers great power to persuade, closer in some ways to a human adapting a speech based on crowd response. Of course, computers have many advantages as persuasive agents that humans do not, such as the ability to provide anonymity and simulation of events. Persuasive Technology is filled with similar insights.This is a very accessible book. Easy to skim when it deals with something less relevant to you. (Fogg's background in information design shows to great benefit.)All in all worth the read."},{"Title":"Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do (Interactive Technologies)","review":"It's 2003 and the initial excitement, innovation and greed that fueled the technology boom of the late 90s have all but disappeared. Yet left in their tracks are the tangible building blocks of an industry destined to continue changing commerce, education and social activism in profound and irreversible ways.For a fresh perspective on the forces shaping next-phase software and Web development, look no further than \\"Persuasive Technology\\" by Dr. B.J. Fogg, director of the Persuasive Technology Lab at Stanford University. Surely, academic research may fail to generate the enthusiasm of erstwhile launch parties and public offerings, but Dr. Fogg's work offers a purposeful key to helping us understand, and thereby design, more effective and sustainable (read: revenue-generating) interactive technologies.Proposing a new analytical model called \\"captology\\", short for \\"computers as persuasive technologies\\", Dr. Fogg is the first to address the increasingly important role of computers in actuating attitudinal and behavioral change - in other words, the ability to persuade users to take a particular action: to buy more, play more, lose weight, quit smoking, register to win, etc. For technology researchers accustom to the tenets of Usability - essentially the evaluation of functionality and \\"likability\\" - captology goes a significant step further, addressing the extent to which an interactive device (be it a website or mobile phone) succeeds in changing users' attitudes and behaviors. The importance of this research is unquestionable, if you can imagine (or personally relate to) an online marketer anxious to sell more goods, or a smoker who turns to a motivational website to help him/her quit. It is no longer enough for a website or software tool to be \\"user friendly\\"; its intended objective - as a tool of persuasion - must be achieved.Through the study of captology, designers have a new framework for building products, services and promotions that succeed in generating the results they seek. What could be more timely and constructive in this period when all sectors - commercial, educational, social/civic and more - are straining to yield measurable, bottom-line results from their technology investments?Thank you, Dr. Fogg, for the fresh and purposeful approach.

The book is well written and well cited. It's rare to see a technology book that has research cited to back its claims. Often times claims are made based on experience without any real claim to validity. Dr Fogg's writing is more academic and in that sense refreshing. Although, it would certainly be nice to see both aspects, experience and reproducible controlled tests, in a single book.If you are well versed in both psychology and technology, this book will not enlighten you, but it does provide a great foundation for future research. If you work in user experience, marketing, or any performance based technology field, you can definitely benefit from the material in this book. I take this to be Captology 101 and I would definitely love to see some upper division material coming down the pipeline.My key take aways are:- Understanding the basics of Captology- Getting a well researched foundation for future, real world testing- Having an accurate psychological lexiconThere is some actionable information scattered throughout the book. For example, in chapter 5, Computers as Persuasive Social Actors, Fogg relates a study he performed that showed changing the error messages on a piece of technology made it \\"rated...more favorably\\" and \\"users reported that [it] gave better information, was more accurate, and was more knowledgeable.\\" This is good research to have if you're a user experience designer especially if you have to justify your work to non-believers. However, this book is not meant to be full of actionable items, so don't expect that of it.I recommend this book for an academic overview. If you'd like real world examples tryCall to Action: Secret Formulas to Improve Online Results, but don't expect to learn why the real world examples work other than a surface level explanation.

Fogg puts to rest the old adage about ivory tower academics obsessing over trivia. The research studies reported in this book demonstrate the power and practicality of scholarly methods when applied to real world issues. Moreover, Fogg's methodology and findings are presented in highly accessible language that can be understood by anyone from high school students on up.But the remarkable comprehensibility of this work should not be taken for a lack of substance. Make no mistake, there are many deep ideas herein and the ethics of using computers to influence behavior are given the same insightful treatment as the applied techniques surveyed throughout.Yet beyond the specific findings of the studies reported on its pages (which will eventually be extended or superceded), Persuasive Technology offers a truly rich framework that defines the shape of an entirely new discipline. As such it will stand the test of time and serve as a guide to generations of scholars, designers, and developers in the years ahead.This book should be required reading for anyone contemplating a high tech startup venture, developing a web presence for his or her organization, or studying such topics as Communications, Information Science, Marketing, and Computer Science."},{"Title":"Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do (Interactive Technologies)","review":"Persuasive Technology is a must read for any technology or public health professional attempting to build a framework for using technology to influence behavior change, particularly for someone attempting to build one for the first time.B.J. Fogg shares his experience in an easy to understand writing style that is both interesting and practical. He demonstrates the potential for using persuasive technologies while also providing a framework that helps bring order to this vast and rapidly changing subject area.An experienced telecommunications product development professional and MPH candidate, I have recently been researching the options and considerations for applying technology to Public Health; this book provided immediate context and perspective on the environment, undoubtedly saving me much time and effort.Given my bias as a product development professional, an unexpected but pleasant surprise was the series of principles defined throughout and substantiated by specific research or commercial examples (also summarized in the appendix for easy reference). By synthesizing his conclusions through these principles, Fogg shares his experience in a practical manner that makes it easy to integrate his insights into the development process, to help profile strategies, screen concepts, and stimulate ideas. I expect most of these principles will hold true, regardless how technology and applications evolve.Hopefully we will see more on the subject from BJ Fogg and his Persuasive Technology lab; more observations on the use of mobile applications would be of particular interest to this reader."},{"Title":"Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do (Interactive Technologies)","review":"An excellent introduction to CAPTology, the study of Computers As Persuasive Technologies.

In the process he provides a fascinating look at cutting-edge and potential future applications of computer and mobile technologies (such as location-linked reminder systems) that could enhance our lives. However, he does not dismiss the darker uses of the technology and the very real ethical issues it raises. Towards the end of the book, he argues that studying computer-human persuasion can provide new insights into human-human persuasion, and the crossover in many of the principles discussed is readily apparent. I took away from this book a new awareness of how systems used in my organisation could be enhanced to make things better for our customers, as well as a deeper understanding of persuasion in general.

For anyone who interacts with computer technology, whether from a design perspective or as a user, this book provides a thorough understanding of how interactive computing systems can change our attitudes and behaviors.Although based in research and academia, the book is not overly academic, but takes advantage of a somewhat textbook style of organization to make the concepts clear and easy to grasp. Illustrations, references, highlighted definitions, and bulleted summaries reinforce the concepts or give a quick shorthand depending on how you prefer to read the book. Fogg peppers the text with excellent real-world and hypothetical examples. I found the hypothetical examples most intriguing and suspect (or at least hope) that we'll see many of them become reality in the not too distant future.As a marketer not unfamiliar with the concept of persuasion, I found the chapter on Web Credibility in particular a valuable source of guidance on how to better design web sites and build trust into the experience. As a consumer, I was fascinated by the possibilities for persuasive mobile technologies - especially the idea that the most successful motivating mobile technologies will be those that best serve the personal goals of the user, rather than intrude into our lives and betray the trust we will eventually need to place in them.In writing this book, clearly Fogg was not only attempting to educate us about this new field of study, but also to persuade us that the future of interactive computing technology can have some very positive outcomes if we understand and respect the humans on both ends of the equation. I believe he succeeded."},{"Title":"Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do (Interactive Technologies)","review":"If you've ever wondered how technology is subtly and shaping how we think and work, this is the book for you. Years of scholarly research at Stanford has allowed BJ Fogg to use the foundations of rhetoric to show how web and other 21st century techologies affect how we make choices, sometimes subconsciously, and can be used to shape quite deliberately our expectations about the choices we make. Probably too much of an overview for the engineer, IT, psychology or advertising professional, the book is nonetheless a very thorough treatment of the subject for any of them, and for the general reader, with lots of well-researched citations for those who want to know more. Good layout and design, with attractive visuals and illustrations throughout bring the subject to life and reinforce the solid and provocative points Fogg is making. Arthur C. Clark once said &quot;the best technology is like magic&quot; and BJ Fogg tells us how the magic of technology is influencing the choices we make.

Think again! Persuasive Technology is an ?eye-popping? look at how we are being influenced everyday by devices and computers. The use of technology for persuasion in the future will expand beyond mere advertising, marketing and sales. Your success in the future is dependent on understanding how captology works and how you are or can be manipulated. Awareness and education are the first step towards embracing new technologies and using them to your advantage. You could sign up and study at the Persuasive Technology Lab at Stanford to learn more, or you could read the book!Dr. Fogg clears the ?fog? and mystique around captology and persuasion by interactive devices. He offers frequent thought-provoking examples of captology in everyday life. In Persuasive Technology you learn how persuasive technologies are already influencing you, and how you can use your new found knowledge to your advantage.What is captology? In the book you will learn that ?captology focuses on the design, research and analysis of interactive computing products created for the purpose of changing people?s attitudes or behavior.?As you will learn, persuasion has always been with us. Governments have long been known to attempt to influence their citizens. Some years ago, Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) had a series entitled ?Films of Persuasion?. The show examined how the government produced movies aimed at changing citizens? attitudes and allowing the government new power. What is different today? Interactivity! With interactive persuasion, persuaders now ?adjust their influence tactics as the situation evolves?.The book is easy to read and ?human engineered? for easy use and optimal retention. Each chapter is complete with references for further study and notes for clarification. Key points are visually summarized in tables in the chapters.

Dr. Fogg's &quot;Persuasive Technology&quot; neatly presents his work over the last several years. His book provides solid background and well-structured frameworks for informing the design process of persuasive systems.&quot;Persuasive Technology&quot; is an in depth look at the cognitive and social factors surrounding computers as persuasive technology. Dr. Fogg takes several steps from research to practice by clearly organizing the research and theory into actionable frameworks and principles that help designers develop coherent strategies and products. His work on web credibility goes even further to provide very actionable metrics and specific factors that help improve or detract from a web site's credibility. It's refreshing to find someone in research that has pushed hard to assist the transition of ideas from research to practice.His book is not a &quot;how-to&quot; cookbook of guidelines for creating persuasive software. Great design rarely proceeds from slavishly following lists of guidelines. It involves understanding the user and their behavior, the problem space and the media, and creating optimal solutions. \\"Persuasive Technology\\" provides the necessary fundamentals for design in this domain and stands with classics like \\"The Design of Everyday Things\\" by Don Norman in achieving this end.Dr. Fogg ends by taking on the controversial topic of ethics in persuasive computing and steps forward as a champion of using persuasive computing for the benefit of users while acknowledging the darker side that exists. \\"Persuasive Computing\\" is an essential read for those interested in this area and in recognizing unwanted persuasion.I look forward to more work in this nascent field, both from Dr. Fogg and others who follow his lead.Andy CargileDirector of Design ResearchAttenex Corporation"},{"Title":"Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do (Interactive Technologies)","review":"With his book Persuasive Technology, BJ Fogg has made an important contribution to the fields of psychology and business. BJ, (a PHD graduate of Stanford) has done for digital-platform user experience what Allan Afuah and Christopher L. Tucci (two PhD graduates of MIT) have done for digital-platform business models. Afuah and Tucci, in their book Internet Business Models and Strategies: Text and Cases, clearly laid out the elements of Internet-related strategy formulation. Although its first edition came out only recently (August, 2000), the book is already in its second edition and has been adopted at a number of top-tier business schools. It has also had significant impact on the way many (including myself) develop Internet strategies. I expect that Dr. Fogg's book Persuasive Technologies will also soon be established as an important reference text for those wishing to use the Internet and other digital platforms (e. g., mobile devices, interactive broadband media) in pursuit of strategic and tactical aims. It will also serve as a powerful agent for stimulating discussions about the ethics of information technology design and deployment.Persuasive Technology is the first book dedicated to exploring Dr. Fogg's widely-discussed work on Captology (Captology standing for \\"computers as persuasive technologies\\"). BJ wrote the book at the urging of Philip Zimbardo (a Stanford professor famous for the Zimbardo Prison Experiment that many of us remember from our undergraduate psychology courses), who served on BJ's dissertation committee. Professor Zimbardo also wrote the Foreword to the book, which will most likely get the reader's attention as the importance of BJ's work is put in perspective.The book begins by providing an insightful context for the consideration of persuasive technologies. The book then spends the bulk of its time working through a refreshingly-explicit approach to characterizing how digital platforms may be used to shape user experience and behavior. Dr. Fogg has made important strides forward at providing a MECE framework (i. e., the categories/issues laid our per the matter under consideration are [1] Mutually Exclusive and [2] Collectively Exhaustive - this allows for breaking a problem down into smaller elements that may be understood and \\"solved\\" more readily.)* This has been done in a fashion that is user-friendly in the extreme. From merely scanning the Table of Contents, the reader can begin to formulate reasonably-robust methods for framing critical issues and opportunities relevant to persuasive technologies. Components of the framework are fleshed out in a fair amount of detail, with a generous set of references to the research and commercial applications that give shape and substance to the book's ideas.The book ends by discussing future trends in persuasive technology, and by exploring the ethical implications of the use of technology platforms in changing people's thinking and behavior. For several years, BJ has been challenging his students and his audience at large to address the ethical issues at hand. It is perhaps reassuring that the public community has been stimulated (and at times angered) by BJ's provocative attempts to stimulate dialogue. BJ, like many of his Silicon Valley colleagues, is somewhat of a technophile, but he has been adamant that we consider not just the benefits of technology, but its potential challenges to human privacy and dignity.This text will almost certainly be a key possession for marketing and strategy professionals who use digital platforms as a key component of their work. Hopefully, this book will make its readers not only \\"successful\\", but also a bit more thoughtful as actors in the human community.* Life, it may be argued, is not MECE (that is one of the reasons it is so interesting), but life and its salient issues can frequently be understood meaningfully in the context of MECE frameworks."},{"Title":"Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do (Interactive Technologies)","review":"Having spent 8 years in the field of Web Development and after being a part of many Internet and Intranet web projects and applications. There was one question that was constantly bothering me. We as a team, on almost all the occasions tried very hard to make the applications and websites as much user friendly as much as we could so that the users CAN DO it when he is there. The question was if we create something that user-friendly that he CAN DO what he wants to do, does it mean that he WILL DO it?So, thats where we started, the WILL to do became most important for us. On some of the projects the marketing and presentations helped us in creating the WILL within the user that drove good response. However, when I got my self in the MARCOM team in one of my previous companies and I saw my deliverables changing from just creating user-friendly designs to calculating and delivering ROIs, I thought I needed something more solid to help me get there.I have gone through the entire Human Factors International Usability course (now trying for CUA exam). Where I found PET (Persuasion, Emotions and Trust) as just a few slides of the course material. I started digging deep into it well before that but I could see the connection of the Captology and any image, web page, micro-site or anything that we as a team create.I got hooked to this book, read it many times, studied all the possible material available from Dr. B.J Fogg and implemented it to my daily work. The material is so practical and so straight forward that its impact could just not be ignored. Just a small fix on web page, like adding a logo or writing a persuasive copy gave us responses. Though in Chapter 9, Dr. Fogg deals with the Ethics of Persuasion, we tried few non-ethical ways (Manipulation) for few days to observe the results and we had the success.If you are in the field of marketing and web, look at this book as a tool that you can always keep with yourself and use it when necessary.My next book is Mobile Persuasion by Dr. B.J Fogg.

Fogg. Dr. Fogg is the founder and leading researcher in the field of \\"captology\\", which is defined as the design, research, and analysis of interactive computing products created for the purpose of changing people's attitudes or behaviors. Though not written specifically to help churches and ministries with their online efforts, this book has a myriad of insights that are extremely applicable to those us interested in understanding how our ministries can have a more effective online presence.There may be some who would ask: should a Christian ministry be learning about how to use technology to persuade people? Shouldn't we just present our message and then let people make up their own minds about their faith without any technological convincing? Isn't the use of \\"persuasive technology\\" one step short of tricking someone into believing our message? This simple answer is: no. Persuasion is not coercion. In fact, I feel that anyone who wants to effectively share the gospel must understand how to persuade someone. I would argue that anyone who puts up a web site, writes a blog, or even posts in Facebook is actually attempting to persuade: \\"go to my site!\\" \\"read my blog!\\" \\"like me more!\\" It is incumbent upon us to use technology to its best effect for the cause of Christ; understanding how to make it more persuasive and credible is an important step in this.The book begins by defining how computing technology can be persuasive. Several categories of technology use are defined, along with the methods of persuasion that are associated with them. You can tell that Dr. Fogg is a researcher and an academic by how he methodically moves through the definitions and categories, with each chapter building on the last. It is the chapters beyond these opening, defining chapters, however, where this book becomes invaluable for online ministry. Here Fogg begins describing the idea that a technology must be perceived as credible if it is going to be persuasive. Perceived credibility is defined here as a combination of \\"perceived trustworthiness\\" and \\"perceived expertise\\". You must be viewed strongly in at least one of these two components; being perceived poorly in either one will lose you credibility. Dr. Fogg then takes these ideas of credibility and applies them to a research project on the credibility of web sites. The results are a laundry list of web site characteristics and how they relate to credibility. In the book over fifty different characteristics are ranked by the positive or negative effect they have on credibility.If I had any criticisms of this book, it would simply be that it is already getting out of date (it is copyright 2003). While many of the concepts presented are lasting, the examples used in the book could use a refresh. The good news it that Dr. Fogg and his team at Stanford continue to research and write on this topic and many new works are in progress or available. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to understand how to make their site more credible.This is just a summary of a much more detailed review, which you can find on my blog: [...].

Expect your assumptions about gaining wealth and the meaning of success to be challenged. Examples: Success means deliverance from a past that limits us. Also, wealth is a neutral, though powerful, tool. We need more people of faith to have wealth and use it for wholesome causes. Gaylord writes from a very fresh and independent perspective. You won't find him repeating or mirroring the ideas of other authors in this field. This is a true original.

I was quite impressed with his speaking skills as well as his depth and breadth of knowledge in what appeared to me to be many different areas of wisdom. Mr Briley does an excellent job of explaining why so many people have difficulty in achieving success through the simple but often overlooked mechanism of permission. Of course, there is more than just that for the reader to enjoy. Richard Briley uses examples and Biblical references extensively throughout the tract. If you are looking for a book that will allow you to peer more deeply into your faith, then buy this book (and read it). The last two chapters would cause quite a stir if read on the evening news (but read them LAST!).

To quote from the book: \\"So, is it all right to pray for riches? Let's answer with another question: Is it all right for a farmer to pray for good crops?\\" The author Dr. Richard Gaylord Briley, was a protege of Arthur S. DeMoss and the Rev. Norman Vincent Peal. This book discusses the principles of success from my favorite two books: 1)The Bible; and 2)Think and Grow Rich. [Both this book and Think and Grow Rich throw light upon the fact that riches are not restricted only to monetary terms].The author explains how to use goal setting to create a successful \\"Alternative Future\\" within the context of Biblical principles. This is an excellent book that will change one's life by helping an individual to grow spiritually, achieve their goals, reach their fullest potential and make the world a better place for this and future generations.NOTE: This edition is based on an original hardcover version titledSeven Spiritual Secrets of Success.P.P.S. I also recommend the following as companion books: 1)Earl Nightingale's The Strangest Secret. This is an excellent work from 1956 that can help people in all walks of life to succeed. Earle Nightingale was a radio legend and a student of Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich (also seeEarl Nightingale Reads Think and Grow Rich; 3)The Debt-FREE & Prosperous Living Basic Course; and and 3)How to Reach Your Full Potential for God: Never Settle for Less than His Bestby Dr. Charles Stanley (Dr. Stanley is a proponent of Think and Grow Rich.)"},{"Title":"Pray and Grow Rich: 7 Overlooked Secrets from the Bible","review":"This review has really helped me.

Theoretical information is kept to a minimum and is very useful. This is a book for constructors who really want to build their own amp.

The state of the art in 1958 was surprisingly good, the builder will bear in mind that the book is written for English reader/builders whose smaller homes and penchant for more efficient speakers even then placed emphasis on smaller amplifiers than Americans tended to prefer. On the other hand, it's precisely the little EL84-tubed amplifiers today's vintage-tweako element seems to prefer, and if you are unhappy with your project you can always recycle it into a guitar amplifier!The projects in this book can be built very cheaply today, the only big expense being the output transformers, and even these are not terribly costly. I believe the intermediate hobbyist will do much better to build from this book with modern components rather than throwing good money into forty-year-old mediocre products such as those now bringing large sums on eBay-with the exception of Mac and Marantz and some specialty or industrial/professional products, most fifties and sixties hi-fi units were actually not very good."},{"Title":"Mullard Tube Circuits for Audio Amplifiers","review":"This is an interesting read, of historical value and a pretty good guide to some basic valve amplification circuits.

At sixty dollars it's a bit pricey but at the cover price of $16.95 would be quite reasonable if it were still available. Oh wait.

It strictly covers Mullard's most popular hifi tubes and their amplifier designs of the 50's. If you are interested in Mullard tubes, most notable being the EF86, EL84, and EL34 then this is the book for you.It covers classic Mullard circuits like the 5-20 and 5-10 power amplifiers, which defined high fidelity in the 50's and whose designs are still as good as gold today. This book has a special meaning to me because the first amplifier I ever built, as a young teen in the 60's, was a Mullard 5-20. That amp was my first experience with a real hi-fi amp. The book also offers pointers on construction and advice on how to not only build an amp but how to build it so that it isn't a hiss and hum nightmare. The Mullard circuits are conservative and clean. (the 5-20 can produce power levels up to 36 watts but Mullard rated it at 20 watts with very low distortion.)Although the material dates to the 50's, this information is as good today as it was back then, when tubes were the only act in town and the best audio engineers were still working with vacuum tubes. This book covers in detail several of mullard's power amps and preamps with several pictures of actual amps and preamps as well as full schematics and parts lists. The Mullard 5-20 was Mullard's answer to the Williamson (and to me a better answer). Anyone interested in vacuum tube audio should get this book and read it.

Although I am relatively new to Kohl, this book is somewhat repetitious. It feels more like an overview of some of Kohl's work in schools, with some noticeable development of his critical ideas. Kohl details his ideas about stupidity in the current public school system (related to his idea of &quot;not-learning&quot; in &quot;I Won't Learn from You&quot;) and he has some pretty strong words for special education programs and the flood of ADD/ADHD &quot;cases&quot; in our schools. It's a good book, definitely worth a read; however, if you know Kohl's work intimately, you might be happier borrowing it from the library instead of shelling out $20."},{"Title":"Stupidity and Tears","review":"Stupidity and Tears by Herbert Kohl is a wonderfully written book about teaching, learning, and the educational system in the U.S. The book is philosophical, historical, and political, and the author draws from his forty-five years of experience in the classroom to illustrate many of his assertions. Kohl is an iconoclast and it strongly shines through in his critiques of the educational system and his challenges to traditional theories of how children learn and ought to be taught. However, the book is not just a searing critique, it is a call for teachers to be strong in their convictions and not let the way of the system bring them down and burn them out, as is what happens all too often.The title of the book mainly refers to the first chapter, the strongest chapter in my opinion, which is where the critique of the system is laid out. He asserts that teachers and the educational system are stupid. He does not mean to say that teachers are inherently stupid, but rather, they are stupid as a result of \\"institutional and social coercion\\" (23). He also believes that the stupidity trickles down to students, and he helps illustrate the point through a quote by a high school student: \\"I'd rather be defiant and stupid in class than let the teacher call me a failure\\" (22). The strategy of this student, compelling his teachers to focus on his negative behavior rather than his learning, resulted in feelings of being trapped and neglected by a system that could not help him learn, which he really wanted to do. The author gives many more examples of how the system is broken and paints an ominous picture of the state of education.The author also gives a passionate critique of research and generalization, particularly generalization of the development of morals in children. He states that all too often researchers make claims that their research generalizes to all children everywhere, even though they may have had a small, selective, sample. He also claims that researchers don't do enough to address many of the social aspects (e.g., culture, religion) that surely play an important role. He poses a great number of intriguing questions regarding morals of children that he believes are not presently known, such as, \\"What is the effect of conventional moral values on an oppressed group within a society?\\" (64).The author ties moral development in with imagination, and believes that teachers should nurture and allow for the imaginations of students to develop naturally at all costs. He believes that imagination is crucial to morals, and says of the imagination: It does not speak the truth, but allows people to play with possible truths, to transcend everyday reality and, through thought and feeling merged, begin to define and understand their own values. He ends the chapter with a poem likely written by a student shortly before he committed suicide - and concludes that the student likely committed suicide as a result of being alienated at school, forced to conform, void of dreams.The book brings up many great points and has certainly inspired me and reaffirmed many of my beliefs surrounding education. Kohl is not only a great resource on topics of education, including great tips for teaching, but a joy to read. I look forward to reading other works by Kohl."},{"Title":"Stupidity and Tears","review":"what a waste! very trite, rather like sitting in a freshman education college classroom! seems like after 40 years we could have something &quot;real world&quot; schoolwise, to think about from h.k. his earlier books were much more insightful and had greater depth. in fact, i bought this book on the authors &quot;name&quot; alone....i will never do that again!!!"},{"Title":"Stupidity and Tears","review":"This book highlighted many of the frustrations I have with the school as an institution, both in my teaching program as a pre-service teacher and in my experiences of working with students in secondary schools.

This is especially helpful considering the long careers, many recordings, and evolving styles of many of them. Most of the photographs show the artists in performance. Blues and Jazz are taken decade by decade from the early years through the nineteen twenties down to the eighties and the contemporary era, with a closing section on the instruments and equipment going with the two long-lasting and changeable types of music. Profiles of each artist cover biographical background, music career, and the artist's influences on or contributions to the field.

But that isn't the case. The problem is probably more a result of SAP constantly changing their interfaces that causes more difficulty than it is worth, but does provide them with revenues from training and retraining their customers.I'd like to see an updated edition, but chances are it would address a newer version of SAP than we are running. SAP has their customers between a rock and a hard place.

Nevertheless, the poster is correct in that the book by Alex Schreiner, Introduction to Compiler Construction With Unix, is very good, and much more detailed and practical than Lex and Yacc by Levine. Which doesn't make the latter a bad book: I think it's the best book to read first; it's simple, friendly, and -- as far as it goes -- very enlightening."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"There is too much repetition of basic ideas in the first few chapters of the book, and not enough coverage of more advanced topics (like how to use marker nonterminals, how to use $&lt;&gt;$ constructs, etc).The discussion of shift/reduce and reduce/reduce conflicts in chaper 8 is pretty good though and would make a fine introduction for a beginner wanting to learn /basic/ concepts.Good error handling is definitely a black art, but I still would have liked to have been given more information about it in chapter 9. The examples were also a bit too soft.Chapters 4 and 5 have some interesting (and highly unusual)examples for scanning and parsing applications, but they do not show off many of the advanced capabilites of lex and yacc. What this book really needs are couple of examples that demonstrate how to overcome classic scanning and parsing horrors (like how to do type checking in, say, C); a chapter like this instead of one of chapters 4 or 5 would be great.Even today lex and yacc are very important tools in the computer scientist's toolkit. They were designed 25 (or so) years ago, but /real/ documentation is still nonexistant. This means that unfortunately, this book is one of the best.I think that the FSF's Bison manual is much better value for money.

Of course I enjoyed the clear style of writing. I'm no more a beginner, so I can't be a good judge of its quality as tutorial; anyway I'm sure this is the best book for a newcomer also.

Forget that the principles behind these tools haven't changed; there are or could be fresh examples -- who needs help writing a curses-based, menu-driven interface anymore? The SQL parser example is a loooong source dump; a shorter example would help to focus on principles, and allow room for more liberal commenting.I far prefer this book over man pages, but the title could stand a refresh."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"Lex &amp; Yacc are fairly complex topics and any assitance is greatly appreciated. And this book is a good introduction to these tools. However, many details are only mentioned in passing and others completely ignored. A 2nd edition, with a more extensive list of the Yacc options and information on bison would earn a well respected spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"Lex &amp; Yacc are extremely powerful programming tools. They are also difficult to master. This book provides a good start. You may need to read it several times and work through the examples before things begin making sense. I also recommend the FSF's book &quot;The Bison Manual&quot; for indepth info on the most common Yacc-compatible parse generator."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"This book, along with the Dragon Book, forms the required reading for anyone interested in compilers and language processing. I was quite impressed by the clarity of the examples, and the breadth of the different lex and yacc implementations that it covers. If you need to do complex parsing or language design, definitely pick up a copy of this."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"A really good book...this is basically the only good tutorial/reference on purely yacc/lex topics. If I have one complaint it is that it should be a little longer, but otherwise it's great; it covers all the lex/yacc versions including flex and bison, has good examples as well as thorough explanations of key concepts. If you need to parse a complex file format or compile a language, this is basically required reading."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"I knew nothing about either lex or yacc when I picked up this book. However, John Levine clearly explains the basics, devoting separate tutorial chapters to both lex and yacc as well as two chapters for complete real-world examples (I was impressed with the chapter about parsing SQL). Despite the repeated nature of parts of the reference sections, I highly recommend the book to anybody else who needs to learn how lex and yacc work. Especially useful for identifying common problems. Includes documentation for nearly all of the functions lex and yacc define."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"I like this book because it is a good compromise between lex & yacc man pages and the theory found in books such as the Dragon book. You will get valuable information about the how and why of the tools that will help you to produce a quality grammar without being overwhelmed by details."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"I've used this book a lot to help me get started using Flex and Bison, and I still often refer to it. The official Flex and Bison manuals help to fill in any gaps and flesh out details. An update would be nice that included information available on the Web. The included examples were okay, but a simple procedural language example would be very useful."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"The book is compact, well written and describes really every problem with LEX &amp; YACC I can think of. I've got every answer I had about these tools in this book. It's a good book for everyone who'll write a compiler or any other program which needs parsing.The only thing I have is the lack of Bison-describing. They reference to the Bison-documentation, but this would make the book complete."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"This is a nice introduction for anyone who wants to start working with lex and yacc. What it explains, it explains well.Unfortunately, there is much it does not explain at all. For example, how do I process conditional statements, how do I deal with functions and procedures, how do I incorporate classes in my language.The book needs a second volume which picks up where this one ends."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"&Agrave;&Igrave; &Agrave; &Aacute;&ouml; &Agrave; &Aacute;&ouml;&Agrave;''&Ugrave;. &iquest;&igrave; &Agrave;&Igrave; &Agrave; &ouml; &iquest; &iquest; &iquest;&Aacute; &Iacute;&Agrave;&Igrave; &iquest;&igrave; &iquest;&iexcl; &eacute;&uacute;&iquest;&auml;. &iacute; &ouml;&Aacute; &iquest;&eacute; &Egrave; &ouml; &Agrave;&Ouml;&Agrave;''&Ugrave;. &iquest;&Iacute; &szlig;&Agrave; &iquest; &iacute; &Ntilde; &Agrave;&szlig; &iacute; &Agrave;&Ouml;&Agrave;''&Ugrave;.

It uses a more realistic example and shows the error handling in more detail. This book is ok for a quick intro, but for a 'real&quot; user, refer to the book I mentioned above."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"As with several other O'Reilly books, I found Lex &amp; Yacc to be maddeningly uneven. The approach is to give a too-brief synopsis of the tool, then illustrate its use using a very specific example that, one suspects, is merely the handiest project the authors had available.I had a fair bit of programming experience when I bought the book, but none with Lex or Yacc. Some fundamental questions came up during the course of my muddling through, and these were left unanswered. I actually got more insight into these tools from a ~20-page web site on the topic.The reference chapters are organized alphabetically (&quot;ambiguities &amp; conflicts&quot;, &quot;bugs&quot;, ..., &quot;%ident declaration&quot;), and in a way that does not help someone who is looking for a specific answer (in trying to find out about the possibility of more than one parser in a program, who would think to look under 'v' for &quot;variant and multiple grammars&quot;?). These 'reference chapters' seemed more like a place to dump the information not discussed elsewhere.Maybe it's a lost cause, finding a comprehensive, well-written introduction to such an arcane topic, but I'm still looking."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"This book was disappointing. I had hoped for a tutorial and reference on Lex/Yacc Flex/Bison for building language recognisers, but in the tradition of &quot;yet another boring and useless reverse polish notation&quot; calculator - it gives us a desktop infix expression calculator. (How could I have possibly guessed?)The book presents some interesting material for those who want to parse SQL, but if you're eager to learn about translating programming languages, this book is nearly useless. It gives superficial and confusing treatment of language constructs like &quot;if-then-else&quot; statements, and gives only an exercise for recognising a function call and &quot;playing it back.&quot; (I feel these are cop-outs.) It also fails to explain clearly how to construct unambiguous grammars, or use facilities for operator precedence or whatver to control the ambiguity.To be fair, I am guessing this was meant as a reference for Lex/Yacc for those who already know how to construct language recognisers and have some knowledge of using these tools. But then why bother to give especially bad tutorial material in the early chapters if this were the case?This books is also in need of a new edition."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"As someone who has written a number of programming language translators and who has read a number of books on compiler generation, I found that this book is very readable and gives the best introduction to compiler compilers I've ever seen."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"In general this book is very good, and I would highly recommended it for anybody using tools like lex and yacc. It covers all the areas (both good and bad) of these tools. However, I find that the book is frustrating and incomplete in two ways :-(1) when it comes to solving some of the problems reported by such tools as lex and yacc, there is not enough of examples, especially less-trivial examples, and some of the more potentially obscure problems that can occur.(2) it is very frustrating that the page numbers listed in the index are out by 1 or 2 pages. In this era of technology this should not happen."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"There is too much repetition of basic ideas in the first few chapters of the book, and not enough coverage of more advanced topics (like how to use marker nonterminals, how to use $&lt;&gt;$ constructs, etc).The discussion of shift/reduce and reduce/reduce conflicts in chaper 8 is pretty good though and would make a fine introduction for a beginner wanting to learn /basic/ concepts.Good error handling is definitely a black art, but I still would have liked to have been given more information about it in chapter 9. The examples were also a bit too soft.Chapters 4 and 5 have some interesting (and highly unusual)examples for scanning and parsing applications, but they do not show off many of the advanced capabilites of lex and yacc. What this book really needs are couple of examples that demonstrate how to overcome classic scanning and parsing horrors (like how to do type checking in, say, C); a chapter like this instead of one of chapters 4 or 5 would be great.Even today lex and yacc are very important tools in the computer scientist's toolkit. They were designed 25 (or so) years ago, but /real/ documentation is still nonexistant. This means that unfortunately, this book is one of the best.I think that the FSF's Bison manual is much better value for money. It also does not cover advanced topics in enough depth, but what is does explain, it explains quite clearly."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"This book will get you writing language compilers in Lex and Yacc. It is clearly written, to the point, and has a wealth of useful information.It should be supplemented with a more theoretical work, like Aho, Sethi and Ullman's book on compilers."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"Firstly there are not many books on Lex &amp; Yacc.Unix programming by Kernighan &amp; Pike providessome necessary information but it is not sufficientto write a complex parser or scanner. In these circumstancesthis book acts like a God given gift for compiler developers.The examples which introduce the tools are very good.But the theory behind these examples is not well explained.Probably NFA/DFA concepts add more strenght to thebook. Adding more and more concepts and exampleswill make this as a unique book in the Market.Many guys who desire jobs as compiler developersfollow this book. So some contemporary examples thatI expect from future editions of this book areA) Parsing a Gate level designB) A small simulator which simulates an analog/digital designC) An assembler etcD) Relational algebra tutor etc.Hope the authors can consider this request."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"To me a great book flows into your mind, magically providing the information in the order you need it. Of course it depends on whose reading it, but this book, though well worth the 96 cents bargain bin price I paid for it, does not build the constructs in my head the way I'd like.Authors should always proofread their books with novices, not the experts. Experts fill in the gaps as they read and don't notice if the logic is missing a link. In chap 2, \\"Using Lex\\", there is the sentence: \\"Lex itself doesn't produce an executable program; instead it translates the lex specification into a file containing a C routine called yylex(). Your program calls yylex() to run the lexer.\\"I waited with baited breath for what it means to \\"run the lexer\\". Does it return a token each time you call it? Does it analyze all the input then return? The text ignores this detail and merrily goes on into other details. The chapter is called \\"Using Lex\\", but the authors omit how you use it! Of course you can scrounge around in the examples and finally root it out, but a book should paint a crystal clear picture, get you oriented, then drop in the details to build your understanding.The book looks so promising, sort of like the beauty of the original \\"The C Programming Language\\" by Kernighan and Ritchie, but disappoints in it's fragmented exposition.I did take a compiler course with the \\"dragon book\\" years ago and write a parser, so I'm not totally in the dark, but I expected this book to lay the subject out in a much clearer way. But it is still a good book to have and read \\"offline\\".I hope the authors take a crack at another edition and explain it all better."},{"Title":"Lex & Yacc","review":"Yacc (yet another compiler compiler) and its companion lex (lexical analyzer) are primarily intended to allow quick and easy development of small special-purpose languages. The common mistake is assuming that they are only useful for creating compilers for massively complex eccentric languages. This is not the case, though you could no doubt use them for such a purpose.Lex and Yacc are commonly used together. Yacc uses a formal grammar to parse an input stream, something which lex cannot do using simple regular expressions since lex is limited to simple finite state automata. However, yacc cannot read from a simple input stream - it requires a series of tokens. Lex is often used to provide yacc with these tokens. As a result, building an application in lex and yacc is often used as an exercise in classes on programming languages and the theory of computation to demonstrate key concepts.The book starts out building a simple character-driven calculator, and then moves on to build a menu generation language that produces C code that uses the standard \\"curses\\" library to draw menus on the screen. The final application is a SQL parser which includes a quick overview of both relational databases and SQL. Some readers will dislike the fact that Lex and Yacc are only capable of generating C code. Thus, the logical conclusion is that you must be able to write C code in order to use these tools. While it would be nice if the sections about the menu generation language and the SQL parser had some information about how to do typechecking and other such things, this book is not about writing a compiler/interpreter using Lex & Yacc. Rather it is just a beginner's guide.The sections about shift/reduce and reduce/reduce conflicts are especially helpful, as are the sections going over the differences and caveats relating to the major versions of lex and yacc such as AT&T;'s Lex & YACC, GNU's Flex & Bison, and Berkeley's Yacc. In summary, if you've never used lex or yacc before and think they might be useful tools for you, and you already know the C programming language, this is a handy book to have."},{"Title":"Logan's Run","review":"this book is about this futueistic world where everyone gets a chip in thier hand as a baby and when they are like 35 or something that chip gets deactivated and they die.this keeps the population under control.well ol logan didnt dig this idea and takes a hike and big brother goes out after him.thats about what i remember other than the book was fantastic and the movie wasnt all that great."},{"Title":"Logan's Run","review":"I picked up a copy of Logan's Run with this exact cover in Kidd's Bookstore in Cincinnati in November of 1969. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. Logan is a policeman(of sorts)in this futuristic novel about over population. Each child when born has a \\"rose\\" implanted in the palm of the right hand. It is red in the beginning, but it changes colors throughout the individual's life. However, it turns black when you reach the age of twenty-one. At this point you are supposed to turn yourself in to the governemtn to be eliminated. Some don't; hence, they are called runners. Logan hunts them down and kills them. When Logan's turns black, he runs along with another runner. Reading this book was like riding a rollor coaster at top speed. I had a hard time putting it down, and I was genuinely saddened when the book ended and there wasn't anymore.I did get the feeling that the ending left room for a sequel."},{"Title":"The Internet for Busy People","review":"Are you the only dinosaur left who hasn't been on the Web yet? Or maybe you're sick and tired of people raving about the Internet while you sit and nod knowingly, but without the slightest clue what they are ranting about. If you have decided it's time to surf before you get alienated, but only have coffee breaks and short lunches to learn how to surf the Web, The Internet for Busy People can give you a crash course in surfing lingo. The best way to learn how to surf is to dive in and get immersed in interfacing with the new environment. The Internet for Busy People does exactly that by using rich colourful pages that give you great screen shots of what you will see while browsing the Internet. As most individuals are more receptive to graphics inclined than text, the book's familiar and myriad screen shots shortens the learning curve, much like a computer flight simulation assists a pilot in flight training. Besides great screen shots, call-out diagrams that point out how to fill out a web page form help overcome the form-filling paranoia that many of us have. For instance, what should you put in the domain box and, for that matter, what the heck is TCP/IP or SMTP Besides helping you overcome such nightmares, The Internet for Busy People does a great job in easing the rookie surfer into Netspeak and the lingo of the Internet surfer. As you get more proficient with simple e-mail protocol, Crumlish grooms you for bigger and better things on the Internet like File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and researching using Gopher to access remote libraries. But my favourite aspect of The Internet for Busy People is the expert dialogue box that peppers the book with wise words from the pros. In so doing, Crumlish actually treats you like an intelligent, albeit busy person that doesn't need to be coddled with simplistic information. Even for a seasoned surfer, I picked up some new tricks and got some questions answered from the expert advice dialogue boxes. I've always found that writing style and tone of voice in any computer publication is the make-or-break factor in my enjoyment of a book. It's easy to accumulate knowledge, but to share it in a non-condescending manner that doesn't put the reader off. Crumlish makes reading The Internet for Busy People like hearing from a friend enthusiastic about teaching you the ways of the Web. The Internet for busy People is surprisingly affordable considering that every page is chock-full of colour graphics and illustrations. Basically, it's like browsing the Internet before you actually go on-line - a dry run, so to speak."},{"Title":"The Internet for Busy People","review":"Christian Crumlish doesn't waste your time explaining every little insignifcant detail about the Internet.

I've upgraded it to a 3 mostly because of the delightful character Erica. In this particular book, the ending is pulled out of a hat even more than Tey's usual ending. There are lots of red herrings too. Some were interesting--but not really explored very much--almost vignettes.

Perhaps this is because it's only the second book of the series. The mystery is good and solid, and there are a number of suspects and red herrings that are thrown out for the reader's consideration, but some of the plot lines seemed a bit confusing at times. The end, truthfully, I saw coming from a long way out so that was sort of off putting. However, many people really enjoyed this one, so it's one you'll have to try yourself. I'd recommend it to fans of Tey, or to fans of Golden-Age mystery, or to readers of British mystery in general.Overall -- not bad; not one of my favorites by this author but still a fine read."},{"Title":"Shilling for Candles/Aud Csst","review":"Josephine Tey is a member of the Golden Age of Mysteries.

At first it is believed to be an accidental drowning, but soon it becomes apparent that this is murder. The novel begins well, and there are some interesting characters, but then it begins to go downhill. Instead of vintage Tey, we seem to have an Agatha Christie plot, and not the best Christie.There are red herrings galore, a false arrest, 2 escapes, supernatural overtones, and then an unexpected, unprepared for, and totally implausible ending. That the guilty one would have and could have perpetrated the crime in the manner indicated is just beyond belief. The author even has to make her turn out to be insane to create a strong enough motive--no, not nearly strong enough actually.If you want to read excellent Josephine Tey, try BRAT FARRAR or THE FRANCHISE AFFAIR. This one just isn't up to her later standards."},{"Title":"Shilling for Candles/Aud Csst","review":"Tey is a brilliant writer of character studies, with her strength lying in her portrayals of younger women and girls. Unlike her later mysteries though, &quot;Candles&quot; has one of the weakest endings in the entire genre of mystery writing. Still, the characters are so brilliantly drawn, it is just plain fun to read about them. After the first five chapters, the mystery becomes immaterial though. For stronger mystery writing, Tey's 'Brat Farrar' or 'Daughter of Time' would be the ones to read. 'A Shilling for Candles' would come at the bottom of the Tey listing, I'm afraid."},{"Title":"Shilling for Candles/Aud Csst","review":"\\"The last legacy of all read, 'To my brother Herbert, a shilling for candles.'\\"- from the last will and testament of Christine Clay, hereinThe unusual title comes from a still more unusual clause in the last will and testament of superstar actress Christine Clay - an enigmatic legacy to her estranged brother. Clay worked her way up from nothing, with a mother who spoiled her brother rotten while having all kinds of excuses why Christine couldn't have proper schooling. Christine managed to escape to the life of the stage; her rise was so rapid that when she married a wealthy man with a title, she was considered to have made a catch, but within a couple of years *he* was thought of as 'Christine Clay's husband'. (Her background, gradually uncovered by police investigation, is enough to support a story in itself.) Now she has been found drowned at the lonely seaside place she was visiting incognito, and a youngster who seems like a stereotypical victim of circumstances is on the run, suspected of her murder for what seems like an inadequate motive. And given the brilliance of Christine Clay's shining star, why was she alone on holiday, with neither a court of hangers-on nor her husband?Grant carries part of the story's action during his investigation, but Tey isn't shackled to a stylistic formula. Erica, the local Chief Constable's 16-year-old daughter, wades in where angels fear to tread, and generally assists Robin Tisdall, one of the chief suspects, to stay out of police custody while the police try to find out how Christine died. (This last provides an excuse for several mildly entertaining bit-part characters to appear, so I can live with it in the name of entertainment.)A few too many plots getting in the way of the story, and could've used better editing to work as a book. I think it works better as a performance on the audio edition than it does on the page. As always when Stephen Thorne is the reader, the audio edition is performed well.Elizabeth Mackintosh (\\"Josephine Tey\\" was a pseudonym) was primarily a playwright; she only produced 8 mystery novels altogether, 7 featuring Grant. Incidentally, she used yet another pseudonym, \\"Gordon Daviot\\", as both a playwright and for the original publication of many of her books. A SHILLING FOR CANDLES (1936) was Mackintosh's 2nd mystery novel, with an emphasis on 'novel' rather than 'who done it?' Tey isn't particularly interested in playing fair with the reader here, but I personally can live with that since the book works as a story. (I've taken off points for it, and for some issues with the story construction, but on the whole it's enjoyable, so the audio edition is worth having.)"},{"Title":"Shilling for Candles/Aud Csst","review":"As an audio book, this is a great production. As a mystery, this was a disappointment. How convenient that people stumble onto critical clues, characters and evidence. It's as if all of England were no more than four acres large. I am still wondering what the motive of the killer was; the ending was abrubt and nonsensical. Please read \\"A Daughter of Time\\" if you want to experience Tey's best work."},{"Title":"Shilling for Candles/Aud Csst","review":"Brief and gentlemanly, Tey's 'Shilling' comes in the middle of the pack of Tey offerings. She's enjoying something of a rennaisance these days--most of her novels seem ahead of their time, and one can't help but picture a youthful PD James consuming them, with visions of a future Dalgleish in her head. If you enjoy leisurely mysteries with much more class than pace, you'll enjoy Tey."},{"Title":"Shilling for Candles/Aud Csst","review":"This is a superb, atmospheric British mystery and cosy murder story.A naiive young man spends a few days with an anonomous, but rich and beautiful, female benefactor at her country cottage until he is accused of her murder after she's found dead by the seaside.Inspector Grant, of Scotland Yard, feels the additional pressure of the investigation when it's discovered that the victim was Christine Clay, a renowned and popular actress and the wife of an English aristocrat. The investigation gets even more complicated when the young and adventurous daughter of Inspector Grant's boss injects herself into helping to solve the crime.While a manhunt ensues for the young suspect, who initially evades Grant's clutches, alternative suspects do not escape his shrewd eye and, from there, Tey weaves a masterful set of sub-plots into this very solid mystery. At one point, Inspector Grant gets side-tracked by pursuing a nefarious brother of the victim, a clear suspect, which nearly costs the former his life.It is not likely that the reader will guess who the murderer is in this literary roller coaster ride. I put this one in Tey's Top Three mysteries, in which I also include \\"The Singing Sands\\" and \\"The Man in the Queue\\". Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Shilling for Candles/Aud Csst","review":"There is a dead body. Where is her car? Why is she swimming alone? It seems her body is expensively cared for.

The young man, Robin Stannaway or Robert Tisdall, the name had been changed to Tisdall to please a relative, stayed with Chris. She had picked him up when hitchhiking, saying that she was alone. The boy clearly has charm. Grant and others determine that it is probable murder.The book suffers from having the most likeable characters mainly off-stage or dead. In other respects, of course, it is wonderful, given that Josephine Tey was one of the best people writing in the genre."},{"Title":"Shilling for Candles/Aud Csst","review":"Josephine Tey is a marvellous mystery writer, but she does use the Golden Age formula. In this book there are actually three plot strands (one of which is a murder). In true \\"Golden Age\\" fashion we don't get the answer to any of the three until the end when the murderer is unmasked. Even though she uses the formula, it is apparent in this book anyway that she likes to flout the rules. It's that hint of the unexpected that makes her books such a treasure. And her titles!! They say so much in so few words.In this book Inspector Grant is looking into the drowning death of a famous film star. There are no shortage of suspects, and there is so much extraneous information that he gets quite frustrated trying to unravel it. But he peseveres and discovers the murderer in the end."},{"Title":"Shilling for Candles/Aud Csst","review":"This book just proves that great writing is timeless. It isn't gory and it doesn't have lots of action. But the characters are very well drawn and the investigation into a murder includes lots of twists and turns to keep your interest.Police procedures, the life of those who work on the stage, evangelicals, rags to riches - there are so many little stories in this larger story that it isn't ever boring. It will make you want to read more of her work in order to know more about some of these characters.This would be an excellent book for those times you have to wait - traveling or visiting doctors or waiting for kids to finish school/games. It is good for men, women and teens - anyone who would like a well written novel."},{"Title":"Shilling for Candles/Aud Csst","review":"\\"You've introduced characters in the last few pages that were never in the book before! You withheld clues so we the reader couldn't possibly guess 'who dun it'!\\"I channeled the late Truman Capote's Lionel Twain a lot reading the last few pages of this 1936 mystery novel. Sure, Twain was addressing a Miss Marple parody in the classic Neil Simon comedy, but he could have been just as easily been telling off Josephine Tey.Another movie to reference here is Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Young And Innocent\\", which was an adaptation of \\"A Shilling For Candles\\", though a very loose one. How loose? The main two characters in the movie are rendered secondary in the book halfway in, and the murder itself almost completely different except for a dead body washing up on the Kentish coast.Hitchcock played fast and loose with structure and sense in his movie, but Tey was even less tethered by the mystery-writing discipline. As other reviewers have noted, various subplots parachute out of the blue sky. Worse, they never connect in any coherent way to create some unifying concept. The worst involves the revelation of the killer. In an introduction to this edition, Robert Barnard praises this being \\"only revealed just before the unmasking of the criminal\\" as a kind of innovation and rebellion against mystery-writing convention. Lionel Twain would have called it something else.What's good about \\"A Shilling For Candles\\"? Well, Tey's take on the sleepy southern coast of England, and the bustle of high-society London where the victim was a celebrated fixture, presents delicious if dated social satire in the Evelyn Waugh vein: \\"The Sunday Telegraph liked influence and art. Even boxers never described punches to it; they explained their art.\\"Young tomboy Erica Burgoyne, a lively center of the movie as played by Nova Pilbeam, is a perverse delight in the book, too. Here, unlike the movie, she hardly needs convincing that the suspect she befriends, Tisdall, is innocent of murder.\\"You're not capable of it,\\" she tells him.\\"Thank you,\\" he replies.\\"I didn't mean it that way,\\" she answers.Erica's search for a missing coat is the high point of the novel story-wise, though here as elsewhere Tey's casual reliance on coincidence is very annoying. In the end, her slapdash plotting renders \\"A Shilling For Candles\\" too weak to recommend to non-fans of period mystery, but for those willing to endure the agonies of Lionel Twain, some fine writing and a few laughs are there to be had on the journey."},{"Title":"The Passion Promise: Living a Life Only God Can Imagine","review":"As a stay-at-home mom, I highly recommend this book.

What may not be as obvious, particularly to Catholics, is the pervasiveness of these characteristics throughout this church&#65533;s long and often chilling history. Author Mary Ann Collins explores this using an elegant and warmly personal format. Each section of the book treats specific areas of Catholic belief or tradition. Collins includes basic information in each area to give the reader a clear picture of how the belief or tradition is presented to the lay Catholic by the magisterium. She then details the history behind each belief or tradition, including its roots in paganism, carnality, greed, and other things the average Catholic is not even aware of.What keeps this book solidly out of the realm of Catholic-bashing are two things: the author&#65533;s obvious compassion for the entire spectrum of subscribers to Christian belief, and the prayers she&#65533;s included at the end of each section. Collins has chosen as her primary (though by no means exclusive) audience Catholics who are seeking a sincere connection with the Almighty, and have noticed that they&#65533;re not finding a clear path to this in the maze of obfuscation and pietistic legalism that is Catholicism. At the end of each section, Collins invites the reader to pray in faith the prayers she&#65533;s written, allowing the reader to articulate, among other things, his or her desire to see the way to an authentic and vibrant experience of faith in&#65533;and relationship with&#65533;Jesus Christ, as eloquently and specifically revealed in Scripture.The introduction by C. Peter Wagner and the afterword by Chuck Pierce--both noted and noteworthy scholars in the Charismatic/New Apostolic tradition--are eye-opening and hair-curling, respectively. This book is powerful and significant reading not only for Catholics, but also for the entire body of Christians whose religious tradition came out of Catholicism (practically everyone, in other words)."},{"Title":"Freedom From Catholicism","review":"If you enjoy being deceived then you will like this book.

Downes tends to be hidden in the literary sections of Catholic libraries. Too bad. It is a treasure for understanding one of the English language's premier modern spiritual poets.Mine was a gift from my professor at a secular university who noticed my appreciation of Hopkins. As a new convert to Christianity, and a young college student, I read \\"God's Grandeur\\" and \\"Pied Beauty\\" and fell in love with Hopkins' style and syntax, and found his view of God much like my own.There is no separating Hopkins' poetry from his faith. He was not writing about faith, but about his faith. There is nothing academic or third-person about his beliefs, even though, as a thinker, and as a scholar of poetry and theology, he was superb.\\"A Study of His Ignatian Spirit\\" brings us the spiritual path of a Jesuit priest, one who converted as an adult. Nothing impacted his life compared to his belief in Jesus Christ. Like a modern evangelical Christian, his faith was entirely personal, but, concurrently as a Roman Catholic, he walked with God in the communion of other Catholics, sharing a common theology and commitment to Rome.To understand Hopkins, it is necessary to understand the force behind the Jesuits, St. Ignatius, the founder of the Society of Jesus. Not merely a casual believer, one who believes without his faith engaging the rest of his, Hopkins was fully engaged. Redemptive grace, humility, love for God, were all keynotes of Hopkins' life, and evidence comes through his work.As a poet, Hopkins' body of work is small, although extraordinarily influential in his concept of sprung meter. As an Oxford grad, and as a priest under Cardinal Newman, he did not see faith in God as an afterthought, or as a polite salute to a cultural religion to which was conscripted. He converted after much deliberation as an adult. There was no force other than the persuasion of God causing the conversion, and so his submission was likewise absolute.Downes shows us excerpts from letters, essays and personal notes of Hopkins' himself, as well as with those he corresponded. We see his level of thought, of faith, views of what poetry means to him and what it can do. We see process and insight.Hopkins' is looked at next to T. S. Eliot, John Donne, and other major faith-driven poets.Chapters* Elected Silence: Gerard Manley Hopkins, 1844-1889* Ignatius and Hopkins* Ignatius and the Wreck* The Ignatian Spirit of the Priest-Poet* The Desolate Self of the Terrible Sonnets* Hopkins and the Meditative Tradition* Postscript* Notes* Selected Bibliography* IndexWell-researched and documented as of 1959, \\"Gerard Manley Hopkins; A Study of His Ignatian Spirit\\" is valid today, 50 years later, because of his thorough yet concise focus on this aspect of spiritual process. It shows the authenticity Hopkins' faith in God wore on his soul and life, with poetry being just one part. It shows Hopkins in a full spectrum, as more than the poet, useful for scholars hoping to grasp the complete man.I fully recommend \\"Gerard Manley Hopkins; A Study of His Ignatian Spirit\\" by David A.

The Remedy -- describes it beautifully: why we have the ups and downs of our economy, which cause incredible human misery, and why we have increasing poverty at the same time that there is hugely increasing wealth.And Henry George provides a logical and workable -- even elegant -- remedy, one which will untangle many of the perverse incentives we cope with today: we say we value work, but we tax it. We say we want to promote sales, but we tax them. We say we want to encourage entrepreneurial effort, but we allow huge barriers designed to discourage the person with an idea from being able to execute it. We say we want a society that naturally creates more jobs, but we allow a relative few of us to pocket the funds which would create those jobs. We say we value initiative, but we reward the \\"dog in the manger\\" far more than we reward the laborer. We say that urban blight is a bad thing, but our tax code encourages it. We say we dislike urban sprawl, and long commutes, and low wages -- but we've failed to implement the simple tax reform that will correct these ills. We work longer hours than our counterparts in other countries, and have less to show for it. We allow a relative few to own our airwaves, and resell them at higher and higher prices, collecting advertising revenues from all who would run for public office or advertise their products.If we truly mean to end poverty, to reward initiative, to ensure that the next child born in America is truly the equal of all who are here today, to ensure that our environment is protected for the common good, George's framework for understanding provides the missing puzzle piece.And as we consider what sort of country we'd like Iraq to be, it is worth considering that if we only give them a constitution without giving them an economic system that considers all people equal, truly equal, we've not accomplished much with the American lives we've lost there.If we can figure it out for Iraq, with all its oil wealth, maybe we can figure out how to share America justly among Americans, too.George lays out simply and elegantly what the underlying problem is and how to solve it.He dedicates the book \\"To those who, seeing the vice and misery that spring from the unequal distribution of wealth and privilege, feel the possibility of a higher social state and would strive for its attainment.\\" Might you be among those who see and feel, and would strive, if only you could see the source of the problem?Churchill, Twain, Huxley, Shaw and many others came to see what George was pointing out. Will you?This one is worth your time!Get a copy for yourself, and send one to your favorite legislator, be he/she local, state or federal. Then start looking for other Georgists, also known as Geoists. You'll find them a lively group with a vision that might inspire you, too. And it is refreshing to be with people who seek a finer society, not more advantage or privilege -- \\"private law\\" -- for their own benefit! --"},{"Title":"Progress and poverty: An inquiry into the cause of industrial depressions and of increase of want with increase of wealth ; the remedy","review":"This is a must-read, in part because this is just a brilliant work that doesn't fit in our normal intellectual history. It is also truly American in its way of thinking and the combination of radicalism and every-dayness. George demonstrates that ownership of land is the key to inequality; along the line he considers and sheds light on a number of other theories. He also makes predictions regarding the general development of the United States that have been very perceptive.At the same time, he isn't afraid to wax poetic. Why shouldn't one? We know why Cain killed Abel--because the farmer requires fencing off land, and calling it his, and his crops will be watered with the blood of his excluded brother. Isn't that where we still are--sacrificing human beings for property? And can we even determine who is in the right and who is in the wrong? George sets out a way of formulating the problem that allows us to get beyond things. It is still worth thinking about, since these problems have grown. And we can't run away from them...as Cain found out all too well.

Photographs enhance and illustrate this landmark presentation of the Gibson Les Paul's creation, and its prevalence in every decade to the modern day. A detailed, informative, highly readable and welcome presentation, 50 Years Of The Gibson Les Paul is especially recommended for the legions of Les Paul fans and electric guitar enthusiasts."},{"Title":"50 Years of the Gibson Les Paul (Softcover)","review":"After reading Tom Wheeler's incredible 50th anniv of the Fender Strat book, I wanted to complement it with a similar book about the Les Paul. This book wasn't it. Perhaps it's because the Les Paul (guitar) story isn't quite as riveting as the Fender story, and that's not meant as a swipe. The Fender story is about Leo Fender and a few others building an empire. The Les Paul story, however, is more \\"corporate\\". There's less personal drama.Tony Bacon does a decent job with the facts at hand, but I'm done reading the book, and I'm left wanting more. It's not a bad book, it will remain in my music book library.

This book is no exception. It is, however in my opinion, an excellent overview of the famous Les Paul guitar---not a resource book. At 160 pages it does a very fine job of detailing how this legendary guitar has blossomed into SO many different models over the last 50 plus years (up to 2001). Sticklers for details, however, will probably find it lacking in some areas (year by year pix and descriptions,for example), but then one would need a book twice as thick to serve as this kind of encyclopedia on the subject. I highly recommend it as an introduction to Les Pauls, and it will probably be all that most guitarists want to know about the subject.

Conley has. In her novella, THE MONSTER'S MIND, Conley shows us a criminal named Joshua Dawson. A monster, really. A man who murdered innocent children. What goes on in Joshua's mind? What monster is really lurking within, and from where did that monster come?The doctor interviewing him intends to find out. It's the same doctor that stood before a jury and testified that Joshua was not sane, convinced a court that he should not be put to death, but instead has him hospitalized for the criminally insane.Slowly Joshua begins to reveal his monster within and between his sometimes cryptic revelations and the doctor's researching skills and dedication to the case, the monster takes shape. The doctor begins to wonder: who really was the monster that caused the death of those children?THE MONSTER'S MIND is an intriguing story that explores Conley's ultimate question, which is that of forgiveness. Conley's clear intention is to call attention to the \\"human\\" of humanity and to make the reader ponder such murky subjects as free will and right and wrong.Unfortunately, the reader must get there mostly on his own. For some reason, Conley's message is clear, but her characters are not. She gives Joshua no voice, with not a single sentence of dialogue anywhere within the story. Additionally, she gives the mysterious \\"doctor\\" no name or identity. There is no hint as to who her characters really are, which leaves their philosophies a little loose.What's most intriguing about this is that Conley is clearly an experienced writer. Her grammar is flawless, her writing style clear and concise, which would leave a reader to believe that she kept her characters flat for a reason. However, that reason is unclear. Is it a statement that Joshua and the doctor represent all of society and its warring factions of right vs. wrong? Is it a suggestion that in today's society The Judged (Joshua) have no voice and The Judger (the doctor) is often quick to dole out blame while remaining nameless, faceless?THE MONSTER'S MIND is an easy read and can be finished in one sitting. It is good food for thought about assigning blame to the guilty and hastening to dub someone \\"monster,\\" while shocking the reader with an ending that will make her gasp."},{"Title":"The Monster's Mind","review":"The Monster's Mind is a powerful story that deals with the workings of thehuman mind, in its most monsterous state.Its depth is intriguing and suspenseful in its depiction of the darknessthat lies in the deepest parts of the mind.

The main character was, I believe, left nameless/genderless for a reason. You will also notice no dialogue of any kind. It is quite amazing an entire book would be written without dialogue unless it was intended to be so. In this case, I believe Ms. Conley knew exactly what she was doing and she did it very well. I can't wait for her next work of art."},{"Title":"The Monster's Mind","review":"While A.J. Conley's book may be her first published piece of fiction writing, it is clear that she is a voice to be reckoned with. The short length of the book makes for an easy, one-sitting read, and the gramatics of the writing are near flawless.The characters in the story, while somewhat wooden, and one-sided, are excellent metaphores for society. The protagonist, in particular, makes for an unusual and interesting character study in that he/she is nameless but expresses a broad range of feelings and emotions about a subject which is relatively taboo in today's society, mental unstability.While I found the ending to the book to be a touch overly dramatic and too high in \\"shock\\" factor. The overall read was enjoyable and should make for an interesting film (as rumor has it, the story is being adapted into a feature-length film). I'm looking foward to Conley's next book."},{"Title":"God's festivals in scripture and history: Part 1: the spring festivals","review":"The book traces God's festivals from Bible to history, and who did away with them. It would be of great benefit for a Christian to re-examine the feast days for himself or herself and discover the truth on the validity of feast-keeping in these last days of earth's history: They were not done away with by God, Himself; rather, they were put away by man.

Despite the sometimes academic style of writing, this book provides an important service: it answers the question, &quot;What is it like to live under Fidel? What does the Revolution mean to everyday Cubans?&quot; Rosendahl makes it clear that this study is based on her experience while living in a small town in a fairly agricultural area, and does not necessarily reflect the feelings of Cubans living in Havana, and certainly makes no comment on the outlook of Cuban exiles in the US. What it does do is give as broad and balanced a perspective as possible of how the communist revolution affects aspects of everyday life, such as schooling, shopping, and interpersonal relationships. The study took place in the 1980's, so it is only in the brief epilogue that Rosendahl has a chance to comment on the devestating effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union. In response to the previous reviewer, the feminist notions that Rosendahl presents are that women are equal to men, and the claims that socialism has been good for Cuba in part can be easily supported by standard of living statistics available from the UN. In conclusion, though the style could be improved, this book provides unique insight into life in Communist Cuba."},{"Title":"Inside the Revolution: Everyday Life in Socialist Cuba (The Anthropology of Contemporary Issues)","review":"Ms. Rosendahl's book reads more like a master's thesis than an informative book. It was apparent to this reader that she started with strong feminist and socialist tendencies which caused the conclusions to be less than candid.Expect a book that starts with preconcieved notions that socialism is a very good thing and that without Castro's revolution there would have been no progress in Cuba in the last thirty years.Overall a very dry boring work that was difficult to follow. Many of her conclusions will ring very false with anyone who has visited Cuba in the last eight years or has the ability to form objective opinions of the state of the people."},{"Title":"Entering Fire","review":"Rikki Ducornet is probably one of the most overlooked novelists of the past 25 years. I think she is a very important writer just shy of being great. Like her previous novel, The Stain, Entering Fire is sexually charged and exhibits a sensuousness seen only in latin american writers like Marquez and Fuentes (except those two authors are boring).Entering Fire, which begins in 1880's Paris, on the surface, is about an amatuer botanist named Lamprias de Bergerac, a descendant of the famous long nosed Cyrano. Not known to the average person is that Cyrano conducted alchemical experiments and composed what may be the first sci-fi story about a trip to the moon. Lamprias has inherited that quest for knowledge from him, even if it goes against the moral conventions of his day. A lover of women, stuck in a loveless marriage with the aptly named Virginie, he takes on many concubines in his travels, even having the nerve to bring home one such from China with ironic name of Dust. Lamp goes further by having a child by his mistress, named First Man. Most of the book focuses on Lamp's travels and the adventures that he has in the jungle which are quite fascinating.Meanwhile, his son by Virginie, named Septimus, feels replaced by First Man, and begins to develop a xenophobia because of it. He feels inferior so he has to become a racist to make himself feel superior, with the encouragement of his mother, whose reasons are the same, feeling replaced by Dust. In the end he becomes a Nazi supporter during World War II and helps send his father's first love to the death camps of the Gestapo.Basically, you have two intertwining stories in the book, one of Lamprias, as he tries to discover a new Eden through physical and spiritual quests and willing to sacrifice his family to gain it. The other is that of his son's descent into madness and the love of his father which, once being rejected turns into a hatred of all those he sees as inferior.Most of the novel is powerful and dissects the madness and obsessions that humans can get locked into. The parts with the son are especially frightening by showing how a person can brainwash themselves into devaluing human life.Something that Ducornet has that so many of her high minded peers do not have is a sense of humor. This book could have been very apocalyptic but shining through everything that's going on is humor. For example, when Lamp recounts how he met Virginie, he says how impressed he was with her poetic speech and the deepness of her intellect. Unknown to him, she had simply memorized verses and thoughts from her school textbook and really didn't even know what she was talking about. She was just repeating them like a robot. He found out too late. Of course, just like comics have bad jokes, Ducornet doesn't always hit it.I highly recommend this book. I believe that some day Ducornet will join the great writers of my time where she belongs. Until then, I guess she will be my little secret."},{"Title":"Entering Fire","review":"Not many novels come with a warning, but it doesn't take long to realize that Ducornet's \\"Entering Fire\\" is well worth the shvitz. She is skilled at the art of narrative seduction and takes the pleasures and profane mysticism of story telling seriously. Her prose is singularly cunning, lush and probing and with whip-smart, mischievous relish she takes on themes that few would dare tinker with. I can only encounter this novel with curious wonder and leave its world burdened and crushed, bewitched and joyous.To look bravely into the heart of \\"Entering Fire\\", one must see the ever-intertwined lives of human brutality and tenderness, and in doing so, it becomes evident that Ducornet is raising important questions about the implications of the stories we choose to love and why. But she doesn't do so by asking -- she just lets them boil over in perfect surfeit like everything else."},{"Title":"Entering Fire","review":"it really is amazing that ducornet's fiction has generated any critical praise at all, when methinks it is fairly obvious that all her fiction is little but sentimental and oh so self consciously political correct drivel posing as 'avant garde' or, even worse, pretending to be surrealism. i suspect it has something to do with her husband, guy ducornet, who is a famous and well respected literary critic. &quot;entering fire&quot; is perhaps her most astonishingly bad and superficial book yet, and it seriously has been years since i've read something so barren of originality or merit. the narrative is half baked, mediocre garbage that has something to do with a young nazi writing letters of third reich fury and racial hatred toward his oh so marvelous, liberal scientist father. (and she gives him the definitive PC thumb up by making his lover throughout the novel a foreigner. sigh.)racism is evil and despicable, but am i the only one who sees ducornet as another kind of racist--a racist against racists? i'm not partial to anyone who judges another person on their ethnic origins or the color of their skin myself, but i do think it's a little pathetic for an author to base his or her work (although I hesitate to use the word &quot;work&quot; in reference to ducornet's thoroughly forgettable nonsense)on a reactionary impulse, no matter how justified or understandable it may be. i myself am liberal, but i guess i'm conservative in the sense that I expect a creative artist to have some actual talent as well as moral and compassionate opinions about things. dh lawrence, for instance, who was at heart basically a fascist and a nihilistic nietzschean, is indeed reprehensible in the sense that his attitudes were morally dangerous and just wrong, but I think it's safe to say that his work is infinitely more important than a book by the oh so bleeding heart liberal Oprah, or the aforementioned Ducornet. the value of art and literature simply has nothing to do with the moral character of the artist or individual, as oscar wilde said many times. on the other hand, if you're actually naive enough to see ducornet as some kind of 'surrealist' (I'm sure her books have andre breton or antonin artaud rolling in their graves) you probably aren't big on books, anyway, so there's no need to go into detail and explain why mentioning &quot;autonomy&quot; and &quot;the marvelous&quot; in every other sentence does not make you a talented surrealist. in case you don't get my drift, avoid this and everything else by her like the plague--you've been warned."},{"Title":"2001 Cars (Consumer Guide : Cars, 2001)","review":"I have been using the Consumer Digest guide for new cars in negotiating with the dealer for every new car I've purchased over the past 15 years. I'm convinced it has helped me save hundreds of dollars on each car I've bought.The Consumer Digest guide includes important information that you won't find in the Consumer Reports or Edmunds guides. First, it includes the REAL dealer invoice price, as well as the MSRP, for the car and for each individual option. (The \\"real\\" invoice is lower than the so-called invoice price that the dealer will show you, since the dealer's invoice does not subtract the hold-backs). That information is a key tool that I've repeatedly used successfully in negotiations. Also, Consumer Digest more systematically and comprehensively lists the specs and features included in all of the various trim lines of each make and model (e.g., in the 'DX', 'LX', and 'EX' lines of the Accord model), and the options that can be added to each, facilitating the buyer's comparison of the various makes and models before having to visit a lot of showrooms. This saves much time and gives the buyer a better-informed and stronger negotiating position.Unfortunately, I cannot find the Consumer Digest new car guide for 2006 (or 2007). If Consumer Digest has stopped publishing this valuable book, that is really sad. I wonder if manufacturers are no longer cooperating in providing car specs and invoice data because too many dealers have complained about buyers using this book during negotiations."},{"Title":"Hatha Yoga","review":"This book offers a decent set of 14 routines that build upon one another to introduce the important concepts and Asanas of modern yoga. Each coarse has a different focus, from relaxation, through rooting the feet, to strengthening the back with back bends. The asanas are mostly beginner's modifications with lots of pictures and text instruction based on what movements to do to come in and out of the postures with the breathing. In this way, it is a good introduction to yoga for beginners.Problems with this text include:1. It is not associated particularly with any one school. This can be good or bad. It is hard to find classes that teach yoga like that in the book, but it can be nice to find something that is new and not too dogmatic. Also, this work draws mostly from Iyengar and some Ashtanga Vinyasa yoga so it would not be totally foreign and could be integrated with classes somewhat.2. There is not a lot of theoretical instruction, like in the author's excellent &quot;Dynamic Yoga.&quot; The reader is encouraged to read this book, and I recommend it too, however, Hath Yoga: Breath by Breath seems like a series of progressive beginners routines for people who were unsatisfied with routines in the earlier book. As a work on it's own, it seems almost incomplete. However, this is perhaps only because the previous book was so rich, and this one cannot compare.3. There are, perhaps, better beginner's books out there. Yoga: Mastering the Basics, for instance is and excellent beginners book which is not associated with any one style particularly.So, I would recommend this book highly to people who enjoyed Dynamic Yoga and are looking for a more graded approach to learning the asanas, and to a lesser degree, to any beginner looking for a very gradual, graded introduction to asana."},{"Title":"Hatha Yoga","review":"Godfrey Devereux encapsulates in this book the entire process of Hatha Yoga.

The poem itself, enormously popular in the 18th century, is now shrouded in obscurity, and it stays in print only due to Blake's illustrations. But despite of its unpopularity, I found it quite enjoyable. It is best read in one sitting, without interrupting the constant flow of ideas and thoughts. It is a meditation, at once introspective and all-encompassing, a contemplation of Death, Time, Friendship, and Immortality of man. Granted, it does tend to drag on too much in the last chapter, but the first ones are so good they're worthy of being memorized. Blake's engravings, surrounding the text as a frame, capture the essense of the poem and at the same time enhance it, adding to it even more depth. The poem's abstract concepts take shape, making some passages more memorable. (This edition includes a commentary on the pictures' symbolism.) The book is worth getting for the engravings alone; it is a work of art in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"Alfie","review":"I have read the book by Bill Naughton and seen both of the films and i think they are all very good. I thought the recent film starring Jude Law was unfairly criticised. Alfie is the story of a young womaniser who always thinks he has the best end of the deal, concerning his relationships with women. He loves his life, and he appears very happy and content. But what becomes apparent is that Alfie is quite a tragic and lonely character. He sums up the whole story himself when he says \\"without peace of mind, you have nothing, and i haven't\\" I think the story is really good, on the surface it appears this is just a story of a womaniser but as you read on you realize there is much more to it than it seems."},{"Title":"Alfie","review":"AlfieImagine a handsome, sweet-talking, English accented gentleman that sparks your attention by his charming smile, and sexy laugh. That is Alfie to a tee. Every woman wants him, and every man wants to be him. Written by Bill Naughton, Alfie is a four star rated book, and maintains the readers curiosity. Naughton's goal for writing this novel was to show the impact of little things done by men to make women feel loved and worthy of themselves. This novel inspires romance, makes guys look like pigs, and teaches major life lessons within the context of the story.Alfie has a unique way of being romantic; he loves all women, no matter what shape or size. Being polite and charming to women is second natured to Alfie. He enjoys cuddling with them, dancing with them, taking them out to breakfast in the morning, and out for coffee during their lunch break. Spontaneously stopping by his ladies' place, to shower them with compliments and flirtatious gestures, until the next moment the women are begging for a relationship, after he pleasures them with things that their husbands are not giving them, and that the other men in town will not take the time of day to do for these women. He is a listener, a supporter, a friend, and an intimate companion, which most women want. Reading about Alfie's life filled with many women, and beauty is inspiring to one to become more romantic in their own life, and encourage love and contentment for themselves and loved ones. While many of the situations with the each woman and Alfie is indeed interesting, some may feel that it may be too much material to cover in a novel that should be focused more on the message of the book.Some have short attention spans, while others have very long attention spans. Reading Alfie, some people may, or may not become bored with the back and forth pattern of the stories and situations of each of his relationships. At the beginning of the book, the stories draw the reader in immediately, but by the middle towards the end of the book, the pace starts to slow down, and it seems that there is no light at the end of the tunnel. The ending is sort of abrupt, and does not seem fulfilling after the reader has patiently waited to hear the moral of the story. Although it is nice to see Alfie trying to include as many women as possible, he does not always make them happy.Trying to please everyone is a nice thing to do, until trying to please them backfires into hurting themselves, or others without being aware of the consequences. Alfie impregnates one of the women and has to face life-altering changes in his life aside from the more dramatic changes the woman has to go through. All of the sudden, the baby needs quiet time to sleep, patience and a lot of energy by the parents, and a constant watch over the child at the time. Simple time away from the house turns into a hard escape to get out of the house. Suddenly, using birth control is considered a little more carefully. More responsibilities, and less going out to party are now new concepts. Figuring out the life must go on, and that people must mature and grow up from always having fun, to becoming more responsible and make better choices that involve choosing things that may not be a personal choice, but according to priorities, the better choice to make.Alfie is a wonderful novel to experience and apply to our own lives. We can use the charm and love for people that Alfie has, and incorporate them into our everyday habits and lives. However, along with learning to love, comes learning to make wiser decisions, and find the grown-up in us that must take over the place of our inner child personalities in order to live successfully and happy. Reading this novel is a great opportunity to evaluate our own lives and help determine alterations that may need to be adjusted in some areas. Pick up your copy of Alfie today, to learn some important lessons and enhance your romantic personality, and add color to your reading."},{"Title":"Alfie","review":"The nicest thing that I can say about this book is that it is a quick read. The main character, Alfie is a womanizing, abusive, egotistical,despisable man. He is every man you warn the women you love to stay away from. He hurts the married women that he dates (okay, they are cheating, so they deserve it)but he hurts innocents (Annie)too. None of the charcters are likeable - the woman are either stupid, cheaters, or weak. I found the book to be shallow and am very glad to be done with it."},{"Title":"Drivers","review":"Critics have described Leslie as \\"gifted\\" and of writing with a \\"powerful resonance\\" with words \\"original, inventive and rich...\\" The stories in Drivers are all that plus, in turn nostalgic and unsettling, poignant and revelatory.Driving a motorized vehicle is the most dangerous activity humans undertake each day. In urban areas we encounter traffic jams and road rage. Rural highways present the danger of slow moving farm equipment and long, lonely stretches that are often poorly maintained. In each short story, Nathan Leslie shows these dangers clearly and draws us into the lives of individual drivers. The fictional characters are sharply defined and represent jaded cynics, hard-line realists, traffic gurus, doomed drivers, insecure dreamers, panicked or fearful fumblers, male and female. In testimony to Leslie's skill as wordsmith, he writes in a different, distinct personality and voice in every story. This technique, which is not easy, adds depth and power to his words.Drivers is an impressive study of human nature and our stunning, frightening obsession with cars, pickups, SUVs and speed. What one character calls \\"the messiness of humanbehavior\\" takes on a life of its own in each story. Due to space constraints, I deliberately avoided listing the 23 individual stories in this book. But if I had to choose a sentimental favorite, it would be \\"Canyonlands.\\" This longer story features a troubled man driving across country, hoping to regroup and regain control of his life. In this brief excerpt, the city born and raised traveler experiences the GreatSand Dunes of Colorado:\\"It was an incredible thing to see and I had to sit down. I couldn't hear nothing except the wind blowing the sand down the dunes, shaping the dunes, and also there were these little green reeds that the wind blew in circles. But that was it. It was like you search all your life for a place as quiet as this place, and then you find it you want to let it sink into your brain so you won't forget what it's like. All that silence. The sun was slanting onto the sand and the sand was cold. I took a picture, you know.\\"Since the first Model T rolled off the assembly line, driving has created a new, skewed reality. Nathan Leslie does a masterful job of examining these odd paradigms and the humans who experience them each day."},{"Title":"Drivers","review":"I discovered this writer recently. Nathan Leslie is, in my view, currently one of the prolific and insightful short story writers. His A Cold Glass of Milk was a well constructed sampling of first person voice--this is his specialty. In Drivers the author has allowed the reader a glimpse into the world we all know--the world of commuters and road rage. This makes the collection important, I think. Leslie's stories are fascinating in that they don't pull punches. My favorite stories in the collection are \\"Flyboys Down the Big End\\" (about race car drivers in the 50's and 60's), \\"Cog\\" (about a car mechanic), \\"Shape\\" (about a car salesman--intricate portrayal), and \\"Oh, Duesenberg\\" (about a love for cars that goes beyond the boundaries of normal). He is a master of characterization--all the characters in the collection really come to life. But all of the stories in the collection are interesting in their own way really. Leslie sandwiches very short stories between his longer stories. He is an author who hasn't yet received his due. In my humble opinion, it is only a matter of time."},{"Title":"Arizona (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"While this book is not a bad read, it simplly serves as a transition for the series, and not a pivotal one.

Gunrunner Francis Hagarty comes to town and excites Sylvie with his passion. Gowry discovers a cache of guns hidden in the shamrock, but though angry is not sure what to do about it. Even worse his wife is having an affair with the smuggler of the weapons.Unable to cope with his life's collapse, Gowry joins the fight on the continent. However, trench warfare in France is not an improvement. On the other hand back in Ireland, Sylvie is trapped in the Easter Uprising. In their separate hellholes, both know it will prove impossible to return to the lackluster life they once shared.SHAMROCK GREEN is an engaging historical novel that brings to life the turmoil of a world gone mad. Though the book starts extremely slow setting up the key characters and the background, once in gear it shifts into a lively period piece. Fans of World war I dramas will appreciate this deep look at the times. One should watch the PBS video The Twentieth Century as the one on this era is frightening, fascinating and unforgettable.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Cunard: 150 Glorious Years","review":"This is an historical account of the history of the Cunard shipping line - complete with all her big ships during the past 150 years. From Samuel Cunard's first sailing steamer - a paddle ship called RMS Britannia (the RMS stands for \\"Royal Mail Steamer\\"), right up to the QE2. Along the way we are able to read brief histories of such magnificent ships as the Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth and such four-funnelled vessels as the Aquitania and Mauretania.John Maxtone-Graham is a noted historian with a number of books on this topic to his credit. He also lectures widely on the subject of ocean liners.With the overall subject matter being such famous ships, there is enough information available to write a book about each and every one of the ships covered in this work. In this case, however, we are treated to an excellent overview - although, for many people, reading this book will simply leave them wanting for more.Once again we have a book that is extremely well supported by an excellent selection of historic photographs on almost every single page.NM"},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself OpenOffice.org 2, Firefox and Thunderbird for Windows All in One","review":"The software trio that Microsoft would love to vaporize... OpenOffice.org, Firefox, and Thunderbird. High quality software, easy to use if you already know the Microsoft equivalents, and best of all... FREE! Greg Perry has written a book that will get you up to speed quite well on it all... OpenOffice.org 2, Firefox, and Thunderbird for Windows All in One (Sams Teach Yourself).Contents:Part 1 - Writing Words with Writer: Start Here; Learning Writer's Basics; Making Your Words Look Good; Adding Lists, Tables, and Graphics; Using Writer's Advanced FeaturesPart 2 - Crunching Numbers with Calc: Getting to Know Calc; Working with Calc Data; Formatting Spreadsheets with Calc; Creating Advanced Spreadsheets; Using Calc as a Simple DatabasePart 3 - Impressing Audiences with Impress: Learning About Impress; Adding Flair to Your Presentations; Making More Impressive PresentationsPart 4 - Drawing On Your Inner Artist with Draw: Getting Ready to Draw; Improving Your Drawings; Putting on Finishing Touches with DrawPart 5 - Enhancing Your Work with OpenOffice.org's Other Features: Enhancing Your Work with More OpenOffice.org Features; Organizing Your Data with Base; Browsing the Internet with Firefox; Emailing with ThunderbirdIndexOverall, I think this book is very well done. The style is such that each chapter has a number of items (all numbered and listed in the table of contents) that focus on a particular task, such as formatting a table or inserting graphics in a document. These items are cross-referenced back to items you need to know/do before you start, as well as to items that will build on your new skills. As a result, the book works well as both a tutorial and a reference guide that you can use once you master the basics. The instructions are easy to follow, and pretty much 95% (or more) of what you'll need to do on a regular basis is covered. If someone were looking to use OpenOffice.org as their primary productivity suite instead of Microsoft Office, this would be a good book to pick up as your introduction.My only nit about the book is the inclusion of the Firefox and Thunderbird chapters. The way it's presented makes it look like Firefox and Thunderbird are part of OpenOffice.org. They're not. And if you're buying the book for some significant coverage on those two packages, you'll be really disappointed. In the 600 pages of this book, you'll get around 50 pages to cover both. It's almost as if the topics were included in order to ride some of the current Firefox popularity. In my opinion (and it's simply that... my opinion), I would have either left those chapters out entirely or expanded them significantly. If you're wanting to know more about either Firefox or Thunderbird, you'd be much better off buying a separate book that *just* covers that.Even with the criticism, the book is well worth having. You'll learn how to cut your dependancies on Microsoft's Office monopoly and save yourself quite a bit of money in the process..."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself OpenOffice.org 2, Firefox and Thunderbird for Windows All in One","review":"How useful is OpenOffice? Can it really replace Microsoft Office for some of you? These are the key questions that the book addresses. Many more people use Microsoft Office than OpenOffice. And if you are one of those, you've probably built up an expertise in it. Plus, you have files written in those formats. How easy is it to migrate?Perry deals with this at great length. He goes through each program in OpenOffice. Explaining how to use it, assuming no prior knowledge on your part. The most important of which is probably Writer. In an office environment, that is what most of us do. Perry reassures you that OpenOffice understands the Microsoft file formats for Word, Excel, PointPoint or Access. More than anything else in the book, you need to appreciate that you are not giving up much (if anything) by moving to OpenOffice. You can still read those legacy files, and you can write documents in those formats and send to others using Microsoft Office.Interoperability is a key virtue here.Now as for the OpenOffice programs, they are no more difficult to learn than their Microsoft counterparts. Serious sweat has gone into making them as intuitive and powerful as possible. All the common operations that you might expect in a word processing program or spreadsheet are here.Note that OpenOffice does not guarantee an exact functional mapping from Microsoft Office. So there are indeed steps you can do in the latter that are not possible in the former. But for most users, these should be uncommon operations.The book and its CD also cover Firefox and Thunderbird. But more as an afterthought. While the coverage is well written, it tends to be less detailed than about OpenOffice itself. I somewhat agree with the previous reviewer, who considered these to be a bit of an add on to the book. Nonetheless, it was competently done by Perry."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself OpenOffice.org 2, Firefox and Thunderbird for Windows All in One","review":"As other reviewers have suggested, the 'hype' you read about the Open Office suite is actually true. Especially in regard to sharing files with M$ Office suite. I have successfully passed spreadsheets and documents back and forth between the two without much of a hitch. As stated in other reviews, and in the book, there are differences in how some things are done, and actual capabilities of each of the two suites, but using the book will help immensely in recognizing and dealing with the issues (which, for the most part are minor). The only problem I've had with OO is one of these issues. I inserted a table with three narrow columns and over 200 rows into a designated section of a document. Then I set that section to flow that table into three columns, to save pages. However, whenever I edited the doc after that, I'd have to reformat the section, because it put the column breaks in odd places. MSWord doesn't have a problem handling the same document. I expect this little bug will be dealt with soon...another advantage of using opne source software!

It is a book I will read over and over again and have purchased many copies for my friends. The author's real life anacdotes make it a very readable book. At the end of each chapter she highlights the main points and introduces the reader to what is coming next. This helps to build anticipation.

So I confess that I approached this book with a bit of cynicism. But this book will move even the worst cynic. It spoke to me in a way that no other book has and inspired me to make major changes in my life that I've talked about making for many years. The recommendations may feel familiar - eat well, rest, get your finances under control, practice forgiveness - but the author inspires by making clear that taking good care of one's self is a spiritual task of the highest order. Adopting a set of practices that help us to achieve a pace of grace is necessary to ensure that we honor - every hour of every day - the virtues within us and bring our best and highest self to every relationship, challenge and opportunity in our lives.

This updated edition of their 1976 handbook suggests a solution to every problem a fledgling public speaker may face (including how to manage hostile questions), and not incidentally weaves in a great deal of anecdotal material concerning (1) the history of women speaking in public and (2) the shift in public manners that a genuine restructuring of the relations between the sexes requires.

To tell the truth, even though I have lived in San Francisco for 25 years, I had never even heard of Mom Chung, but I guess if I lived here during World War II I would have been reading about her exploits every day.One record after another, she smashed, despite the obvious disapproval of both the Chinese and white communities here. And then there's the gender thing. She adopted, as Dr. Yu shows us, a comically asexual pose, which made it humorous for hundreds of white men and women to call her \\"Mom,\\" which would have implied that she had had sex when to look at her, and to survey her lack of marriage license, she had none. There's the secret!The \\"fair-haired bastards\\" of the title were the war heroes, at first the pilots, then those who served in the Navy, then a bunch of \\"Kiwis\\" who Chung recognized for their work in the field supporting our men overseas. She attracted celebrities to her wherever she went, sort of like our own JT LeRoy in the present day. When she started out, she walked timidly, and it took a cunning and open-hearted woman like the poet Elsa Gidlow to see underneath the brim of her cloche and discover the Lesbian within. Gidlow's memoirs, from which Dr. Wu draws the story, reveal that Gidlow became Chung's patient pretty much to get that old countertransference going. And after a difficult operation, in which Gidlow nearly died, Chung finally admitted that she loved her.Later on came an intense attachment to the \\"last of the red hot Mamas,\\" Sophie Tucker. Chung destroyed Tucker's letters, but Tucker carefully preserved all of Chung's little love notes and tokens--thank Goodness, for otherwise we might never have guessed the lengths to which homophobia and sexual fear drove the love affair of these two celebrities deep underground. In a way it was a perfect pose. Chung nearly built Tucker her own shrine within her lavish apartment, so that whenever Tucker decided to visit San Francisco she would be pampered like a goddess. In one letter she hopes that Tucker wears a special nightgown, and \\"think of me as that nightgown,\\" getting upclose and personal with the famous Tucker body. Sophie Tucker was then coasting on a formidable heterosexual reputation, having been married and divorced thrice by the time she got involved with Mom Chung. I read a whole biography of this notorious entertainer, and the name of Mom Chung never even made it to the index.Thank the Lord for brave historians like Tzu-Chun Wu who no longer shy away from the uncomfortable truths about their subjects. How I wish that the bruited movie of Chung's life (starring Barbara Stanwyck in Chinese makeup) had really been made, in the long ago days of Mom Chung's celebrity!"},{"Title":"Doctor Mom Chung of the Fair-Haired Bastards: The Life of a Wartime Celebrity","review":"Having had to read this book for a history class I wasn't sure about whether or not I would enjoy it. But once I got an understanding of whom Mom Chung was and her importance I really wanted to read the book. I'm glad I did because Chung's story is inspirational, being the first Chinese American Female Doctor. Also Chung was a lesbian (though not 100% proved one can infer this from the evidence.) At the beginning I was inspired by Chung's strength and guts, her breaking through barriers and fighting to be successful and true to herself.(Also managing to continue fighting after several rejections.) Though by the end of her life it seems as though she lost her spunk and drive and settles into the status quo image.The author does a great job of explaining Chung's life and actually makes the ready feel her triumphs and loses. So from a biographical point of view this is a 5 star book. From the historical point of view it's not as good. She wanted to\\"...provide insight into the historical transformation of American norms regarding race, gender and sexuality over the course of her lifetime...\\" This might have to do with Chung being such a larger than life character it is easy to get lost in her and miss the general trends and changes that happened in her lifetime.With that being said read the book!!!"},{"Title":"Doctor Mom Chung of the Fair-Haired Bastards: The Life of a Wartime Celebrity","review":"I knew Mom Chung well, visited her soirees many times, and have had memorable experiences with her.

However, when I saw this title I thought I would give Sybex another chance. Unfortunately, Sybex has let me down again. This book was filled with technical inaccuracies. I am hoping that this is due to time to market issues causing poor technical editing, however, based on how far off this book was I think it must go beyond this.I wanted to point out some items that are somewhat misleading or that might have been over-looked during the editing process. I found that after starting with chapter 2 my patience would not allow me to proceed beyond this chapter.Email Clients- pg. 43&quot;Three e-mail clients are in use today: CC Mail, Netscape Navigator or the newer Netscape Communicator, and Microsoft Internet Explorer.&quot;- Netscape Navigator is a web browser that is often bundled with Netscape's e-mail client, Netscape Messenger. Likewise, the MS Internet Explorer (Microsoft's web browser) installer provides for the install of Outlook Microsoft's new e-mail client (replacing Microsoft Mail).Windows Internet Naming Server- pg. 48&quot;When a client connects to the network, the WINS server detects and records the both the IP address and the machine name. The information is entered into a file called LMHOST.SAM.&quot;- The WINS service will only work with a network client configured to participate as a WINS client. -WINS does not 'detect' the client's information, a client configured to utilize the WINS service sends this information to the WINS server upon startup. - The LMHOST.SAM file is not used to store the WINS database information. The WINS database is called 'wins.mdb' and is located in the \\\\systemroot\\\\system32\\\\wins\\\\ directory. (Windows NT Server Networking Guide; part of the NT 4.0 Resource Kit) - The LMHOSTS file is a static mapping system for NetBIOS names to IP addresses. WINS is the dynamic replacement. LMHOST is specific to a machine, although there are ways to push this down from a central location. - The LMHOST.SAM file is a sample file (hence .SAM), it provides a basis from which to create an actual LMHOST file. However, the LMHOST.SAM file serves no other functional purpose.Chapter 2 Sample Questions-Question 2: Answer is stated to be both B (subnet mask) and C (gateway). Answer B is definitely incorrect (see FIGURE 2.8 on page 54, you will notice that when 'Obtain an IP address automatically' is selected the subnet mask field is grayed-out). Further, C is misleading since by default most all DHCP servers are setup to pass down the gateway information.Question 3: Answer is stated to be C (HOST.SAM), this is incorrect for the same reason given above on the LMHOST.SAM; a .SAM file is a sample file and has no functional purpose.At this point I stopped reading and decided to return the book. Further, I am afraid I must deter other from purchasing Sybex books in the future; unless your quality improves and you can demonstrate this to me.Thank You,Patrick Smith Senior Systems EngineerMCSE MCP + Internet CCNA"},{"Title":"I-Net+ Exam Notes (Exam Notes)","review":"When you spend money on a study guide you expect to at least cover the basics needed for the test.

She was beloved of her family and suffered little in the way of childhood traumas or incidents that might darken her satisfied sense of life and herself. She was also a girl and later a woman with the sex drive of what at the time was considered- a man. More than that, she acted on it and what began in youth became a part of the rest of her life, that is the addition of a secret sexual fire and behavior that smoldered through her position as nothing less than wife, mother and social leader of the town.The Rage to Live is a book that accurately and presciently tells of an era of transition. In that Pennsylvania small town, the country and the heroine; a transition was occuring wherein the upper classes would no longer be secure to behave however they chose. It was also an era when over-indulgence itself was in the process of entering the mainstream, i.e. was democratized. That did not lead to an increased forgiveness in the part of the newly liberated, however. The old horse riding, martini drinking gentry has transformed even more over the years, but the Grace Caldwells and their trademark entitlement still can be found in various suburbs in and around the east coast and in the summers along the various coasts. Grace and her family and her fate makes for a great story, dated, but so what."},{"Title":"A Rage to Live","review":"Grace Caldwell was the young woman who stood out in her community, for her wealth, her athleticism and her confident, striking appearance.

More than that, she acted on it and what began in youth became a part of the rest of her life, that is the addition of a secret sexual fire and behavior that smoldered through her position as nothing less than wife, mother and social leader of the town.The Rage to Live is a book that accurately and presciently tells of an era of transition. In that Pennsylvania small town, the country and the heroine; a transition was occuring wherein the upper classes would no longer be secure to behave however they chose. It was also an era when over-indulgence itself was in the process of entering the mainstream, i.e. was democratized. That did not lead to an increased forgiveness in the part of the newly liberated, however. The old horse riding, martini drinking gentry has transformed even more over the years, but the Grace Caldwells and their trademark entitlement still can be found in various suburbs in and around the east coast and in the summers along the various coasts. Grace and her family and her fate makes for a great story, dated, but so what.This review is from: A Rage to Live (Modern Library Classics) (Paperback)Just finished Rage, read and re-read the A. Pope poem, from which the book title is derived. This is, indeed, a novel centered in transitions, and treats the heroine, Grace, with sensitivity and judgment. Most, like Louis Begley, who wrote the introduction, might leap to the conclusion that Grace, through her choices/dalliances, was relegated to exile in NYC. My somewhat feminist perspective is that Grace outgrew her provincial circumstances, embraced an essential part of herself, and moved on in the wake of unavoidable tragedy - almost certainly to the benefit of herself and her children. I'm not so sure much has changed in the US, especially in small towns. Rage is a good read, overly long in some places, and as mentioned, abrupt in others, in significant respects. I skimmed much of the boring dialogue and superfluous character setups, but otherwise found the novel engrossing."},{"Title":"A Rage to Live","review":"Just finished Rage, read and re-read the A.

I have read most of John O'Hara's books & decided to reread them. This particular book is about Harrisburg, & Fort Hunter which are local to my home. I am truly enjoying it all over again."},{"Title":"A Rage to Live","review":"I haven't written a book review for quite a while, but I thought I'd join the discussion again, as I just finished this book yesterday. I don't know. To me it leaves quite a bit to be desired.One of the things you hear about John O'Hara is that he writes good dialogue, and he does. The trouble, though, is that he writes lots and lots and lots of dialogue. I personally thought many of his scenes were too long, and a fair number of them could have been dropped altogether.I personally much prefer long novels to short ones. In fact, if a novel is less than 500 pages long, I approach it with a great deal of reluctance. And the shorter ones that have become the vogue in recent years miss me altogether. I won't even read the reviews on them!Also, I should point out that I read--and thoroughly enjoy--Victorian novels. So, length, in and of itself, is not a problem with me. Padded length is something else, though, and I really had the feeling that O'Hara padded a lot of his scenes. Also, we grew to know his characters almost exclusively through dialogue. And there was quite a bit of abruptness to some of his scenes, notwithstanding the novel's length.When one of the male characters, happily married with two children, decided to start having adulterous affairs, I found myself wondering why the hell he would do such a thing. I thought the author could have done a lot more to explain this particular lapse, and especially so, when he had done so much to explain why Grace found it necessary to drop her knickers on a regular basis.All in all, I would say, for those who are in the mood for over-blown passages, it is doubtlessly an interesting book. In any case, because it's John O'Hara, and he has such a reputation, it is certainly worth a look."},{"Title":"A Rage to Live","review":"I bought and read this novel because it is set in a fictionalized version of Harrisburg, PAWhere I had recently moved, and where I was studying the history and mores of the city.O'Hara thought of himself as a candidate for a Nobel Prize.

Men only wish that sex were that easy.O'Hara's reputation is much like another icon of the 60's -- Elizabeth Taylor.Producers kept giving her employment in film - and even after the gushing results - they voted to give her AWARDS!!But then I thought Elvis Presley was an embarrassment too -"},{"Title":"Functional Assessment: Strategies to Prevent and Remediate Challenging Behavior in School Settings","review":"Could not put the book down.

My view is that if you are taking the time to read a book on a subject, you want details. I find generalities and broad sweeping statements a waste of time. This text provides a breadth and depth of information in a clear and succinct manner. My only complaint is that the book could be updated with a newer edition.

He explains the reasons behind all the fees that are attached to loans, but does little to explain how to avoid or reduce them. He describes the different types of loans available, but doesn't really tell you why you should choose one over another. This book was a mostly a waste of time. You are better off reading the section about mortgages in Home Buying For Dummies and finding yourself a good mortgage broker."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"Had me in with the frist breathless sentence, and though each chapter is very different, Smith managed to keep me enthralled right to the end.

But with her lucid, fast-paced array of voices, Ali Smith has done something very few peers are managing these days, cast a vivid new world with crisp, strong characters. While I can agree at some points the pool seemed to be growing shallower (the gimmicky use of '&', {can somebody help me recall the name of that symbol?} and the occasional moral lesson shouted and waved) I was hooked right through to the very end.If you tried Kerouac once and put him down forever, dont go near this book.

And then each, in turn, relates their personal story.Hotel World is a story of the power of time, how quickly time can turn us from living to dead, sane to mad, happy to sad, secure to homeless, rich to poor, healthy to sickly, and how we swim through the fog of finite time.Time is omnipresent and of great importance to the story.Life can end in a heartbeat!...Live freely and passionately in the time you inhabit...now, the present!The heaviness of the prose gave this work the sensation of swimming through metaphors that could not be rushed. One had to come up for air from time to time to continue the breaststroke forward.Ms. Smith plays quite skillfully with words that are at times so amusing and clever that I had to stifle a chuckle. It's hard not to delight in the ingenuity of this novel, despite wanting more plot, more character development, more cohesiveness in sentence structure."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"I thought this was a very well written book, with an excellent storyline. Although I had a little trouble reading the point of view chapter from Sarah's sister, I thought the overall effect was great. Good book!"},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"This book is really difficult to review. It is not a book that you just pick up and read for fun. The literary structure is all over the place (e.g., there is an entire 35+ page chapter without a single period); it is totally nonlinear, each chapter starting out with a totally new main character; and there are no quotation marks used at all (a la Jose Saramago). And yet, this book hit me to the core with a heartbreaking emotional punch. In each chapter, Smith starts out in a whirlwind style that eventually leads to a strongly compelling accounting of a particular, important incident. If you are open to \\"alternative\\" literature, if you wish for more creativity in you reading, and if you allow yourself to give in to Ali Smith's \\"World\\" you should be highly rewarded and deeply moved. I shed tears like a baby near the end of this book, but in a really, good life-affirming way."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"This book was almost like five short stories all connected to a central plot, with varying voices and styles. The first narrative is told by the spirit of a girl, Sara, who died falling down the dumbwaiter shaft of a hotel. A homeless woman who skulks around the hotel and the street surrounding tells the second part. The third is told by an employee of the hotel and the fourth by a journalist who is a guest of the hotel. The final, emotional account comes from Sara's sister. While each voice has its own distinct style, they are all written as a stream of consciousness. Some are more choppy in their thoughts than others, and some, especially Sara's sister, run one thought in to another. It was an interesting, quick read, different than I initially expected. Like other reviewers, I tend to go for straight plot, but Ali Smith's writing kept me captivated."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"i found this novel to be wondrous & delightful. the first chapter is exhilarating, one of the most original, most gorgeous bits of writing i have ever read. ali smith is stylistically clever, yes, but not cute. she uses textual devices to represent different voices: madness, illness, despair, death.

I've never seen her NOT finish a book so I asked her what was up. Her response: \\"This was the hardest book I've ever tried to read.\\" She couldn't really explain it so she handed it over to me to give it a shot.I got two incredibly garbled sentences into the first page and put the book down. I realize this book is probably supposed to be written in some cutting-edge, fast-paced, thinking on the way to the bottom kind of way, but for me (and my wife) it was INCREDIBLY difficult to read. She made it much further than I did (about 2/3 of the way in), but she took nothing from it and said it was an incredible waste of time. Actually, all of the women in her book club (10, I believe) had similar thoughts. Only one finished the book and she said it was horrible and the only reason she finished it was because she kept hoping it would get better and the next thing she knew, it was over.Kind of disappointing, really."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"This book is a true ride that you will in no way soon forget. As the first chapter, even the first page, unfolded I knew this would be something special. First experiencing the ghost world as felt by Sara you will be thrilled to feel the simple things around you, as a living being.Then you will fall into the other worlds of those around her, those there as she died, and others in their lives. Sometimes this is a confusing ride, but it is so well written that you won't mind one bit.Jokes flow in and out of the story, puns and plays on words that will send you smiling in the midst of the tragedy also amaze. I was simply stunned with how effortlessly Ali Smith seemed to do this, even tying things, in her own strange way, together in the end as you seem to witness the circle of life and it's seasons.This is the book to buy if you want a new voice that sees things in a new way and writes them in a way entirely of her own. The lack of quotations always takes a bit of adjusting, but for me the only distraction was Ali's unapologetic and excessive use of the notorious F-word. I found it a bit bothersome and had it appeared a few less times (maybe one hundred or so) I could have probably enjoyed the book a bit more and given it the coveted 5 star rating. Buy this one, you will pass it around for years to come (and definitely read it for inspiration before ever writing anything of your own)"},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"Ali Smith is the most exciting new writer in English, clearly in love with language and literature and life. _Hotel World_ spins and soars, shouts and whispers, sighs and sings...read it."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"Yes, it's another book that made me cranky.

I read about 1/3 of this and then said, enough. No thank you. This one's going to the Sally Ann too. Woo----hoooooooooooo, if I had a dumbwaiter, I'd chuck this book down it."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"Ali Smith's \\"Hotel World\\" is hardly a novel. More like five vignettes held together by the most tenuous of links - a common locale, the Global Hotel, where the stories take place, a perfect excuse for the use of five disembodied voices as narrators. There's the ghost of young national swimmer Sara Wilby, the chambermaid who paid for the fun of a prank with her life, her grieving sister Claire, regular bag lady Else from across the road who gets to be a non-paying guest for the night courtesy of the kindhearted receptionist Lise, and Penny, the glamourous visiting journalist. Smith's writing style is consciously experimental, almost deliberately inventive and varied, so it shouldn't surprise that some of her stories work better than others. Sort of a hit or miss.The opening chapter, Sara's ghostly confessional, is an absolute delight. Full of playful regret and poignance, it expresses articulately poor Sara's shock at being consigned in a few seconds to the other side of existence. So much so that she keeps going over and reminiscing on every little detail of living. Lise's story is also strangely moving because we can all relate to it. Her ambivalent act of kindness is every minion's secret dream. Of cocking a snook at management as a therapeutic release from one's sense of powerlessness. Claire's stream-of-consciousness rambling is rich in content but frustratingly difficult to access. Unless you've had plenty of practice with Virginia Woolf novels. Penny's adventure on the corridors outside her room is surrealistic and reads like a spooky episode from \\"Twin Peaks\\". But it isn't quite up to the mark. Else's story is unexceptional and the closing chapter with references to the spirit of national icons like Princess Diana and the late 60s pop diva Dusty Springfield just seems like a lame attempt by Smith to gain a more general validity for her novel. Stylistically, what gives \\"Hotel World\\" a coherence is Smith's use of repeat themes and objects throughout her stories. Like that of \\"falling\\" (Sara's flight down the chute.....and the strange girl outside Penny's corridor peering into the void behind the wall) and the \\"watches\\" and \\"time\\" motif , etc.Ali Smith's \\"Hotel World\\" is an interesting experiment and typical of the works of young contemporary writers from England. She is a name to watch but it's early days yet. \\"Hotel World\\" is ultimately more hype than substance...and by far the weakest and the most lightweight of the Booker Prize nominees of 2001. Smith has to pay her dues to land the big one !"},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"Hotel World started out strong and then petered out. By the time I had gotten to the long run-on sentence chapter done by Clair I had lost interest in the book."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"Ali Smith's Hotel World was shortlisted for both the Orange and the Booker Prize. Although this book is in many ways about death, it is so vivid and vital that it is not surprising that it has won such critical praise. Some readers have compared Ali Smith's writing with that of Virginia Woolf, but I think that Virginia Woolf would have good reason to be afraid of Ali Smith. Okay, so both have written novels that are full of streams of consciousness, but the spirits in Ali Smith's world are far more witty and recognisable, even if their \\"minibar is fear\\".All five voices in this book belong to women, so Ali Smith may have a weakness when it comes to portraying men. The first voice we hear is the spirit of the recently departed Sara Wilby, a promising young swimmer who could have been a sub for the national team. She has died in a freak accident just days after starting a new job in a hotel. Her spirit interrogates her corpse with clenched teeth to find out how it happened. Clare Wilby, Sara's younger sister, is just as determined to find out what exactly happened, and haunts the streets outside the hotel. Lise, the hotel receptionist, only has vague memories (if any) of Sara before her death, tries to help Clare, unaware that she will be bedridden a few months later, felled by a mysterious disease. Else is dying on the streets, probably wasting away with tuberculosis. Her world seems inhabited by the strange words she picks up from poets in libraries who died long ago. She tries to find the meaning of \\"rebegot\\" from John Donne's A Nocturnal on St. Lucy's Day. In the company of the affluent, but ignorant, journalist Penny, this word transmutes into \\"rebiggot\\". Else's voice shows that she had an education once, but now she even has difficulty reading clocks - time has lost meaning to her. Her TV is watching through the windows as other people watch TV, with TV dinners in their laps. But this is not a dismal world, despite the poems dedicated to dying children - there is every indication that Else could be 'reborn'. This is a world, after all, where the birds sing cheerful TV ads in Lise's dreams.There's a whole range of other, minor characters too, such as the girl in the watch shop, the learner driver and his amorous teacher, Duncan, the guy with whom Sara Wilby had the bet that led to her death. Even Princess Di and Dusty Springfield make fleeting appearances towards the end, and perhaps they and the Millennium could date the novel. But Ali Smith carries off her prose with such poetry and style that I am sure that it will always remain fresh. I don't think of Virginia Woolf when I read this novel - I laughed at the joke about the dog who walked into the Western saloon looking for the guy who shot his paw - James Joyce's The Dead seems a much more apt comparison. Now and again, the Booker prize panel does nominate really good books on its shortlist from powerful new writers. Ali Smith's voice (to borrow a phrase from her companion in Internet search engine results) will rumble in the jungle for a very long time."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"\\"Hotel World\\" can best be described as a book that 'haunts' you, from the first page, from the first paragraph, from the first word (which, amusingly, is 'wooooo-hoooo!'). Once picked up, it won't let you go until every word and idea is consumed, until the plot is exhausted.That, in my opinion, always makes a good read.\\"Hotel World\\" revolves around the tragic and untimely fate of a teenage swimmer, Sara, who plummets to her death in a dumb waiter. The first 'chapter' (if it can be called that; it's more of a vignette) begins with Sara's 'ghost', mislaid from her body, wandering the earth she has left and trying to make sense of it. The 'ghost' visits Sara's body in its coffin and begs it to give her insight into what happened on May 24th, the day she died. Sara's body explains that she had just fallen in love, suprisingly with a female employee of a watch shop, and that her fall in the dumb waiter had been a tragic accident: a 5 bet that went horribly wrong.If any of this sounds silly or hackneyed, it is the fault of my description only because Smith's writing is incredibly imaginative, insightful and unique. The melancholy theme of Sara's death is never over-played, and is conducted in a highly creative and contemporary manner. The strongest vignette in the book is that 'written' by Sara's younger sister, Clare. Although written in a somewhat baffling stream-of-consciousness style without punctuation, Clare's chapter is the most wonderfully evoking and emotional (without being too sentimental) account of grief I have ever read. Picking up tiny diamond-details with a fine-tooth comb, Ali Smith has an impossible eye for the subtle wonders of humanity: Clare, going to put onion peel in the rubbish bin, finds her sisters's swimming trophies in amongst the trash; she picks them out and tells her father that the rose bowl trophy has to be passed on to whoever wins the prize next year. Clare, remembering that dust is partial dead skin particles, keeps 'some of her sister' in a handkerchief in her top drawer, saving her sister from the hoover.The main body of the story is generated when Clare, dressed in Sara's spare uniform, goes to the Global Hotel and searches for the now hidden dumb waiter shaft, obsessed with finding out how many seconds it took the steel box to fall. She then unwittingly involves a cast of strangers who also play their part in the seamless beauty of \\"Hotel World\\": Penny, a bored and disenchanted journalist and Else, a homeless woman who is given a free room by the hotel receptionist, Lise, who is sick and tired and wants to rebel about the corporate chain, Global Hotels. They are all linked in some way, as Smith stitches an engaging and colourful patchwork of death, hope and the endurance of love.I read Smith's novel in around 4 or 5 hours; it was impossible to stop or delay finishing it because the characters, and the world they weaved, just captivated me. \\"Hotel World\\" leaves you feeling full and empty at the same time, enriched, confused, happy, futile, and -- if you're a writer -- jealous and frustrated. Her talents are enviable. The descriptions, visions and observations she uses in her book are profound, but never ficticious or pretentious. I must admit that I cringed slightly at the idea of a well-paid style writer and a homeless woman who collect pennies and wraps newspaper around her boots joining together to help a young girl, and by any other writer the story would seem false and preachy, but in Smith's hands it is true, tentative and remarkable.It is clear why this book was nominated for the Booker Prize and the Orange Fiction Prize, the calibre of writing is fantastic- although I wouldn't actively recommend it to anyone who finds anything other than the classic beginning-middle-end novel structure challenging, as it's fragmented style maybe be a bit too brave for the tastes of some."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"I picked up this book because I was browsing through previous year's Booker winners and it looked like one of the more promising ones. The book has a certain energy that propels you through it and it never gets to be plodding or tedious. The central event of the book is the death of a maid, but I found the most interesting characters of the book to be neither the maid nor her grieving sister, but rather a magazine writer and a homeless woman. The unusual encounter that they have with each other and the completely different (and wrong) impressions that each has of the other are at once sad and laughable. The book is particularly effective in that there are no neatly tied up ends so it almost seems non-fictional. Another strength is the skill with which Smith depicts the street scene outside the hotel, which will ring true to anyone who has visited England. Since this book is short, it's easy to read at one sitting, which is what I'd recommend because of the stream-of-consciousness style."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"So I opened the what do you call it--I forget the word--the thing that people read and started to read and got sucked in fascinated really I can't remember why--maybe the creepiness, I'm not sure--sucked into the story of this disembodied girl and her split-with-anger sister and all that she is forgetting and has forgotten about life and all that these other characters are making her remember. And I guess I was annoyed--it was really just a spark of indignation (I can remember the abstract words just not all the ones that are concrete) by how the thing was written because I really liked the premise and thought this could be a great one of those things that people read. But it got old after a couple of pages, and creepy after a couple more pages when the spirit started referring to herself in the plural and having conversations with her corpse and playing games with her old family whose names she can't remember well and I have to admit a prejudice here--I cringed and almost put the thing down but as I read on it got more and more worth it. Still:If this review's style annoys you, you're not going to make it through the book."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"OK, for me the story itself here was at best, OK - something that one could have dreamed up by sitting in a hotel lobby one winter day and making up stroies for the people you observe passing by. It reminded a bit of Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway in style. What impressed me was Ali Smith's gift for writing. At times the book reads more like a poem than a novel. Her observations of the sights, sounds, smells, and feelings that her characters undergo is breathtakingly realistic. You can literally see/hear/smell/feel it in your mind as you read. Her musings on death and on life as a series of frozen moments is bound to send the reader into long periods of contemplation on finality. Her characters seem like people we know or have seen. She is a truly gifted writer."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"I adored this book. It was engaging, thought provoking and refreshing. The unverbalized in all of us is exposed in these characters struggling to make sense of life and death. A brave assessment of reality which is rarely confronted is lyrically exposed with undeniable revelations of the rarely discussed."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"This is an excellent book, even if you are not in to post-modernist stuff. The reading is sometimes tedious, although well worth the work. Smith is very abstract and brillant at capturing characters."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"This is an extremely innovative work. Ali smith is brave in exploring literary methods which don't feel self-conscious. I think I will definitely read more of her fascinating work"},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"This is the best and most original thing I've read this year. A British Spoon River Anthology. Ali Smith never once places a foot wrong. The language is dense, beautiful, and true and so compeling you'll want to read it all at once. I can't remember the last time I was this excited to discover someone new to read. I can't wait to see what she writes next."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"I enjoyed parts of this book more than others, and that's probably because Ali Smith did such a great job of creating the five different narrator's point of view. Each chapter is told from the perspective of a different character, and each character has a very distinct style. Some of the text is harder to weed through than other parts, but it's still a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"I have not read any of Ali smith's previous writing, nor had I heard of her previous to reading this book. I picked up this book solely because I saw that it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize together with Ian McEwan (one of my favourite authors).The concept of this book is interesting enough. We meet 5 main characters. Sara Wilby, the 19-year-old chambermaid. She was a very talented swimmer, and could easily have been testing for the national team. On one of her first days working at the Gobal Hotel, she bets with Duncan if she can fit into the dumbwaiter. She could, but she also plummeted to her death while doing so. Lise, she is the kind but slightly depressed reseptionist at Golbal's frontdesk. Else, or Elspeth, the homeless girl that Lise let stay one night for free. Else is usually begging outside of the Global Hotel. When she's not, she is wandering the streets, watching TV through the windows of other people's houses. Penny, a newspaper reviewer surveying the hotel, and Clare, Sara Wilby's grieving sister. Clare visits the hotel, determined to find out exactly what happened the day her sister died.Each chapter is written in a different style, some works better than others. The stream-of-consciousness narration reminds me of A. S. Byatt, but Ali Smith is not able to bring it to same level. The chapter where \\"&\\" is used instead of \\"and\\", well, that gimmick gets tiresome after a while. The first chapters were interesting, and my favourite is Else's chapter. But after a while, I got tried with the whole idea, and must admit that I was glad when I was finished reading it.How this novel got shortlisted to the Booker Prize I cannot understand. I give it 3 stars because I really liked Else..."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"The buzz on the book caught my attention. The first chapters were interesting, but the book wore on me and I was glad when it was finished. In one chapter the dead girl's sister uses the &amp; sign every time she means to say and, gimmicky, overused and annoying me thinks... Runner up for a big award?"},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"This is the only book I have ever read that when I finished the last page, I turned back to the beggining a read again. And I enjoyed it even more the second time through.On the other hand, I've recommended it to people whose opinion I trust who couldn't understand it at all.I highly recomend Hotel World and think it was a wonderful read, but if you need to understand where you are and what's going on when you read a story, this may not be for you."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"Set in &quot;an unnamed Northern English city&quot; which is obviously Oxford, Smith writes down the humdrum workaday lives of outside-looking-in characters in this excellent, powerful novel. Although the plot of a young girl grieving for her dead older sister, who died in a freak accident, leaves little room for anything else, such as the inner life of the homeless woman on the steps, Smith iagines them all with great compassion and tenderness, my favorite quality in a writer.Also, this novel has one of the best donw interior onologue sequences I've ever read. It heps that she chose a small English city and not London which is always gettign written about. it adds mystique to this rre find, a novel that is one of the top ten of the decade, no doubt."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"I can't believe I actually finished this dreadful book. Unique definitely does NOT mean good! My lasting impression of this book is: What was the Booker Prize shortlist committee thinking?"},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"I forced myself through half the book and had to give up. What hype this novel got - it was sure not deserved."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"This novel arrived in the US with a crown of laurels: a Booker Prize nomination and at least one other British award. It's an inventive sort of a ghost story (&quot;wooooo-hooooo&quot; is, believe it or not, used often in this novel) with commentary on love, childhood, and memory. Contemporary English life and political musings are everpresent: TV, movie stars, contemporary economics and more. There are no memorable characters, but there is some suspense. Smith uses stream-of-consciousness in places, but it comes off as a kind of authorial laziness - rather than a way to arrive at psychological truth or meaning. But what ultimately hamstrings this novel the most is the sloppy diction, careless word choice, and the dire need for editing - or at least a critical reader, pre-publication.Early on in this novel Smith's narrator muses about the feel of &quot;a mouthful of dust.&quot; The experience is more visual than tactile, though - and unconvincing. She doesn't feel it, and neither will you. Elsewhere, a reflection &quot;looms,&quot; &quot;misshapen and small.&quot; A woman enters a room in which &quot;clear and plastic, was the smell of new computer.&quot; A Booker nomination ought not to beg the reader for a red pencil.It's hard to get excited about a novel that asks one to forget about language's meaning (and potential to thrill) as often as this one does."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"Hotel World is a disappointing little book. For all of its accolades and promise, it falls incredibly short. The story sounded promising, five women, two sisters, one dead. Unusual writing style, somewhat unformatted and different. Different sounded promising rather than annoying. I thought the characters mostly unlikeable and mousy. I found one character's chapter to be completely unreadable due to the complete lack of any punctuation."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"It's hard to say exactly what I think about this book. It was good, but not great; parts were very interesting to read, while some were more difficult. I am not normally drawn to the dreamlike writing style that Ali Smith displays here -- I just don't like to think that much when I read. However, I found that Hotel World was easier to understand than most of these stream-of-consciousness novels.Instead of being a cut-and-dried story, Ali Smith has chosen to break up her novel into five separate vignettes. The main point of the novel, I believe, is Sara Wilby, a chambermaid at Global Hotel, who fell to her death in a dumbwaiter on her second night on the job. Sara's spirit haunts the hotel, her family, and tortures her own corpse in an effort to find out the details of her death.Following this story (which was excellent and the reason why I continued on), readers are introduced four other women: Else, a homeless woman who camps out in front of the hotel; Penny, a journalist on a business trip who finds herself bored and goes in search of something different; Lise, the hotel's receptionist who recalls the events that take place in the hotel after Sara's death; and Clare, Sara's sister, whose meandering thoughts depict her grief over the loss of Sara, and her determination to carry on.I found this novel to be a difficult read because of the writing style. However, I'm not sure if a linear approach would have made this story come out right. The dreamlike quality put on an atmospheric, ghostly spin, and I believe the book is better for it. Hotel World was definitely worth my time, although I questioned myself many times throughout my reading. But now that I am done and have had time to reflect on it, I realize that I did enjoy this book, and for other readers who can persevere, I believe they will find it worth it, too."},{"Title":"Hotel World","review":"I know that i am going against the grain here, but i do NOT think this is a good book. Or even an average book. Hotel World was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2001. I find that very scary. This to me is a pretentious, try-hard attempt at fiction. There are five separate, tenously connected narratives written in various first-person styles. Not a bad premise, but Smith manages to leave it dead in the water. The only really interesting section is from the perspective of a dead character. There are a few interesting snippets, but they are mired in boring dross about characters that i couldn't manage to care about - i kept waiting for a character to grab me - and they didn't. Even the attempt at a resolution didn't bring it together. What a shame."},{"Title":"Peter Redeker","review":"It was nice to get the book at all but it was fragile as the pages come easily out.However, as the book is old - it is to be expected.Thanks,Cc."},{"Title":"Business English and Conversation for the EFL-ESL Classroom","review":"Most business English books are tedious, boring. This book is a very nice exception. Lots of different activities and combinations to learn grammar and writing along practices for conversation. Good aid."},{"Title":"Business English and Conversation for the EFL-ESL Classroom","review":"The title is comletely misleading. This is a book of grammar exercises. Chapters are entitled Nouns&quot;, &quot;Verbs&quot;, &quot;Correct Punctuation&quot;- you get the idea. Even the sentences and examples used in the grammar are unrelated to business. The only bow to business is in the last 20 or so pages which are about letter writing, telegrams (!), memos and other business writing forms. As far as I can see, there is no conversation skill practice at all. I gave it two stars because it you want a succint little grammar practice book, it's ok. But go elsewhere for business and/or conversation."},{"Title":"Business English and Conversation for the EFL-ESL Classroom","review":"I have been using the book as a textbook and found it quite complete in its coverage of the English grammar and business correspondence. It is quite concise, since it avoids overbearing the user with annoying extra examples of items already seen, something I found in a couple of other books. I would suggest that the photographs and illustrations be chosen from a wider selection, since they do seem to be mostly of people from a certain ethnic background, and this book is supposed to be used in different areas of the world. This would enhance its &quot;portability.&quot; The conversation exercises are quite varied as well, but they do make you work a lot since it contains no audio CD or tape. That might be another suggestion for the future. Overall, very usable and helpful."},{"Title":"Business English and Conversation for the EFL-ESL Classroom","review":"It's not usual to find all the grammar needs in such a small book. It gets to the point in a nice no-nonsense kind of way and lets you gather the information you need most. I found it can be used nicely with students of all ethnic backgrounds, a huge plus. Lots of exercises of all levels, another big plus. And the fact that it is available as an ebook as well as in printed form is rather unusual for works of this kind. Thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Business English and Conversation for the EFL-ESL Classroom","review":"The book has a lot of varied exercises for the student of English. It does require much work from the teacher, but that is to be expected. I have never used a book that is in itself a &quot;teacher,&quot; but a tool, and as tools go, this one gets high marks as far as I'm concerned. I would change some of the examples which seem rather grammatical, but that in no way diminishes the quality of the work overall."},{"Title":"Business English and Conversation for the EFL-ESL Classroom","review":"A no-nonsense kind of book with a lot of examples and exercises. Very professional in its presentation and content. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a book that will help you practice the fundamentals of grammar and general usage of the language."},{"Title":"Business English and Conversation for the EFL-ESL Classroom","review":"I found the book not only quite complete but also entertaining. It helps as a supplement and as a workbook too."},{"Title":"Business English and Conversation for the EFL-ESL Classroom","review":"This books title is misleading. It has very little conversation and even less business conversation. It is a good reference book. It could also be a supplement book for a class but when working overseas it could only prove to be useful asa supplement for the teacher."},{"Title":"Business English and Conversation for the EFL-ESL Classroom","review":"This textbook remains a fine grammar book with focused, grammar based exercises. Smaller and cheaper than the Azar books, people looking for drills to improve \\"look-see-do\\" speaking exercises should be satisfied.However, most authentic conversations include open ended questions, a topic, and follow-up questions. The title, therefore, seems quite misleading. Several solid conversation books exist - from Discussion Starters and Talking Your Heads Off for intermediate ESL students to Compelling Conversations and Discussions A-Z for advanced students. Therefore, I strongly recommend a conversation book if you are looking for a conversation book - especially if the goal is to tutor business professionals."},{"Title":"Oracle DBA Exam Cram: Test 3 and Test 4: Exam: TEST 3 & TEST 4","review":"I am an IT consultant and Oracle DBA with 8 years of experience in high-end technology, working for a large international bank in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I have decided to become Oracle certified because it would certainly give me more visibility in my work. Now, I am an Oracle8 OCP DBA with an average score of 97% in the five exams of the Oracle8 DBA track.I must admit it was very difficult at first to find out what the best way would be to prepare for the tests. It took me some time to understand that the exams are entirely based on the original Oracle course books and that the practice tests offered by Self Test Software are a superset of the real exams. Now I have a keen perception of what the whole process is all about. The real trick to get a 90+% score is to attend the Oracle classes and cram with the STS practice tests. However, this is a rather expensive way to study, since each course costs around US$ 1,000 and each practice test costs US$ 99, not to mention the exam price itself (US$ 125).When I fist set off my study, I bought Mr. Jason Couchman's Oracle8 DBA Certification Guide by Oracle Press. Bad choice... It was completely out of synch with the real exam contents and had a lot of typos and gross conceptual errors. I do feel sorry for those people who were caught unawares buying the big red book. I wonder how Oracle signed off on it.I also bought the 'Oracle 7 Exam Cram Tests 1 and 2' by Mr. Michael Ault and 'Oracle 7 Exam Cram Tests 3 and 4' by Mr. Ault and others. They were both better than Mr. Couchman's, but a bit confusing, especially because they mixed two tests in each book. Besides, they did not cover Oracle8.As a last resort, I borrowed the original course materials from an acquaintance, with the exception of the Network Administration book. I read the reviews on Mrs. Pascavage's 'Oracle8: Network Administration', and decided to order it from Amazon.I was surprised. This book is really great ! It was evident that the author was careful to study the original oracle course material and practice test, giving priceless tips and accurately separating the chapters according to those of the course books and the exams sections. Also, the questions in the book are very close to the real ones one would encounter. Congratulations, Mrs. Pascavage !"},{"Title":"Oracle DBA Exam Cram: Test 3 and Test 4: Exam: TEST 3 & TEST 4","review":"Better organized than the first Exam Cram book (Tests 1 &amp; 2).

In a few places it has mistakes and some of them maybe confusing. It's not very important for exams preparation but probably it's annoying enough for some people to put 1 star. Another reason is a book structure. It's not supposed to be a general Oracle tutorial. It's just the exam cram. You can easily pass exam using this book but it's also true that you won't have complete Oracle vision in your head. I guess, some people don't like it too.

The text has helped me master more advanced concepts and tools of both Max the program and animation in general. The section on character work, while a regurgitation of what you'll find in Illusion of Life, Timing for Anim, and Foster's works, is still helpful to the beginner. The first third of the book is also an excellent source of principles that any budding animator who's transitioning to 3D would be wise to read.

Once again, I was able to continue reading without losing respect for the editors ... The next step instructed me to rotate a dummy by its Y-axis in the top viewport, which I did. The comment under this instruction directed me to look at the figure on the next page. The blurb next to the figure stated &quot;Top view of the UFO, with the leg properly positioned.&quot; Naturally, I figured that when I looked at the figure, I would see exactly what I had on the screen, but instead, the image was a screenshot from several steps before the rotation instructions, in the FRONT viewport. There is no mention of this image anywhere in the text, and there is no image demonstrating the proper rotation that the text led me to believe.What should you learn from this little story? Well, I hope the editors are reading this: If you publish something, the consumers would appreciate it if the editors do their job and offer the public a book worth buying. I received Vol. #3 in the mail several hours ago, and I've already downed four aspirin. If the first chapter is any indication of the quality of work put into this book, it's looking to be a LONG weekend.So long, fellow gurus, And remember, Scum lurks in pretty packaging.Boss Hogg"},{"Title":"Inside 3d Studio Max: Animation","review":"This book is Great. It provides an indepth explanation of the concepts and abilities of 3D Studio Max2. It is definately for the more advanced user and is definately a must. The first Vol is like a big encyclopedia that explains the concepts but does not provide real hands on learning methods, This Vol. is by far the best of the 3 and is an important tool in every animators libary."},{"Title":"Inside 3d Studio Max: Animation","review":"After grinding through the horrendously written Volume I of this series, I thought that maybe by Volume III things would have improved. Well, they haven't. Written by different authors, this book obviously draws upon the faults of the first Volume, and thus keeps consistent with the faulty scheme of the series.The examples in this book, while informative, are extremely frustrating, as the authors have obviously not put the time into ensuring that they work. Textures don't ship with the CD, so when you open certain examples you are greeted with &quot;BLAH.TGA&quot; not found error messages. Examples don't work properly, even the ones shipped on the CD, they take extra tweaking to make them do what they were intended to do. For example, in the first chapter there is a certain example in which you are to go to frame 145, but in the .max file on the CD, there are only 130 frames!!!! What?!?!? Do we rescale, or do we assume a typo or just a basic laziness on the part of the authors/publishers.What a shame, as this topic had potential."},{"Title":"Inside 3d Studio Max: Animation","review":"I am writing specifically about volume 3. It would be an excellent book if they had just proofread it first before rushing it for publication. Filled with mistakes and worded very poorly I still recommend this sorry book because it is one of the few 3d max sources that actually attempts to teach animation."},{"Title":"Inside 3d Studio Max: Animation","review":"this book is one of the best books if not the best for indepth training in MAX 2, i own the entire set and rate them all 5 stars because I am now an experienced 3D artist thanks to them."},{"Title":"Inside 3d Studio Max: Animation","review":"Maestri and New Riders come through in this 3rd book of the Inside 3ds Max series. The book offers highly complex real world animation projects as tutorials which not only stress proper techniques but also the most common mistakes in their application. The most in depth book of its type so far on the subject of Animation in Max."},{"Title":"Inside 3d Studio Max: Animation","review":"good progr"},{"Title":"Toxic Plants of North America","review":"Toxic Plants of North America is a grandiose work, fruit of many years of intense labor, as one can confirm just by leafing through its hunderds of pages. More than just an academic resource work, this treatise is one of the very few that can actually be used as a textbook for a course on poisonous plants.Burrows and Tyrl's book is one of the most ambitious projects ever to be undertaken about North American toxic flora since 1964. Indeed a newer source of information was long overdue.The book has also many salient features including its clarity, objectivity and a usually neglected feature in other publications, which is the inclusion of pertinent information about poisonous plants of Mexico.I highly recommend this book as a text for courses dealing with poisonous plants offered by Universities in their colleges of Animal Science, Range Ecology and Veterinary Medicine.Toxic Plants of North America is destined to be a definitive work on the subject."},{"Title":"Toxic Plants of North America","review":"The hefty price tag of this paperback may limit it to college-level collections, but there it's appropriate and important for any collection strong in environmental science, veterinary science, agricultural science or botany. The organ or body system affected by the plant poison serves as a point of reference here, with chapters organized with vets, livestock owners and students in mind. Each coverage begins with the system and moves to an explanation of the toxic plants that can affect it. Color photos of each plant round out the details. An invaluable reference.Diane C.
