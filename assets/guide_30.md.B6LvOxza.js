I was quite disappointed with the \\"wordiness\\" of the text. The author will make a loose and far from concise statement and then follow it up with an example that is completely disconnected from the scattered statement at the beginning. And to make matters worse the author will use another example to describe the first example and the secondary example will be even more disconnected and irrelevant than that of the first. This sequence is very repetitive on almost every page. It may have been one of the most frustrating readings I have ever encountered. I believe if I ran into a man on the street with schizophrenia and decided to jot down some notes on what he had to say about religion it may be a similar read.I do understand that this was originally a radio address and then was converted into a book, but the author should have shaved off some of the original text and changed the format for presenting his information. I am not discouraging anyone not to read this book; it has impacted thousands of people positively. But if you are looking for an on point, concise, descriptive book about Christianity you may want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Assertions followed by analogies and metaphors does not even begin to make something true. Neither does it make for good or entertaining reading. Lewis is an acrobat like any other apologist - he uses flips and contortions in his presentation, but unlike a real acrobat, only the feeble-minded will be impressed. What's that? My analogy is dumb and does little to advance what I'm actually trying to say? Good, then I'm glad you get my point.As a brief example, he tries to equate a sexual appetite with an appetite for food. \\"..when people say, \`Sex is nothing to be ashamed of,' they may mean \`the state into which the sexual instinct has now got is nothing to be ashamed of'. If they mean that, I think they are wrong. I think it is everything to be ashamed of. There is nothing to be ashamed of in enjoying your food: there would be everything to be ashamed of if half the world made food the main interest of their lives and spent their time looking at pictures of food and dribbling and smacking their lips.\\" Comparing the two is only a tactic that does much less to make a credible point than it does to focus our attention elsewhere, to a place where it is much easier to make a statement that will garner universal agreement. After this it is much easier for him to mold the minds of those among us who let ourselves be fooled. He does this on nearly every page with every assertion and it gets extremely old and painfully annoying.At one point early in the book, Lewis says \\"the only packet I am allowed to open is Man,\\" referring to the only nature we can know is our own. Yet he spends the rest of the book asserting with such misplaced certainty the nature of God.The book gets a second star because it's easy to read and he writes with a gifted fluidity. On top of that, much of the time he anticipated my own counter-arguments that I was forming in my head, and even though his responses were frustratingly not actually addressing my questions, I give him a bit of credit for noticing possible flaws in what he was saying."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I loved this book. C.S. Lewis made several good points, but it's far from perfect. The one thing I strongly disagree with is his views on &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;the right thing to do&quot; I guess you could say. He gives an analogy of playing a piano; saying that all the keys are correct at one time or another and to say that one is incorrect is terrible. Great anaology, but the principle is unBiblical. Through this he's given us the message that the truth or what we do is relative and that there are no absolutes. If it all depends on our situation how will we know what the truth of that situation is? Or how will we know what is the correct thing to do? Does it become ok to lie if it will keep someone out of trouble? Of course not. God has given us a set of rules to live by and it is not ok to disobey those rules ever. What we(Christians)are to do is not relative. No matter what the situation it's not ok to murder, worship false gods, and it never becomes not sin. Instead of supporting his views with scripture, he use's analogies instead. I think that they were very good analogies, and I agree with a lot of his views; but the only thing he uses to support them most of the time are analogies. Analogies are great, but analogies can be used to support even the most irrational of ideas. Look at this book critically, it's not perfect no matter how much sense it seems to make. Francis Schaeffer's &quot;The God Who is There&quot; would be a better choice. This book is well worth your time though, so read it and see what you think."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Amended review: I originally rated this at 1 star because of the quality of the materials and binding. My initial reaction when I took it out of the box was \\"Yuck. This feels and looks awful.\\" I have changed the rating on this to 4 stars based on the fact that, although I feel the overall look and feel of this edition is rough (The publisher's attempt to mimic a high-quality hardcover edition? If so, they needn't have bothered.), it has held up well over several months of almost daily reading and studying. The cover is still in good shape and the pages firmly intact, so it has proven to be good-quality binding. I prefer smoother pages, but pages that stay in the book are even more important!

He provides us with a lucid and concise commentary on Christianity that could only be conceived after experiencing the horrors of WWI. Anyone who wishes to understand Christianity, the twentieth century, or Narnia, must read this book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Lewis begins his argument for Christianity by pointing out the grammatical oddity (in English) that we often speak of things that we ought, or ought not, do. He then makes the dramatic leap that the origin of such ideas must come from some SUPERNATURAL realm, and thus opens a doorway for the arbitrary and historically contingent Judeo-Christian ideas about &quot;god.&quot;Now, really. When you buy a new auto, and you read in the owner's manual something like, &quot;You ought to change the oil every 3,000 miles,&quot; are you to conclude that you've just received a &quot;supernatural&quot; revelation?Of course not. Some human invented that ought-statement as a way of expressing the relationship between a means and an end, in this case, maintaining one's auto properly. Moral ought statements are no different, though their origins have been lost in the passage of time. They express relationships relating to the maintenance of a workable society, with the &quot;supernatural&quot; sanctions associated with them acting as a kind of psychological scarecrow to improve compliance.Moreover, since Lewis argues elsewhere (_The Abolition of Man_), following David Hume, that you can't derive ought from is, this effectively destroys the argument that the postulated existence of a god means that we ought to act in certain ways. &quot;We ought&quot; cannot follow in any way from &quot;God is,&quot; so Lewis's case is dead on arrival.Moreover, even if the origin of moral ideas is genuinely mysterious (though I don't see them that way), you can't explain a mystery by invoking an even bigger mystery (&quot;god&quot;).And to top off my critique, I might add that modern cognitive psychotherapy (exemplified by the popular writings of Albert Ellis and David Burns, many of them still in print) has discovered that a lot of unnecessary emotional distress results from irrational adherence to ought, must and have-to ideas. Ellis coined the term &quot;musturbation&quot; to describe the kind of crooked thinking responsible for so much human suffering. We can use ought statements as guidance when they serve human flourishing, but the kind of unthinking ought-idolatry promoted by Lewis and other Christian moral absolutists causes nothing but misery."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"CS Lewis managed in the Chronicles of Narnia to prove his mastery of the clumsy religious allegory. And, with Mere Christianity, he tries to approach the thorny topic of God's existence and the divinity of Jesus using &quot;logic&quot; and &quot;reason.&quot; It's as subtle a piece of elegant design and craftsmanship as any tractor factory in Rostok.Facile arguments are bolted together using bold assumptions and the Krazee-Glue of faith. It's amazing that anyone could send such a clunky contraption to plough furrows in logic and reason and sow the seeds of unconditional belief. I read that book and I think think the only thing he got right was the title, which is bang-on."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis was the chairman of Medieval and Renassiance English literature at Cambridge, making him the foremost authority in his field. Thus, one would anticipate a quality book on any topic he chose to write on, even as an avowed amateur in a particular topic. This simply is not the case in \\"Mere Christianity\\".As an amateur theologian, Lewis attempts to explain simple Christian docrtines to non-believers. Yet, the only readers who gain something from Mere Christianity are avowed Christians.The arguments within the text are not well developed, and in most cases merely stated. His understanding of doctrine runs afoul by the influence of long ago dismissed heresies and the inclusion of Mormon doctrine and Eastern thought.The text is poorly written, using inappropriate allusions, such as a machine for man (one being totally deterministic and inanimate, while the other is fully living and dominated by Schopenhauerian will. Since most Christian readers are not aquantainted with Schopenhauer or been immersed in Mormon or Eastern thought, none of this matters to followers and admirers of the popular Christian icon.Lewis' constant use of the word \\"thing\\" to mean attribute, attitude, manner, or in fact any descriptive noun, is very amateurish, and unfit for an author of such high scholarly esteem.His ridiculously popular statement that Jesus must have been either a con-man, a lunatic, or the Christ may influence and soothe Churchians, but ignores so many other possibilities. Even standard Judaism declares Jesus as someone else, namely, a failed Messiah candidate, not a con-man, nor a lunatic, not the Hebrew Messiah, but Lewis is utterly ignorant of the prevaling view of a major religion.Lewis' constant misuse of the word, Christ, signals his misunderstanding of his topic. The term, Christ, means a god who is incarnated into humanity, suffers and dies for his followers, that they may be reunited with the chief god. In most cultures in the middle east, there was always a Christ figure. In Eqypt there was Osiris, in Persia Mithra, in Greece Dionysius. All of the mystery cults of that period had a Christ figure. Paul claimed that Jesus was the Hebrew Christ, in comparison with the Christs from other cults.Instead of using the word, Jesus, Lewis, almost always uses the more generic word, Christ. Sophisticated laymen of the 21st century will dismiss the author for his sloppiness in this regard.Lewis' dismissive attitude toward Islam and Muslims, using the insulting term Mohammedism, marks Mere Christianity as obsolete, particularly in an age when understanding Islam is an essential for political, social, and economic currency.His obsession against atheism allows the author to make outlandish claims against the personal purity and inner harmony of non-Christians (that is non-Jesusians). The book, therefore, suffers from the ignorant arrogance of his time and place, when England ruled the seven seas and sought as its goal to make the whole world England.Why Mere Christianity remains a Christian (Jesusian) classic is beyond me. I found so many inconsistencies in final viewpoints from chapter to chapter that the most charitable opinion to give of the book is that it has in its time influenced Jesusians in some sort of pretentious defense of their faith, so long as the antagonist was ill-informed.I give the book a charitable 2-stars, on the basis of the book being considered a classic. If the book were a 21st century work by a relatively unknown writer, I would have given a minus rating."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis book Mere Christianity, offered some excellent insights into the Christian life, especially in the second half of the book, which I found more interesting than the first. However, I was surprised that he considered Roman Catholicism a &quot;Denomination&quot; of the Christian faith. I consider it to be another religion which misinterprets a fundamental teaching of true Christianity: Faith in Christ will produce works. Salvation is not earned by being a &quot;good&quot; person and going to mass. Salvation is a gift and a Christian will produce good works BECAUSE of his faith and the Holy Spirit that dwells within. Salvation cannot be earned.That being said, the book did offer some good insights into the christian faith. One thing I thought was interesting is a section in the last chapter where he describes striving to become a more sanctified christian as &quot;Great fun.&quot; I never thought of it this way, but yes, it is great fun. Especially feeling myself growing closer to the Lord the more I pray, meditate, and ask God for wisdom.All in all, I would recommend any christian to read this book.God Bless!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book has its origins in a series of wartime lectures that the author gave over BBC in 1943 which were later collated into three booklets and finally rendered into the present volume. The author, who says he was once an atheist, fancies that he can convert others into Christianity with his pop talk about the \\"Moral Law\\" or \\"The Law of Right and Wrong\\" he pulls out of himself. God embedded a knowledge of it into human nature he says and to him it is as real as the laws of physics except that we can disobey it. The first five chapters are devoted to this Moral Law and then he goes on to some basic Christian ethics. Included are the four cardinal virtues -- Prudence, Temperance, Justice and Fortitude -- as well as the three theological virtues -- Faith, Hope and Charity. His defense of God for allowing much evil in the world is that God gave us free will and we ourselves messed up our lives. That is a real copout for a supposedly all-good, omnipotent being. If the Nazi and Communist mass murders leave him unmoved, what chance is there that he will interfere about the woes of an individual human being? Although not married Lewis lived with an older woman (mother of his fallen comrade) for more than a decade. In discussing Christian marriage, however, he speaks of \\"the monstrosity of intercourse outside the marriage.\\" and goes on to suggest that \\"divorce is something like cutting up a living body.\\" Also, in marriage, \\"Christian wives promise to obey their husband\\" and \\"...the man is said to be the \`head'.\\" For those already converted or on the verge of being converted all that sermonizing does have a morale-boosting quality, for it tells them just what they want to hear. And what does conversion do for you? \\"Those who put themselves in His hands will become perfect, as He is perfect - perfect in love, wisdom, joy, beauty, and immortality.The change will not be completed in this life, for death is an important part of the treatment.\\" In plain language, you have to die first in order to collect your just rewards as a Christian. Or, like it says in \\"The Preacher and the Slave,\\" \\"...you get pie in the sky when you die.\\" However, Francis Collins, the director of the Human Genome Project, read the book when a preacher whose advice he sought handed it to him and became a famous convert. You really have to want to believe badly and close your eyes to all that unreality which is part of the package to accept such delusions but Collins manages to do it. He in particular should know that modern science has found the physical basis for that moral instinct upon which Lewis builds his case. Quite simply, we are a social species and evolution has provided us with social instincts necessary to hold society together. In \\"The Science of Good and Evil\\" Michael Shermer has worked out some consequences of evolutionary ethics. Michael Gazzaniga, speaking of brain scans in \\"The Ethical Brain,\\" points out that whenever a person is willing to act on a moral belief the emotional part of his brain has become active while considering the moral question at hand. In \\"Moral Minds\\" Marc D. Hauser introduces the idea of an evolved moral grammar, analogous to that which we possess for language and of which we are not aware of but which is capable of rapid ethical decision making. Physical damage to some parts of the forebrain, as happened to Phineas Gage in 1848 and to others since, will destroy all moral inhibitions we have. The latter fact is proof that it is a properly functioning brain, not some spiritual essence that is responsible for moral behavior. Further proof comes from the observation that autists lack emotions, including any sort of moral sense as a result of their brain defects. All this of course is knowledge Lewis could not have had but which Collins should have been aware of. Atheism is quickly dismissed by Lewis as being \\"too simple\\" (which says nothing about its validity). And his treatment of evolution is equally cavalier: \\"By one chance in a thousand something hit our sun and made it produce planets; and by another thousandth chance the chemicals necessary for life, and the right temperature, occurred on one of these planets, and so some of the matter on this earth came alive; and then, by a very long series of chances, the living creatures developed into things like us.\\" This materialist view is not for him for he prefers the religious view -- the view that behind the universe is something like a mind which is conscious and has purposes. And one of its purposes is to produce creatures like itself that have minds, which means us. He does not tell us how he came to know all this or why we should take his word for it and simply says that trying to disprove it by \\"science in the ordinary sense\\" (whatever that may mean) is impossible. Further reading reveals that not only is his science out of date but that he also makes a joke of it: \\"Every scientific statement...in the long run really means something like, \\" I pointed the telescope at such and such part of the sky at 2:20 A.M. on January 15th and saw so-and-so,\\" or, \\"I put some of this stuff in a pot and heated it to such-and-such a temperature and it did so-and-so.\\" My mind simply boggles at the legions of faithful who lap up this nonsense and give him five stars. Lifelong indoctrintion easily overcomes the few weeks of studying evolution they get in high school and gives them no chance to consider the alternative. Lewis himself belongs to that ilk of British intellectuals ignorant of science who drove C. P. Snow into distraction over the two cultures he was to write about later."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Assumptions is a more appropriate title. I have never seen such an array of circular reasoning and assuming in my life. Hardly one fact is referred too.My ex-pastor gave me this book to straighten my thinking out. What a confusing bunch of bologna. I was glad I read it, it confirmed my doubts."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I was most interested in Optimus Maximus, though I disagree with two points. Still I said the essay was helpful. I think most people would find it so. But--pullease, sir!-- Christianity is NOT complex. It can be stated in three paragraphs known as The Apostles' Creed. You needn't tell me that many Christians do not know this Creed, and therefore find the many books written ABOUT Christianity complex. Of course. When one is discussing a world view one ought to go back to the earliest statement of it.Regarding the other point, I have found that many Christian women, including my wife, do not at all mind obeying their husbands. It relieves them of a great deal of heavy thinking and gives them more time to do the things they like,--such as spending time with the children, knitting, cooking gourmet meals, and gardening. My wife cordially detests the women of NOW, refers to them as the &quot;hairy-legged ones&quot; and numerous other nasty epithets. Not all of today's women, especially Christian women, feel &quot;liberated&quot; by twentieth-century mores.For me, the value of Lewis's book is its use as a handbook to provide a language by which to speak to Christians of other persuasions. I have given away more copies than I care to count. You will remember his preface in which he says that he has found those at the center of each denomination in tune with each other more that they are with those on the periphery of their own denomination. I find this is true. As a traditional Episcopalian, I have more in common with James Kennedy, a traditionsl Presbyterian, Adrian Rogers, a traditional Southern Baptist, and Alan Keyes, a traditional Catholic, than I have with many of the bishops of my own church, who would not find MERE CHRISTIANITY at all palatable. I think the book was not so much written to convert non-Christians as to inform them about basic doctrine and to re-inform Christians when they have strayed into heresy. Just my opinion."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"A friend lent me this book while I was reading Bible for my class at UC Berkeley. I told him that I did not understand Christianity so he thought this book may help me. However, this book really makes me feel that Christianity is not an intellegent religion. It insults my intellegence by presenting arguments as a matter of fact. Although the book itself is not philisophical, it tries to convince readers that conservative Christian belief is the only possible explanation of the world. To achieve this goal, it showcases other philosophies and beliefs in a simplified and biased way and mocks them as nonsense while his whole viewpoint just sound stupid. The only value I see from this book is that it shows you what conservative Christians are thinking. You can get a sense of where they are coming from. However, if you are interested in Christianity with some depth, you should check out books like St Augustine's Confessions."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Though Lewis is often described as one of Christianity's best thinkers and writers, this book (actually three books combined) does not support any such description. While easy to read, this book contains nothing but overly simple reasoning, faulty logic, double-speak, and unsupported--and unsupportable--conclusions. This is a book to avoid unless you want a lesson in how to write an easy to read, but intellectually dishonest, book on religion."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis wrote some great children's books, but his non-fiction works -- the ones where he takes his mythology seriously -- leave a lot to be desired. Lewis is said to be one of the great thinkers in recent times, but I found his arguments in favor of Christianity less than compelling and rather easy to refute. At the beginning of this book, he makes a case for the existence of God, based on psychology rather than pure reason. We all \\"just know\\" right from wrong, he argues. We all feel that tug of conscience, he says. Well, no, we do not all feel that. There are plenty of sociopaths out there who have no empathy or sense of guilt whatsoever. They may be aware of society's rules, because they are often chillingly bright people, but that is not the same as saying that they \\"hear God's voice.\\" For full and open disclosure, I am an atheist. I bought this book because someone said that he found the arguments irrefutable. He must really want to believe... Christians who are already in a state of denial about their beliefs may enjoy this book.UPDATE:It has been a while since I reviewed this book. I am a bit surprised at how personally Christians take any criticism of it. Even when my review was several pages down, many months old and very hard to find, people were still commenting on it.I did not mean to offend people, if I have. I almost get the feeling that people feel as if I told them their children were terrible in the school play. (Which of, course, I would never do!) :) I want to be clear that my review was not a personal attack on Christians or C.S. Lewis. If I were rating Mr. Lewis, even I would give him five stars. He seemed to me to have been a kind, thoughtful gentleman who would have made a great neighbor. I also was not criticizing his writing. Lewis was an excellent writer. I read the entire Narnia series when I was younger and I enjoyed them very much. I am just not a fan of Christian apologetics. I think it is only fair to be up front about that.Amazon's ratings system has a clear response bias. Most of the hundreds of reviews of this book are by Christians who found what they wanted to hear and responded glowingly. A few reviews are from atheists who did not find the book as interesting or meaningful. In other words, that vast majority of reviews are either five stars or one star. My one star review doesn't mean that it is a worthless book. As I said before, Christians will probably like it. I was reviewing what it did FOR ME. (By the way, I tempered my original title of this review from \\"I'm not impressed\\" to \\"Disappointed,\\" which is probably more accurate. \\"Mere Christianity\\" is well-written for what it is. In that sense, it is impressive. But, as I said, Lewis' writing skills were never in doubt.I am amused that so many people take the time to say that they did not (or, in a few cases, did) find my review helpful while positive reviews around mine go without much comment or feedback of any kind. Perhaps they protest a bit too much.There are clearly many thoughtful Christians out there. I did not intend to imply that because they are, in my opinion, in denial about their beliefs, that they are stupid. They are not stupid. I do think, however, that many religious people are attracted to their beliefs as much, or more, for emotional reasons than for intellectual ones. This book fills those emotional needs. If you do buy it, I hope you enjoy it."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Bowen Simmons has deposited here possibly the best review of Mere Christianity I've read. But as my task is to review the book, not one of it's many reviewers, I'll state only that Mere Christianity works for those capable of appreciating simplicity. Those sternly demanding difficult philosophical pretzels may huffily dismiss Lewis as a simpleton. If they also require a \\"contemporary\\" defense of ancient tenets they might easily assign the appellation to themselves.Faith, regardless of chronology, is faith. Natural theology, in which reason alone is employed to understand God, was vigorously challenged as late (or as early) as the 13th century (see William of Ockham). I think C.S. Lewis well aware of this. But, he is evidently also aware that the promotion of faith to the ambivalent is only a partial strategy. Thus, Lewis provides a sublime distillation open to anyone willing to open the tiniest aperture unto themselves.Though he ostensibly has, his goal is not to convert atheists (for they have a faith of their own). He merely presents Christianity for those who wish a clear, concise understanding. Yet, as in everything, we find only what we wish to find. Some will find here 5 stars."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"\\"Christ never meant that we were to remain children in *intelligence*: on the contrary. He told us to be not only 'as harmless as doves', but also 'as wise as serpents'...He wants everyone to use what sense they have.\\" This is the description of a rational person's Christianity--this is why I respect C.S. Lewis so highly. Even if he and I may not have *total* agreement (even the agreement we do have is to a shocking degree!), it is clear this is someone who has applied his intellect to the matter of Christianity, carefully constructing his arguments step by step, defining all meanings and explaining their significance. He constantly warns against arrogance (as he also does in The Screwtape Letters) even as he proposes his theories--a caveat that I strongly believe must be taken with the utmost seriousness.I should warn the potential reader that I may make certain statements that will invite vehement disagreement, particularly in the most conservative quarters. However, I believe they are indicative of the nature of this book--if indeed one takes *extreme* offense to what I write, Mere Christianity is probably *not* the ideal book for that person. Lewis, from my readings, is no fundamentalist; otherwise, I could not imagine him daring to set the following into writing: \\"Is it not frightfully unfair that this new life [given through Christ] should be confined to people who have heard of Christ and been able to believe in Him? But the truth is God has not told us what His arrangements about the other people are. We do know that no man can be saved except through Christ; we do not know that only those who know him can be saved through Him.\\" To my mind, and perhaps to others of what I call a moderate persuasion, this statement de-fangs one of the most serious potential arguments against Christianity. For to have a world in which certain people were condemned simply by happenstance of where they were born or when in time would require a capricious God--and such is *not* the God one encounters in the Bible. I respect the opinions of others, of course. However, I do warn very seriously that if statements of this nature are going to give you problems, you ought to look elsewhere in Christian writings.This is heavy reading--at least, in the sense of the care taken by Lewis in the construction of his arguments. While not a work of philosophy or theology, it does demand the reader's close attention. It is not at all devoid of wit--but do not expect there to be anything sensationalized about it in the way that most \\"popular\\" Christian literature on the market today is. To be blunt--expect more. And Lewis will deliver. This is nothing like the sort of thing one finds in the Left Behind series or other works of LaHaye (for which I have a very serious dislike on grounds that I personally believe it has the potential to foster damagingly exclusionary attitudes in its audience...but that is another day's rant, and I'll leave it for now). In fact, I would go so far as to suggest that the taste for Lewis' work and the taste for LaHaye's, or works of that nature, would be almost mutually exclusive. This is why I must again warn the reader to make an educated decision as to which type of literature he or she will benefit most from.To those, especially, on the more liberal end of the spectrum, I should let you know to be prepared for a few antiquated ideas such as certain statements of his about marriage and sexuality--however, Lewis himself in the same chapters does make certain allowances for the change of social mores. Bear this also in mind when he uses terminology for groups of people that, while acceptable in the 1940s, are no longer acceptable. In my opinion this is not sufficient grounds upon which to discount the entire book.The other reviews may have helped to give you an idea of the book's contents and style--it is my hope that this one will help you to decide if it is *appropriate* for you or not. This is why I call Mere Christianity *incendiary*. I am deadly serious in the use of this word. It will without doubt provoke either extremely passionate agreement or a vehement condemnation. As other reviewers have noted, there is almost no middle ground. With content like this, it is no wonder. And it is a reflection of a very major divide in the Christian community as a whole. I award the five stars because from my experience, if it IS appropriate for you, it will very likely be a most rewarding reading experience. If you know it will not be appropriate for you, however, I will honestly advise you to pass this over in favor of something else."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"As another reviewer pointed out, Christians seem to rate this book highly while atheists and agnostics tend to give it low ratings. Assuming that orpington is not an atheist or agnostic (from his objections that Lewis does not tow the Scripture line as he would demand of such a work), I guess fundamentalists (at least this one in particular) are not impressed with this work from Lewis either. THE BIBLE may say that once a person is saved they are never lost, but Lewis points out that giving our lives to God is a decision, and who among us hasn't seen someone make that decision and then change it?As for the idea that people could come to Christ from other traditions, I can attest to this myself. I was raised in the Methodist denomination and then pursued the Bahai faith and Buddhism seeking to determine if I really believed in Christianity or followed it merely from conditioning in childhood. Lewis has helped bring me back into the Christian fold, with a much clearer idea of what I believe and why.

It is an excellent series of subjects starting with the \\"Meaning of the Universe,\\" where Lewis takes a systematic approach involving right and wrong as a key to understanding the Universe. As the book continues it follows a path in which Lewis gives insight towards more technical and precise variables of Christianity such as faith and forgiveness. He concludes the book with a large section on the \\"Doctrines of the Trinity,\\" plastered with metaphors and deep explanations concerning the world around us, rather than each of us as an individual personality. However, this book is a conquest for the truth, it does not have the final answer. If one finds a final answer for their spiritual beliefs in this book, they are contradicting what they have read. A final answer can only be found within one's self.Concerning the logical soundness of this book, C. S. Lewis demonstrates an almost uncanny ability to prove religious arguments with reason on a consistent basis. And to make it even better, he builds upon each subject that he proves. This is best noted in his explanations of the universe, where he concludes that there is a one God that created everything. However, there are obvious fallacies concerning the validity of Lewis's arguments. Although a great scholar and philosopher, he was once an atheist, which gives us the hint that he might not be such a great authority. And if he is a die-hard Christian, we must not overlook the fact that he is biased. There are very few instances where counter views, and arguments are presented. However, this book was written from a series of lectures during World War 2 where Lewis was given the task to explain the truth in Christianity, not prove it. Also, a large majority of the book relates to religious presumptions, which don't go with the flow of structural logic, but when dealing with religion improvable presumptions are inevitable. However, these are all minor technicalities that have little affect on the real meaning of the book. For Christians and non-Christians alike, truth prevails over faith. We must make sure we understand our beliefs before we completely conform to them. Faith and no margin for evidence results in blind ignorance.As a service to society, Lewis created a structural manual describing Christian values, and their affect on humanity. For the person looking for answers concerning their spirituality, this book is a gateway to finding them. It presents the reader with an opportunity to comprehend why Gods word is true. It also encourages questioning, and not only enlightens, but inspires reason. Summarizing the review is a quote that demonstrates the attitude of C.S. Lewis, \\"In religion, as in war and everything else, comfort is the one thing you cannot get by looking for it. If you look for truth, you may find comfort in the end: if you look for comfort you will not get either comfort or truth - only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin with and, in the end, despair.\\""},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"...I think C.S. Lewis is brilliant. His defence of theism in general and Christianity in particular is impassioned, thorough, and philosophically sound. It takes some concentration, and it may just change your life. If you're already a Christian, your faith will be strengthened, uplifted, and challenged. If you're looking to become one, this book is a great place to start understanding how to live it, and if you aren't one and have no intention of being one, you can still find tons of wisdom and great philosophy in this book. I was, and I am, challenged by Lewis' words and the knowledge and feeling behind them. I do not agree with him on several major points, and my greatest criticism is that he is far too narrow minded at times. Objections aside, however, his work is astounding and deserves wide readership."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Whenever I get into intellectual arguments with nonbelievers, I refer to this book the most, and then I give them a copy. I always have a few laying around so that I can give it to a nonbeliever or a new chrisitan. It is a short read that can equip a Christian to enter an intellectual conversation with some credibility. C.S. Lewis has a gift of making complex theological/philosophical ideas coherent to the average man.If you haven't read it, go get it now."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is a must read for anyone honest enough to confront his deeply held beliefs: both Christian and non-Christian...."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Probally the first book one should read if they are either Christian, Considering converting from or converting to any christian denomination. (Short of the Bible of course) This is a book written by a classic philosopher who was a late convert to Christianity on a RATIONAL basis.In the modern world it the idea that one could find a rational basis for Christian belief is considered a joke. Clearly Lewis found it the opposite. His arguements are fresh and lucid and the fact that he is well read in the ancients and the classics is evident here as he makes his case.The single best thing he does here is make plain that Christianity is not the key to a pain free life or a panacea. It is more of an acknowlidgement of a state of facts, A willingness to accept these facts knowing the consequences and rewards thereof. His path was reason and arguement. It may be yours as well."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"A good friend of J.R.R. Tolkien, Clive Staples Lewis was an atheist as he entered adulthood, but had a genuine awakening of spirit (one of the most thorough conversions known). An \\"apostle to the skeptics\\", he was a deep thinker and prolific writer, yet always accessible to the genuine inquirer. As an British citizen during World War 2, he grappled daily with the existence of evil - whether characterizing an individual, or an entire nation. He was finally joined in his death by Aldous Huxley and John F. Kennedy (all three died on Nov. 22, 1963).Lewis wanted us to think about \\"mere\\" Christianity - the truth-claims and implications of Jesus' life, without all the various trappings that had become encrusted around that, over the centuries.He analyzed the absolutely unique claims of Jesus of Nazareth, statements that would be sheer lunacy or megalomania were anyone else to speak them (e.g., the ability to forgive sins, to receive worship etc.), yet we find them very compatible with His humility.I would commend anybody with an open mind to consider the most unique Person in history, as presented by one of the most unique writers, philosophers and thinkers of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have read many books on Christian Apologetics. Mere Christianity is the clearest, most concise, rational, reasonable, logical, compelling, matter-of-fact and down-to-earth presentation and defense of the Christian faith that I have ever come across. Two things put the book on a higher level than most other books on the subject: first, C.S. Lewis was one of the intellectual giants of the twentieth century (I recommend ANY of his many books on Christianity and of course The Chronicles of Narnia and The Space Trilogy); second, he was an atheist until the age of 32, so he knew firsthand the beliefs, objections, arguments and rationalizations of the atheistic position. Any skeptics reading this who are truly and honestly searching for truth should read this book and Handbook Of Christian Apologetics by Peter Kreeft and Ronald Tacelli."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity is the best explanation of the main points of Christianity that I have ever read. It cleared up some misconceptions I had about the three person God, becoming one with God, and what being a Christian was all about. I like its straight forward manner and accessible language, just deep enough to get to the meat of the idea, but not over the head of the average reader."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"As a freshman in college, the concept of religion can be a very distant one. A man who is a leader of a spiritual organization on campus highly recommended CS Lewis, beyond the Chronicles of Narnia, and finally I decided I would see what the interest was about. I cannot believe I waited so long to experience such a fantastic author and truly wonderful books. If you are a life-long Christian, someone open to the concept of religion and looking to explore, or just someone who wants several great stories to read, this collection is unbeatable. Over 750 pages and seven stories that will challenge the reader, both spiritually and intellectually. I highly, highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is truly a life changing book. What an incredible mind C S Lewis had. It has been an honor to have the opportunity to read this collection. I won't stop until I have read everything I can find about, or by C S Lewis."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C. S. Lewis held such a brilliant God-given imagination, that ALL his works tickle the mind in places that one didn't even know existed! His writings will have you laughing until you hurt one minute, and the next minute so full of spiritual sobriety that the on-going, unseen (yet very \\"felt\\") battle raging around us becomes crystal clear.It is far and few between when a book will call me back to it when I walk away. It is not often that I find such joy and delight when I can finally pick it up again--almost feeling a guilty pleasure when there are so many chores to do and work to be done!What a brilliant mind this author had. What a blessing he was to our planet! My children love his works.Carrie Lynn JonesAuthor of:It All Began... When Jesus Gave Me Sneakers"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book has been on my favorite list for over 30 years. Lewis had a way of speaking to the average person, in a convincing manner. A sign of the different (not better) world we live in, the book was originally broadcast on the BBC(read by the author) during WWII to encourage the citizens of Britain as they were being attacked by Germany and so many of their young men were dying. Would that happen today? I think not, and that diminishes us."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is a great bargain for anyone new to C.S.Lewis. I wanted just one or two books, but when i noticed this one, with SEVEN books inside, i decided to give it a try. Good Move! I have enjoyed the entire collection, and at a price of barely two single books!!!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"If you're wandering, shopping curious or any other connection to religion, this book is A MUST. It is easy reading, large print, covers every aspect you would never even think to include and more. I highly recommend it to you and any you know who are searching or just need a small push in the right direction. Thumbs Up!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"bought this book initially being drawn to the author and references that were made to his work in other books that i have read, and i was not disappointed. The first book in the compilation, Mere Christianity, dealt with the topic from a perspective that i never considered before- at the end of which i think non can refute the ideas postulated by the author. And that is one thing that must be said of CS Lewis- the ideas that he puts forward are profoundly original, and he does so in a very very logical manner, with one thought connecting with the other effectually making the 'whole' very clear.Truth be told however, this is not a novel, or some book you can pick up and read in one night because you are intrigued by some catchy story line. If you dont have a taste for these sort of things, and an appreciation for what i view as a superior writing style, you may be daunted when you get to books like miracles. Nevertheless, i would give this book my personal recommendation, it is fresh (original), well written, logical etc. and well worth your money"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"It has been said that one should not speak of Christianity (without being a Christian and not understanding it) if they have not read Mere Christianity -- I agree.Mere Christianity, Miracles, and The Abolition Of Man are great not only as guides for Christians, but great because they address other religions. Comparative religion of a sort, but not without perspective, which is what is missing from so many books.These seven works are all great, there's no reason to buy them separately to avoid any poor books. Even if you do not end up agreeing with him, reading C.S. Lewis' books will assure you that whatever side you take, one should be taken seriously."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book was the &quot;straw that broke the camel's back&quot; and helped me become a Christian. I've read or listened to it many times, and it has brought me much closer to God. Lewis is an incredible genius with the ability to use terms that average people can understand. In my opinion, this is his masterwork. The main thing that I could say about this book is that as I read it I would think &quot;you know, I never thought of that in that way.&quot; and it made me wonder what other things I've not thought of (i.e. have been wrong about or just not known about)."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This brilliant work by C.S. Lewis is aptly titled 'Mere Christianity.' It may be seen as an attempt to prove that Christianity is true, though I think there is another, deeper level as well. Lewis sought, very successfully I believe, to take away the sectarianism, the various religious dogma and ceremonies, to strip all Christian denominations of their pecularities, and to examine what was left; what can only be called \\"Mere\\" Christianity.Lewis made no attempt to win converts for his own church, nor tried to disprove the theories of any others. He wisely left extremely controversial issues (such as the Virgin Mary) untouched, and focused on the very essence of Christianity. Rather than examining the propriety of all the various doctrines on the subject, he looked at it as a way of life, as a way of being.Throughout the book there is a message which is dominantly conveyed--that Christ is the means of our salvation, and that there is no other way. You do not need to submit to the bickerings of various denominations as to HOW true discipleship can be acheived, you need only understand that it MUST be acheived, and act accordingly.Obviously, this book is partial to the Christian mindset, but it's value is incalculable to anyone--Christian or not. The root of the message Lewis so elegantly conveys is that man has the potential to progress to an infinite degree--it just so happens that he believes Jesus Christ to be the medium through which that progress is made possible.This is not an 'objective' work in the strict sense of the word, for Lewis relies on the faith of the reader, and faith is something which cannot be seen nor proven. Despite and perhaps because of this fact, Lewis presents here one of the best views of Christianity of our time."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book allowed me to forget all I knew about God and investigate from a totally new perspective. I could never just rattle off chapters, this is a book to be read SLOWLY, absorbed and digested. My brain got a great workout."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Having owned a Christian bookstore for 10 years and selling countless copies of Mere Christianity I decided to finally read it. I was quite surprised at how relevant Lewis' writing, examples and explanations are today, 60 years after they were first created. I just love his illustrations, they are so common and relatable. The simplicity with which Lewis' defines theological principles makes your eyes roll at their poetic relativeness. I would heartily recommend this book for believer and seeker alike. You will greatly benefit from the time spent."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I first read this book while stuck in bed following a surgery I had in the summer of 1996. I found the book to be enjoyable (if somewhat heavy) reading as I first went through it. At first, there was nothing I hadn't expected; just a thoroughly well thought out, eminently logical, predominantly intellectual case built in defense of the Christian faith -- in short, typical Lewis.Then came the chapter entitled &quot;The New Men.&quot;In it, Lewis makes a masterful comparison between the New Birth and the Theory of Evolution, eventually reaching a discussion of Man's ultimate destiny, again presented eminently logically -- but with a conclusion which will shake the complacent, unthinking, indoctrinated churchgoer to his or her heels!!!What is that conclusion, you ask? I'm not giving it away. You'll have to buy the book and see for yourself. Believe me, if taken to heart, it is life changing!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I would recommend Mere Christianity by C. S. Lewis to anyone, regardless of their beliefs. I believe every reader will find some part of the book that will prove to be useful. For those readers thinking or wandering about Christianity, Lewis provides them with the motivation and tools needed to get them headed in the right direction. Atheists reading the book may find Lewis's ideas and experiences interesting since he too was once an aheist, and he knows the doubts, questions and oppositions they may have. For Christians, Lewis prepares those who are faced with the need to explain and defend their beliefs while witnessing to others, which in turn builds their confidence to do so. Lewis's views are non-denominational and he does not attempt to define those boundaries, nor does he try to solicit their beliefs.In many ways, Lewis aids his readers through the reading process. The book is divided into four smaller books containing short chapters. Once a section is read, the reader is then allowed time to reflect and absorb the information provided before moving on. At the end of each chapter, Lewis attempts to summarize his purpose for that chapter and its intended message. Each new chapter brings up questions that may arise from reading the previous one, and provides more of an explanation to address those issues.Lewis is very careful not to prematurely turn a reader away or scare them off by forcing Christianity upon them. Lewis heightens the reader's awareness, and then slowly works in logical reasoning, so as not to overwhelm them. Instead of padding the book with teachings that will further confuse the reader, Lewis uses examples the reader can relate to, and then connects those examples to the point he is trying to make. Clearly, not every reader will find every chapter or section in the book helpful. Lewis advises the reader to take what they can from each chapter, and then move on to the next. He never claims to be an expert, but instead states his only authority is that of experience, as a layman, a Christian, and a former atheist. He even asks in his book for &quot;instructed Christians&quot; to advise him when he goes wrong.The opinions stated in Mere Christianity were originally voiced to people at war during World War II. Considering what is going on in our world today, this book might come at an appropriate time to offer hope, for those fighting for our country, and for those of us at home. It was meant to give comfort then, and it will give comfort to those who need it now. Lewis explains that God created a perfect world, not the bad things in it, and God's will is for those things that have gone wrong to be made right again.What I appreciate most is the wide range of an audience Lewis seeks to reach. For those who feel they don't understand Christianity, Lewis advises that they cannot begin to know how it works until they accept it. For those who have the fear of failing in their search, Lewis points out that failures are expected, and what matters most is the honest intent and the will to overcome.Lewis helps the reader to depend on God and strengthens their desires to turn things over to him. He offers some insight of Theology, aiding those searching to understand their faith, which in turn will allow their faith to grow. Lewis discusses hope and heightens Christian believers' desire for heaven. Readers will come away thankful for the earthly pleasures, but also knowingthe best is yet to come."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I quote Kierkegaard above because it fits more than the Nietzsche quote from the previous post (they are both Existentialists). To not like this book based on the presentation of Christianity is to not get the book. A staunch agnostic, I read this in college and was floored by the imagery Lewis brings to faith. This book may not convert you, but it offers a view of the power of faith that few writers can create. Religion, in and of itself, is a concept absent of scientific validity because, at its core, is faith. If you are looking for a historical critique or a philosophical deconstruction of Christianity then don't bother becuase, and I will state again, you won't get it. The fact that some will claim the failings of this book are its &quot;flowery postulates without a hint of evidence&quot; show themselves to be living examples of certain characters in the world Lewis creates. It is his attempt to explain that which can not be contained by language that makes this book great. He does not write to prove, he writes to elucidate. It is as if you are reading a landscape painting.As for the advice to the Atheists, yes, read this book. You might possibly grasp the concept of faith and realize that your &quot;disbelief&quot; is itself a faith, much like Lewis describes, and that your Atheism is a disbelief against the God that is defined and not the God that is."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Since my original review is 7 years old, I thought I would re-review it!I have to rate this a 5 star for what it is. It is a well written, pretty concise compilation of topics that CS Lewis finds most important and interesting in the basics of Christianity. He does it trying his best to keep denominational tint out. It was a longer read for me than I expected, not yet being well experienced in reading CS Lewis, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. If someone doesn't like reading something other than modern American English, there are some speed bumps along the way.As you've probably read, the book is a compilation of four previous \\"talks\\" that were read on the radio in the 1940s. Basically, the different sections discuss right and wrong, what Christians believe, Christian behavior (living), and the Triune God (but not wholly the doctrine of the Trinity...).Maybe it was because I was still warming up on the language I'm not used to, but I really enjoyed the latter two sections the most. I felt they were more interesting than the first two, and more useful.Inside the third book he discusses general morality, Christian marriage, sexual morality, forgiveness, etc. The topics I named I thought were the most interesting of section. The fourth book is about creation, a Triune God, God and time, human condition (sin), Christian life, etc. Really, this was my favorite book.His perspective isn't dissimilar to mine or the rest of mainstream Christianity, he just says it all in a way that makes sense and doesn't sound like every 45-minute Sunday morning Bible study material that's trying too hard to be palatable & applicable."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Insiteful look at the meaning of Christianity. A book that needs to be read more tha once to get all that C S Lewis is telling us."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The book does a great job on some points, and skips over some important details. Lewis' argument from \\"there is a god\\" to \\"Jesus is God\\" is not very fleshed out. I do think that since Jesus is a man that changed history, and is followed by many, it would be wise to consider what you think of him, and the logical consequences of that conclusion. The most common \\"he is a good man, and that is all\\" ideology seems to be well argued as the least logical.But coming from the perspective of someone who already has deduced that it is most likely that there must be some Cause to all of this effect we see, as well as someone who is leaning towards the Christian God, I found the book to be very refreshing and well worth the read.Lewis has thought this out much more clearly than most of us, so his thoughts at least provoke us to think more deeply than we have before, which is generally a good thing."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"As someone newly interested in rediscovering the meaning behind Christianity, this book had a profound influence on me. Lewis gets to the bottom of things, and tells them for what they are. He does not paint Christianity in an easy light, nor should it be painted in such a way. Instead, he breaks it down using analogies and metaphors that make it easy for the non-Christian to understand, and difficult for the non-Christian to refute. As a Christian, it re-enforced my beliefs and renewed my understanding of what it means to be a Christian and life the Christian way of life as intended."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is a great book, its about twice the size I expected after looking at the paperback one. The Hard cover is almost twice the size of the paper back. I do like the layout and the type is a easy size to read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"It is rare to find a Religious writer who also uses their head in a self responsible way and to this extent.An enlightening & eye opening text: not just another book for the sake of having one's book out there."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is perfect for an C.S. Lewis fan. Great having the best of C.S. in one book, but I will say it is rather large so not so portable."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I finally read this all the way through and I'm so glad I did! Lewis explains this so very clearly, his passion is evident, and he makes you think. He uses a lot of helpful analogies and understands their limitations, thus not getting carried away with them. Some of the more memorable ones for me were comparing Christian morality to upkeep of a fleet of ships (making sure that they are all able to stay afloat, that they don't crash into one another, and that they are headed for the right destination) and comparing theology to a map of the Atlantic (demonstrating that while it is \\"less real\\" than actual experiences with God or \\"less real\\" than the Atlantic itself, it's based on thousands of people's actual experiences and serves as a guide). If nautical metaphors don't interest you, then worry not; he uses lots of others.Mere Christianity is divided into four books: Right and Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of the Universe; What Christians Believe; Christian Behavior; and Beyond Personality: or First Steps in the Doctrine of the Trinity. It was adapted from a series of BBC radio broadcasts he gave during World War Two and we see evidence of this throughout the book, as he contrasts Christian morality with \\"Nazi morality\\" and reminisces about his experiences in the First World War as a backdrop for a brief discussion on the ethics of warfare.In Right and Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of the Universe he speaks of the \\"Natural Law\\" (that is, the \\"Law of Human Nature\\".) To sum up (although some of the nuances will be lost in this quick summary), he says that all of us have a conscience and that it acts differently from our impulses and even safeguards against our own \\"herd instinct.\\" He says that this Natural Law is therefore from outside ourselves and is in fact from God. At this point, however, he warns that we are still far from establishing the idea of the Christian God.What Christians Believe provides us with Lewis's famous Trilemma, some observations and explanations about the Incarnation and the Atonement, and some contrasts between the Christian view and other ideas about God and the origins of the universe and ethics.Christian Behavior expounds upon... well, Christian behavior. I won't spend much time on this one, not because it's not an important part of the book, but because you just have to read it for yourself.Beyond Personality discusses the Father's eternal begetting of the Son, contrasts that idea with the fact that the Father created (as opposed to begetting) us, and speaks of a Christian's rebirth and sanctification.All in all a very worthwhile book. Should be good for Christian and non-Christian alike. Hopefully reading this will lead one to repentance and faith and reading other worthwhile works. Foremost among the \\"worthwhile\\" works is of course the Bible. If you find yourself puzzled about the Atonement after reading Lewis's brief treatment of it, I would highly recommend John Piper'sFifty Reasons Why Jesus Came to Dieas a companion book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The \\"non-theological\\" Lewis tackles the theological challenge of apologetics admirably in this wonderful book. He wrestles through numbers of challenges to the Christian faith and lays out some of the core principles of Christianity. Although some readers wish that Lewis would go farther and deal with deeper doctrine, and religious distinctive, I would contend that Lewis has achieved his goal. Lewis set out to deal with the heart of Christianity. He deals not with the debated aspects (with only a couple of exceptions), but focuses on what should, in all reality, be the focus of every Christian. This work was most valuable for me as an opportunity to return to the roots of my Christianity, to remember why I believe what I believe, and to become motivated to live in light of that belief."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis is a great author. This compilation of seven of his books is great for anyone to have on their bookshelf. On digging a little deeper into his writings you find some great philosophy that doesn't try and word you out like some newer philosophical writers. Highly recommended for Antibes bookshelf!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"It might be helpful for some skeptics of orthodox Christian teachings. I like it because it doesn't come on strong like some Christian apologists books. Tom Dougherty"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C. S. Lewis is one of the greatest theologians of our day. In this book he does an amazing job of breaking down and explaining some of the main ideas that surround the Christian faith. Some people prefer to view this book as an apologetic masterpiece. I however, saw it as an explanation for many of the aspects of Christianity that just don't make sense.There are so many aspects of the Christian faith that I don't really understand and that I often have to take on faith. Understanding issues like the Trinity, the problem of sin, why we need God, are all things that I think about. C. S. Lewis takes a crack at helping explain some of the intricacies of the Christian faith.Overall I think it is a great read. It is definitely something that you want to take your time with and really let some of Lewis's ideas sink in. I think it would be ideal for a book study or small reading group."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Who is God? How do I come to know Him? Are we God's descendants?These questions are but a few of the questions that C.S. Lewis addresses in &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;. This book contains short chapters that can be read in under 10 minutes. However, Lewis has managed to zero in on the question and explore it in such detail that no one can walk away without fully understanding the issues and his position on them.Lewis relies not on quoting scripture to illustrate the core principles of his beliefs, but rather on logic and the observation of humanity.&quot;Mere Christianity&quot; is highly recommended for both the Christian searching to answer questions about his faith and the non-Christian who is wondering what all the fuss is about."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I just received the set. I pulled out one book out of the box. It was a piece of junk.Harper One should buy a nice paper cutter. The edge of the books are not cut properly.I'm returning it and never buy Harper One publication."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This continues to be among my top 10 favorite Christian books. C.S. Lewis explains things very clearly, and always has examples to make what he says more understandable. I especially enjoyed his explaination of how our culture is obsessed with sex, and how he said that if another country did a striptease with a plate of food, covering and uncovering it for a bunch of salivating people who paid to watch this, we would be dumbfounded and astonished and think there was definitely some unhealthy obsession with food in that culture. But in Western countries (especially America), where women do the same thing with their bodies, we don't feel that is at all odd.An important thing I would say about this book though--if you are going to use it as a tool in evangelism--I think that's great. But I would not tell non-Christians who are very logical and analytical to read this book, because I think it could do more harm than good. This is because often when Lewis makes a point in this book, even if it is correct, he doesn't back it up with reason, but rather with analogies and hypothetical situations. So if you are looking for a good book to offer to the skeptical, rational philosopher types, this probably isn't the best one. (I'd recommend Descartes' Mediations, Leibniz's Theodicy, or Josh McDowell's Evidence that Demands a Verdict for people in that group.)"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"What if in the end, the non believer is wrong? That there is a God, he came to earth as a man to offer salvation to his creation that had gone corrupt.Great book for someone who is caught up in the he said, she said of today's religion. Forget denominations... they confuse a person with pity details that loose sight of the fact that there is something much bigger than I.

It's a good book for Christians, or for anyone who has ever wondered what it is that Christians believe, or anyone who has ever thought they knew. It describes the basic tenets of Christianity in clear, laymen's terms. It's easy-to-understand and absolutely inspiring. A must-read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The reviews here by atheists mostly seem to boil down to \\"he didn't prove it\\". But that was not C. S. Lewis' purpose. His purpose was to show how Christianity answers the deepest questions about human nature, and this he does masterfully. Like a jungle trail guide, Lewis slashes through the thickets of self-deception, sloppy thinking and intellectual orthodoxies to show the logic - rooted in our knowledge of our own selves - of the incarnate God and risen Christ. Like many other reviewers, I was enabled to become a Christian, in the thinking adult sense, through reading this book. I think what we all in this group have in common is that, like Lewis, we ARE rationally and logically-driven people who could never fully accept Christianity on blind faith. Lewis gives us the eyes to see, so that our faith is not blind. As if that were not enough, the book is pleasurable, even exciting to read, and brings you into the cheerful, yet serious company of one of the last century's finest minds. And what can you say to an author who brings such rich gifts? Thank you, C. S. Lewis, from the bottom of my heart."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"In &quot;Mere Christianity,&quot; Lewis sets out to explain what Christianity is in its most basic forms (i.e., &quot;merely&quot; what Christianity is). Avoiding controversy as much as possible, he lays out basic tenants that all Christians believe. As such, it is a wonderful book for seekers and new Christians to read. The work has dated a bit, and some of Lewis' illustrations seem quaint now, but that does not decrease the usefulness of this book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity is the magnum opus of the greatest 20th century writer of Christian literature. Lewis argues for the Christian faith in Mere Christianity, and he does so with grace and style. He does not spurt dogmatism. Instead, he takes the reader on a circuitous route to the cross. He begins by describing the vague sense that most of us have about &quot;fair play.&quot; Whence comes such a noble sense? Surely it did not get into us by indoctrination or by birth-- there must be some higher source. At this point, Lewis admits that he is not within a thousand miles of &quot;The God of Christian Theology,&quot; but he does get there eventually. Lewis's take on the doctrine the Trinity (which comprises a section of Mere Christianity titled &quot;Beyond Personality&quot;) is exceptional, and just maybe the best Trinitarian theology ever written. I have read St. Augustine's work on the Trinity, but it is not nearly as well thought out or put together as well as Lewis's. &quot;Mere Christianity,&quot; like &quot;Pilgrim's Progress&quot; by John Bunyan or &quot;Castle of Wisdom&quot; by Rhett Ellis (the most intelligent Christian book of recent times) should be read by every Christian who is a deep thinker-- and also by deep thinkers who are not Christians."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"My wife and I read Mere Christianity together early in our married life more than 40 years ago. It is the read of a lifetime for us. As Christian lifelong learners, we still refer to and benefit from its principles, We have practiced giving a copy of Mere Christianity to high school graduates in our church fellowships for many years; we have given away hundreds of copies this way, and received countless letters of thanks, some many years after the gift. Its principles of struggles with belief and faith in the midst of doubt are as relevant now as in the 60s when we first met the book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Didn't know what to expect but this book lays out a good, sensible, logical, backed up argument for Christianity. There is no 'leaps of faith' involved, nor is anything said without being backed up with logical argument. A brilliant read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I was simultaneously impressed and disappointed in Mere Christianity. I am ashamed to say that I never read this book until recently. I should have since it is by many considered to be a halmark of Christian appologetic literature. Lewis' conversational style is appealing and make this small book a fairly easy read. I do have to admit that the first part of the book is brilliant. It is an extremely articulate arguement for the law of God being written on our hearts. No doubt it will not convince those who are philosophically opposed to the very idea but for those who are willing to read what God has written it should be very powerful. There are times that the arguements flowed to the point that I had to reread parts. I actually feel that while his conversational style makes for an easy read it at times convolutes the logic which is generally (though not always) sound once you go back and track it down.Book 2 (What Christians Believe) was fairly good but I have to admit that there were parts of Book 3 (Christian Behavior)that I found to be tedious. Book 4 (Beyond Presonality: Or First Steps in the Doctrine fo the Trinity) was pretty hit and miss parts were brilliant and others were lacking.What this book impressed uponme the most is that despite the accolades we need to read everything with a critial eye. As, I have stated parts of this book are brilliant and worthy of study. But, at the same time we need to recognize the deficiencies in Lewis' Theology. His discomfort with the exclusivity of Christ is hinted at in this book and expanded in others. But, also we need to be carely about the very idea of Mere Christianity. He makes a great effort to be theologically inclusive in this book and in the Preface Lewis even draws the analogy of Christianity being a large Hall and the different parts of Christianity being different doors leading out of the hall. He ackowledges that when we seek to open the door we need to seek which door is true but he says his purpose is only to lead us to the Hall. This way of thinking resonates strongly today. But, if one door is true then another door may not be true and that is deffinately something we need to consider. The discussions of Mere Christianity have their place but they must not replace the discussions of our Creeds. Souls often hang in the balance."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I went into this book a marginal agnostic and came out a Christian. The final barrier, for me, was that Christianity was illogical, a belief reinforced by the fact that most Christians seem to consider quoting the Bible an appropriate way to debate non-believers. This book opened my mind to the necessity of logic and faith working cohesively, and showed me that, in fact, Christianity bears a powerful and irrefutable logic. For a much better argument in favor of Christianity, I would reccomend Miracles, by C. S. Lewis, but for a quick and incredibly thought-provoking beginning, one could hardly do better."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis's Mere Christianity is the most informing book I've ever seen on matters of Christianity, more so even than the bible or other traditional religious texts. It slowly develops reasonable thoughts about the world, in a style similar to Greek philosophy, that lead into a dissection of Christian morals in today's world. Lewis supports his points with well thought out explanations, eliminating other beliefs with reasoning and logic.I began Mere Christianity somewhat of an atheist, but more of just a non-committed Christian, waiting for something like this book to give good reasons why Christianity is the correct religion. It has helped me by giving me the argument and reasoning I needed to see before I would believe. The book did not immediately convert me, but Lewis gives the best argument in favor of Christianity I've ever heard. It is the start of my own understanding of religion.I would have liked the book to have spent more time with generalities, explaining the foundation for Christianity more, and not move so quickly into Christian morality as it does, but it is a small annoyance shadowed by too many good points to matter. This is a great book to read for anyone looking for explanations of why to believe in Christianity, or just someone looking to deepen their faith. Lewis gives with Mere Christianity an understanding of religion greater than any church sermon could give."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is based on a series of radio broadcasts that C.S. Lewis did during WWII. It begins assuming that the listener has no belief in God. C.S. Lewis provides a strong intellectual argument for the existence of God and God's nature. He then develops a basis for belief in Jesus Christ and characterizes Christianity.I loved the book and will probably read it again from time to time."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The genius of CS Lewis is not so much that his works are still popular after some sixty years, which is an achievement by itself. It is important to understand that he writes in a period of history where the world was dark following Word War 2 and the rise of secular Marxism. His style is classical and somewhat Old fashioned English but under that there is a person with superb intellectual capacity who had been touched by personal grief having lost his wife to cancer and friends in the war. He challenges the idea that 'science' by itself has meaning. In his time the technology of war wiped out a whole generation in World War One and of course, a new world order of the \\"Atomic Age\\" was creating fear.Read as a basic foundation with this historic context leads us to understand that meaning and purpose in life are at the center of our human existence. He is a powerful intellectual with an inquiring mind and if he were alive today I am sure that he would enjoy the debate between biologists who tend to be secularists and astrophysicists who seek to understand the majesty of creation.Any work by Lewis can not be readily dismissed but equally it was written a generation ago and life has moved on in the christian community since then.Read as a basic understanding of christian faith in this context allows the reader to develop a richer exploration of the faith journey.All of his works are still a good read - that is why they are popular"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis has lately become a rock star within the Christian community. A new movie based on his books, The Chronicles of Narnia, is a blockbuster hit. His books are among the best selling in Christian literature. This is quite a feat for a reserved British intellectual who has been dead for more than forty years.As a young man, Lewis was a skeptic who dismissed Christianity as a myth. At age 33, with the help of J.R.R. Tolkien and others, he experienced a spiritual awakening. Afterwards, his creativity helped make him a celebrated champion of Christian belief. The intellectual journey Lewis takes us on in his masterwork of apologetics, Mere Christianity, is truly amazing. In it, he sought to explain the doctrines that Catholic and major Protestant denominations could all agree. He drew upon his former skepticism to help explain Christianity in a common, non-theological way.To begin, Lewis notes a predisposition in people to search for a standard of absolute truth. It seems all people across cultures and time generally agree that they should not put themselves first, and they ought to be honest, fair, unselfish, and courageous. He calls this tendency the Law of Human Nature because everyone knows it almost instinctively. Lewis then makes a second observation. While people everywhere have a notion that they should behave in these ways, they do not do so themselves. He says, \\"They know the Law of Human Nature; they break it. These two facts, are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe in which we live.\\"Lewis reasons that just as the laws of physics or mathematics are real, this Law of Human Nature must also be real. It must have been created as part of a universal truth, and not by man. He says, \\"I find that I do not exist on my own, that I am under a law. Something that is directing the universe, and appears in me as a law urging me to do right and making me feel responsible and uncomfortable when I do wrong.\\"He reasons there must be a \\"perfect goodness\\" behind the universe that is interested in what we do. And if that perfect goodness exists, it must disapprove of much of our behavior. \\"I think we have to assume,\\" he says, \\"it is more like a mind than it is like anything else we know.\\" Perhaps that is because it has rules. To Lewis, that perfect goodness, that Being, is what we call God. Lewis believes that in the end, God is our only reassurance, and we have made ourselves his enemy. What we need most is that from which we want to hide our behavior.Once we understand the Law of Human Nature, that there is a power behind that law, and that we have put ourselves wrong with that power by breaking it, Lewis says we then begin to understand what Christians are saying.If we are free to choose between good and evil, Lewis reasons, then evil must be a genuine possibility. An all-powerful God could surely prevent evil, but he could only do so at the cost of human freedom.Lewis goes on to observe that this powerful Being selected a specific group of people and spent hundreds of years hammering into them what kind of God he was, and that he cared about their conduct. Those people were the Jews, and the Old Testament chronicles the hammering process.Then, he says, comes the real shock. Among these Jews there suddenly turns up a man who claims he has always existed, forgives sins, and goes around talking as if he were God. \\"He says He is coming to judge the world at the end of time . . . What he said was, quite simply, the most shocking thing that has ever been uttered by human lips.\\" This man told people that their sins were forgiven. However, he never checked with others to whom those sins had wronged. He acted as if he were the primary one offended by our wrongdoing.\\"In the mouth of any speaker who is not God,\\" Lewis says, \\"these words would imply what I can only regard as a silliness and conceit unrivaled by any other character in history.\\" Jesus' words make sense only if he really was the God whose laws are broken and whose love is wounded by our sins.Lewis notes some people may say, \\"I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept His claim to be God.\\" He responds, \\"A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher . . . You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse.\\"\\"You can shut Him up for a fool,\\" Lewis says, \\"you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.\\"We know which choice C.S. Lewis made. To him, this rationalization was only the mere essence of Christianity. While his many books have been an inspiration to many people over the years, they continue to be an inspiration to those newly acquainted with his work today."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is a fabulous book, because C S Lewis takes us where he has been. He is a thinker's thinker, so he comes to Christian faith from the perspective of scholarship and intellect. Yet, he is not a \\"hard\\" read. This book is in everyday language and very accessible.The word \\"mere\\" can have two meanings in this title. The most common meaning is this: \\"Being nothing more than what is specified\\". In keeping with this definition, Lewis gives us basic Christian belief, presented in a way that is both simple and compelling. However, \\"mere\\" may also harken back to the Old English sense of the word, which meant a boundary or boundary marker. And this too, fits the book, as Lewis shows us the boundaries between belief and non-belief, and invites us into the realm of faith.Lewis wants to share what it is for a bright and thoughtful person to come to the point of believing that Jesus is the Son of God and the salvation of the world.If you have been struggling with that concept, no doubt it is because your own powers of reason have presented some barriers to belief. Lewis has met those barriers, and he discusses them in this volume. I would urge you to listen to his views--with an open mind--knowing that this is a very sophisticated writer. He is not out to take any short cuts, as he speaks from one mind to another.In the realm of the mind, without compromising who you are and what you have learned up till now in life, may you happily find what Lewis finds.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Probably one of the great books of the last century. Lewis approaches Christianity as late convert who previously held well-thought out philosophical objections to its teachings. In Mere Christianity, he outlines and refutes many such objections such as:(1) \\"'Isn't what you call the Moral Law simply our herd instinct and hasn't it been devloped just like our other instincts?'\\"; and(2) \\"'Isn't what you call the Moral Law just a social convention, something that is put into us by education?'\\"What is wonderful about Lewis' writing is that he draws delightful, imaginative analogies which he expresses in simple, unpretentious language, but which are nonetheless thoughtful and profound.As a university student, I frequently hear variations on these two objections made by students and professors to deny the existence of natural law. In his defence of natural law and critique of moral relativism, Lewis argues that while it (was, and remains) fasionable to argue that good and evil cannot be objectively defined because conception of morals have differed in space and time, this is not so. He asks us to imagine a country where people were admired for cowardice; where men felt proud for betraying their friends. In no society or age has selfishness or cowardice ever been admired, nor generosity and courage condemned. Lewis goes on to argue, persuasviely, that morals are NOT simply a matter of taste and opinion.In regards to objection (1) mentioned above, Lewis argues that while we do indeed possess a herd instinct (a natural desire to help another person), a DESIRE to help another is different in kind from feeling that you OUGHT to help whether you so desire or not. Lewis says you may feel two natural desires - the herd instinct to help another (and put yourself in harms way, and the instinct to self-preservation (to not risk harm). But human beings feel a third thing which tells us what instinct we OUGHT to follow. This thing which judges between the two cannot be one or the other. A sheet of music which tells you what note to play on the keyboard cannot be itself a note. Therefore: \\"The Moral Law tells us the tune we have to play: our instincts are merely the keys.\\"In regards to (2) Lewis argues that like our multiplication tables, morals are objective truths, not \\"social conventions.\\" The fact that we learn morals from our parents does not prove otherwise. We also learn math from our parents but that doesn't make mathematics a social construct (and therefore subjective and relative). Moreover, Lewis points out that: \\"If no set of moral ideas were truer or better than any other, there would be no sense in preferring civilised morality to savage morality, Christian morality to Nazi morality . . . The moment you say that one set of moral ideas can be better than another, you are, in fact, measuring them both by a standard, saying that one of them conforms to the standard more nearly than the other. But the standard that measures two things is something different from either. You are, in fact, comparing them both with some Real Morality, admitting that there is such a thing as a real Right, independent of what people think, and that some people's ideas get nearer to that Real right than others.\\" If we deny this transcendent, objective standard, we lose our ability to object to the actions of any other person or state.Lewis exposes the intellectual poverty of moral relativism, and in this modern age of cynicism and disbelief, his argument for the transcedent truth of Christ's teachings are needed more than ever. For those who find their faith faltering this book will help to sustain it. And for those who are not Christian but are curious and are open-minded enough to look beyond modern caricaturation, this book may surprise you."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"In Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis examines faith and Christianity without biasing any particular denomination. This book is divided into four sections. In the first two sections, Lewis writes as an apologetic. He takes a philisophical approach to describe that humans have a moral standard and this standard originates from God. Lewis also defends Jesus Christ's claim to be God and how we are redeemed through His death on the cross. I found this section to be very well written and intriguing.In the third section, Lewis examines Christian behavior. He discusses various topics including the four Cardinal virtues, the three theological virtues, sexual morality and the Christian marriage, and my favorite chapter - \\"The Great Sin\\" (pride). I would be surprised to find a reader that would be disappointed in this section. It is very intriguing and is an excellent reference looking at sin and appropriate behaviors for Christians.The last section discusses the trinity and Lewis's view of the life as a Christian. This is probably the most challenging section of the book. Lewis even warns readers that they may want to skip a chapter or two if they don't think it will help them. Nonetheless, I found this section to be interesting and it really gives the reader a glimpse into the mind of one of the great apologetics of the twentieth century.I recommend this book to both the non-believer and the strong Christian. It is an excellent reference and is guaranteed to challenge you."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity is, more less, the Mount Everest of 20th century Christian apologetics, and its exclaimed stature is completely justified. I find it hard to believe that any who read it would come away with a poor view of Christians and their beliefs. Lewis cuts past all the minor differences that divide the various denominations and explains what the utmost core beliefs and stances are and, yes, it is very hard to argue his logic in regards to a Higher Authority or an Absolute Truth. Whether or not the book serves well as a conversion tool, well I will leave to an individual reader's personal reaction to it. But taken as an explanation of and argument for my religious beliefs, then I give Mere Christianity my highest of high recommendations."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This boxed set is perfect for anyone who enjoys CS Lewis or just great reading on spiritual topics. Lewis has an amazing way of presenting the hard to understand subjects of the bible in beautifully constructed stories & analogies. An amazing writer - These are the essentials of CS Lewis and Christian Literature."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity is a great work about faith. Many intellectuals may scoff in contempt about some of the logic that Lewis uses, but in some ways that is the entire point of this book. He gives a concise and easily understandable description of what faith means. Keep in mind that this book is comprised of essays, many of which were born out of a radio program during World War 2.While Mere Christianity is a great read it should not be taken as the gospel truth. C.S. Lewis was a brilliant individual, but some of his beliefs about women in a religious perspective are outdated. He would be the first to tell you that he was nothing more than a layman when it comes to explaining the Kingdom of God. Qualms aside, this is a really great book and it is easy to read. Those that like Mere Christianity should read Lewis' The Screwtape Letters."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I've recently (as in yesterday) finish C.S. Lewis's \\"Mere Christianity\\". I thought it was a good book for Christians to read, but I think that, as far as trying to prove Christianity, he falls a little short. In the beginning, I thought that his argument was New and Different, but it's not. His argument for proof that there must be a God is, essentially, that there must have been something to give us our high moral ideals. Those of you who've read Anselm will notice a marked similarity to his argument, namely, they both say that because you can conceive of something higher, it must exist. Obviously, that need not be true. But, if you can accept his \\"argument\\" and continue on reading it, he brings out some really interesting points about the Trinity and how one God can be Three and still One, and the importance of Jesus in that equation. I think it's well worth reading as long as you don't take his attempts to prove Christianity with a grain of salt and focus more on how the book can help you in your own search for Jesus, or in your own search for faith, if that's what you're searching for."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Found this book to be the best of introduction to the essence of Christianity without getting bogged down by the dogmas of the numerous denominations. For someone who is already a Christian, CS Lewis's lucid style will reinforce the greatness of the religion and will surely the reader will appreciate his ancestors for having choosen this faith. For anyone who is not a Christian and is looking to know more of the faith ,surely there cannot be a better book than this."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"There's a reason Mere Christianity is one of the &quot;most popular books written in the last 100 years&quot;. Lewis put his extraordinary writing talent to use to present yet another wonderful case for Christianity. He aimed this book at normal readers who might have questions about the basic beliefs of Christianity. The great majority of readers and reviewers feel that he succeeeded brilliantly, as do I. I've read it three times over the past few years and it always brings me smiles. A bonus is the gentle humor that Lewis uses in describing some of his examples. This book clarified many points for me and truly made me want to read the bible even more."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I read this book for an introduction to Christianity class this past term, and despite my high expectations for a wonderful insight into the nature of Christianity, I was sorely disappointed. Although this book is easy to read and approaches humor in some places, this is where the charm of the book ends. C.S Lewis was obviously writing for a war-time audience, addressing his readers to fight evil in the same way that we fight against enemy-occupied territory. Throughout the book, Lewis charges his readers with being separate and apart from the rest of the world to be truly Christian. In addition, this book is not for moral relativists, as Lewis starts with the assumption of absolute morality to deduce the existence of God. He attempts to refute Nietzsche's \\"herd morality\\" concept by discussing how morality favors what is good for society, against individual desire, ignoring the fact that the herd morality advocated by Nietzsche does favor the herd, society, not the individual. Lewis continually personifies God (God thinks, God wants, God desires, etc) then tells his readers that God is ineffable and \\"more of a drama\\" than anything else. Any Christians who are familiar with the theologies of either Reinhold Niebuhr or Martin Luther will see glimmers of their theories bleeding into Lewis' work, but Lewis taints these theologies by adding his own concepts that only offer contradictions to these works. Bottom line: don't believe the hype. This book disappoints anyone who wants an objective view of Christianity - instead, it is meant to convert the agnostic unbeliever who despretly would like to be Christian. Lewis' assumptions and small contradictions can be easily overlooked by someone who doesn't want to see them."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity is the first book that I ever read in which the author approached the subject of Christianity in a logical, thoughtful and intelectually engaging manner. Lewis addresses many of the questions and concerns that nagged me about Christianity throughout my college years. As such, the essays in this book were instrumental in my coming to faith in Christ.I have since read many, many good books on Christianity, but I would recommend this one to anyone who is struggling with his intellect. This is still one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book gives a purely objective view on Christianity. C.S. Lewis starts out with the plain facts and just methodically explains why Christianity makes sense. A comprehensive book that flawlessly spells out Christianity! A Must read for all Christians and non-Christians who are seeking the truth."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Whether christian or not a must read book from one of the foremost christian writers of the modern era. Lewis presents christianity in cogent terms that accurately reflect the historical christian faith. Never intending to write a mere logical discourse, Lewis does utilize rational structures to frame the discussion. Christians will find their faith and commitment challenged. Lewis gives non-christians a chance to understand just what it is they are rejecting. I find myself rereading this book and finding something new each time."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"c.s. lewis rationalizes and rerationalizes every aspect of chirstianity, almost to the point that it becomes overwhelming - it is a VERY thorough work with an endless number of metaphors for explaining all aspects of the christian faith."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I don't know if he could have possibly covered all the ground he did in any fewer words. It is incredible how he goes from assuming you believe in absolute nothing to getting down the heart of Christianity in a matter of pages. I also like Lewis b/c he often gives credit where credit is due. This book shall stand the test of time."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book breaks it down pretty simple and really makes you think. Read it at least twice to get the full gist of what he's saying. If you don't get what he's trying to say, you'll at least be smarter by the time you finish the book. Forces you to think."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Many people who don't call themselves Christian (and some who do) don't know what Christianity is all about. This book will tell you. Depending on where you're coming from, you'll either be personally offended or completely sold on what Lewis says. It's worth reading either way."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is a must for any Believer. Though parts of it take several readings to fully comphrehend, Mere Christianity is beyond just a classic. It is part of the cannon of basics for the thinking Christian, and a joy for everyone. This book brought peace to my mind."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is a dangerous read for one that may still be avoiding Jesus Christ. The reviewer that stated this book is &quot;philosopically flawed&quot; and that Lewis &quot;over-simplifies&quot; is buying into the same old unspoken nonsense. Many want a god that can meet them intellectually, which means of course that the God the simple man worships can't be the one for them. The Gospel is deliberately simple; Lewis could not over-simplify it......he could neither add to it nor take away from it. It is because of the Gospel's simplicity that Jesus is available to all people at all times, everywhere. God's intellect can be matched by no created being and any individual that finds salvation through Christ to be of no intellectual challenge is really revealing this: They value themselves above other people and in doing so expose the very nature of sin and God's amazing mercy of sending Christ into the world. A paradox? Of course, and the narrow road to the Kingdom. Welcome!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Next to the Bible, probably the greatest book ever written about Christianity, and (in terms of clarity) makes God's teachings much easier to understand."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Originally a series of radio broadcasts that were transcribed into book form with the author's help, C. S. Lewis' witty and systematically logical defense of Christianity still endures as a favorite today. Although intellectual works of this caliber can seem intimidating, his conversational style of communication makes the book approachable and thoroughly enjoyable. He not only addresses the common sense of Christianity, but also thoughtfully doesn't neglect the practical need, the heartfelt void, that Christ alone can fill. All in all, this book is an all-around, solid work that consistently covers all the bases of thought and makes for a great read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Outstanding book. The content is a perfect grouping of modern- classic literature and the book is well made and very attractive. It even has a nice ribbon page marker. It will make a nice addition to any library."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book was not written in an attempt to convince the staunch non-believer. It was written for those who believe and those who doubt their non-belief. I felt that his opening chapters regarding the moral argument presented a strong point in a weak way.Lewis used very little scripture in this book, but I do not see that as a weakness. If Christ genuinely is the Word, then his message should make perfect sense even apart from the written word.One of the things Lewis demonstrated very well was the fact that if you look at man's dilemma as being fallen, and consider how he came to be in this dilemma, then the solution that Christianity offers makes perfect sense.The concept of the trinity is also covered very well.Finally, the chapter on God and Time sheds light on a few misconceptions about God's nature, and introduces a number of different ways of thinking about time that make it easier to see how God can hear everyone's prayers, or how the fact that God knows my future doesn't mean that I have no choice over the matter."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Lewis was a master of language. This book is written in a style that is both easy to read and beautifully constructed. He was Chair of Medieval and Renaissance Literature at Cambridge, and his works are widely recognised as masterpieces of literature.In the book, his description and characterisation of mainstream Christianity is thorough. He covers the faith at a basic level, but it is more comprehensive and comprehensible than most non-Christians and even many Christians have ever heard before. This book taught me a lot about mainstream Christianity, not in a dogmatic sense, but in a spiritual sense. Too many authors rely on discussion of theology and dogma; Lewis covers the spiritual, and this is what sets his book apart.His coverage of the faith is non-denominational, and he deals with the subject in a frank, conversational manner. It is an extremely easy read, but at the same time both interesting and involving.With that said, many of his arguments lack force. While his apologetics make use of many good analogies, his logic will be unconvincing to most non-believers.On a side note, Lewis died on the same day as Aldous Huxley and JFK. Funny how life works!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I listened to this book in audio format from Audible, and although I had read it multiple times--the audio format added a whole new rich texture that I enjoyed thoroughly. Lewis' clarity never ceases to amaze me and strengthen my faith. One thing I do want to note though is how Lewis is misused. Often I hear many Christians state (sometimes as an excuse to avoid taking a position on the things that God intends us to study) that they just practice \\"mere Christianity.\\" Lewis would not have approved. He never intended his work to be used in that manner. I suggest these \\"mere Christians\\" re-read this book and take to heart Lewis' admonition that the basic principles he elucidated are not intended to be a stopping place, but rather a juncture that we all pass through in the \\"hall\\" on the way to the \\"room\\" that will be our home. We are not intended to remain in the milk of \\"mere Christianity,\\" but to move on to the rich and bountiful meat of deep study and immersion into the joy of knowing God."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"great book. a little hard to read because of such in depth thoughts and such but its a great read and im learning from it. this book was recommended to me and i think i might have to read it twice so that i can fully understand it ."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I read this when I was first becoming interested in Christianity. It isn't heavy-handed. It actually doesn't really go into much theological argument at all. It basically sets a stage of \\"why\\" one should believe. There was a great chapter on \\"Pride\\"- a non-believer would probably even enjoy."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have always been interested in CS Lewis from the time I was a child. I first read his Screwtape Letters and branched out into the Chronicles of Narnia. I also found him frequently quoted my many people that I respected. This gave me a desire to read more of his works. As a result I picked up this compilation of seven of his important works. I was intellectually and spiritually rewarded for reading this volume. There was a good variety that included Christian apologetics, allegory, philosophy, mourning, and morality.\\"Mere Christianity\\" was probably my favorite book. He explains some of the most fundamental principles of Christianity if a clear, forthright manner. His views on the potential of man are beautiful.The \\"Screwtape Letters\\" is a series of letters from a devil to his apprentice teaching him how to corrupt his subject. In the process it teaches us what some of our most common failing are.\\"Miracles\\" is a work describing how God works with man. In this book he brings out more of his theology that I saw in any of his other books. I personally didn't agree with everything he said; nevertheless, I learned a lot about him and he did have many good points.\\"The Great Divorce\\" was a tale of a being from hell travelling to visit heaven and learning many important lessons about how we hold ourselves back by not forgiving others and ourselves.\\"The Problem of Pain\\" does a good job describing how pain fits into our lives from a Christian perspective.\\"A Grief Observed\\" is a journal of Lewis' deepest feelings after the death of his own wife. It shows how truly painful grief is, but shows that it does get better.\\"The Abolition of Man\\" is an essay on the pitfalls of moral relativism, and clarifies that there are universal truths out there.I highly recommend this group of books anyone wanting to know Lewis better; and you will learn or re-learn many important truths in the process."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"CS Lewis is almost always wonderful reading. This one was a bit odd to read as it's written primarily to a non-Christian audience. It's essentially a logical argument for Christianity, and of course Lewis does a great job of that. He's one of Christianity's great thinkers, and I think it's not a coincidence that he came out of a non-Christian background. He pulls from the common objections to Christianity heavily, which makes this a wonderful book not just for unbelievers, but for Christians who have doubts as to the rationality of their faith in Jesus.Lewis was an Anglican in the 40s, so there are some weird dated references, and of course there are places where I'm far more of a Calvinist than Lewis was. However, these are nits, and hardly worth picking at. If you're dealing with an educated agnostic or atheist, and need to speak on their level about Christianity, there's hardly a better choice."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is a great book for people who are either half or fully convinced about Christianity. But, and I should mention this right away, this book is not meant to convince a non-Christian that Christianity is true. Many other books have been written for this purpose, and if you want to find one then just search for a Christian apologetics book.This book answers many questions that Christians might ask about their faith, and does so in an easy-to-read format, almost like a novel. The book is written in a very non-technical manner, so almost anyone should be able to understand what Lewis is talking about. Also, there are lots of analogies to help the reader better understand what is being explained.This book is comprised of four smaller books called \\"Right and Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of the Universe\\", \\"What Christians Believe\\", \\"Christian Behaviour\\", and \\"Beyond Personality, or First Steps in the Doctrine of the Trinity\\".The first book explores the idea that the concepts of right and wrong are proof that a morally good God exists and loves us. Lewis does a good job of explaining this point, and, as usual, uses lots of analogies and examples. His explanation may not convince an atheist that God exists, but nevertheless it provides food for thought for all readers. Again, if you want to be shown proof of why God exists then you shouldn't be looking for it in this book. Read a book that is dedicated to Christian apologetics instead.The second book explores the Christian idea of who and what God is, and discusses some aspects of the Christian faith. Some ideas that are discussed are pantheism, dualism, and the nature of the devil.The third book continues exploring what Christians believe, but does so in a more detailed way. Some concepts that are discussed are morality, sex, marriage, forgiveness, charity, and faith. This is my favorite of the four books because it gives some good reasons for why Christians believe what they do, and it also gave me a better understanding of what the Christian faith is about.The fourth book is the most abstract of the four, which makes sense considering that it's about the Trinity. This book also talks about what God wants from us and how we can become true Christians. A lot of this book is comprised of Lewis' opinions (rather than commonly accepted facts), but nevertheless it is an excellent read because Lewis has some very interesting and convincing opinions. Lewis' analysis of how we become \\"true\\" Christians was particularly interesting.Overall I consider this to be a very good book. Lewis is a very intelligent man who has many convincing arguments. I also enjoyed it because Lewis seems to think in the same way as me; many of the ideas that he presented are similar to things I have thought of in the past. Nevertheless, there are a few things about the book that I didn't like. For one thing, it is written in a very old-fashioned way which many young people may not be used to (but, Lewis wrote these books in the 1940's, so that is to be expected). Also, it would have been nice if the first book (which is commonly called \\"The Case for Christianity\\") included other proofs of the Christian God, rather than just dwelling on the origin of morality. Many people are not convinced by this proof, so it would have been a good idea to present other proofs such as miracles, the historical accuracy of the Bible, the origin of the universe pointing towards the existence of a god, etc. The final problem that I have with this book is that some parts are not at all convincing. But, this only applies to about 5% of the book, and perhaps these arguments that I consider weak would be convincing for other people, so this is a pretty insignificant objection.One final note about this book (and religious books in general). When it comes to religion (or any other controversial topic), many people are extremely biased, emotionally-driven, or narrow-minded. Not all people are like this, but way too many are. If you plan to read this book, or any other book that is about a controversial subject, please do so in an objective, emotionally-neutral, open-minded manner. Doing so will help you figure out what you truly believe."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Reading this book I gained a logical confirmation of the natural beliefs of the heart, which in modern times are increasingly condemned as illogical. The best scholarly defense of religion/morality in general and Christianity in particular I've read! To make the most out of it, read \\"The Everlasting Man\\" by G.K. Chesterton, a book which greatly influenced Lewis and played a major role in converting him to theism:The Everlasting Man. These books go hand in hand.

His argument for Christianity is convincing, and his passion and love for Christ come through in his words.

Miracles is another apologetic as well as the Great Divorce. One needs this volume at hand and needs to read its content from cover to cover to even start to say that they are an educated person. For me Lewis is one of the greatest writers of all time, and a theologian without all the trappings of obscurantism.

Instead, I will make several points: 1. Like the works of Shakespeare, this didn't begin as a book, but as a series of radio speeches given in England during WWII. The language is very formal and very dated. (Years from now, I can imagine a reader wondering about our use of terms such as &#34;dude&#34; and &#34;LOL.&#34;) 2. The speeches were given during an extremely dark period in the history of mankind. 3. Who requested the speeches? The king? The church? 3. Why? To raise moral? To provide spiritual inspiration? 4.

Lewis was never trained as theologian, the books included in this volume of his works provide incredible insight into Christianity, including what it means to be a Christian itself. C.S. Lewis (known to his friends as Jack) was actually an atheist who, through logical argument and reason, eventually became a born again Christian. Although it is not touted as such, the book (within this volume of books) \\"Mere Christianity\\" maps out that journey Lewis took to becoming the Christian he eventually came to be."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"One of my favorite authors is C.S. Lewis. His creativity and writing style captivate me. I love reading the Chronicles of Narnia at least once a year. Powerful themes of life and love, yet incredibly enjoyable too.I first read Mere Christianity when I was a teenager and while I remember enjoying it, I don't really think I grasped a majority of it. So I figured it was time to read it again. I should have a better understanding at 30 right? I'm glad I did. While written in 1943 (and in Britain no less :) ), there's still so many provoking thoughts and ideas.I'm not sure how any of these blog posts will go (let's be honest, this is my second post), but I'm sure each one will look nothing like that last. So to kick off my first official \\"book review,\\" here's some of the quotes I thought were worth highlighting.I'll start with my favorite quote of the book:\\"To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket- safe, dark, motionless, airless-it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable.\\"\\"Put right out of your head the idea that these are only fancy ways of saying that Christians are to read what Christ said and try to carry it out--as a man may read what Plato or Marx said and try to carry it out. They mean something much more than that. They mean that a real Person, Christ, here and now, in that very room where you are saying your prayers, is doing things to you. It is not a question of a good man who died two thousand years ago.\\"\\"It is a living Man, still as much a man as you, and still as much God as He was when He created the world, really coming and interfering with your very self; killing the old natural self in you and replacing it with the kind of self He has. At first, only for moments. Then for longer periods. Finally, if all goes well, turning you permanently into a different sort of thing; into a new little Christ, a being which, in its own small way, has the same kind of life as God; which shares in His power, joy, knowledge and eternity.\\"\\"Because free will, though it makes evil possible, is also that only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having.\\"\\"Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.\\"\\"If you read history you will find that the Christians who did most for the present world were just those who thought most of the next, the Apostles themselves, who set foot on the conversion of the Roman Empire, the great men who built up the Middle Ages, the English evangelicals who abolished the slave trade, all left their mark on Earth, precisely because their minds were occupied with Heaven. It is since Christians have largely ceased to think of the other world that they have become so ineffective in this.\\"\\"If Christianity was something we were making up, of course we could make it easier. But it is not. We cannot compete, in simplicity, with people who are inventing religions. How could we? We are dealing with Fact. Of course anyone can be simple if he has no facts to bother about.\\""},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Inspiring and enlightening.

Given that this book was based on radio talks given during the 1940s, you might expect that some of this book would be \\"dated\\" or cobbled-together; I did not find this to be the case, as many of the issues Lewis focuses on transcend the time period they were written in.There are a number of things about this book that I especially appreciated:* Its clarity and concision. C. S. Lewis had a well-earned reputation for explaining difficult concepts in a way that laymen could understand, and that really comes through here.* Its originality. While many apologetics books (even by many well-known authors), are just rehashing the same old arguments over and over again (how many different ways are there to present the cosmological argument anyway?), Lewis actually originates several arguments that are apparently original to him (and re-formulates several old ones in an original way), such as his now-famous trilogy argument for the deity of Christ.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Provocative and poignant.

No matter what you believe- take the time to read this classic. It is highly unlikely, near impossible, that your perception of the Christian community will be the exact same after you read.Britain can be proud for producing an author like Lewis, but even he could not have been aware of how valuable his work would become in today's America. Arguably, America has done more to promote Christianity than any other nation in the world's history, and more to damage it.

This is good and bad. He observed that all people seem to understand that there is a set of rules that we should live by. And typically when someone does not follow the rules, they won't say that the rule is not a rule, they will make an excuse instead. He inferred from this that there must be a Natural Law and a source of that law. What's more, he concluded that the source must be merciful, because we break the Natural Law all the time. He explains the logic behind the Christian position on controversial topics such as marriage. His discussion is focused on want the Christian position is and why he thinks the Christian position on things is logical, rather than simply accepting what the Bible tells us as best we can understand it. Most Christians are going to accept the Bible as the word of God and try to follow regardless of whether they completely understand the logic. Challenging God is not a rational endeavor. Book III Chapter 8 on Pride is outstanding. Given that the book aims at the logic behind certain moral standards, anyone who is serious about living a principled life would benefit from the book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The author of this book was religious and tried to decide whether or not to talk about religion directly in his work. He made a wise decision to leave direct religious references out of his children's book because the book became popular without the direct religious comments and you cannot find a book that has strong Christian theology for children that is popular. What as good about C. S. Lewis' take on religion was that he did his religious proclamation incognito; he did not adamantly announce his view he just talked about his conversion from atheism in his personal life on in his bio, then he wrote non-fiction books about Christianity and fiction books, which were more popular, and only slightly implied his views on good and evil.The concepts displayed in this book are to ameliorate the theological aspects of Christianity. C.S. Lewis tries to explain why God allowed certain evils into the natural world. I think that God allowed pain and suffering to see which form of relief people would choose to relieve their pain. Pain is a test of loyalty to your faith and way of life. Few fiction writers make such a profound effort to explore non-fiction subject matter and this is a good example of that concept."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"One of the best explanations of the Christian point-of-view ever written.

It arrived promptly, as the seller had said it would. The boxed set looks great --- I can't wait for my husband to open it!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The following review is based on the 2001 HarperSanFrancisco edition copublished by Zondervan, with a foreword by Kathleen Norris:In this volume, C.S. Lewis, one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century, successfully lays out those basic tenets that nearly all Christians have held together at all times. He employs convincing arguments in plain language to point to a system of absolute truth and he then comes full circle by arguing that this system is fully realized in a Christian worldview.1. The Case for Absolute ValuesHe opens the book by arguing that people hold to common perceptions of right and wrong, as can be evidenced in everyday, mundane situations. The statements that are exchanged in arguments, such as \\"That's my seat, I was there first\\" or \\"Come on, you promised,\\" demonstrate this tendency (p. 3). People quarreling typically do not discard the standard against which their conduct is being measured; rather, they try to justify themselves according to the standard. This, says Lewis, points to a system of absolute values that people hold in common.2. The Case for ChristLewis then challenges the reader to concede that he (the reader) has at sometime or another violated the very standards of behavior that \\"we expect from other people\\" (p. 7). Thus, although people believe in transcendent standards, they have throughout history and throughout cultures typically not acted in accordance with these standards. This is the gateway through which Lewis sets up the argument that he will employ throughout the rest of the book: people need to be justified, and Christianity offers the answers in Christ.The reader is challenged to examine the claims of Christ and to determine for himself whether or not Christ was God, as he claimed to be. If he was not, then he \\"would either be a lunatic--on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg--or else he would be the Devil of Hell\\" (p. 52). Lewis leaves no room for the view that Jesus was no more than a \\"great moral teacher,\\" since no great moral teacher would claim to be God if he was merely man.3. On Christian LivingAfter setting out the case for Christianity, Lewis discusses various aspects of Christian doctrine and behavior. The purpose and end of Christians is to become like \\"little Christs\\" while working out their salvation. Lewis discusses a series of relevant questions, including social morality, sexual morality, charity, hope, faith, and the difficulty of Christian living.Of the latter sections of the book, one of Lewis's strongest is chapter 6 of book 3, where he discusses the idea of Christian marriage. He makes the case for the leadership of the man in Christian marriage in a way that is strikingly relevant. He begins from the premise that there needs to be a leader in the relationship and, based on the natural differences between men and women, as well as some anecdotes and arguments based on intuition and some common sense, Lewis states why the leadership of the man, as taught in the Scriptures, is in keeping with human nature. My only criticism to this chapter is that Lewis starts on the premise that disagreement will naturally arise, and because there can be no democracy in a relationship of two, either the man or the wife needs to take the lead. The problem with this is that it ignores the place of leadership even in the absence of disagreement. For example, Adam was Eve's head in prelapsarian Eden, where there was neither sin nor conflict.Lewis also discusses the two aspects of love that married couples will experience, the first being the \\"falling in love\\" and the second being the \\"staying in love\\" that should last for the rest of their lives. He writes that \\"What we call \`being in love' is a glorious state, and, in several ways, good for us. It helps to make us generous and courageous, it opens our eyes not only to the beauty of the beloved but to all beauty, and it subordinates (especially at first) our merely animal sexuality; in that sense, love is the great conqueror of lust. No one in his senses would deny that being in love is far better than either common sensuality or cold self-centeredness. But, as I said before, \`the most dangerous thing you can do is to take any one impulse of our own nature and set it up as the thing you ought to follow at all costs'. Being in love is a good thing, but it is not the best thing. There are many things below it, but there are also things above it. You cannot make it the basis of a whole life. It is a noble feeling, but it is still a felling. Now no feeling can be relied on to last in its full intensity, or even to last at all. Knowledge can last, principles can last, habits can last; but feelings come and go. And in fact, whatever people say, the sate called \`being in love' usually does not last. If the old fairy-tale ending \`They lived happily ever after' is taken to mean \`They felt for the next fifty years exactly as they felt the day before they were married', then it says what probably never was nor ever would be true, and would be highly undesirable if it were. Who could bear to live in that excitement for even five years? What would become of your work, your appetite, your sleep, your friendships? But, of course, ceasing to be \`in love' need not mean ceasing to love. Love in this second sense--love as distinct from \`being in love'--is not merely a feeling. It is a deep unity, maintained by the will and deliberately strengthened by habit; reinforced by (in Christian marriages) the grace which both partners ask, and receive, from God. They can have this love for each other even at those moments when they do not like each other; as you love yourself even when you do not like yourself. They can retain this love even when each would easily, if they allowed themselves, be \`in love' with someone else. \`Being in love' first moved them to promise fidelity: this quieter love enables them to keep the promise. It is on this love that the engine of marriage is run: being in love was the explosion that started it\\" (p. 108-109). Lewis speaks with remarkable clarity and wisdom for a man who, at the time he wrote the passage, was unmarried."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is a real \\"large print\\" edition and not one of those made large print by enlarging the page.

There are thousands of new age Christian writings, watered down to suit those who want the blessings without doing the work. This book implies that we have work to do and clearly explains why and how.Written in 1952 or around there.

Lewis, intellectual giant of the 20th Century and author of The Chronicles of Narnia, is widely considered to be one of the world's foremost influences on religious thought in the past 100 years.These six books leave little doubt as to why.Lewis wrote many books on religion, fiction and nonfiction alike, but it is in these six works that his entire belief system is neatly laid out. Lewis was a master at detailing his complicated philosophies with simple language and the usage of metaphor to clarify any points of difficulty even for the most confused layman. In this review I will briefly comment on all six books:Non-fiction:Mere ChristianityThe Problem of PainMiraclesA Grief ObservedFiction (note that when I say \\"fiction\\" here, I mean that the characters/events/places in these books are not real or are used in a fictional manner; depending on how you would define fiction, these books may be no more fictional than the Declaration of Independence):The Screwtape LettersThe Great DivorceMere Christianity is perhaps Lewis' most well-known non-fictional work. In it he brilliantly lays out the fundamental beliefs and tenets of basic, non-denominational Christianity as he perceived them (what should be kept in mind is that Lewis himself acknowledged that he was by no means an absolute authority), explained their meanings and consequences on our everyday lives, defended them with precise logic, and, anticipating future rebuttals to his argument, defended his defenses as well. Anyone wanting to know what Lewis believed, how he came to believe it, and why he died believing in it simply must read this book.The Problem of Pain is a short work in which Lewis describes the existence of pain and suffering and their relationship to (and, perhaps, their affirmation of) the existence of God. An excellent read for the up-and-coming apologist and students of philosophy interested in his thoughts on this area of the infamous Problem of Evil.In Miracles, the largest of the six books (in terms of number of pages), Lewis lays out what he believed miracles are, how they exist, how they work, why we don't seem to experience miracles on the same grand level as people in the Bible did, why a naturalistic universe devoid of miracles makes no logical or intuitive sense, and the relationship between God, miracles, and humanity.A Grief Observed is the shortest of the six books. When Lewis' beloved wife died, he began to write down his thoughts and emotions in a notebook that he eventually decided to publish, in the hopes that someone going through a similar heartbreak could find some understanding from a man who knew good and well what true grief is. The reader cannot help but truly feel the anguish Lewis felt as he began writing these notes on the nature of God's goodness.The Screwtape Letters is a fictional work consisting entirely of letters written from a demon, named Screwtape, to his nephew, Wormwood, a demon in training that is trying to tempt a human soul into Hell. Lewis steps right into the mind and body and spirit of true, absolute evil in this work, describing the existence of demons, the purpose for what they do, how they tempt human minds, and their utter defeat at the hands of God.The Great Divorce is a short fictional allegory describing the trip of an unnamed man into both Hell and Heaven. My personal favorite of the six books, The Great Divorce describes Lewis' views on Heaven and Hell, who goes there, why they go there, their relationships to the existence of God, and God's influence on both places through wonderfully presented allegory. George MacDonald, who was greatly admired by Lewis, appears as a character in this story meant to give a guided tour of the beauties (and terrors) of Heaven.With each book being a classic in and of themselves, this boxed set is definitely worth the price for any C.S. Lewis aficionado."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"My whole family is reading this now and they love it. It is thought provoking and C.S.Lewis was a very smart man.

Lewis is renowned as one of the foremost Christian thinkers of the twentieth century. Despite being an Anglican and exhibiting a number of tendencies making him a bit of an iconoclast among his fellow believers, C.S. Lewis has been fondly embraced by a broad swath of the church in part because of his efforts to promote a version of the Christian faith amicable towards all denominations by appealing to what all of these theological niches have in common, which could be referred to as mere Christianity.As such, one of Lewis' best known apologetic texts is titled none other than Mere Christianity. Originally presented as a series of broadcast talks, Lewis vetted much of his text past four members of the clergy --- an Anglican, a Methodist, a Presbyterian, and a Roman Catholic --- in order to keep denominational idiosyncrasies to a minimum. Because of such conscientious effort, the Christian finds in Mere Christianity a rational defense of the faith of considerable sophistication.Mere Christianity begins as a recitation of what is known as the moral argument for the existence of God. According to Lewis, the moral law consists of the fundamental rules by which the universe operates and to which all residing within are bound. And even though considerable intellectual resources have been expended to deny its existence, not even those making it their life's purpose to undermine these eternal principles can escape from them try as they might. Lewis observes, \\"Whenever you find a man who says he does not believe in a real Right and Wrong, you will find the same man going back on this a moment later. He may break his promise to you, but if you try breaking one to him, he will be complaining \`It's not fair' before you can say \`Jack Robinson' (5).\\"The very fact that human beings are able to argue that one set of moral claims is superior to another, Lewis observes, is itself proof that some kind of higher law exists. Lewis writes, \\"Quarrelling means trying to show that the other man is wrong. And there would be no sense in trying to do that unless you and he had some sort of agreement as to what Right and Wrong are; just as there would be no sense in saying that a footballer has committed a foul unless there was some kind of agreement about the rules of football (4).\\"Lewis notes, \\"If no set of moral ideas were truer or better than any other, there would be no sense in preferring...Christian morality to Nazi morality...If your moral ideas can be truer, and those of the Nazis less true, there must be something --- some real morality --- for them to be true about (11).\\" Thus, the standard by which human moralities are judged stem from a source apart and above them.From establishing that natural law exists, Lewis moves on to examine where this eternal law originates from. Lewis postulates there are approximately two sources that this law could possibly originate from: the materialist view that the principles governing the universe arose through a process of chance and the religious view that the universe was established by a conscious mind. And since the law comes to us in the form of principles and instructions, this would seem to conclude that the promulgator of this law would have to be mind rather than inanimate matter.Despite the fact that the universe was meant to run according to moral law, it is obvious from a quick look around that the moral agents operating within it fail to live up to these noble ideals as we are regularly aware of even our own shortcomings. As such, the universe requires a divine intervention to set things right. Lewis writes, \\"Enemy occupied territory --- that is what the world is. Christianity is the story of how the rightful king has landed...and is calling us all to take part in a great campaign of sabotage (36).\\" This king is none other than Jesus, whom from his own claims, must be God or, as Lewis famously points out, is a lunatic \\"on a level with a man who says he is a poached egg or a devilish liar (41).\\" It was the primary purpose of Jesus to suffer and die so that our sins might be forgiven so that we might be made whole in Him.Fundamental as this message is to man's eternal salvation, Mere Christianity is also full of practical observations less cosmic and more down to earth. Lewis writes, \\"Theology is practical. Consequently, if you do not listen to Theology...It will mean that you have a lot of...bad muddled, out of date ideas (120.)\\" Many of theology's practical concerns manifest themselves in the form of morality.Lewis lists morality as being concerned with three matters: harmony between individuals, the inner life of the individual, and the general purpose of human life as a whole (57). Lewis observes that different beliefs about the universe will naturally result in different behaviors and those closest to the truth will produce the best results (58).Lewis demonstrates how this phenomena manifests itself in a number of ethical spheres, sex being one of interest to just about all people. It is this obsession with sex, Lewis point out, that shows just how out of whack contemporary morality has become. Lewis comically comments that the level to which this biological impulse has been elevated in our own society is akin to a land where the inhabitants have such a prurient interest in food beyond nourishment and wholesome pleasure that the inhabitants watch a plate containing a mutton chop that is uncovered just before the lights go out (75). Ironically, Lewis points out, such deviancy is not usually the result of starvation but rather overindulgence.Though Lewis is witty in regards to most issues he addresses, even in regards to this beloved Oxford professor, the Christian must remember to be a Berean and measure even his formidable intellect by the standard of Biblical truth. Unfortunately, there are at least two matters that must be approached with caution.Lewis likens the process of change we go through as Christians to the biological theory of recapitulation where it is believed an embryo passes through the various phases of evolution during development in the womb. Of the process, Lewis writes, \\"We were once like vegetables, and once rather like fish; it was only at a later stage that we became like human babies (159).\\"One hopes that had Lewis lived until more technologically advanced times that he would have not retained this scientifically erroneous theory. For at its most innocent, it is used to justify Darwinisim and from Lewis' statement one could very well use it to justify abortion.From another passage, it would seem Lewis tottered dangerously close to a \\"proto-universalism\\" in his thought. Lewis writes, \\"There are people in other religions who are being led by God's secret influence to concentrate on those parts of their religion which are in agreement with Christianity, and who thus belong to Christ without knowing it (162).\\"John 14:6 says, \\"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\\" And Acts 4:12 says, \\"Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.\\"In writing Mere Christianity, Lewis does a commendable job overall of balancing the theoretical and practical concerns of the faith. As such, Mere Christianity will no doubt continue as a classic apologetics text for decades to come.by Frederick Meekins"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The title describes this book. I contains several of the writings that CS Lewis is famous for. This is great reading to cause serious reflection on one's faith and belief in Christ."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I am usually a great fan of C.S. Lewis, and as a Christian I have found much inspiration in his works. However, as a woman, I found much that was troubling in Mere Christianity. When Lewis stated in his preface that he wasn't covering the issue of abortion because he was not female and had no experience with it I rejoiced, hoping that I would have a reprieve from the many Christian books that demanded that women be obedient, no matter how intelligent or practical they might be. Unfortunately, I was sad to find that Lewis fell into the same old rut as so many of his peers. I found the notion that most women feel guilty for being sometimes in charge insulting to say the least. I do not consider myself a feminist necessarily, but I have enough of a brain to know when I'm being asked to do something completely unreasonable, which submitting because I am apparently scarier than a man is.It's really a pity, because it was otherwise a great, uplifting book. I just wish there was more understanding for half of the people who might read it."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Be careful or you might just end up a Christian through the written philosophical common sense of C.S. Lewis.Seriously though, has anyone ever made Christianity make more sense than the late Mr. Lewis? This book will strengthen your faith in Christ or quite possibly break your faith in atheism."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Lewis&#65533;s Mere Christianity is an insightful and thought provoking classic work of Christian literature. This collection of World War II radio speeches retains the impact it had fifty years ago in Britain. Lewis, a layman of the Church of England, conveys issues debated by the greatest scholars and minds for centuries in a way simple enough to be understood by a young student. The quantity and quality of illustrations alone make the book worthwhile. The genius imagination of C.S. Lewis beautifully reduces difficult thoughts down to simple illustrations.Lewis begins with topics relating to all people everywhere such as morality, the conscience, and the ideas of evolution and creationism. Primarily using anecdotal evidence, Lewis logically progresses the reader from the belief in the existence of a god to belief in the God of the Bible. Christian topics like forgiveness, hope, faith, and the Trinity are addressed at the end of the book.The book&#65533;s goal is to present only the core and central Christian doctrines, what Lewis calls &#65533;mere&#65533; Christianity. As a result, issues relating to denominational division in the Christian church are intentionally omitted. In my opinion, however, many of the topics ignored in order to reach this mutual &#65533;mere Christianity&#65533; are far too important to be overlooked. I also believe Lewis should have used more quotations from the Bible to support his arguments.Lewis presents the Christian perspective in a book aimed at the skeptic, the atheist, and the fellow Christian. Mere Christianity caused me to re-evaluate the beliefs I hold and the way they are applied to my life."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is by far the best book that I have ever read.

It also really expanded my views of God and His relationship with us. Everything that is mentioned is expanded on what you already know and from you learn from what you have read in this book.It really challenges your brain and helps you to know what you believe but also why."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I had heard a lot about this book from Christian radio and other sources and heard CS Lewis quoted on a number of different occasions so I was very interested in this book. It does not disappoint. The author simply explains what he believes is common among Christian beliefs. I find no argument with him there.I also found the dated nature of some of his examples quite interesting. The most memorable example or analogy Lewis uses is to explain what he means by Go being &quot;outside of time&quot;. I had heard of this before and the more I think of it the more sense it makes to me.I recommend this book to anyone. Lewis does not preach he simply states this is what is believed and why. Take it or leave it. Of course part of the why is what the consequences of not accepting are but he portrays this in a very straight forward manner."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is really one of the best Christians books of all time. The intention of Jack was to write about Christianity taking out the typical religious sting. This is not a small fit given the exclusive nature of religion. And Jack achieves his task marvelously.When Jack writes is like an old loved friend explaining to us things that until this moment where elusive to our understanding. He led us in a journey describing the enchanting building of Christianity and leave us marveled at the splendor of our discovery. This is a MUST have for any library (buy it hard copy, when you read it you will know why)."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This was the first C.S. Lewis book I read and I became one of his fans after only a few chapters. He begins with basic human nature and then expands to more specific Christian beliefs. He doesn't go into denominational doctrines, hence the title, but explains a basic overview of the what's &amp; why's of Christianity.

Lewis shows that Christianity is not about endless doctrinal debates within hundreds of denominations. Quite on the contrary, it unites all its believers round the world into one community, distinguished from the rest by a uniform radical stance towards humanity and God.

This is a great apology for the Christian Faith. I found the philosophical reasoning C.S. Lewis uses throughout the novel intellectually stimulating. However, if I did not concentrate on what I was reading, I soon found myself completely lost. This novel was written on a much deeper level than most novels I read. Having previousily read the Chronicles of Narnia, I knew Lewis was a great author, but I did not know philosophical he was.Some of the highlights of Mere Christianity from my perspective. I enjoyed his description of the trinity. I had always been told, \\"We don't understand it, but God is three yet one.\\" Lewis offered an explanation with more substance than I had been told before. I found his thoughts on Heaven and what we can expect to find there interesting. Two other topics in the novel stick out in my mind. First, is the problem of pride and how detrimental it can be in the Christian's life. Second, is the continual growth and improvement of the Christian during this life.I highly recommend this novel. In fact, I recommend buying more than one copy since I have already given my first copy away to a friend."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is one of the best apologetics book out there.

A great buy!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"It took me a few tries to get past the first couple of chapters in this book--see, I already believe in Christ and the first few chapters seem to address concerns for non-Christians. I almost gave up on it, but I'm really glad I didn't. Once I got into it, it really made sense and came to occupy a place close to my heart. C.S. Lewis' perspective really brought together much of what I believed, but was unable to but into thought or phrase (this is probably why he's a writer, and not me). It filled in a lot of gaps in my faith, and now it's one of my all-time favorite books of any genre ever. It's not just a good read, it can save your life--it did mine. I can't recommend it highly enough for you if you're a Christian, as well as a gift for people on the fence."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Never part from the Bible, of course, but if you want insights from a brilliant mind on practical Christian living, look no further. This book has relevance to every Christian and deserves a place on any believer's shelf."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I enjoyed the logic of this book, the wonderful metaphors C.S. Lewis used to describe his points about the divinity of Christ, the relationship between Father and Son, of God to man, and people to each other. Pithy but not witty, this book includes several quotes that will forever be a part of my reperatoire: \\"Really great moral teachers never do introduce new moarlities: it is quacks and cranks who do that\\" (p. 82); \\"A moderately bad man knows he is not very good: a thoroughly bad man thinks he is all right\\" (p. 93); and \\"The sense in which a Christian leaves it to God is that he puts all his trust in Christ: trusts that Christ will somehow share with him the perfect human obedience which he carried out from His birth to His crucifixion: that Christ will make the man more like Himself, and in a sense, make good his deficiencies\\" (p. 147). This will definitely be a staple on my religious book shelf. I'm glad my friend bought it for me for Christmas, and I am sorry it took me this long to get around to it!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"&quot;Mere Christianity&quot; by C.S Lewis is an erudite, cogent view of Christianity. Skeptics will appreciate Lewis' willingness to look at the harder questions of the Christian God, while true believers will gain confidence as they see the logic of God presented sensibly and pursuaively.Not to be compared with Augustine, or any of the church fathers, Lewis does bring a modern, yet classical examination of what Christianity is and why it is reasonable to believe. He doesn't get caught up in anything but the core and substantive matters of the faith. Lewis is eloquent here in his clarity.For an entertaining and insightful expose of human sin, read his &quot;Screwtape Letters.&quot;I fully recommend &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; by C.S. Lewis.Anthony Trendl"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"... The fact that so many people see this book as truth or nonsense can state one fact:Somebody (atheist or christian) is right, and somebody is wrong. There is nothing else. This simple experiment proves a great divorce between the two beliefs. There is either no God in the form of the Trinity and this book is \\"gobble\\", or it is right and there is a God of love but love with justice (for there is no love without justice or pain).

The Screwtape Letter is opening my mind to alot of new things."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I'm not a big fan of debate on the reality of Christianity but it would be interesting to listen to Lewis and any atheist speak about such matters. This book is a very impressive reflection of Lewis' thinking. The book starts out in assertion to why Christianity is the only logical reality. Lewis talks about topics like the conscience and why it is inevitable to conclude that there is a God through this. After this stage of the book Lewis continues to speak of Christian living matters. He delves into the each topic and brings revealing insight with very helpful parables. As an example: Lewis writes on pride, anger, love, and other topics. Each topic is brought up with deep though of the reality of what these things are and what they mean. Lewis shows his genius in this book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis was BRILLIANT and so humble in his writings. His position truly comes from the self-imposed, most humble vantage point of an \\"every day Joe\\" and not of the clergyman or schooled theologian giving his point-of-view on Christian thought and practice. This is a quick and easy read even though the concepts can lead you into aspects bigger than life. He makes the non-Christian think about what they truly believe and the Christian ALSO think about what they truly believe...giving both groups new insights they can learn from no matter what your background or religious belief.The chapters within the book were once a series of radio broadcasts during the World War in 1943. Lewis's poignant words and descriptive analogies bring Christianity to life, making his ideas 3-dimensional and easy to grasp.I would highly recommend this book to the serious student of Christianity AND to the non-believer who is curious about what makes a Christian tick! :)"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis would be a person I wouldn't want to debate. The way he thinks things through and articulates them in this book are very impressive. He does it in such a way as to make you think \\"Why didn't I think of that? It was so simple\\".If you are not wowed by reading this book, then I would say you don't know how to read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I am impressed with Lewis' ability to articulate Christianity as a mere lay person. As a Chinese with Taoist's understanding of the world and way of thought processing, I find his arguments highly acceptable.I also enjoy different opinions, so I read the negative reviews. To my disappointment, all those argued that Lewis' was illogical proved themselve illogical with their own words. Some are even rude, which proves their own stupidity.Yes, the Truth, the Tao, The Way, the Christ, is fuzzy, &quot;revealed and hidden at the same time.&quot; It is even more difficult for the linear thinkers (black-or-white thinkers) to grasp it, because it is grey. Only a few people in each generation are gifted with articulating this Truth with such a high level of clarity. C. S. Lewis is one of them in Mere Christianity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"In case there was any question C.S. Lewis proves in Mere Christianity that he is one of the greatest theological thinkers of the 20th century. If the Case for Christ left you wanting more then this is where to go.Every great sermon should include at least one quote from this book. If it's not on your bookshelf then you're missing out."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"&quot;Mere Christianity&quot; is a great book for those who want to know why people believe in the Christian faith. It is also a great book to remind believers (who may have strayed, or been burned out by big churches and confused denominations) why they believed, and why they should still believe. This book is simple to read, but it's message is not simplistic. It calls us to either believe totally, or to choose not to believe... either way, get off the fence and practice what you say you believe, because there is no middle ground."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have just finished re-reading this short, powerful book, which was first given to me by my father on my 18th birthday. At the time, it struck me as eminently logical, extraordinarily well written, and a more powerful nudge toward Christianity than all my prior religious education.

It will be less than thirty years before I read it again."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Absolutely the most clear and methodical proof for Christianity I have ever come across. A truly brilliant book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"As C.S. Lewis prefaces Mere Christianity, he explains that the work started out as radio broadcasts he later wrote down - scribing them as though he were speaking them out loud. This is a valuable piece to Lewis' structure of the book and an insight to the flow of his work. I had read the book once before finding it difficult to follow and needing to re-read the bulk of it. More recently, I listened to the audio book while following along in the printed copy. I have found this to be tremendously clearer and recommend the method.Lewis leads the reader along with him as he constructs Christianity; reminding me of Jesus' parable of the wise builder in Matthew 7:24-27: building it as though it were a house. The foundation is first laid of human nature and our relationship to the law. He builds on top that our relationship to our creator and then to each other. All the while, Lewis draws comparisons between our other options: if we are to think of ourselves as the judge of \\"good\\" or if we choose not to accept our creator as God etc., and brings about logic and reason. Having come from an atheist view and later choosing to follow Christ, Lewis brings about some hard truths which may come off as offensive, but for good reason.\\"I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: \`I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept His claim to be God.' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic- on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg- or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.\\"He speaks out of the lies we are told regarding sex, the worth-while risk God has taken on us for the sake of free will, and his opposition to imposing Christian morals on the rest of mankind. He finishes it up in the last section by talking about doctrine and reinforcing the \\"how\\"s and \\"why\\"s of Christianity. Within this book I have found some very meaty bits and amazing quotes which I had to refrain from plastering all over this post. You can most definitely google them or just read the work. Okay, there is one more that I feel is foundational and much on the contrary to the popular misconception of why Christians tend to resemble their Christ:\\"That is why the Christian is in a different position from other people who are trying to be good. They hope, by being good, to please God if there is one; or- if they think there is not- at least they hope to deserve approval from good men. But the Christian thinks any good he does comes from the Christ-life inside him. He does not think God will love us because we are good, but that God will make us good because He loves us; just as the roof of a greenhouse does not attract the sun because it is bright, but becomes bright because the sun shines on it.\\"I enjoyed this book a great deal and recommend it to anyone trying to figure out what following Christ is all about - whether from a following perspective or a more inquisitive perspective looking in.

This one is no exception even if it is leaner than most and touted as \\"signature classics.\\" Though it appears to be satisfactorily produced, with reasonable, though not fine, quality rag paper, and a decent readable font, I'm not happy with its large size, which resembles more of an atlas or coffee table book one would normally expect from a book on photography or art.It's just not the sort of book one would take from the shelf to a coffee shop for a read or feel comfortable in penciling and underlining. Nor am I particularly impressed with its silver-toned spine, something designed to please those whose tastes run to red carpets and velvet paintings of Elvis and chrome-edged dinette sets. Alas, I should have checked out this book more closely before I made my purchase. In any case, all is not lost.

Lewis ever claiming (himself) to be a theologian, nor do I recall him ever writing that Mere Christianity was designed to create faith in others.Different dictionaries will of course vary on the exact wording, but apologetics is essentially the DEFENSE of faith. The word defense is chosen because apologetics is not designed to instill faith nor to create faith. Reading Mere Christianity as an atheist is unlikely to change your mind (though I daresay it isn't impossible.) I've generally found that reading any book is unlikely to change your mind. Rather, reading helps you clarify your own thoughts, so the atheist is likely remain an atheist while the Christian is likely to remain a Christian.Where Mere Christianity shines is not so much in refuting or arguing AGAINST the atheist's point of view as it does in explaining and arguing FOR the Christian's point of view. While Mere Christianity is unlikely to create faith in you, it will help you tremendously in explaining your own faith to you. The presupposition, of course, is that you are entering with a faith to begin with.Naysayer's aside, if you are looking for an introduction to Christian theology, Mere Christianity still remains as the seminal work to begin with.

I loved his writing style and was impressed with his intellect and decided to read \`Mere Christianity' based on the recommendations of several friends from various Christian religions. I found it to be a very wonderful and thought provoking book.I was most impressed with CS Lewis' views on what man/woman may become. In the last paragraph of Chapter 9 he says, \\"The command Be ye perfect is not idealistic gas. Nor is it a command to do the impossible. He is going to make us into creatures that can obey that command. He said (in the Bible) that we were \`gods' and He is going to make good His words. If we let Him--for we can prevent Him, if we choose--He will make the feeblest and filthiest of us into a god or goddess, dazzling, radiant, immortal creature, pulsating all through with such energy and joy and wisdom and love as we cannot now imagine, a bright stainless mirror which reflects back to God perfectly (though, of course, on a smaller scale) His own boundless power and delight and goodness. The process will be long and in parts very painful; but that is what we are in for. Nothing less. He meant what He said.\\"I also liked the way he put the personal attention and healing Christ gives to us by saying, \\"[God] has infinite attention to spare for each one of us. He does not have to deal with us in the mass. You are as much alone with Him as if you were the only being He had ever created. When Christ died, He died for you individually just as much as if you had been the only man in the world\\".I do not agree with everything CS Lewis says, but what he says, he states very well, in clear, powerful language. I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to understand this beautiful vision of Christianity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"After reading this book, I consider myself an absolute fan of C.S. Lewis. I was a little skeptical about this book, thinking it would be dry and \\"religious\\", but it definitely surprised me. The author starts out with a look at the human condition, and the existence of 'right' and 'wrong', and goes further to say that certain things about this point to there being a creator. That's just one little part of the book. He goes into lots of other things that will definitely make you think about how you approach God. It's written in a very conversational tone (actually, it's transcribed radio broadcasts from WWII times in Great Britain), so it is very accessible. Be prepared to take notes, though, as you read it."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis has a wonderful talent for explaining Christianity in simple, clear terms. Example: \\"You don't have a soul. You are a soul. You have a body.\\" Here was a very intelligent man who was agnostic until late in life, so he struggled with all of the questions of faith in his own walk. Finally, like the Apostle Paul, he became one of Christianity's greatest proponents. This book relates the conclusions of his personal journey to faith. I highly recommend this book to all Christians and especially to all persons who have doubts about Jesus Christ and the role he should have in their lives."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I read this book with low expectations (I am a bit of a science geek), but was blown away by what I read. C.S. Lewis describes the fundamentals of Christian faith in a clear and concise way. But don't think it will be boring either. It's reasonable and it's fascinating.The book starts by describing what he calls the \\"moral law\\", before going on to talk about particularly Christian beliefs and behaviour. He does this in a way that avoids divisions, which is very refreshing. This book is important for people of any belief to know about what Christians believe - regardless of if they believe it themselves.I don't normally write reviews, but \\"Mere Christianity\\" is so good that I feel compelled to. I was constantly underlining the best bits with real urgency. If you're even slightly interested then I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Any person, young or old who has the faintest interest in Christianity should read this book. I first read it at least 10 years ago, while serving in the U.S. Army. It is one of those books that you find yourself thinking about for weeks after you've read it. If you're curious, if you're just interested in the classics of religious literature, buy this book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"MOST COMPELLING BOOK ON THE SUBJECT I HAVE EVER READ. I HAVE GIVEN MANY COPIES TO AN ASSORTMENT OF FRIENDS AND I HAVE NEVER HAD ONE THAT DID NOT SAY, AFTER READING,........THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Well worth the investment! I had a paperback copy of Screwtape, but I wanted the rest of these books too. The book itself is very nice, and the index is great for writing talks. A lot of the General Authorities cite C.S. Lewis, so I wanted to be able to read at least these six. I highly recommend as a supplement to scripture study."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis has got to be one of the best Christian books ever written. I read it one chapter a night in devotional style. I don't think I could have read more than that at a time and truly digested the awesome message Lewis packs into each chapter. This book not only defends Christianity, it also explains, as best it can, some of the mysteries of the faith that may put people off. Questions about the trinity, the beginning of the universe, begot, and so many other things, Lewis handles carefully and humbly. He admits that he may not always have it exactly right, but his straightforward manner of speaking is delightful to read and easy to understand. I can't begin to state all of what I learned while reading this book. Read it, buy it for your friends, leave it on the subway or bus for others to find: this is one of those few books that could truly change the world."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"\\"Mere Christianity\\" is undeniable. Lewis' infallible arguments and persuasive words will teach anyone and everyone. C.S. Lewis takes you step by step, argument by argument, logic by logic into Spiritual truths that, although you may have known, you'll now see in a new light. Truly, this book has changed my walk and my thought.Lewis' logic is food for thought and replenishment for the mind. Inside this awesome book you'll find the logic behind our existance, the truth about \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\", the definition of morality, how Christianity compares to other major world religions and so much, much more. Truly, C.S. Lewis is pivotal in modern Christian thinking... this book is merely the proof.This book is a must have for any new-Christian, anyone wanting to be a better Christian or anyone looking for logic in Christianity.\\"I believe in Christianity in the same way I believe in the sun; not because I can see it, but because, by it, I can see everything.\\"-- C.S. Lewis"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I was an atheist who wanted to know how intelligent people (like Lewis) could believe. Lewis' Mere Christianity is at once elegant and simple, a foundation for a rational belief in God that does not require acceptance of any particular religion -- thus, one can progress in any direction from its premises. It has the additional advantage of being divided into short, highly readable chapters so that the reader can spend fifteen minutes before bedtime digesting the ideas in each chapter at an unhurried pace. Lewis' ability to capture absolutely stunning concepts through everyday analogies really helps someone not trained in reading philosophy to follow his arguments."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Whereas I LOVE C. S. Lewis, and you simply can't go wrong by getting anything written by him, I was a little dissapointed by the size of this book. I suppose it's really meant to be a coffee-table book, so it's not easy to handle, and is probably too tall for most book shelves. Check the dimensions before purchasing! But besides that, the content is GREAT, and I was delighted to find such a good price for seven books at once!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Lewis was no doubt a gifted writer and a man of strong religious conviction. As a lapsed Catholic of fifteen years, I am only recently beginning to rediscover my own connection to my faith. The Pastor at the Episcopal church I am attending (I am done with the Roman Catholic church, but there is something comforting to me about the structure of the Episcopal service) recommended this to me.I read it in a couple of days, and I did enjoy it, though it had a few jarring moments: some owing to some of the more antiquated social notions (mentioned in other reviews) and others having to do with the fact that someone born in a far away land with no knowledge of Jesus Christ could never be saved. Spiritually, intellectually, morally, I just can't buy that Christianity is the way, the only way for everyone.It certainly is for me, but I think it's somewhat patronizing and ignorant to view that whole world through that kind of lens. Buddhism, Hindu, Islam, Judaism, all devout practitioners seek truth in their own way, and it would be wrong-headed to presuppose the superiority of one over all the other (leaving aside for a moment the interpretations in some of these faiths that call for subjugation of women, etc.).I did like the civil war metaphor, however, which I thought quite apt, and his rejection of the warm and fuzzy God, or as he called it \\"Christianity and Water\\" which gave me a good chuckle.Otherwise, my larger problem with this book was that the book comes across as philosophy lite. I think Lewis covers the bases of the faith adequately and in an approachable way, but he concocts syllogisms and metaphors in a way that is just not sufficiently rigorous for me from a forensic or philosophical perspective. There's some circularity, some GIANT hypotheses that he treats too casually as truths, and some chilidishly simplistic allegories.As a student of philosphy (M.A. not Ph.D. unfortunately), I found this to be profoundly frustrating. I was waiting for the core of the argument (a la Aquinas, More, Descartes, Kant, etc) and it never really comes.Having said all this, I did enjoy it, and it does encapsulate the major points very well. I just wish it could have had the same lighthearted tone but espoused a more sophisticated approach. Faith affirming, yes, in a way... but not the be all end all."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Lewis delivers complex Christian concepts distilled to intellectionally rich bite-sized and digestable pieces...give yourself time to absorb it. I had to read it while in a quiet place. It is an ideal book for the intellect who cant see her/his way clear to Christianity. This is a perfect intellectual \\"seekers\\" book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The book is excellent. It is about the basics of Chrisitanity and not at all about confusing Doctrines. It is a short read and I highly suggest it."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis explores the common beliefs of all Christian denominations by appealing to his readers logic. Beginning with observations about human nature, he builds a case for the existance of a higher power, that higher power being like the Christian view of God, and how Christianity fulfils the expectations of such a god. He searches into many of the questions that humanity has grappled with for all of time: the existance of God and an explanation of sin and evil, and also discusses the mystery of the Trinity and human redemption through Christ. Any one who reads this book will walk away at least realizing how much time and energy must be devoted to religious questioning."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have always enjoyed the writings of C.S. Lewis and had not read this book. I was eager to see how as an atheist, he had converted to Christianity and his eagerness to spread the gospel as he now is a follower of Jesus. I purchased this on my Kindle very economically."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I recently read C.S. Lewis's Mere Christianity -- a diversion from my usual reading -- suggested by a doctor while she stitched my sliced hand. I found it an eloquent and accessible discussion, very much in the British style."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"\\"Generic Christianity\\" may have been the title if Lewis had written this in our day, because that is apparently what he was aiming at. He does an outstanding job of explaining why this thing we call Christianity is so essential to understand, and so explanatory of what human beings experience. Though his explanation of the nature of God is apparently motivated by his understanding of the religious creeds popular in his day (which were, as his explanation is, unreasonable, unscriptural, and unhelpful), his understanding and explanation of human behaviors and interactions are remarkable in their truthfulness. Especially appropriate for our day is the chapter on sexual morality, the problems of which have obviously not changed since his day. Outstanding book... I shall re-read and refer to it often!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I was raised in the Christian faith. As an older teen and young adult I turned away from that faith as \\"irrelevant\\" and \\"too restrictive\\". At age 26 I realized that I had dismissed Christianity without looking at the facts; I'd made the move based on my feelings. As part of my search that year I read Mere Christianity.Mere Christianity gave me permission to approach Christianity on an intellectual level before taking a step of faith. That was new to me. Is C. S. Lewis right about everything he says in this book? Probably not. But he informed my thinking and approach to life through this book in a way that no other book had.A classic book insists that the reader think. A classic book moves beyond the time and culture in which it is written. A classic book informs us about the human condition. This is a classic book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Much has been written of C.S. Lewis' classic work Mere Christianity because of the wide influence it has had in the past 60 years. Mere Christianity is not only a lucid Christian apologetic, but it is the articulated philosophical process by which C.S. Lewis, originally an atheist, came to find Christianity a reasonable doctrine to live by. To be sure, his conversion was not simply a matter of syllogism applied to religion; Lewis is forthright in acknowledging and even embracing the mystery, and at times, the not insignificant confusion that can accompany the acceptance of Christ as Savior. One of Lewis' purposes--rare among popular Christian writers--is to provide a framework of belief that allows a Christian to express their faith in a manner that is intelligible and reasonable to non-believers. Relying, as Christ did, on the power of metaphor and parable, Lewis is able to provide insight into Christian principles in manner that is at once accessible and profound.One of the major contributions of Mere Christianity is the argument of the Moral Law. Lewis draws upon a universal set of principles of right & wrong and relates them to the existence of a high power. Lewis loosely defines the \\"moral law\\" as a set of moral principles which are universal across culture, time, and geography. By emphasizing the contrast between human moral goals--for peace, altruism, etc.--with the survival-dominated behavior paradigms in the natural kingdom, Lewis argues that a universal moral law---even one that is at times flagrantly disobeyed---is evidence of a loving God.Lewis is careful to point out that we have moral goals that often amount to nothing more than aspirations. Yet, these aspirations form a powerful framework for action since the moral law provides a universal set of expectations about right & wrong. The universal expectations are true regardless of philosophy or belief in God. For example, a person may believe that all morality is relative. However, if that same person were robbed, they would strenuously object and would seek justice through some law-enforcing institution. Thus our actions and thoughts may not always reflect the hopes of the moral law, but we carry the law with us in all of our interactions and have real expectations of behavior from our fellow man.It is important to note that recent scholarship in evolutionary biology has begun to explore natural reasons for phenomenon such as altruism and self-sacrifice. This scholarship provides, at the very least, a plausible explanation for the moral law that does not rely on the existence of God. While research continues in this area, Scientists such as Francis Collins (atheist convert to Christianity, leader of the Human Genome Project, and author of Language of God) have developed frameworks of belief which do not set evolution and faith in God at odds with each other. In Collins' framework, evolution is simply the means by which God created (and continues to create) life. Similarly, Lewis is comfortable with evolution as a tool of God. This may surprise many conservative Christians who draw so heavily on his articulation of the Christian faith. But this is what makes Lewis' work so powerful. We see a passionate believer who embodies a faith that is not threatened by advances in scientific understanding even while refusing to compromise the moral and spiritual imperatives of Christianity.Mere Christianity is by now a classic work in the Christian anthology. Its power is in Lewis' ability to connect with the reader without pandering. Its durability is in its reasonableness. Its attractiveness is in its commitment to raw faith in Christ. As such, Lewis' treatise is recommended for both Christians and non-Christians alike for the purpose of introspection, interaction, and exploration. Current debates within Christian circles and between believers and non-believers could benefit from Lewis' unique ability to explain the Christian faith as a vibrant, flexible but demanding discipline upon which we can place all of our hopes."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"As a professor of apologetics and theology, I have made this book mandatory reading. It is my firm belief that EVERY Christian MUST read this book! I won't offer an apologia of Lewis' work here in this review; however, I do challenge you to read and find out for yourself what a wonderful work this is. If you are one of those who have always said to yourself, \\"I need to read that book sometime\\", then let today be the day that you start! Christians beware though! This book will knock you down and challenge you. It is the definitive work when it comes to apologetics and Christian philosophy. You will have to read this over and over many times BUT it will be worth it and God will be honored as a result by your strengthened faith.I also recommend: Intellectuals Don't Need God and Other Modern Mythsby Alister E. McGrath. This work is an excellent companion to Mere Christianity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is probably my favorite book on Christianity of all time. Lewis is so intellectual and logical in his writing. In this book, his reasoning and explanations are spot on, and it will strengthen one's faith enormously considerably. His illustrations are profound yet simple and poignant. Excellent read!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I'm not a student on the writings of C.S. Lewis, but I have found in even brief introductions to some of his work an appeal that I readily understand as the reason for his popularity. From reading Mere Christianity I was struck by his ability to clearly articulate the basic principles of the Christian faith, without delving into the doctrinal disputes arising between different denominations or succumbing to the language of theologians. His writings, while some may call simplistic in their style and their analysis, are anything but in reality. What I mean by this is that Lewis has a profound way of analogizing certain principles associated with both the obvious and the deeper aspects of the faith with the more mundane realities of day to day life and etc.I think you can have your disagreements with some of Lewis's arguments, but he certainly does hit a cord. I'm not going to get into the aspects of the faith that he discusses, I think everyone will confront those with his/her own experiences and background in mind. This book will appeal to the practicing Christian and those who have drifted away from active church attendance and so forth. Perhaps this is a good primer for those who are not familiar with the basic tenants of Christianity and would like an introduction. It seems to be written for that audience. Once again, I think everybody will have a different approach in deciding to read this book and what they take out of it.Lewis clearly believed that what he was trying to show was the broader, more uniformly shared beliefs common (or should be) to all denominations whether they be Methodist, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, Anglican (as in his case) and so forth. For those of us who have doubted and drifted away, I think there are some helpful reminders and reassurances in this book, but also some hard lessons that are not comfortable to think about. A must read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book has led more to Jesus than we will ever know, it led me to the Lord years ago, I purchase them to give as gifts from our Ministry"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Review of Audiobook:Mere Christianity should be a staple in every believers library.

Lewis proves the case for Jesus Christ need to come to earth in none churchy terminology. It shows part of his journey as an Oxford agnostic to a follower of the Lord Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Unfortunately, I cannot write a review as eloquent as this book deserves. What I can say is this:As a young man, churches in this country (I shan't name names...) turned me from faith and aided in my becoming an angry young man through their capacity for hate, their towering self-righteousness, and their incredible, tenacious, and willfull embrace of ignorance. I scorned faith as the refuge and virtue of the ignorant and hateful, and in Lewis's own words, was paradoxically \\"quiet angry at God for not existing.\\" Time and experience and God have thankfully done their work and brought me to a point in life where I could be receptive to a work like \\"Mere Christianity\\". This book helped me make sense of a good deal of my lingering doubts, and brought me back to Faith and God. That, perhaps, is the highest praise I can give it.Perhaps you won't agree with every word Mr. Lewis says herein...and that's okay, he expects that. He is only human, and he knows that this book is but one mortal's attempt to convey Christianity. It's a beautiful attempt though; it is not Christianity for a person who likes a loud and angry faith...it is Christianity for any thinking person who has ever looked out at the vastness of Creation and wondered at its beauty and majesty, and wondered where a mote such as they fit in. Wondered about a God who could possibly love them.Mr. Lewis does his best to introduce you to that God."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis is a well known author for many reasons, and for many books. My very favorite of his books is \\"Mere Christianity\\" which can be read by both branches of Christianity.....Protestant, and Catholic alike, and enjoyed by those who are new to this religion. The explanations given are just as valid today, as when C. S. Lewis wrote them way back when! I highly recomend this book to the new Christian, and to the old one alike. This book is both inspiring and captivating!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is astounding.I believe at least the first third of this book should be taught on every high school and college campus.In this first part of the book, Lewis calmly and cheerfully leads the reader methodically and logicallyto the idea that, contrary to the popular opinion, there IS absolute truth, and that we all intuitively adhere to it. He shows us that it comes from outside ourselves, and that it must come from a Creator.He eventually goes on to prove that this Creator is Jesus Christ.Anyone who wants to deny that there is a God, must in good conscience, filter their beliefs through this book.I promise you, their beliefs cannot make it the whole way through, if they are insisting on an honest search.I believe every believing parent and teacher needs to get this in the hands of every young person thatthey can, before secular education gets ahold of them, and tries to tell them that all truth isrelative.The Bible is the cornerstone of my life, and Mere Christianity is one of the very few books that areon the highest level of necessity after it."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I bought three copies of this just so I could give it away to other people. It's life changing and brings great understanding to what Christianity is all about. The best part is that Christians and non-Christians alike can enjoy and learn from what CS Lewis has to say. HIGHLY recommend!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I read this book every year and see something new in it everytime. It's not necessarily a light read, but it is a must read for all Christians or people curious about the Christian faith. I love this book. Lewis is such a talented writer. I haven't read a book of his I didn't like. Next is the Screwtape Letters."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"It's hard to believe that I've had this book sitting on my bookshelf for nearly six years. Had I known what I was missing I would have picked it up sooner. But as we Christians know, it's all in Gods' perfect timing. I may very well have not been ready for it six years ago.This may be a small book in terms pages but it is packed full of wisdom. I often had to reread a sentence and even paragraph before I was able to grasp what the author was trying to convey but it was well worth it.MERE CHRISTIANITY is for all believers no matter where they are at their walk with Christ, as well as for seekers. All who read this amazing book will walk away a better person for it. At least I would hope they would. A great tool for all Christians.As a lover of music, I loved what C.S. Lewis said in chapter ten, titled HOPE:\\"All scriptural imagery (harps, crowns, gold, etc.) is, of course, a merely symbolical attempt to express the inexpressible. Musical instruments are mentioned because for many people (not all) music is the thing known in the present life which most strongly suggest ecstasy and infinity.\\"Music is a huge part of my soul, who I am. To read of it in scripture and know Gods' intentions in regards to it goes way beyond words."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"One of the top Christian books on apologetics ever written.

If you're not, you may very well be after reading this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Book was for my 16 year old granddaughter. She was very pleased with it and me for sending it to her."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"If you want a book that dips deep into christianity, analyzing its truths from a very rational, interesting and entertaining perspective, and at the time instructing you, by immaginative examples, on Christian faith, go for this book.C.S. Lewis, was teacher of literature in Oxford and Cambridge. He was atheist and before his conversion he constantly tried to prove Christianity was wrong. On his way of doing so, he found himself to be wrong. This book presents some of the logical and rational proofs that led him, (and me) to consider Christianity seriously.I recommend this book for begginers, skeptics, and those whose mind gets in the way to struggle with their faith. If you're a Christian already, don't mind, this is quite entertaining apologetic thinking."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is the best antidote for Relativism that I know. Lewis takes the belief that most of us think we should be treated fairly, that is we have a &quot;Right&quot; to be treated fairly, to the assertion that a law exists beyond ourselves. Of course if you don't believe we have a &quot;Right&quot; to be treated fairly then you are off the hook. Otherwise you are forced into the next question; &quot;Where did this law come from?&quot; Then again each step along the way you can get off Lewis' bus, but not without cost. Ultimately Lewis leaves one with two honest alternatives; a Supreme Being or Nietzsche's Will to Power. He then gives Christianity as a viable expression of the Supreme Being option. Even those that do not buy Lewis' argument will enjoy his clear, highly approachable and methodical reasoning."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I was raised in a Christian family and attended Sunday School faithfully all through my childhood; but until I read Mere Christianity, I never really understood my relationship with God -- and His with me. Back in college, in '73, I borrowed some books from a friend and she slipped it in, saying, &quot;You might enjoy this, too.&quot; Well, by the time I finished it, Christ -- the living Lord -- became so real to me, I asked Him to forgive me and lead me. Now, 25 years later, I still reread this book several times each year! Sometimes the Bible is hard for newcomers to get into so, I take a paperback copy of it with me on airline flights, and leave one in the seatback pocket, inscribed, &quot;A friend left me here for you!&quot; That's because it meant so much to me, and I believe it is the best explanation of Christianity ever written. You might want to invest in spreading the Word this way, too!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is a gem!And for the atheist who didn't agree with C.S.Lewis, of course there is a moral law! Without one there would be far more criminals today! Can you honestly say that not once when you did something wrong you didn't feel a pang of guilt? Where did that pang come from? We all have a moral law, otherwise we could do anything without the least bit of regret, remorse, or guilt!And I disagree with you when you say \\"atheist\\". An atheist is an individual who believes there is no God. Just in saying you are an atheist you are admitting that there is NO SUCH THING. Everyone has a God, whether it be money, power, the One True God, but most likely yourself. I pray that you will find the Truth soon."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have read this book four times. It is the apologetic book out there.

This is THE book that EVERY person should read.Also recommended: Buried Alive by Jacob Jenkins"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is the best book to read for Christians who need to articulate to themselves and to others why they believe what they believe. It is also a wonderful choice for a non-Christian who wonders why people opt for Christianity in this ocean of many religions. Lewis articulates the uniqueness of Christianity, against the backdrop of natural law and other arguments that can be made from a non-Christian frame of reference.He puts a lot of the 'mysteries' of the faith in great perspective, and helps his reader to personally understand and reconcile what the human mind sees as 'contradictions' in the faith (for example, God being merciful and yet being a just judge who punishes sin; why God gives us free will and yet sends His Son, etc etc.)Highly, highly recommended. A definite must-read."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book can change your life. I am a lifelong Christian who recently reread this, and it blew me away yet again. I firmly believe this (and probably most if not all of his other writings) was divinely inspired. For anyone on the fence regarding Christianity, this book should serve to convince you that God is real, Jesus was real, and the only logical conclusion to draw is that Christianity is the only real religion. For those of you who already believe, C.S. Lewis will only reinforce your beliefs and maybe show you a different perspective of the same truths you already hold, as well as serve to enlighten. There are way too many examples to mention, but suffice it to say that everyone should read this book! It's a classic, to say the very least."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"\\"Mere Christianity\\" proves why CS Lewis was (and still is) one of Christianity's great apologists since biblical times (Jesus, Paul, Peter, etc.). While the book is only around 190 pages and is small, do not let the size fool you!At times I had to reread what Lewis was saying to understand the gist of his thought. Admittingly, some of the content was over my head and required me to think more about what I was reading. However, I much prefer this to the \\"feel good\\" book titles that populate bookstore shelves today. I will need to read this book again in the future to get a better handle on it.The book consists of 4 main areas:1. Right and Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of the Universe - here Lewis briefly goes over his previous atheism and explains why there has to be a Creator.2. What Christians Believe - Lewis explains repentence, sin, good vs. evil, and other basics of the faith.3. Christian Behavior - hope, faith, charity, forgiveness, marriage, and other areas of appropriate Christian behavior are covered here.4. Beyond Personality: Or First Steps in the Doctrine of the Trinity - describing that the Christian life is a difficult and challenging road to travel (even with Jesus) and other doctrines are mentioned here.Be warned: If you are looking for a feel-good easy read, then this is not the title for you. If you want to read something that will challenge you to think, then by all means read this!!!Recommended."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I was given \`Mere Christianity' by C.S Lewis, as a High School Graduation gift from my Pastor Joseph. At first I was thinking that this was a subtle hint telling me I needed more Christian guidance in my life, and this is where Joseph thought I could find it. I figured I'd never read the book and it would sit on my shelf and collect dust. When we were given the opportunity to read a book for one of my classes I decided to humor Joseph and read \`Mere Christianity.\\" One would think that this book's intent was to reprimand those lacking Christian religion, but it shines a light on Christianity in such a way that only Lewis can explain.C.S Lewis stunned me with his refreshing and insightful approach on a changing religion in a modern world. He uses his creative imagination in an ingenious way to help the reader understand God, His meaning, and the Christian religion. Lewis urges us to take a look at the world around us, ourselves, and how they relate to the Christian beliefs and God, in a way that makes us want to change the realities of the World and become a better Christian, at the same time. Lewis does anything but reprimand Christians; instead he gives us his intuitive perspectives on the uncertainties of God and the Bible, in a comprehensive approach. I would recommend this book to those lacking the Christian religion, the common Christian, the strict Christian and those who feel lost in this relentless world. It provides comfort, a new perspective and insight for all Christians.After reading this book I have a new found sense of faith and understanding. I now approach the Christian religion with hopefulness and enthusiasm and have discovered a profound sense of religion. I hope that each one of you will take my advice and read \`Mere Christianity' and I hope that you find it as enriching and fulfilling as I did."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"In this book, C.S. Lewis gives his defense of Christianity as a religion, a philosophy, and a way of life. Primarily, Lewis argues from morality, citing basic morals that all humans share as virtues. But Lewis isn't like the hundreds of Christian apologists that author thousands of books on the market. Lewis doesn't rely on circular reasoning or emotion to prove his points. Instead, 'Mere Christianity' sets forth an argument that is logical, easy enough to understand, and in accordance with the beliefs that the vast majority of Christians share.I don't think I could describe the content of this book anymore for fear of reducing it to one argument or a handful of points. This is a broad, sweeping book that takes the reader from theism vs. atheism to the problem of duality to sexual immorality. It's at times philosophical, at times theological, and at times even political. Nevertheless, 'Mere Christianity' is not a difficult read.'Mere Christianity' is an important book for all Christians and an essential book for non-Christians. This book has converted many to Christianity, including Francis Collins, author of 'The Language of God' and a prominent scientific voice on the Christian front. It's influence on Christian apologetics is incalculable.Buy this book and you will not regret it. This has quickly grown to become one of my favorite books in my collection."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This explanation of Christianity is easy to understand. If you are a Christian, read it. You might understand better or gain a better perspective. If you are not a Christian, you might read it. The Beatitudes has been called a lesson for Christians, but others marveled at Christ's words. If you are nonchristian, you may attain an understanding or a perspective that you did not have."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis had an uncanny knack for cutting right to the chase, in an engaging and entertaining way. Very sound opinions. A must read for all, but especially for Christians, whether recent converts or those walking with Christ for some time..."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"CS Lewis creates a solid 'case' that there is a God. And once established, he then very eloquently defines God in three persons (Father, Son, Spirit). This is a book for believers and non-believers alike.It would also be helpful to understand CS Lewis's own journey from a strong felt atheist to a born again Christian.A fantastic book to read and study!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I originally bought this book because it was recommended by my Pastor as an interesting, informative read. Having been an atheist, C.S. Lewis has the perfect explanation as to why he believes there is a God. I bought this book a second time around because my 17 year old son is struggling with the whole concept of God (his father is an atheist) and I thought this would be helpful. He was really impressed with the way C.S. Lewis succinctly and clearly goes step by step on why he believes there is a God. Every child going off to college needs this book to counter the left wing, secular university experience. A fantastic book!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The great classic by Dr. C.S. Lewis, who provides clear logic for faith.Also highly recommended for subsequent reading is \\"Screwtape letters\\".Mere Christianity"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is a beautiful tome of reasoning on a difficult topic that has sparked much argument. Lewis is brilliant in every sentence and concept. This book deserves at least one read by every one. If you disagree with the conclusions, you will still be much enriched to know the thoughts of Lewis as he persuades all people to an acceptance of eternal concepts."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This purchase was for my husband who is always looking for a way to enhance our Christianity! The price was $9.88 after several discounts via Amazon and Free Super Saver Shipping!We are very pleased with the easy reading of this book that gives any person a closer sense in their Christian beliefs! Great for all ages and all types of groups especially guidance and healing groups. Invites a person to find inner strength even during an epidemic of devastation as depicted! Be positive and be found this book is worth every penny!God Bless You All :))"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"One of the most thought provoking pieces of literature I have ever read. Very beneficial to anyone looking to gain a deeper insight to what the heart of Christianity stands for or for anyone who wants to grow in their faith and be challenged. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is a tremendous book. Mere Christianity is perhaps one of the best books ever written. I highly recommend checking it out if you have never read it.Originally this was a series of radio broadcasts that was later adapted into a book. The book is primarily a Christian Apologetic that predominantly depends on the argument of a Natural Law. The grand claim is that there must be an ultimate foundation for ethics if ethics and morality are to matter and furthermore that it can be demonstrated that ethics is universal creating a Natural Law.His primary argument for Jesus being the Son of God is the Lord/Lunatic/Liar argument. Lewis is clear, easy to follow, and logically sound.I read this book first in college while not yet a practicing Christian. It has been one of the most influential books in my life. I also highly recommend other Lewis works such as the Screwtape Letters and the Abolition of Man."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"wonderful, thought provoking, massively intellectual (and way too much for me) - it's a constant re-read. Some of his thoughts go way over my head and I am not on his wave length intellectually or iq - but somethings I totally get - and he talks sense (when I get it). I take some, i leave what I don't get, but that is the beauty of the journey of christianity - not just questioning - but realising that it just IS. and knowing that is just AWESOME!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Very good book from the brilliant mind of C.S Lewis. THe Word says we are to love God with all our heart and all our MIND and all our soul (Matthew 22:37). This book addresses the mind aspect of accepting God in Christ Jesus."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This books is easier to read than some of his other ones on theology because it was a series of broadcast talks on the BBC during the dark days of WWII. He explains Christian beliefs for the benefit of unbelievers. Very good. Makes me want to read more Lewis."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I loved this book! It was easy to read but really enlightening! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for something Christian based to read!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The book was what I expected but the service was slower than promised. Greatbooks wanted 15 days and it took 20."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I first read Mere Christianity many years ago. I re-read it because I wanted to talk with my grandson about being a Christian in the 21st century. Although C.S. Lewis' book was published in the 20th century, his thinking and writing are still insightful and inspiring."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Book was what I wanted and came in good timing. However, the cover picture was different than what was shown on amazon. It's still good though."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity does not pretend to be systematic theology, but it approaches that. Compared to systematic theology texts, it is disappointing, compared to popular literature, it is deep. It is accessible to non-theologians and has several classic statements of Christianity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Audio quality is great, content is classic C.S. Lewis. The contents of \\"Mere Christianity\\" were originally given over the radio during the heavy attacks of Germany on England during World War II. The significance of the information is increased by understanding the cultural setting in which they were first spoken. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to think!!!!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is amazing. My copy has highlights and notes throughout. Lewis has greatly helped me to come to a fuller understanding of basic Christian thought through this. This is a definate recommend for someone who is Christian or wanting to know about Christian thought. Wow, I can't get over how fantastic this was. This is what the joy of reading is all about. Final Grade - A+"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"It was the first Christmas where it was time to actually give some gifts (I'm 18 so this probably should have come earlier). I had just read Mere Christianity and it was the most revealing book I have read and well timed after my first philosophy class. So, I thought I would share that with my family and bought this box set. I set it up kind of like a book club where we all take possession of one and in the process of exchanging for the next one, we talk about them. My family appreciates the gift and I have learned a ton from C.S. Lewis."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I bought this set as a Christmas gift for my husband. He's read through about half of \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" to date, and he absolutely loves it. That's not surprising, you don't need me to tell you what a great writer C.S. Lewis is. Great buy."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"After 65 odd years, Mere Christianity still presents the most logical and convicting message of honest truth I have yet come across. Concise but thorough, this book is great for anyone, from atheists to lifelong Christians. It would also be helpful to religious nonChristians seeking more information about the Christian faith. I thoroughly enjoyed this read, Lewis is not just a magnificent writer, but an artist, a philosopher, and one of the wisest men of his century."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I was more than pleased with this book. I've been meaning to get more C.S. Lewis for awhile so this compilation was perfect for me (as I believe it would be for other enthusiasts, as well). The quality of the book was even better than I expected."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I really like the practical analogies that C . S Lewis uses to illustrate otherwised difficult concepts to understand. Even thought it was written more than 60 years ago, his writing stye comes across as warm and illustrates his passion for Christianity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"As solid an explanation of Christianity as I have ever encountered. Beautiful writing. Clarity of thought. Solid reasoning. The text of this book originated from a series of BBC radio lectures C.S. Lewis delivered to England while Nazi bombs rained from the sky. Set in that context, the imperative is clear. Christianity is not doled out as a panacea for every sheep in the flock. It is presented, rather, as an choice of free will, guided by grace and dedicated to justice."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I dont know what else to say besides this book is exactly what you need if you have any hesitations of christianity or the idea behind what it means when christians say Jesus is in us.."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"For those of us that are more logical and analytical in our thinking, CS Lewis illustrates logically the need to not only acknowledge but address the existence of God but make a choice in where we stand and what we consider Truth. Use this as a starting point in a lifelong journey to gain an accurate picture of who God is."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This was a terrific book. I'm so glad that I ordered it. It was in great condition when it arrived."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book begins at the beginning, establishing the rationale for accepting that there is a Being which created and sustains the Universe, but deals with each of us on an individual basis. He then moves on to identify what kind of Being this is, eventually naming Him \\"God\\". The next step is to further identify this God as the Christian God, one Being composed of three Persons. Throughout the book, the author always returns to and emphasizes the individual's relationship to God as the primary reason he has written this book. It is fascinating, calling each of us to examine that relationship and its ultimate meaning."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"A logical approach to the understanding of God as the Creator and Christianity. Appeals to the intellect. You do not have to put your brains on the table when you become a Christian. C. S. Lewis in a masterful way explains his faith. Is an excellent book for the seeker of the truth."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This was a Kindle download, amazingly fast. The book itself is a classic with many memorable and useful points for anyone searching for answers about Christianity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is my fourth time reading this little book. It is from a radio broadcast in London durring the blitz of WW2. I would have called it \\"Humanity: 101\\""},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Read this one slowly! It is very thought provoking.....many interesting points I had not thought about before. Agree or not agree....it makes ones think and consider what you really believe about God."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have just received this book in the mail today. I am glad to say it's not beaten up like any other packages I received through amazon so that was a plus. Also The book was in great condition, I bought it used and it looks brand new. being a student in college I will have to say this is one book that if required, this is the best way to get it. if you have a problem with getting it then I guess it's bad luck so I would highly recommend ordering this book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Clive Staples Lewis' Mere Christianity.My gosh. Talk about an eye-opening read... more than a read actually, a revelation that is so interesting to unfold. Never has theology been so intriguing, so mesmerizing and what surprised me the most was how this work (written nearly 59 years ago) was able to resonate with someone of this generation like me. I found myself nodding my head off, laughing (the guy had wit!), reflecting, studying... this is not the kind of book you read page after page. Sometimes you have to read one paragraph twice before you move on to the next, just to fully grasp- and savour- what C.S wrote.This is for everyone: those interested in theology or not. I believe you'll understand, because Lewis wrote in an understandable manner. (Never mind that at the Preface I had to use the dictionary after every two words..)I'd like to end with this. I agreed with many of the things C.S said, but I'm also questioning some others. In my opinion, this is -or was- the opinions and thoughts of a very intelligent man.Undoubtedly, an excellent work!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"very good condition exactly what I expected I would most definitely order again. This is not my first order and it will not be my last"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I am a different Person for reading this Book. I think different then before I read it, I wish I could have known the author..I read the entire book. All Christians who have not read it, should."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is an excellent collection of Lewis's most popular works. I found it a great selection, at a very reasonable price."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I'm new to CS Lewis and this was an excellent place to start reading his work. If you have any curiosity about Christianity this is worth your time."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is the meat of Lewis's apology for Christianity. One of his main arguments is that we all have something inside of us that makes us know what is right. This cannot be taught by our parents, but is inherent and innate. There must be a higher power - God. All of Lewis's works are extremely profound; he has the knack for saying so much in so few words and this is especially the case in this book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"lewis had a definite gift for tackling a subject, almost scientifically, step by step. i was considering Budhism as a possible alignment to Christianity when i read this book. thank God, He used it as a goad in my life. that was two years ago. i just finished reading it again, and i retain my opinion. read it with an open mind, though, and overlook the insignificant dogma that contradicts with statments in the Bible that you interpret differently. there aren't more than a handful, but they deal with some issues like purgatory and alchohol use. i really enjoy this book and think that it's a significant addition to any philosopher or apologist's library."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"There is nothing &quot;Mere&quot; about this book; it will merely change your life. Lewis lays out in plain english a logical argument for the existence of God and the definitive apologetic for christianity since St. Thomas Aquinis. His use of metaphore makes difficult abstract concepts understandable. Christianity claims to change lives and Mere Christianity lives up to its name. A must read for anyone seriously seeking the truth."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is a very easy read, and it gives much insight into how Lewis saw religion and Christianity. It is very dated; I wonder how many people here would agree that it is a woman's duty to obey her husband.I was kind of surprised at the number of very weak arguments and ridiculous assumptions in this book. One example is the circular logic of using scripture to try to convince us of Jesus' divinity. We believe he is the son of God because the New Testement shows that to be the case, and we believe the New Testement is correct because we believe that Jesus is the son of God. In fact, I think this is the only time Lewis tries to make a case for Christianity in Mere Christianity; he does try many times to make a case for theism.I find Lewis' strategy to discredit those who disagree with him very similar to the strategy creationists use to try to discredit Evolution. They take certain unproven theories of evolution, and use the fact that they are not proven to assert that the FACT of evolution (that life forms tends to change over time) is false, even though they understand it as fact themselves. Lewis will attack weak claims made by some of the opposition, and then assert that the entire opposition has been discredited, even though the entire opposition doesn't make those weak claims. It's disconcerting to witness someone fool so many people using these kinds of dishonest tactics.Well, this has mostly been very negative, but I am glad I read Mere Christianity. It is well-written, and it is extremely insightful in a number of ways.On the issue of critics of this book getting few &quot;helpful&quot; votes... That some of the critics are not backing up what they say is merely an excuse. Many reviews that praise the book without backing the praise up AT ALL are getting all or almost all yes votes. I have provided examples in my review and it is going to be infested with many hypocritical no votes, not because I didn't support my assertions enough, but because people merely disagree with me about C.S. Lewis and religion."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I do not even know where to begin with giving accolades to this book. For Christians anywhere in their faith this book is a must read. Beware of the challenges that Lewis presents. I have never been so full of joy, humility, and thanksgiving as I was while reading this."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"&quot;Reality is something you could not have guessed. This is one of the reasons I believe in Christianity. It is a religion you could not have guessed.&quot;Mr. Lewis is not saying anything about and odd twist in reality and he certainly isnt saying that since the universe is complex and since Christianity is capable of explaning it, it therefore has to be complex and true.All that he is saying here is much like reality, Christinity is not a faith that can be conceptualized by a human mind. If reality did not exist, and we somehow did (which is impossible to say the least), we would not be able to come up with such an idea. Therefore Mr.Lewis'logic is as follows.1- Reality is not something that a mere human mind can come up with.2- Christianity is not something that a mere humand mind can come up with.3- Then just as reality is REAL so is Christianity.The argument contains no circulatory logic and it certainly isnt self defeating.P.S: there is no point in attempting to come up with examples to disprove this statement, because that in its essence would be self defeating. Because by giving any example,that would disqualify your statement because it was somthing that was imaginabled by the human mind."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Whether you like it or not, this book defines Christianity for modern evangelicals more than any other text, excepting perhaps Matthew and Romans in the New Testament. Lewis is at his rhetorical and biblical finest. If you cannot admire his mastery of the form at the least, you ought get therapy for self-deception."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I was pretty happy and satisfy with all my past purchases with Amazon.All the used books I bought were pretty decent and in good condition.Until, Bellwether Books shipped me the C.S. Lewis Classics: Mere Christianity, The Screwtape...I am astonished by the very poor quality of the books: the paper, tailoring and binding are so inferior which I never experienced. The pages are so insecurely bind that they might fall off in matter of time; the paper is so coarse like commercial paper towel that is used in the public restroom. The pages are so unevenly cut and are mostly larger than the book cover.All I can only hope that C.S. Lewis' ideas and his writing will give me the pleasure in reading.Frankly, I never have such bad experience with used book purchase until now with Bellwether Books.Surprisingly, the seller stated the book as good or very good condition."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"7 books in 1. I haven't read the whole book yet. But what I've read so far is a delight. It's like listening to an old friend.I have the Chronicles of Narnia and I'm thrilled to add this to my collection."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I owned this book for more than a year before I read it. Once I began though, I was stunned at how good it was. This book has become one that I keep in a treasured place on my bookshelf always ready to be read.I recommend this book to every Christian and to every non-believer that is curious about the faith. Lewis writes with such logic and clarity that it is a joy to read.This book is brilliant."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"No-one should be allowed in apologetics until s/he has read C. S. Lewis' &quot;Miracles&quot; at least four or five times, and no-one should question whether miracles can occur until reading it.&quot;The Great Divorce&quot; and &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; are clearly among the classics of Christianity.I am also currently reading &quot;The Problem of Pain&quot; and &quot;Mere Christianity.&quot; So far both are excellent books."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This was the first of Lewis's apologetic works that I read and he has since become one of my favorite Christian authors. His arguements are well thought out, and based in reason. The book is highly accessable and an easy read. Lewis is able to put into words many of my own thoughts about my faith in a much more eloquent manner than I ever could. This book is honest, frank, and a must read for any Christian looking to better understand their faith."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis will be long remembered for this brilliant treatise showing how Christianity does indeed intersect with reason and human experience. Many have read this book on their path to embracing the faith and cite it as a major influence, Chuck Colson included. If you have questions about the relationship of faith to your intellect, this book is an excellent place to start."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I was really quite surprised to see the number of people taking potshots at Lewis's logic- true, it is not enterly comprehensive, but it is consistent and for the most part valid. The possible difficulty may have been the style- unlike many theological tomes it was written so as to be comprehensible to the mildly educated layman rather than reserving its rewards for the esoteric scholars alone. Lewis could, and did, write for academic audiences, but the style of his work for the common man- elegant, occasionally almost flashy rhetoric, dry, acid, occasionally breezy wit- is not a fault of the work as a whole.It is a book easy to love, easy to resent. But it is the sort of book that will not go away or quiet down."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"To those who look to this book to find an intellectual &quot;proof&quot; of christianity, as many tout it, you will be disappointed. The truth revealed in this book goes far deeper than any intellectual argument. Lewis prowls deep within the soul and everything that humankind knows is true from within. An excellent analysis of the continuity of morality and feelings among people in general. This book is useful to skeptics who are at least willing to open up and admit their own feelings and experiences--then this book will help you to experience God."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I was raised in a Christian home, but after my university experience, I had become an agnostic. This book was lent to me and after having read it, I realized the Truth. What better person to write this book, than one who had had much the same journey as other agnostics? Thank God for this brilliant and persuasive man."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"A literate, well thought-out argument for the existence of God and the validity of Christianity. Yet the author is never condescending toward his reader. Don't be fooled by the small size of this book. There are a lot of ideas here. Is there a flaw in Mr. Lewis' logic? I couldn't find it."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Outside of the Bible, Mere Christianity presents the most irrefutable of arguments for Christianity. Appealing for those of an &quot;intellectual&quot; bent, Lewis lays down a very rigid, but delightful, chain of logical morsels, eventually tying them all together to present the bigger picture that is Christ's divinity, His death and His resurrection. This book is very helpful to those who, like myself, sometimes get caught up in peripheral issues, ignoring the very elementals that make up the faith of Christianity. Don't just read this book, take notes and study it"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C. S. Lewis the foremost apologist of the 20th Century. Mere Christianity is his signature work and an absolutely \\"must read\\" for every Christian and for any person pondering the question of faith."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"\\"One of the most popular and beloved introductions to Christian faith ever written,\\" as the back cover proclaims, was that of C. S. Lewis's Mere Christianity. A culmination of radio speeches given during World War II, the pieces were intended to reintroduce Christian teachings to the British public, as well as to justify them. This influential book, in fact, does do a fine job at explaining Christian theology and concepts in layman's terms, so to speak. In his work, Lewis gives some terrific insight into certain practical elements of life. For instance, his distinction of love being the adhesive of marriage as opposed to being \\"in love\\" can shed some valuable light on current divorce rates, explaining, perhaps, why it is that so many marriages today end early on in disaster. His casual and personal style make the book pleasurable to read and easy to understand, and so this review will be done in much the same way. And since I am what could be called a secular humanist, much focus will be laid on related issues.C. S. Lewis falls short on a few of his arguments. The first of these shortcomings, although he does not present them in this order, is his so-called revelation from atheist to Christian. This seems to imply that he may somehow have special understanding of the \\"heathen\\" arguments, which he obviously does not. As an atheist, he claimed that his \\"argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust\\" (Lewis 38). But this sounds more like a disgruntled believer than a true non-believer. It brings to mind people that have proclaimed atheism because their grandmother died of cancer and they couldn't conceive of a loving God who would take away such a sweet woman, etc. Lewis reminds me of one of these angry, pseudo-atheists. These are hardly motivations for disbelief. Just because the world is \\"unjust\\" is not grounds for atheism, although it may stray from Christian teachings, for why would one not consider the option of an unjust God? From where did this concept of a just and loving God come? Obviously his perception of the world has some strong Christian foundation. By seeing the universe through such a filter, it seems that such claims are more that of a Christian who is having a crisis of faith, but not an absence of one. His claim for atheism was weak, and therefore collapsed. His transition back to Christianity would then have been quite easy, for he probably never truly disbelieved in the first place. This would also bring one to question his rash conclusion that \\"atheism turns out to be too simple,\\" (Lewis 39) for he appears to not fully understand the potential complexities of such a qualifier. He seems to never really have stepped out from Christianity in the first place.The second of his flawed claims is his proof of God's existence. In his claiming that the universe was unjust, he felt that he had to have had an idea of what justice was. He concluded that this sense of morality was higher than the learned Rules of Decent Behavior because \\"we all do believe that some moralities are better than others\\" (Lewis 13). He felt that by judging the strength of different moralities we must have some standard with which to compare, one that is not of our creation, and that ultimately a supreme being must be responsible. However, I feel that he leaves out the very simple possibility. Individuals begin to see both advantages and disadvantages in the world early on in life, and they then imagine ways that could make the disadvantages less so. This does not mean that these ideas are somehow separate and originate from the Heavens, like in some Platonian sense of Beauty, but that they are brought about with sheer reason and experience. A toddler who steals from another child or beats him does not necessarily have an embedded sense of morality, however, when he learns that there are consequences to such actions or that it may be more advantageous to cooperate with the other, he will be inclined to do so. The previous generations, likewise, would have learned the same way. This is not an example of external morality, but mere adaptability. Also, people feel pain, desire, hunger, etc.: all are experiences individuals will have at at least one point in their life. It is these moments that begin to lay the \\"standard\\" for which to compare moralities, not God, for people are able to formulate an ideal moral sense of their own (which will most likely coincide with others because of common experiences) that will have the most potential for a happy life. As a side note, an explanation such as this discredits the frequent claim that morality cannot exist without God. Simply put, humans are social and political animals, and they must live amongst each other. Therefore, in order to survive and prosper, one must learn to live among other humans taking into account the environment, demography, and culture. There is no mysticism needed, only intelligence. God is not needed for a moral life, but merely that all-to-rare ability to empathize!These problems topple the foundations of Lewis's arguments both against atheism, and for God. But his use of maladaptive analogies does not end there. For instance, in the chapter \\"Sexual Morality\\" there is the rather strange argument that the biological need to eat is the same as the biological urge to have sex. He gives a hypothetical situation, comparing a woman's striptease to the uncovering of a dinner plate on stage, and that somehow both would be an indication that something had gone wrong with the instinctual desire of the audience that looked on in anticipation. However, this comparison is rather unfair: firstly, people are born hungry, not horny, and they need food each day to survive. Sexuality does not come into significant fruition until much later in life, particularly through puberty. This can partly account with the human fascination of it, for it is a fresh and exciting element of early adulthood, not infancy. Also, all individuals must eat, but certainly not all need to procreate. Populations need to reproduce, not necessarily all individuals, and definitely not every day. Although both eating and intercourse fulfill a biological purpose, the intentions, necessity, and process are too different to compare. And even though it is much later than Lewis's time, what about the Food Network on television today? Is it starved Americans that watch the show, or the well fed? Is Emeril a symbol of retarded instincts, and the audience that claps at his creations proof of a degenerate population, or just gastronomes appreciating the culinary art? I hardly think the prior claim holds much credit. Yet again, his foundation for argument falls short of convincing. While reading his work, one should always keep in mind the adage: arguments by analogy are inherently suspect.Overall, C. S. Lewis's work is a decent introduction to the Christian faith. It succeeds in bringing theology and understanding to laymen, but while Lewis's craft diligently explains what Christianity is, but he seems to falter when he attempts to convince readers of why Christianity should be. A brilliant literary critic he was, a great theologian he was not."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Introduced to me in the 50's, as Lewis suggests I was not ready for all its lessons. But each time I reread the pages, it uplifts my spirit. As a student and teacher of the Bible, I find it a constant companion."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I admire the way Lewis hits on all the basic aspects of the Christian life in a logical and mathematical way. Many atheists view Christianity as illogical and mindless...well here Lewis shows how much brainwork is actually involved in Christianity. What's nice about it is that he does it in a simple, easy to read manner. Highly recommended for all Christians, even non-Christians!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Lewis was able to explain my faith to myself for the first time. Eye opening. If you are unsure who God is in your life or unsure what God's plan for you is, this book could be the clue book with the answers. It was for me."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I feel out of my league critiquing Mr. Lewis. I certainly recognize he is a gifted writer. All I am trying to do is say why, at least for me, he didn't prove his case.The book is divided into four books, and at this time I'm only intending on commenting on the first two. The reason being that the latter two books are for Christians. The first two are for those that are contemplating Christianity.Lewis starts out his argument for the existence of God by first attempting to prove the existence of what he calls \\"The Moral Law\\". It seems that a reader's perception of the strength of Lewis' argument for the existence of God completely stands or falls based on whether said reader is convinced by the argument of the existence of this purported Law. Lewis argues that it seems that everybody has some innate understanding of a proper, moral behavior. He says that if we didn't, it would make no sense to say that Nazi's behaved \\"badly\\". Saying they behaved \\"badly\\" only makes sense if you have a fundamental understanding of what it would mean to behave well.My first complaint is that I feel he trivializes the differences of morality amongst different cultures. He agrees that there are differences but says \\"these have never amounted to anything of a total difference... Men have differed as to whether you should have one wife or four. But they have always agreed that you should not simply have any woman you liked.\\" Considering how much to do Christians (including Lewis himself) usually make of the properness of the biblical \\"one man, one woman\\" concept, it seems odd to have him say that isn't a real difference. Lewis neglects to mention that some cultures have found it acceptable for men to kill their wives if they find them displeasing. This isn't a real difference?However, I do agree that at least most cultures have had some form of \\"The Golden Rule\\". In fact, Lewis himself later refers to \\"The Golden Rule of the New Testament (do as you would be done by)\\". So, if I accept that at least most cultures have had some form of this, the question then becomes, where did it come from? Lewis discusses two naturalistic possibilities, instinct and learned behavior. Lewis dismisses these. To dismiss instinct, Lewis discusses the scenario where somebody sees someone in trouble. They may have the instinct to run away to protect themselves. And he says they may have the instinct to help the other person. Yet somehow the person must make a choice between the two instincts, and the means that one employs to make that choice must be The Moral Law. It seems to me that it is more likely to be learned behavior even though Lewis dismisses that possibility.I shouldn't say that Lewis completely dismisses that The Moral Law as being learned behavior. In fact, he agree that it is, much like the multiplication tables are something that you learn. But we couldn't have arbitrarily made up the multiplication tables. Nor, he argues, could we have arbitrarily decided The Moral Law. For evidence of this, he again reiterates his claim that all cultures have had similar morality; and if morality were arbitrary then that wouldn't be so. As I've said, I'm not convinced this is the case. But I have agreed that most cultures have had some form of The Golden Rule. So Lewis would say that I'm agreeing with him. Well, not really. Is there any other possible explanation for the universitality of The Golden Rule? I think there is. For my own self preservation, it seems obvious that I would want other people to not to decide to arbitrarily kill me. It also seems obvious that I would have no reason to have such expectation of other people, if I won't likewise arbitrarily go kill them. It doesn't seem to me that it requires a God to have told me this. Granted, in today's society, the concept of treating others as you would have them treat you sometimes seems to be in amazingly short supply. Yet I'd still say that it really shouldn't take a rocket scientist, let alone God, to figure this out.Lewis accepts some desire to help others is instinct. He calls it the \\"herd instinct\\". I'd prefer to call it \\"empathy\\". Many Christians ask why would this evolve? If we evolved, wouldn't we evolve primarily the instinct to save ourselves? However, Lewis doesn't ask this question and accepts that we do in fact have such an instinct. But he believes that the self-preservation is a stronger instinct and that therefore if someone chooses to help someone instead of saving themselves, it must be because of The Moral Law. However, he doesn't seem to offer any proof that the self-preservation instinct would be stronger than empathy. But even if he is correct and self-preservation is the stronger instinct, the combination of learned behavior plus the \\"herd instinct\\" seems to me to be quite capable of being stronger than the self-preservation instinct, at least in some individuals in some situations. Maybe I can't prove that my explanation is correct. But I assert that Lewis has not proven it to be wrong."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I don't know really know whether this book is profound philosophy or, as claimed by at least one reviewer, profoundly flawed philosophy. I must admit that I find some of the logical steps in his arguments to be a bit of a leap. I do know, however, that this book is very useful for me, personally, in understanding just what's up with various aspects of faith and Christian beliefs that are, again quite personally, important to me. I would recommend it to anyone with a skeptical turn of mind who is really trying to understand. The attitude of the writer seems to be more or less, \\"This makes sense to me ... if it's helpful to you that's good, if not ... well, it's up to you to figure out what's useful\\". Taken that way, it is indeed helpful for me, but I could understand why it would not be for others."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Lewis was so brilliant, genius in fact. I wish I would have read him earlier in my life. Before picking up the audio version of \\"Mere Christianity,\\" I did not quite know what to expect. It was very interesting that Lewis believed in \\"the scream of evolution\\" while at the same time having God intervene with a beam of light(symbolic language) to perhaps alter the slow natural process of natural selection only ruled by the law of beasts. Lewis is simply saying there is more to human ethics than \\"survival of the fittest.\\" At the same time he talks about the change from being \\"creatures of God to sons of God,\\" something coming from the outside. After finishing the book, I called my best friend from college who is a strong Christian. That led to a discussion of developing one's faith and the challenge of helping this \\"new humanity\\" take shape. This is Lewis's conception of the \\"new man.\\"This spiritual evolution that Lewis is talking about is something to take very seriously. Human brain power and metaknowledge allows us to exponentially increase our awareness of the preciousness of this short time on earth and our responsibility to live the best life possible. As Lewis describes spiritual birth, \\"the doctor has arrived\\" and we have a choice about whether this will occur or not.The last chapter is by far the best. Here, Lewis puts it all together, describing the best he can the self-actualized Christian, to become holy, so to speak. Into ourselves we must have the mind of Christ. He debunks the argument that Christianity demands conformity. The opposite is true in fact according to Lewis. He says releasing oneself from spiritual baggage comes from help from above and that this new man is actually having \\"more fun\\" in life by seeing it in all of its wonderful and colorful perspective. He says \\"thousands of little Christs will still not be enough\\" to honor the marvelous diversity that will honor the king of goodness. Jesus wants us to become our perfect selves, therefore honoring our creator.\\"Give up yourself and let Christ help you to your higher being. To find Christ is to find your real self.\\" POWERFUL thoughts indeed, even to one like me with a scientific mind."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"There is the story told of a teacher instructing a martial arts class. 2 of the class mates are squaring off. The one boy doesn't have the training as the other does, although he's giving it everything he has. He's pretty much throwing every bit of technique at the advanced student as he can, and yet he still continues to get beat. The teacher finally pulls the less of the 2 students off to the the sides and says, &quot;I know that you are as tough as nails. I know what you know. Perhaps if you went back to the basics, it might not be so difficult.&quot; The boys line up and square off. They circle each other. The lesser student finds his opening, BOOM!!! The other kid is sprawled out on the mat.C.S. Lewis takes us through the basic points, and BOOM!! He floors us with what we thought was just going to be, &quot;Mere Christianity.&quot; He wrote this back in the 1940's, yet he used a language that we can all understand, yet you have to take the time to comprehend what he's saying. I looked at this as a complex book on simple issues, and it constantly hit me between the eyes! There are places where you see God in a whole new light. It is like you've never seen it in such a perspective, yet now you find yourself amazed. His illustrations are very simple, yet sometimes you might want to read it again to get the full understanding of what he is saying. Then read it again, and smile, and praise God for this wonderful work! People have labeled this as &quot;The most important book next to the Word of God.&quot; It just might be. And it is just the beginning.C.S. Lewis used to be an atheist, and when he gave his talent to God, he became one of the most influencial writers that Christianity has ever seen! Folks, this is what happens when people might say, &quot;God can't use that.&quot; And then God looks at what appears to be impossible and says, &quot;Let's see what I can do!&quot; Did people back then think that a former atheist could pull something like this off? This is just 1 of many wonderful works that Lewis has accomplished for the Kingdom of God! And it is so beautiful. Hats off to a legend!!!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis is a book I consider must reading for everyone. You've probably noticed that I have given it five stars, and from this you may conclude that I am a believer (and you would be right). However, I am not saying that you have to agree with this book. Just get it, read it, reread it, and ponder it. One reading is not enough. The reason I say this is that we all have a tendency to read what we expect a writer to say into what he actually does say.Many critics of Lewis often set up &quot;straw man&quot; arguments. They read some flawed logic into his words and then easily knock it down. For example, Lewis said, &quot;Reality is something you could not have guessed. This is one of the reasons I believe in Christianity. It is a religion you could not have guessed.&quot; The context of these statements shows that Lewis meant that reality has a curious twist of &quot;oddness&quot; about it, and this is one of the reasons he is a believer; Christianity echoes that curious twist of oddness. Please note, he said &quot;one of the reasons&quot;, by which he meant &quot;in conjunction with other reasons&quot; that he has given. Some say he meant that the world is complex, Christianity is complex, therefore it must be true. They then demolish this straw man by pointing out that all this really means is that a person is free to attend the most complicated religion of their choice. That is not what Lewis said. It is always a good idea to check the context when interpreting any statement.&quot;Circular reasoning&quot; can also be a staw man argument. For example, Lewis is supposed to have said that one believes what the New Testament says because Jesus is the Son of God and one believes He is the Son of God because of the Bible's description of His life. If Lewis actually implied that, it would be circular reasoning and worthy of being discounted. But did he? I have read Mere Christianity several times and I never got that Lewis was saying one belives what the New Testament says &quot;because Jesus is the Son of God.&quot; Lewis says the New Testament is reliable reporting, and gives other reasons for believing this, but Jesus being the Son of God is that which is to be demonstrated.These are just two examples of many straw man arguments based on not paying attention to what C.S. Lewis actually does say in Mere Christianity. Maybe if you get it, read it, reread it, and ponder it, you will find a really valid argument against it. Until then, don't jump to conclusions or assume you already know what this book is all about. I will try to do the same."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity is one of my favorite books of C.S. Lewis's entire collection and life works.This book summarizes the entire Christian belief system. From human nature, to the law, to Christian &quot;Behaviour&quot;, this book has it all.A must-buy for any student 'seeking the truth', or anyone wanting to understand what Christianity is about (secondary to the Holy Bible, of course)."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity by C.S Lewis was derived from three radio lectures given by the author during the Second World War. Lewis is a well-known mid-twentieth century writer with popular works in a variety of genres; religious fiction, children's fiction, science fiction as well as religion/philosophy.Mere Christianity remains, probably, the most significant twentieth century Christian apologetic text. Lewis employs what is known as the classic approach to apologetics - starting with a general argument for the existence of God then moving on to make the specific case Christianity. Contrary to an earlier reviewer - this is a general introduction aim at the lay reader. Although all readers can find it helpful, it is not aimed at \\"intellectuals\\". Readers seeking more significant philosophical argumentation on these types of issues may want to look at the likes of Plantinga, Craig, Moreland etc.One small criticism of the book is the last chapter - it has 1940's speculative science fiction feel. Lewis' interest in science fiction; coupled with the progressive view of evolution popular among thinkers at the time makes it feel dated and a bit out of place for an introductory text.Overall, Mere Christianity is a classic (The audio version is also tremendous). I highly recommend it as a starting point for anyone interested in Christian apologetics.

His book, Mere Christianity, is broken into four parts, each discussing a major principle of Christianity. Lewis takes the complexity of the Bible and is able to present its major tenets in a clear and concise way. He uses his reason and intelligence to logically present his arguments and to defend the heart of Christianity.Lewis lays out the precepts of Christianity and describes what Christians believe and why using simple terms and examples. He uses compelling evidence to verify God's existence and uses rational to show that Christianity in fact does make sense and that it is the only truth.Mere Christianity is so thought-provoking and provides a sound defense of the Christian faith. It clarifies many points of questions- such as how to love your neighbor, why Jesus had to die, how Jesus could be both perfectly man and perfectly God, and many more.This is not only a book that you will read, but one which you will take notes, study, pray, and constantly refer to your Bible as you examine many aspects of Christianity.

Instead, he allows the reader to meet him at the beginning of the road for Christians, that morality is a real thing, and that humans have somehow broken the morality that transcends all belief systems. If a person cannot agree that morality is at least real, then Christianity will be too much for them to believe in. C.S. Lewis knows this, and he allows the reader to agree with at least that - that morality is a real thing.When I first read the book, I was weary of Christianity. I was on the fence about the entire thing. This book pushed me a little over the fence. I give this book to anybody who is willing to at least think about God and religion.

Mere Christianity is one of these notable and important books.No matter the stage in your walk in faith, this book will be a great read. Lewis' intelligence jumps off the pages, and the style of writing (taken from audio conversations) makes it feel like you're listening to a close friend. Lewis provides excellent allegories and everyday examples of faith, belief and basic understanding of Christian concepts. And the beauty of it all is that he provides just the right mix of philosophy, facts and faith.I suggest this book if you:A) Want some &quot;real world&quot; examples of why faith is important B) Need a refresher course of who God is and why He matters C) Need more backing/help in your crusade to spread God's Word D) (like most of us) All of the above"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This particular box set of has had a rather curious publication history. It was first issued in the early 1990s, when I first bought it. The box set (not known then as the SIGNATURE SERIES, it was later renamed thus in the second incarnation) was focused explicitly on Lewis's output from the 1940s. There were six books included: THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS, THE GREAT DIVORCE, THE PROBLEM OF PAIN, MERE CHRISTIANITY, MIRACLES, and THE ABOLITON OF MAN. The first two are works of fiction, and the remaining four are first rate, but very intellectual and written much more from the head than the heart, apologetics.As the box set stood on its original publication, it was the ideal presentation of Lewis's critical faculties and contained very detailed, rational defenses, very eloquently written and simple to understand, of the Christian faith. Due the books all being written within a few years of each other, the box set read very much like each book was a logical extension of the next.Then when the new millennium dawned, the publishers decided to rechristen the box set (formerly nameless) as the C. S. LEWIS SIGNATURE SERIES, and include a new book from a much different era in Lewis's life. They removed THE ABOLITION OF MAN, and instead included A GRIEF OBSERVED, a work published much later in Lewis's life than any of the other books. This rearrangement is a particularly revealing little facet of what has now become a very profitable industry built on Lewis's name. With the public attention brought on by Lewis's marriage, there has been a marked increase and peaking of interested in Lewis's relationship to Joy Davidman, and GRIEF was included for business reasons. While the original set presented a very clear and rational set of apologetics, it was broken up to include a book incompatible in tone and content with the other five books.To better understand why they deleted the book, it is best to know more about each work. THE ABOLITION OF MAN focuses on moral law, and is primarily focused on debunking the idea that morality is not objective, but subjective, and all reactions to beauty, horror, etc, are purely biochemical and subjective. Lewis goes to great pains arguing against this viewpoint, and also focuses his critical attacks on [various professors and teachers] two professors from universaties. ABOLITION is very much an extension and elaboration on one of the primary arguments in MERE CHRISTIANITY. THE CASE FOR CHRISTIANITY, the first book in MERE CHRISTIANITY, argues for a natural law, and ABOLITION expands and propounds on Lewis's ideas of the Tao, or moral law. These two works are best understood when read together, and it is unfortunate they dropped ABOLITION from it. The book is subtitled \\"Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools,\\" which lets the reader know one of its primary audiences is education, which is not surprising given Lewis's profession. THE CASE FOR CHRISTIANITY, the first book in MERE CHRISTIANITY, argues for a natural law, and ABOLITION expands and propounds on Lewis's ideas of the Tao, or moral law. These two works are best understood when read together, and it is unfortunate they dropped ABOLITION from the second incarnation fo this boxset.After the publication of MIRACLES in the mid 1940s, Lewis had a debate at the university defending his arguments found in the book. Though even the other debater would disagree when asked about it later that Lewis actually lost the debate, Lewis believed himself losing the critical debate. After this key moment in his career, Lewis stopped writing apologetic works, based on stringent, rational arguments, and turned rather to writing devotional books or examinations of the Christian faith, and did not write any more defenses of his faith on the same level as the works found in the original set.Lewis would go on to write several more Christian books, but as previously stated, none of them were explicitly apologetic, that is, none were built on logical arguments and primarily focused on providing rational defenses to Christianity. Rather, Lewis wrote works of meditation and autobiography. Toward the end of his life, he wrote A GRIEF OBSERVED, which is exactly what it says it is. It is a very acute, extremely frank, heart wrenching work, and very beautiful. It is also a very personal work. It is one of Lewis's most precious and honest works, but in terms of content and style, it simply does not work when presented in the context of the other five books included in the second publication, all of which were primarily apologetic and written in a much earlier era than this book.Too me the ideal solution would have been to let the original six books stand, and then come up with a second box set of the books Lewis wrote in the 1950s and 1960s. This second box set could include the following works: THE FOUR LOVES, TILL WE HAVE FACES, REFLECTIONS ON THE PSALMS, LETTERS TO MALCOLM, SURPRISED BY JOY, and A GRIEF OBSERVED, and perhaps throw in AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM as well (essential literary criticism, and highly influenced by Joy). These better represent the period of Lewis's life that Joy had the most impact on, though LETTERS was published in 1963. Both sets would be present an accurate snapshot of Lewis's faith and how it evolved as he lived his life. Both sets would be much better served by being published together, as Lewis's style and intellectual focus is more consistent when broken up into two box sets. The original set are great apologetics, and the second set is a more meditative box set.Instead of presenting Lewis's remarkable skills as an apologist, which was the original function of the box set by presenting four nonfiction works and two works of fiction , ABOLITION was replaced with a book from an entirely different period of Lewis's life.Then we come to the third incarnation of this box set. For whatever reason, they went back to including ABOLITION, and added GRIEF as well. These books are central to understanding Lewis as a Christian writer, and especially as an apologist. Most people may know him from NARNIA or one of these volumes, and it is a good place for introduction into the mind and works of C. S. Lewis. All the classics are here, from SCREWTAPE, MERE CHRISTIANITY, and MIRACLES, as well as three other works, all of which range from profound (the majority) to beautiful (THE GREAT DIVORCE), to the gut-wrenching (A GRIEF OBSERVED).Bottom line: This is a nice box set to have, just be aware that GRIEF isn't really the same as the other six works, and to understand the era that Joy Davidman most impacted, read the works listed above. The other six, however, are fantastic apologetics, and wonderful to study and use for witnessing [as a witnessing tool].Bottom line: This is a nice box set to have, just be aware that GRIEF isn't really the same as the other six works, and to understand the era that Joy Davidman most impacted, read the works listed above.

S. Lewis' insights into the validity of Christianity remain as current as today's internet blogs. \\"Mere Christianity\\" answers the intellectual questions of post-modern intellectuals and provides nourishment for the spiritual hunger of Gen X/Gen Y seekers.Lewis writes in the style of his intellectual mentor, G. K. Chesterton. Both men entered adulthood as agnostics. Both men spent their careers defending the rational integrity of Christianity. Chesterton's \\"Orthodoxy\\" addressed the questions typical of the agnosticism of his era (1900). Lewis' \\"Mere Christianity\\" addresses the hardened agnosticism of his WW II generation.Like Chesterton, Lewis not only discusses how Christianity is rationally consistent, but also how it meets the \\"real world/real hunger\\" test. That is, he demonstrates how Christianity is relationally fulfilling, meaningful, and consistent.\\"Mere Christianity\\" also reads something like a Christian version of Plato's \\"Republic.\\" In the \\"Republic,\\" Plato attempted to define the shape of a society that would produce \\"happiness\\"--meaningful, purposeful existence for the individual and the society. Philosophically, Lewis offers the Christian version of the ideal individual, in the ideal society, following the ideal Supreme Being.

Clever and intriguing examples derived from observation of everyday human interaction illuminate simple truths with enormous meaning.This book is not a guidebook to the many sects of Christianity, nor will it help you select the one that best fits you. Lewis writes this book with the hope that whoever reads it will understand and accept the basic Christian doctrine and follow his or her heart from there. This book also does not delve into theological specifics or any of the innumerable disagreements about the intricacies of the religion, as he rightly believe this will drive away many of the seekers before they can even get to the door.I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone - any person of any age, any belief system, any race, any country.

If you know the code this book will be a revelation. If not I pray for you."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity is very simply that: a straitforward explanation of what Christianity really is. In an age when philosophical and theological modernism seeks to alter and even destroy the essence of Christ's teaching, Lewis makes plain what are the essential and unchangeable tenets of the Christian faith. To those who argue in favor of updated modernist versions of Christian beliefs, Lewis is telling them by inference, that their versions are not true Christian views. His way of explaining Christian doctrine is so logical as to seem irrefragable. But whether or not one accepts these views as truth, Lewis is declaring that this is what Christianity really is. Each one of us is free to take it or leave it.It is interesting to note that Lewis was born a Christian, and in his early adulthood became an atheist, then later on he became a Christian. He never did become Catholic, but had he lived longer, he might have, for he was a contemporary of J.R.R. Tolkien (a cradle Catholic) and G.K. Chesterton (a convert to Catholicism), and they all knew each other quite well. A philosophy professor at Fordham University named Willam Marra, while he was still living (he passed away about five years ago) formerly conducted a monthly seminar at Fordham's Keating Hall on the traditional orthodox teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, and spoke of Lewis's writings a number of times. On one occasion he said of Lewis \\"I love that man, I don't know why he didn't become a Catholic\\". Even though he (Lewis) was a Protestant, he is held in high esteem by orthodox Catholic theologians.This treatise of C.S. Lewis is an enormously important book for anyone seeking to understand basic Christianity. It is written in a style that gets to the heart of an idea he is expressing, almost instantly. You don't need to have any sophisticated understanding of theology to grasp the explanations he offers.His treatment of the three Theological Virtues (Faith, Hope and Charity) and the four Cardinal Virtues (Prudence, Temperance, Justice and Fortitude) is very good. And everyone should know what he has to say about the Great Sin (Pride), which is so destructive to the self. The chapter entitled \\"Let's Pretend\\" explains how and why we should seek spiritual self-improvement, and I'll bet that there are ideas in this section that you never thought about.In the fourth century there was Augustine, in the thirteenth century there was Thomas Aquinas, and in the twentieth century we had Clive Staples Lewis. An outstanding group, I would say.Not enough can be said in favor of this book. Read it !"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christanity by C.S.

Presented in four books (the first two of which act as progressive argument based on ethical perceptions), MC can be easily devoured a chapter at a time by people who are leery of diving into the &quot;deep end&quot;. This is most certainly NOT an attempt to devalue or &quot;explain away&quot; the supernatural elements of Christianity; but instead strongly ratifies the core beliefs shared by most denominations. It is an invaluable tool for any Christian who seeks to strengthen the grounds of their faith; and, in my opinion, an excellent place for sceptics of the Christian faith to begin if they are curious about some of the logical arguments behind Christianity (although M:aPS produces an even stronger argument.)

Very interesting."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I'm not a Christian and on a polemical level I didn't find this book to be very persuasive. It contained a lot of after-the-fact reasoning to justify pre-existing beliefs. Of course, the same could be said for almost all books about religion or politics. It is a fairly succinct account on how many Christians think so I can recommend it to people who want to learn more about Christianity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is the first Christian book I read after really deciding to follow Jesus. I remember walking through a book store and how shocked I was to see that C.S. Lewis had written a Christian book. I loved the Chronicles of Narnia as a child, so I had to see what it was about. I must admit the first time I read it, it took me several months to get through it. But it was enthralling. This book, far more than any other besides the Bible, has greatly influenced my outlook on life. I have read it four times I think, maybe more. If you have not read this great piece of literature I highly suggest that you do.Most of this book is just talks that Lewis gave over the radio, especially to troops. In it he sets out to \\"explain and defend the belief that has been common to nearly all Christians at all times.\\" He does so masterfully. While intellectual, this book explains the heart of Christianity in non-theological terms. Using metaphors throughout, C.S. Lewis uses real life experiences we already understand to help us understand Christianity. It is simple, or \\"mere,\\" Christianity.SYNOPSISIt is divided into four parts:I. RIGHT AND WRONG AS A CLUE TO THE MEANING OF THE UNIVERSEThis first section has helped me more than anything else in believing there is a God, and that He is Good. Scores of books are written to \\"prove\\" God with science (i.e. intelligent design). While creation does point to a Creator, this method only works effectively if you are a scientist. If you are not, you really have to go on what other people have told you about it.But Lewis works on a different premise. Why do we all feel there is such a thing as 'right' and 'wrong,' even if we disagree on what it looks like? If one of our friends punched us in the face we would be angry. Why? Because friends don't punch each other. But why do we have that idea within us? Why do we have this idea that people ought to act a certain way and not in another? And why is it not just in our society, but everywhere? We didn't put it there, so Lewis reasons that something else, something greater than us, must have.And if that Greater Something put this idea of right and wrong in us, it must be on the 'right' side of things. That is, it must be 'good' because it is the One that gave us the idea that some things are 'good' and some are not. Something good would reveal itself to us, not just leaving us here to figure it all out. And this Good Something has. It is God. Lewis then reasons that the most probable explanation must be Christianity, because it is the only answer that really makes sense.II. WHAT CHRISTIANS BELIEVEHere Lewis goes through the process of examining atheism along with different conceptions of God. He goes on to say that atheism is too simple. Many atheists' main reason for their belief is that the world is too unjust for a god to have made it. But what gave man the idea of just and unjust? So atheists argue that God, who gave them the very idea of right and wrong, does not exist because the world is too wrong. This may be an accusation against God, but He is the one who gave them that idea in the first place.Another idea about God is that everything lovely and beautiful is \\"God\\" in some sense, so as long as we are all living good lives we are living true religion. But this is a candy religion. It is all rewards and requires nothing. After dealing with even more views Lewis says that the final view is the \\"Christian view that this is a good world that has gone wrong, but still retains the memory of what it ought to have been.\\"And finally he goes on to explain the Gospel, the heart of who this Jesus is and why He came. He writes, \\"The perfect surrender and humiliation were undergone by Christ: perfect because He was God, surrender and humiliation because He was man. Now the Christian belief is that if we somehow share the humility and suffering of Christ we shall also share in His conquest of death and find a new life after we have died and in it become perfect, and perfectly happy, creatures.\\"III. CHRISTIAN BEHAVIORThis is a great section in which Lewis explains the implications of God. He deals with some basics of morality like: faith, forgiveness, love, hope, sexual morality etc. I think up to this point in my life (before I read this section) morality seemed like such a cut and dry, boring thing. In Bible classes I mostly heard these terms defined, sometimes applied, but almost never why we should choose one over another.Lewis' classic view of morality is this. God made us to live a certain way, and only living this way will bring us happiness, contentment, and meaning. The human machine is meant to run on God. Anything else that is put into it will eventually make the machine sputter out and die, even if at first it seems to do better.He also explains it like taking a dog for a walk. If the dog gets caught on the other side of a pole, it will likely keep trying to push forward. If you try to pull the dog back around the pole it will think you don't want it to go forward, when really pulling back for the moment gets it around the pole, and further than it could possibly go with the leash in the way. This is sort of how morality works. No denial of a sin is fun at the moment (lust, greed, lying etc.) but in the end God is just trying to pull us around the pole to get us where we wanted to go in the first place: joy everlasting.IV. BEYOND PERSONALITY: OR FIRST STEPS IN THE DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITYThis is definitely my favorite chapter, and contains my favorite chapter in all books: Nice People or New Men. Many have the idea that religion is all about becoming nicer and giving God His due. Or that Jesus had some good social teachings and if we all just took His advice we'd be a better society. But that's not what God is after. Those are all by-products only. We have been self-polluted by sin, and it's only by becoming something completely new that we can be made whole again.Lewis gets into a lot of theology, but from a very practical and reverent perspective. \\"The Son of God became a man to enable men to become sons of God.\\" He has already done the work for us; we have only but to accept it. Here Lewis explains that we're all very much like tin soldiers. If you were to try to explain to a tin soldier (if it could speak) about what real people are like, and that it could become one, it might not much like the idea. It would be a long, painful process of veins coming in with bones and everything else. It might be quite unpleasant. But if he would just let it happen, he would experience something far greater than he could ever have imagined as being a mere tin soldier.We are all in the same place, even though we tend to rank people. We tend to look at some people as more evil than others. But we're all tin soldiers without Christ. It's only through the Gospel that we become real people, sons of God. He then writes, \\"A world of nice people, content in their own niceness, looking no further, turned away from God, would be just as desperately in need of salvation as a miserable world - and might even be more difficult to save.\\"In conclusion Lewis explains that the seed of real life was started in Christ, and that we merely need to accept it to start transforming into a creature with a nature like God's. We are born spiritual babies through Him, but if we keep walking and trusting we will eventually become just like Him, though likely in the life after this one.MY REVIEWOf course I just skimmed the top of this wonderful book. If you want more detail I suggest reading it. No book seems to stir me like this one does. Here Lewis talks about Christianity likes it's both real and poetic, like it's inspiring yet intensely practical. I love that, because that mirrors my own experience with Christ.He's a bit like Shakespeare. If you read Lewis enough you start to think like him, just like I've found myself thinking a little in Old English if I read Shakespeare very much. Once you're in his own version of the English language, his writing is like a refreshing glass of cold water. It is as if he knows real English, and that you've been taught a plastic version all your life. Writing like that about something as grand as Christianity, the reason for existence, really helps make Christianity seem a bit like that as well: the only life that really makes sense.This is, in my opinion, the most helpful and inspiring book outside the Bible ever written."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I can see why this is clearly a timeless classic and why it continues to do so well in the market, nearly half a century after it's original printing. Lewis has a style that is unique, metaphoric and engaging that cannot be imitated by another. While professing ignorance in the area of theology (and technically he is unqualified in the academic sense), he displays a keen pedestrian sense of those things central to the Christian life and mystery. He hits the nail on the head, to invoke the clich&eacute;, when focusing on what is truly essential and what could serve as a focus for interdenominational dialogue.I cannot recommend this volume of Lewis's work enough! It is certainly a must-read for all in the theological, philosophical or literary field, and really speaks to the heart of all people. It is witty, blunt and intelligent. Read it today!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is a book that every Christian should read.

I believe it is a must read for intellectuals of any faith. C. S. Lewis converted to faith late in his life and has a unique perspective. In this book he shows respect to other religions speaking on the great pragmatic teachings of all religions. He admits that Jesus was either God or insane and their is no middle ground based on what the bible records of his claims. He also discusses how people are the world's most valuable resource because their soul is immortal while governments,businesses, and everything else of the world is only temporary. This book approaches Christianity from a fearless standpoint and probes its reality deeply. If you like to search your soul and think, buy this book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I found this book very well written. C.S. Lewis has a way of leading the reader through a logical progression of thoughts and uses examples that you can relate to in explaining various principles throughout the book. It's a good overview of Christianity for someone seeking the basic framework of beliefs agreed upon by all Christians, regardless of the particular religious expression of those beliefs (i.e.- Catholic, Protestant, born again Christians, etc.)."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity is one of the two best logical logical cases for the Christian faith I have read. Lewis first brilliantly lays a foundation, logically showing that the universe (external and internal) demands logically that some form of God exists. He then compares various theories of God with what we find in reality, and finds that only the Christian one honestly stands. At this point, he continues into details of the Christian faith. Any one honestly seeking to understand Christianity, and/or trying to decide if it is true, will find a powerful, rational case here for &quot;yes.&quot; The other book I mentioned is Charles Colson's How Now Shall We Live, whose conlusions are based on real-life studies and experiences, rather the more pure logical base of Lewis' writing. They are two halves of a whole perspective, the theory and the application, and I would especially suggest both to any Christian reader."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"My first introduction to C.S.Lewis was in 1964 as required reading in an English Comp. class. I read &quot;What Christians Believe&quot; and it had such a profound effect on me that I look back and think that that was when I became a Christian. I said that &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; for me is &quot;Christianity Revisited&quot; because here I am 36 years later and just now finding out that &quot;What Christians Believe&quot; is an essay contained in this compilation of C.S.Lewis radio shows of many years ago. I started attending church and Bible study classes on a regular basis in May 1999 and I realize now that I've been a Christian for 36 years but was &quot;sleeping&quot; until just recently. I'm not finished with &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; yet. I'm just starting book 4 but I find myself reading and re-reading what I've already covered and dreading the fact that I'm almost finished with the book. I've come to Amazon.com to find more books like this one so I'll have another available when I finally finish &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;. I'm one that feels that, in order to really believe in anything whole-heartedly, one must question it from as many angles as possible. This book helps me do this. I'm sending a copy of this book to a person I know that is an atheist and either he will find something that he never knew or we'll have a lot to discuss. I would suggest this book to anyone.

Thanks!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis was a rare individual. One of the few non-clerics to be recognised as a theologian by the Anglican church, he put forth the case for Christianity in general in ways that many Christians beyond the Anglican world can accept, and a clear description for non-Christians of what Christian faith and practice should be. Indeed, Lewis says in his introduction that this text (or indeed, hardly any other he produced) will help in deciding between Christian denominations. While he describes himself as a 'very ordinary layman' in the Church of England, he looks to the broader picture of Christianity, particularly for those who have little or no background. The discussion of division points rarely wins a convert, Lewis observed, and so he leaves the issues of ecclesiology and high theology differences to 'experts'. Lewis is of course selling himself short in this regard, but it helps to reinforce his point.The book looks at beliefs, both from a 'natural' standpoint as well as a scripture/tradition/reason standpoint. Lewis looks both at belief and unbelief - for example, he states that Christians do not have to see other religions of the world as thoroughly wrong; on the other hand, to be an atheist requires (in Lewis' estimation) that one view religions, all religions, as founded on a mistake. Lewis probably surprised his listeners by starting a statement, 'When I was an atheist...' Lewis is a late-comer to Christianity (most Anglicans in England were cradle-Anglicans). Thus Lewis can speak with the authority of one having deliberately chosen and found Christianity, rather than one who by accident of birth never knew any other (although the case can be made that Lewis was certainly raised in a culture dominated by Christendom).Lewis also looks at practice - here we are not talking about liturgical niceties or even general church-y practices, but rather the broad strokes of Christian practice - issues of morality, forgiveness, charity, hope and faith. Faith actually has two chapters - one in the more common use of system of belief, but the other in a more subtle, spiritual way. Lewis states in the second chapter that should readers get lost, they should just skip the chapter - while many parts of Christianity will be accessible and intelligible to non-Christians, some things cannot be understood from the outside. This is the 'leave it to God' sense of faith, that is in many ways more of a gift or grace from God than a skill to be developed.Finally, Lewis looks at personality, not just in the sense of our individual personality, but our status as persons and of God's own personality. Lewis' conclusion that there is no true personality apart from God's is somewhat disquieting; Lewis contrasts Christianity with itself in saying that it is both easy and hard at the same time. Lewis looks for the 'new man' to be a creature in complete submission and abandonment to God. This is a turn both easy and difficult.'Mere Christianity' was originally a series of radio talks, published as three separate books - 'The Case for Christianity', 'Christian Behaviour', and 'Beyond Personality'. This book brings together all three texts. Lewis' style is witty and engaging, the kind of writing that indeed lives to be read aloud. Lewis debates whether or not it was a good idea to leave the oral-language aspects in the written text (given that the tools for emphasis in written language are different); I think the correct choice was made."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"First of all, let me say that I find the argument that \\"it is appalling that C.S. Lewis is writing as if Christianity were the ttruth\\" hilarious. The book \\"Mere Christianity\\" is written to explain what Christians believe, and, just like the Muslims and the Jews and the Hindus, we believe that our religion is true. Therefore I cannot fathom why someone would be surprised that the sentence \\"Christianity is true\\" would be in there. In fact, if I were reading a book about the beliefs of Islam from a devout Muslim and did NOT perceive that he believed \\"Islam is true\\" I would be a little worried about why that would not be stressed in the religion. Did that make any sense? I tend to babble.And many people have had complaints about the first part of his book, where he argues why there must be a deity, etc. As I discovered later, he is not giving an absolute, but simply letting the reader follow the path that he took in transitioning from an athiest to a Christian. First of all, let me just say it was incredibly more logical than anything I went through, but of course it is not pure logic. In any sort of decision anyone comes to (c'mon, I think even Spock admits to this on Star Trek), there is never nothing but pure logic. There is a bit of pure instinct involved, something beyond logic, which cannot be accounted for in words. So when there seem to be random jumps in his explanations or holes in his logic, I think that is the reason.Oookay. Anyway. I came into this book having my only other C.S. Lewis experience be \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" and naivly assumed that was simply how he wrote. So let me just say first off that I was knocked on the floor by the complexity and the thoughtfulness that went into his writing.There are, of course, flaws, like there are in any book; fiction, non-fiction, religious, secular, etc. As a rather modern teenage girl with a rather modern outlook on life and an innate hatred for the \\"glass ceiling\\" let me say that when I read his comments on the woman's place I had a distinct urge to go back in time, hurl feminist pamphlets at him, and burst into the song \\"You Don't Own Me\\" in the manner of the 3 women of \\"The First Wives Club.\\"But in some other instances I found him remarkably insightful. My favorite parts of the book were the ones where I would basically see him saying the exact opposite as those TV evangelists and ultra-conservative fundamentalist Christians I (and, I belive most people) have begun to get seriously sick of. In places where I was extremely afraid he would fall into the old super conservative, narrow minded view like so many of his contemporaries, I found him incredibly refreshing and even a bit liberal and open minded in his opinions.For the athiest, agnostic, and people of other religions considering this book: While it isn't an evangelical book bent on getting you hooked on Christianity if it's the last thing he does, it IS written from a Christian pov and explains the basics of what Christians believe under the assumption that Christianity is true. Please do not be thrown off balance by this. If you were writing something about what you believed, I would hope you would consider it to be true first."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is one of Lewis's most famous and oft-quoted works, and for good reason. It is an honest and intelligent - not to mention brilliantly written - examination of the many facets of the Christian faith and human nature: the existence of and belief in God, the Trinity, faith, love, pride, morality etc. Although written during World War Two, the subjects explored still resonate powerfully with contemporary concerns.I found the opening chapters particularly helpful in presenting a well-argued case for the rational foundations of Christianity, or at least belief in the existence of God. It offers a challenge to Christians to question the intellectual grounds for their faith, and the reassurance that sufficient answers can be found. Non-Christians looking to investigate the rational basis of Christianity, or of religion in general, will also find this an accessible and thought-provoking read.The book is also an ideal place to start for anyone thinking to dip into the non-fiction works of C. S. Lewis. No book in my opinion gives the reader a better first taste of the prolific author's delicious prose, keen intellect and razor-sharp wit.I cannot recommend this book more. For the Christian, for the non-Christian, and for the fan of \`good books': this is a must-read!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis is probably the best Christian writer for both believers and unbelievers to read. He dispels rumors that the orthodox Christian camp is one dominated by anti-intellectualism, thus being assertive with his Christianity; yet acknowledges the doubts of his past and the cleverness of his ideological opponents.I strongly believe that Christianity is under attack from two places. One place is from without; there will always be those who despise Christianity. The other, however, is not so obvious: an attack from within where Christians have become compromising and complacent with what is supposed to be the crucial areas of life and faith.I think Lewis is the ultimate and perfect blend of conviction and civility; and that is why his writing is so comforting as a supplement to Biblical texts. What he does is show that Christianity is a particular, identifiable thing. While this may fly in the face of postmodern anti-foundationalism and critique of \\"metanarratives,\\" mere Christianity sustains itself as not only a tenable, but the true, philosophy/religion.Lewis is also an artistic man who is highly creative, and \\"The Great Divorce\\" and \\"Screwtape Letters\\" are proof enough of that. He engages the Christian rationality, imagination, and spirit all at once, fulfilling the greatest commandment to love God with all that we are. I highly recommend him to anyone."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"\\"Apologetics? I am a Christian and there is nothing for which I need to apologize for\\". So the story goes, these are the words that were once uttered by a student of theology in a college class. In reality Apologetics is that field of Christianity that aims to argue out the fundamentals of the Christian faith. It is a field that gives reason for the existence of God. C.S Lewis was perhaps the master apologist of our time and his book \`Mere Christianity' surely shows us why.\`Mere Christianity' provides a compelling argument for the existence of God as well as for our purpose in God's creation. Indeed Lewis begins his discussions by considering how our own morality reveals such a purpose, noting how there is an underlying moral law that spans across different religions and civilizations. What does this moral law tell us about God? According to Lewis, the moral law to which we abide tells of a God that is fair, unselfish, honest and of good faith.Christianity as well as Judaism and Islam are what Lewis calls \`fighting religions'- that is religions that describe a conflict between good and evil. Unlike the pantheistic view of Hinduism, in these three religions God exists outside of His creation. God is the masterful designer that is ever present outside of His own design. Within this framework, Lewis writes of evil as a constant search for the perversion of what is good in the creation. Bad is really good gone bad- exactly what Christianity teaches about Satan being a fallen angel.Perhaps disappointingly Lewis does not consider in detail the question of why a benevolent God would allow evil to enter into His creation although he has written other books that deal with precisely this question. Nevertheless, one conclusion that he does draw is that it is through God's supreme love that He has endowed His creatures with a free will and that therefore evil is a natural consequence of that freedom. Equally important to Lewis' argument is the central claim of Christianity- that God sent his son as a sacrificial lamb to die for human sin.Christianity teaches how Christ came to earth to suffer and be crucified so that He might take away all the sins of humanity and thereby conquer evil. As Lewis argues, that God should send his only son to die for man is the best possible evidence that He truly cares about man's predicament. Repentance is what we in turn need to go through if we are to receive the benefits of Christ's crucifixion. But we cannot achieve this repentance on our own- we need God's love inside of us to be able to succeed in this endeavor. The Christian belief is that if we accept the redemptive power of the pain that Jesus endured on the cross then we too will share in His conquest of death. As Lewis adds, Christ is able to transform us- make men out of the \`tin toy soldiers' that we are- and thereby give us new life in Him. God works on us to remove our self-centered attitudes and our false masks, to make our bodies into \`palaces' so that He can dwell in us during our time on earth.The principle reason for rejecting the existence of an absolute law is the perception that it straight-jackets us to behave in a certain way. But it only stands to reason that if man is to lead a good life and find joy in his life, he should be bound by certain rules and regulations. It is important to remember that the moral law is about more that just how we relate to others- it is also about our behavior within ourselves and how this affects our relationship with God. Since Christian teachings claim that our bodies were created, so we must respect our bodies as \`tenants' and not as \`land owners' of God's property. Within this context Lewis describes how the Christian virtues of prudence, temperance, justice, fortitude, chastity, forgiveness and charity define God's design for our minds and bodies. As we fall prey to pride and selfish ambition, we run into the danger of considering ourselves more important than God and forgetting these virtues. God calls us to something very different- to love Him and to delight and be humbled in His awesome power. There is no bargaining with God. Communicating with Him depends on our admission of spiritual bankruptcy. As Lewis repeatedly comments, we cannot have a relationship with God until we realize our dependency on Him.Hope in an eternal existence beyond our earthly lives is one factor that distinguishes the Christian from the non-believer in today's world. While secular thinkers look for a lasting satisfaction in the material, the Christian pins his hopes on the life beyond, seeing as his mission the task of winning others for Christ. As Christians we yearn for something that is foreign to the reality that we experience here on earth. Indeed Lewis' last chapter provides quite a radical extension to the ideas he has considered in the rest of his book, telling of the moral evolution of man into a new being- a being that is ready to give up his selfishness for God.While I do not necessarily subscribe to the notion of an evolutionary \`moral perfectioning' of man during his time here on earth, Lewis overall argument for a future existence is compelling. Indeed his final charge to us is to look beyond ourselves to the promise of an eternal life. As he concludes \\"Look for yourself, and you will find in the long run only hatred, loneliness, despair, rage, ruin, and decay. But look for Christ and you will find Him, and with Him everything else thrown in\\".For that theological student who said he had nothing to apologize for in his faith in Christ, he was absolutely right. But as Lewis has revealed in \`Mere Christianity' the added bonus to his faith is even more enticing; for not only does he not have anything to apologize for but he has everything to look forward to."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S.

Thankfully, this book confirmed all of those positive remarks and did much more.Lewis has an incredible writing style which enables him to express the key concepts of Christianity in layman's terms, thus making it easier for the non-Christian to make sense of it. My favorite sentence in the book is one that I remember Christian apologist Douglas Geivett mentioning in a debate, and is in Chapter 10 - Hope. The author states \\"If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world...\\"Lewis goes on to talk about the ongoing battle that man endures between his desire for autonomy and the subjugation of his will to the Will of God. He explains that what appears to be the difficult path in the short-run turns out to be most beneficial and rewarding in the long term. I also found his thoughts about the trinity to be quite interesting. The author states that when praying to God, it is helpful to consider Jesus as standing beside you, assisting you in your prayers and the Holy Spirit to be behind you or within you.The only contention that I wish to make is concerning \\"Lewis' Trilemma\\" (the assertion that either Jesus was Lord, a Liar or a Lunatic). I personally don't believe that these are not the only conclusions that one can draw from his teachings, however this does not prevent me from giving this book a 5-star rating. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Loved kindle for iPad can't go wrong I buy as many books as possible this way.

I was greatly affected by Lewis' style of reasoning. He uses finely-tuned analogies and plain language to get the reader to see things from a point of view they may not have considered before. This book really gets to the fundamentals of Christianity in a common sensical way. It is an especially great read for 3 types of people:- A new believer trying to understand the faith more (which is how I found myself reading the book the first time)- A non-believer who is simply curious and wants to gain some insight into what all these crazy Christians are always harping on about- A mature believer who wants to--indeed, needs to--revisit the fundamentals of his faith (which is how I found myself reading the book the second time)"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The detail and depth of arguments is incredible.

A great collection of books for anyone interested in participating in a higher education discussion of modern day Christianity and theology."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Originally a series of radio broadcasts, Mere Christianity is the capstone of C S Lewis's work to address the skepticism of the modern age and an encouragement to individual believers battling an environment that is hostile to Christian thinking. By its very title, the book attempts to describe the cornerstones of the Christian faith against the backdrop of a skeptical age that has lost much of its understanding of the core of the Christian faith. Speaking passionately as a layman, with all the imprecision entailed therein, that that entails, Lewis attempts to precisely describe the basics of the core of Christianity, while being deliberately vague about the disagreeable matters that have divided various Christian groups and have led to misunderstandings about the core teachings of the faith.The addresses that make up Mere Christianity were delivered in an environment that could best be described as a deep crisis in Great Britain in particular and in the West in general. In the midst of the conflagration of World War II, rampant theological liberalism, philosophical naturalism and humanism and the pressures of the post - Industrial Revolution, Lewis's arguments in Mere Christianity achieved a long-lasting audience because they simply articulated answers of eternal issues within the context of a discordant world.Mere Christianity is organized deductively. Lewis begins by leading towards theism by starting with the argument of natural law. But he approaches this knowledge with the assumption that we see through a glass darkly. That we first know God, not usually by a direct encounter with Him, but by seeing how God works within the lives of individuals, and not necessarily by any sort of miraculous work.Mere Christianity, for the secular world, soundly refutes the thinking that says that men just need to behave, be well adjusted and live sanely. For Lewis, the problem is not that men are mal adjusted and unhappy, but that they are not moral. The actions that men try to change the most, external actions such as appearance and social etiquette, do not change what needs to be changed - the immoral actions that offend a moral God. Here the thought is put forth that it is much better to be a just man than to perform just actions. The speed of modern secular society demands nothing more than that we perform just, and polite, actions towards each another.For the Christian in the church who is attacked from within and without, Lewis presents a two-fold approach. First, one must know that the faith is much easier than expected from the world. Secondly, that within a church that at times decays from within, the faith is much harder than is expected. For the modern, secular world there are no answers, only platitudes. As Lewis said, \\"What point is there in learning to steer a boat if all boats are old leaking tubs\\"? Christ invaded the world to make men adopted sons, and believers in Him are slowly being turned into grand ships that work as they were originally designed. For the church, Lewis offers hard encouragement. Temperance, for example, is more than avoidance of alcohol. It is the avoidance of all things that can be good, but are turned into idolatrous behavior. The ultimate encouragement of Mere Christianity is that men would not only know the core of the faith, but that they would be encouraged to have their very core changed by the dynamic One who invaded the earth."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity is taken from a series of radio lectures Lewis gave in the 1940s, and was originally published in three volumes. Here, Lewis lays out the basics of Christian doctrine, focusing on those things we can agree on rather than on issues that run toward the controversial. This is not a scholarly work; it was written by a layperson for laypeople, and is based more in logic and rhetoric than anything else.Lewis is able to pick and choose between what is fundamentally important and what is not foundational to true Christianity. He addresses human nature, the nature of God, common sense, faith and reason, and morality, and on the whole uses great illustrations to do so. Lewis also sticks to his guns on the more unpopular tenets of Christianity.The book is highly readable; Lewis has a humorous, engaging style, and while the chapters flow together in sequence, they are relatively self-contained.There are gaps in Lewis's logic here and there, and at times he is slightly off the doctrinal mark (on love for enemies, for example), but on the whole he provides new and refreshing ways to look at Christianity.

Lewis humbly tells the reader (again and again) that he isn't a professional theologian, but I can't imagine that a professional would have done any better at thinking things through and doing it in such an entertaining way. I understand that the book came from radio talks or lectures. The text may not be actual transcripts, but I don't think much rewriting was done as it reads like a lecture...very natural. I also think that I probably enjoyed this book even more because it was written by someone from another time. Although it is intended for a general audience it isn't exactly a light read. Just as the old TV commentaries by Edward R. Murrow were intended for the average TV viewer of his day (despite their sophistication) so too these thoughts (although intended for everyone) are a bit complex."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is a very intelligent and logical look at the basis of not only Christianity but at spirituality in the larger sense. As a former Atheist, he shares his own unique path to discovering a higher being and finally how that lead to his belief in Christianity. I thoroughly enjoyed this perspective as one who was raised in a very strict Christian home is now looking to define religion on a more personal level. He shares (and reminds some of us of)the most basic Christian doctrines which are often overshadowed these days by moral and social issues. Obviously a great read for non-believers who are seeking. Keep in mind while reading that this was written over 50 years ago and times have changed therefore so more modern ideals are not addressed."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Lewis has a way of taking giant concepts of religion and explaining it down so that the average joe can understand.

I would say that parts of the book are very well written apologetics, but since there are various books in this one volume, there are also different styles and genres...The two works that are closest to fiction resemble different aspects of various prose, with \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" being written in a form of collected letters.I can only endorse this book: It has been very helpful in understanding my faith and the varieties in the different denominations, because it was written with much wisdom and insight that many people can prosper from."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Most people have no idea about what Christianity is. That is the reason that CS Lewis' book exists.If you are looking for a book that will convince you to take the leap of faith and become a Christian (like so many 1-star reviewers who said they were unconvinced) then don't waste your time. No book will convince you. However, if you are looking for the facts about real Christianity (not as a religion, but as a relationship) then you can't do much better than Lewis. Although his voice is rather formal (read: evidently British), seekers will give him some latitude on this. If you want the egg, get past the shell.As an aside, I personally did not become a Christian because of the 'scientific facts,' although I did assure myself that I wasn't committing intellectual suicide by doing so. I used to be very fond of evolution. If you want this same validation, you can either talk to a Christian who knows the facts (as I did), or read something like what Lewis has presented. Simple.If everybody read this book, I can imagine at least a few of the following would happen:1. Most people in Western culture would stop calling themselves Christians, and would either become one or become a real athiest. They would at least be standing for something instead of falling for anything.2. Other cultures would stop saying ignorant things like \\"America (or wherever) is a Christian nation.\\" The facts in Lewis' work speak against this. They would stop saying that they have a holy war against these so-called Christians (who are in fact not Christians at all.)3. Heaven forbid, some people might realize the inheritance and gift they could receive and actually choose to find out about God by taking an Alpha course or reading that \\"Bible\\" thing ;)If you like reading novels, you'll probably find the book dry until the last chapter. But don't miss this book on that account. Even if you read only the last chapter (about the next evolution of humanity), you'll have captured a significant (and inspiring) picture of real (er, Mere) Christianity. When you do, you might just be tempted to go back and read the book and see what all the fuss is about (and how he could possibly make such an outrageous statement.)Well , that was long and rant-ish. But I love you all and I hope you read this book.Look at my Listmania for some ideas about other crucial books like Sacred Marriage by Gary Thomas.Feel free to contact me.Cheers,Danny"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Okay, before I begin, I will say that I just got this book today, and have not yet begun to read it, BUT my mom is a psychologist and gives this book to most of her clients that are not christians.

First of all, Christianity isn't loosing converts, you must be thinking of rational materialism. Yes all societies have some concept of right and wrong. The few individuals who don't are usually institutionalized. Find a sane man who claims to a moral relatist than kick him in the stomach. See how relative that is."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis presents a disappointing defense of Christianity and Christian Ethics. The primary advantage of this work is that it is clearly written, and uses many analogies to help illustrate its points to the reader. The major disadvantage, however, is that these analogies and analysis are far too simplistic. By introducing an analogy Lewis merely assumes it as proof of the very thing he is trying to argue. Page after page is filled with analogy and reasoning which seems to rest on an undefended assumption. His argument that Christ was either \\"Divine or a Madman\\" for calling himself the Son of God, and that therefore we must believe the former is really ludicrous. Any number of persons have been false prophets and made false claims, but because the claims are outrageous doesn't mean we must accept them. If Christ is any different, he has not shown how Christ's ideas were different, which is where he should have gone. I write this from the perspective of one friendly to the Christian religion and its ethics, and simply don't think Lewis has done a very good job in arguing for the Christian religion. Too many of his arguments are really thinly veiled theological assumptions that are uncritically presented in two-dimensional depth."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is not a review of Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis was a genius.This is on the quality or better yet the lack of quality of the manufacture of this book; the paper is the cheapest grade imagineable,the binding is also very low grade, and to top it off the publisher didn't cut the pages evenly.I thought for the price they were charging the paper and binding would be of good quality, needless to say I was greatly mistaken.Buy a paperpack edition from another publisher, you'll get a much better made book and save money at the same time."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The Book is not for \\"sissies\\" or for those who hold \\"a boy's philosophy\\" but is for real men (and women, I use men and man in a universal sense) who wish to grapple with some of the most basic questions of existence. One reviewer states he believes Lewis on shaky ground with his central argument that Christ must be divine. Well let me state it as plainly as I can. If you believe anything about Christ, whether he be demon, devil, or teacher and master, you must realize that Christ himself allows no other belief than that he is divine. Because Christ said very clearly and without any argument that he was God in the flesh, He called God his father, and He said He and God were one. Thus you can have only one of two opinions of who Christ was. Either he was whom he said or else he was a lunatic of the worst kind. Christ left no room for the interpretation some make that he is a 'good teacher' or a 'moral man'. A good teacher would never say he was God in the flesh unless it was true, and if it is true then any nonsense about his being anything less is foolishness. That is the mastery of Lewis who is a master of linguistics, and the English language. If people will simply look at what language means, much modern nonsense would cease to bother."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This book is gigantic--the size of an over-sized coffee table book.

Unfortunately, it did not. The book's logic is often (usually!) shoddy and I learned more by visiting a church one day and speaking to the pastor for 15 minutes than from reading this entire book.I don't know, I didn't care for this book. It is well written in an easy to read fashion, but don't let that fool you: behind its pretty exterior lies a whole lot of gobbledy-gook and nonsense. If you want intelligent Christian thought, go talk to an educated member of the clergy because you won't find it here."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I'm an agnostic, which pretty much means that the only thing I know for certain is that I know nothing for certain. Hence, in reading this title, I naturally had a tendency to question the arguments presented.Overall I found that C.S. Lewis' work, while smartly written, was an exercise in fallacies. I'm not criticizing his belief or his talent for writing (I thoroughly enjoyed his Narnia stories growing up), but I think his arguments for those beliefs does have what most would call holes in them. And yes, his views are a bit unconventional by today's standards, (but then again he did write some time ago, so that's an understandable trait.)I can see why so many Christians would enjoy the book. What's not to enjoy for them, it reinforces their beliefs. If you're already skeptical of the religion's arguments for being the one and only truth, this will most likely deepen the seed of distrust in your head. If you are a believer, then hey, here's some christian soup for the soul.What I find most discouraging is that with the previous reviews, there is a tendency for reviews that praise the book to receive larger amounts of votes towards the review itself being helpful. Those that criticized the book tend to get lower votes. Why is that? A review is generally a descriptive opinion of something. Whether or not the review speaks highly of the product shouldn't prove if it's helpful or not. In my opinion any review that provides details is helpful.It really looks like those religious souls that believe in what C.S. Lewis did are offended that someone would criticize their views, and therefore have chosen to vote against the review being helpful. Seriously, look at the reviews and you should see the trend.That's very sad that so many folks can't get past the fact that everyone's entitled to different opinions and I think it speaks volumes for why religion has divided so many in the world.I know, I digressed from the original topic of the book, but I couldn't help it. Pick up the book and read it, you'll most likely either embrace it or discard it, there's rarely an in between. The one star is for the style and talent of writing.So was this review helpful, or merely offensive to Christians? Let's see what the votes say... (I'm guessing 2 out of 20 will find this helpful.)"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"While this is often held up as a paragon of clear, concise, and convincing apologetics, Mere Christianity is logically weak, filled with antiquated views, and ignorant of some basic social science.To begin with, Lewis likes to raise objections to his arguments, imaging that these are the very things a non-believer might say in response to his claims. However, most of these objections are petty and insignificant, easily refuted and not anything a serious non-Christian would raise as an objection.For example, he likes to use the Lord/Lunatic/Liar argument for the divinity of Jesus (see Book 2 Chapter 3). It goes as follows: Jesus claimed to be God. Either he was indeed God, or he was a lunatic for claiming it, or he was an outright liar. This argument is a non-argument for at least two reasons. As Lewis argues, \\"It seems obvious to me that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend\\" (Book 2 Chapter 4). It seems obvious to Lewis, but not to me.To begin with, there are more than three possible explanations here. Perhaps he never did claim to be God. Or perhaps he was misquoted in the Gospels. On the other hand, we can't so easily dismiss the lunatic or liar possibility as Lewis likes to think. We have to remember that Jesus lied at least once. \\"'Go to the festival yourselves. I am not going to this festival, for my time has not yet fully come.' After saying this, he remained in Galilee. But after his brothers had gone to the festival, then he also went, not publicly but as it were in private\\" (John 7.8-10 RSV). In addition, the lunatic label, while somewhat un-PC, might indeed fit, for Jesus once cursed a fig tree because it wasn?t bearing fruit, though it wasn't in season.He also makes the bizarre argument in Book 2 Chapter 2 that Christianity is real because it's too bizarre to have been made up. In other words, it's true because it's weird. I guess that makes all science fiction stories true as well.In arguing for basic theism, Lewis makes a little linguistic switch and then makes something out of it. He begins by using the word \\"law\\" descriptively (i.e., gravity) and the switches to a prescriptive use of \\"law (i.e., morality). He then makes much of this fact without acknowledging that that in fact is all he's done. It's a language trick, not in any way a proof of god.Not only is Lewis book illogical, it is steeped in antiquated ideas. He subscribes to the idea of constant societal, moral progress (i.e., we as a society are becoming more and more morally enlightened) a la Comte even though this claim has widely been disputed by both historians and sociologists. He also shows an ignorance of basic sociology, and seems never to have read a single work of Durkheim (who could easily explain whence comes this internal ?moral law? that Lewis basis so much of his argument on).A good example of his sociological ignorance comes when discussing the nature of Jesus? sacrifice in Book 2 Chapter 4. He makes the analogy that Jesus? sacrifice was not as much receiving punishment as paying a debt we all owe to God. That?s fine and good until we stop to think about what ?debt? is. In short, it is a societal construction. A debt is simply saying ?I owe you money.? What happens if we don?t pay it? According to nature, nothing. We won?t drop dead of a heart attack or break out in a rash. Instead, society allows the person owed to punish the debtor if the debt is not paid. One could easily imagine a society where there was no concept of debt. In this society, you can give money to your friend, but you cannot expect or even desire for the friend to pay it back.Another example of antiquated ideas is his sexism. Describing the Christian marriage, Lewis says, ?There must be something unnatural about the rule of wives over husbands, because the wives themselves are half ashamed of it and despise the husbands whom they rule? (Book 3 Chapter 6). Not only is that a sexist statement, but, like most such statements, it is a sweeping generalization that presumes to see into the heart of thousands of women whom Lewis might describe as ruling over their husbands.In short, Mere Christianity is a disappointment. It offers no new insight into Christianity and is in fact chock full of logical fallacies and ignorance. Any educated non-believer will remain unconvinced."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I have already reviewed this purchase. Now please leave us alone until we buy something else!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I was referred to this book by a Christian acquaintance. She labeled it as \\"masterfully logical.\\" There were countless times while reading the book that I would literally laugh out loud at the contrast between that description and what Lewis was actually saying.Apparently this book is considered to be one of the most influential and best works ever written in defense of Christianity. If that is the case, then the defense of Christianity is in a sad state. Of course, as an unbeliever I'm unlikely to affirm the conclusions of a book like this, but I have seen intelligent arguments for theism such as Plantinga's \\"analogous mind\\" argument. Even though I disagree that the argument is ultimately persuasive, I'll concede it is well-made and thought-provoking. I can't offer the same praise for any of the arguments in C. S. Lewis's Mere Christianity.The famous trilemma (liar, lunatic, or lord) found here is astonishingly stupid (or possibly just intentionally misleading) because it assumes that the Gospels are indeed \\"gospel\\" and ignores the best explanation of a liberal mixing of mythologizing and embellishment that almost undoubtedly occurred in the numerous decades from the life of \\"Jesus\\" to the time the gospels were written. A reasonably intelligent first grader could point out this glaring problem.The discussions centering on ethics and morality are very nave and show a lack of awareness of large areas of philosophy, not to even mention moral psychology and basic social psychology. To be fair though, the latter two weren't very well-developed fields in Lewis's day, but it is nevertheless inexcusable that someone who thinks they have something interesting to say on ethics doesn't even display awareness of basic things like the Euthyphro dilemma. One can get 95% of the substance of Lewis' system of morality by stopping and listening to the next street-corner preacher you come across.The remainder of Lewis's arguments are not very noteworthy. They essentially boil down to reifying intuition in a nave form of anthropomorphism. This is actually quite understandable since this is exactly what the cognitive science of religion claims religion is (seeSupernatural Agents: Why We Believe in Souls, Gods, and Buddhas). But to take one's nave intuition and to try to pass it off as rational argument is insulting.Lewis continually, unapologetically, and obliviously asserts there is intentionality lurking behind causality in realms outside the human social domain (the only place it unquestionably resides). This intentionality must have an agent and it must be supernatural; therefore God. That's Lewis' argument in a nutshell and it is ridiculous."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"If you read any of Dawkin's books, (The God Delusion,The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution,The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design), you will see that all of C.S.

I was very disappointed as many have spoken well of this book.His &quot;argument&quot; would only appeal to someone who is already a Christian; non-Christians who are looking for a good logical argument supporting Christianity will be disappointed.The book's version of a water-down version of Plato's theory of forms--spiced up with a touch of Aristotle--represents, at best, middle-brow religious theorizing."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis builds foundations of logic based on faulty black or white situations, and then expounds his theories upon the trembling base beneath. The further an objective human being gets, the less steady the footing becomes. It is inconceivable to me that such a book can occupy a revered position to otherwise objective people. Of course, objective individuals are not the target audience. If you are a Christian, then this book will most likely confirm that you are indeed the best, the smartest, and the only truly righteous in the only way such a thing can be confirmed: Through rationalization, circular logic, and outright self-delusion. The misogyny and blatant hatred imbued in this dogma-filled tripe is offensive.

This is not a bad book if you're looking for a plausible excuse to be religious; but if you're not afraid to take a closer look at Christianity, read something like Dan Barker's &quot;Losing Faith in Faith&quot;. Or, for a closer look at religion in general, read Campbell's four-book series entitled &quot;The Masks of God&quot;."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Lewis makes a solid case for Christianity in this highly readable series of talks he delivered on the BBC. Lewis' common-sense approach, and easy-to-understand analogies catch the reader unawares. One finds him or herself agreeing with Lewis, even when one is unsure what it is one has agreed to.In Book 1 Lewis makes the case for morality, or what he terms &quot;the law of human nature&quot; written upon men's hearts. In Book 2, he examines the competing conceptions of God and makes the case for Christ. Here he states that all Christian denominations tend to hold 3 things in common - these being baptism, belief (faith), and Holy Communion. In Book 3, he examines the Cardinal virtues, the theological virtues, and the importance of living virtuously. And in Book 4 he leads the reader into the doctrine of the Trinity and what this means for the believer.An Anglican himself, who avoided speaking of Catholicism, contrary to the direction many have taken this book, Lewis argues against a kind of non-denominationalism. He says that if Christianity is viewed as a hallway inside of a mansion, his job is merely to bring us into the hallway. Which room we enter, he says, is up to us, but he does argue that the worst room is still better than remaining in the hallway.Readers desiring to learn more about what led to Lewis' conversion to Christianity should read G.K. Chesterton's &quot;The Everlasting Man,&quot; as Lewis has said that this book greatly influenced his belief in Christ."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is, from what I've read from him, C.S. Lewis' best book. It's jam-packed with so much wit and wisdom; like the Bible, reading it more than once will prove rewarding. The first chapters deal a lot with &quot;belief&quot; in God, while the later ones simple talk about living a life of Christianity. Both sides are a great read, even if you feel like you're doing okay in both areas (Mere Christianity will defenitely reveal something that needs to be fixed in your life).It can be pretty confusing in spots, so only read this if you WANT to.

Lewis, and I must say that I am truly impressed. Only Mr. Lewis can tackle some of the most complicated questions of the Christian religion and explain them in the way that a child could understand but a scholar could ponder for hours. Truly remarkable!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C.S. Lewis explains why Christians believe and what Christians believe, writing in an gripping and easy-to-understand style. He doesn't assume any prior knowledge of Christian beliefs, but Christians well-versed in doctrine will still find the book fascinating.I read this book every few years to remind myself of the basics."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"A helpful and wise commentary about the basics of Christianity, written for the layman yet helpful for anyone. Excellent."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Compelling to say the least, Lewis brings Christian apologetics to an everyman level. Without sophisticated or complex methods, a quick and solid foundation for faith is laid out. The popularity of this work speaks for itself (just look at the other reviews!). Hopefully, such a down-to-earth approach will soon be adopted by theologian authors of our time."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"An interesting examination of why Christians believe as they do. Yet, although compelling reading, it did not convince me of the validity of Christianity"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Religious or athiest (which, one could argue, is a religion itself), all will agree that Lewis was a master of his craft. Few men possess the talent to strip an issue down to its core, exposing its true (or the author's view of the truth) value. Other apologists, like Chesterton, get bogged down and easily lose the reader. Lewis, on the other hand, has a knack for making the most complex appear trivially simple.For those who reject Christianity, Lewis offers at the very least an exercise in logic and reasoning. He'll begin an argument with simple reasoning, akin to &quot;you agree that two plus two equals 4, corrct?&quot;, and then before you know it, he'll trap you in a logical parlor trick, forcing you to either accept his reasoning, or argue that two plus two does not equal four.It takes a few readings of some passages to discover some errors (as I percieve them)in his assumptions. He writes with such lucidity and confidence that you'll find yourself mesmerized and nodding along with him. But he lost me at the pivotal point, where he argues for Christ's divinity.Lewis warns us of those who would look to Jesus as a moral teacher, and not as the Son of God, saying that they then are placing their trust at what would be, by their denial of Christ as Savior, in the hands of a lunatic. If Christ is not God, than he was insane; for only an insane man would argue that he was the Son of God. Thus, you must completely dismiss Jesus as a relevant moral teacher, or accept his divinity. I believe Lewis is on shaky ground here.A popular example to argue the contrary is the story of John Nash, popularized by the movie A Beautiful Mind. Nash was insane - certifiably so - yet that doesn't preclude mathemeticians from accepting his mathematical ideas as correct. Granted mathematics and religion are not the same (but probably closer than most would like to believe), but I think the point is still valid - &quot;insanity&quot; does not preclude someone from the validity of their work. I am not arguing that Christ was insane, I'm just trying to illustrate that the pivotal argument of the apology is on very shaky ground. I can accept his arguments regarding the internal moral law and such, but I expected a much better argument for the most important issue an apologist can address - the divinity of Jesus Christ.But it is still worth 4 stars for the greatness of his writing, and its excellent treatise on &quot;What Christians Believe&quot;. At the very least, this book will force you to think - a dying art itself."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The title shoud be changed to &quot;I'm now a Christian and here's why....&quot; I won't even bother to discuss the silly analogies and ridiculous attempts at logic to be found in this &quot;masterpeice&quot; of his. This book is great to Christians merely because it is a written example of one who has &quot;chosen the light&quot; and had a PhD, hooray! Also, the mere idea that there's still a war between science and religion in 2001 should baffle everyone and those responsible should find better, more constructive things to do with their life. If you are seeking the Truth, look to those whom you trust and ask them. Or look inside yourself for the answers, most are already there. Good luck to everyone and may God have mercy on your souls."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Perhaps I'm confused, but by Book II: Part 3 'The Shocking Alternative', it seems to me that with the sentence &quot;God created things which had free will&quot;, C.S. Lewis had decided that the concept of &quot;god&quot; is a given, and the Christian view that &quot;this is a good world that has gone wrong, but still retains the memory of what it ought to have been&quot; becomes the basis upon which the remained of the book is built.Maybe I misunderstood, but it is at this point he lost my interest.

He is concise and brilliant and an all around master of his craft. Please read this book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This novel changed the way I acted, spoke, thought, and carried myself every single day. I was turned on to this book by my Younglife leader and I was a little hesitant to read it because of the old English style of writing. I was thoroughly surprised to find that every single sentence had meaningful content to my life. From Christians who are trying to find an amazing read about their religion to the person that is not too sure that there is a God out there, this book will give you knowledge and will provoke your thoughts in a way that you could never have imagined.The first Book in this novel revolves around such an amazing topic. The first book helps us understand why there is a God. C.S. does an exceptional job in describing God without using the words 'Lord', 'Savior', or 'Father'.C.S. describes God in a way that makes you truly believe in a greater force then the ones we see on Earth. I read this book to find answers to my questions about God and why He does the things He does. I definitely found the answers in this book. It is imperative to take these words from 'Mere Christianity' to heart because knowledge is only useful and meaningful if you put this knowledge into practice. C.S. takes such an unknown and occasionally uncomfortable topic and creates a well organized piece that helps you understand who God is and why you need Him in your life.This novel makes you think. It creates these thought provoking questions and ideas that you truly have to think about for a couple days. I heard ideas from this book that I had never thought were relevant in my life but I soon found out that they were the centerfolds. C.S. also address the fact that we are human, which we rarely think about. We are all the same and we need God in all the same ways when it comes down to it. C.S. writes with such passion and connects with aspects of our lives, which many books can never do.This book will make you dive into the parts of your brain that you have never explored before. This book will make you look at the world in a new way. This book will raise your consciousness about Our Creator. This book will help you understand the aspects about God that you question or aspects that you have never heard before. This book will blow your mind but also calm it. This book is an exceptional read strictly because C.S. takes a very controversial, and occasionally awkward topic and creates a novel that puts it in perspective. I strongly recommend this book if you have ever questioned your life or the Lord that created you. C.S. creates another epic classic in Mere Christianity."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"There is nothing empty or shallow in CS Lewis' explanation of the truths of Christianity. While expressing idealogogical facts, he using allegorical and practical references throughout this masterpiece. Mr. Lewis is engaging and yet down to earth. He does not elaborate on one set of Christian precepts to the exclusion of others. He covers a wide range of beliefs without bias.It is clear from his explanations of Christian principles that he has struggled to attain the insight and knowledge to express Christianity with such clarity. I will listen to this CD over and over.....it never loses its originality."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"One of the best books on Christianity I have ever read. This book was given to me by a former agnostic who is now a Christian and much of the conversion was from this book. C S Lewis somehow manages to give practical reasoning to a subject I thought could only be taken on faith. I highly recommend to anyone who wants answers to questions about Christianity that no one else can answer in such a practical way."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Brilliant book!! I found myself nodding in agreement through 90% of this book. His chapter on marriage seemed a bit biased and naive, nevertheless, I can not deny I walked away from this book with several epiphanies and the desire to return to it again."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Next to the Bible, this is the best book I've ever read! About 2/3 of the way through this book, it hit me what it meant to call myself a Christian."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"The author is a skilled writer. He tells you what things mean and don't mean in many different ways. He really knows how to zero in on difficult concepts using common language. He gives you, based on your own experience, an insight into what the idea of Heaven is all about.But on page 165 Mr. Lewis was not as complete in his explanation as he normally is. He writes, \\"We cannot compete in simplicity with people who are inventing religions. How could we? We are dealing with Facts. Of course anyone can be simple if he has no facts to bother about.\\" And he ends without an explanation of exactly what are the Facts he is thinking of here. A brief list would have been very helpful. The doctrine taught in many mainline churches states, that reason and faith must not contradict and that faith is a supernatural gift. Is he drifting away from this doctrine here or is he just too brief? A clarification or a reference to previous pages (since there is no index) where the Facts may have been already dealt with would have yielded the fifth star."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"One of the best summations of what Christians believe. This book is full of insights into human behavior and as it is written from an apologist's perspective is very helpful for those seeking to defend the faith."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Perhaps the clearest and most logically argued defense of Christian faith ever written. An excellent introduction to Christianity for new converts to the faith or those who have questions about why Christians believe as they do. Lewis came to faith by a logical path. A novelist of some renown, he writes really, really good prose!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Where to begin with one of the great classics of the Christian faith? Well, from the beginning, it must be noted that Mere Christianity truly is a must-read for all Christians and that is exactly the intent of the author himself. Lewis set out to write or at least describe the fundamentals of the faith - actually to the truth - to which he himself had been called to almost against his own preferences. Christianity, to Lewis, isn't a mental asset to some sort of religious dogma or doctrine, rather it truly is a confrontation with the greatest truth known to man - that the person of Jesus Christ truly is the Son of the Living God, and only by the redeeming work of Christ can man be restored to a right relationship with our Creator. Mere Christianity is an attempt, and a very good one at that, to describe the concept of how God has woven this inextricable truth into the hearts and minds of mankind. Lewis argues this concept by stating two universal truths that he defends throughout the book:1. That human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot get rid of it.2. That they do not in fact behave in that they.Lewis is describing the concept of natural law, or the \\"Law of Nature\\" which puts forth the concept that God created man with eternity set in their hearts and that man's own sinfulness acts as a veil shrouding this truth, but now fully, so that man knows right from wrong, but is enslaved by sin nature to a life of unrighteousness. The chapters of Mere Christianity are arranged in various arguments that address this universal truth, and the final conclusion, once Lewis has demonstrated his premise, is that if true, this argument demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that man is indeed created by an Intelligent Designer who has revealed Himself to mankind through general and specific revelations.Lewis' concept of Christianity is really very simple - the problem really is that man complicates things, either by mistake or on purpose. But Lewis' concept of Christianity can be summarized by the Creation-Fall-Redemption model. Christianity is a simple, straight-forward explanation for the world not only as we know it and experience it, but also as it was intended to be and what when wrong with it. God's creation is perfect; man's corruption of that original nature is the problem with the world - and now, we live in what Lewis calls \\"enemy-occupied territory\\" where the \\"rightful king has landed\\" and is working through the church (individual Christians) to take back what is rightfully His. Amazingly, as you read through Mere Christianity, you can see so much of the creative imagery that Lewis brings to life in his wonderful Chronicles of Narnia series.Lewis also argues that to live the Christian life one must follow the example set by Christ - they must die. Living the Christian life is not a matter of daily ritual or routine, but rather daily sacrifice and surrender. To truly live out the ideals of Christianity one must surrender themselves to the greater authority of the Christian walk - Christ Himself. If we are created for His purposes and for His glory, then we must realize that our understanding of His ways are lower and pale in comparison - the Christian life is not about raising our standards of living, but rather about us dying to self and being made alive in Him. Of course, Lewis then writes about seven \\"virtues\\" by which one can measure their Christian life, not in an attempt to live more righteously on our own accord, but rather for the world to measure our surrender to our God - literally for others to see the nature of God transcribed on our lives as we live out who He is before a watching and listening world.Lewis' concept of Christianity is a very positive approach - it is not a set of rules and standards that a person compares themselves to - rather the Christian life is an appreciation for the ideal, and a pursuit of that ideal through the grace and work of Christ in and through the life of each and every believer. To Lewis the greatest sin is pride - a concept that man, by his own regard and on his own strength, could live a life worthy of God's calling. \\"Pride,\\" writes Lewis, \\"is spiritual cancer; it eats up the very possibility of love, or contentment, or even common sense.\\"Christianity, while \\"easy\\" to explain for Lewis is not easy to live. Christianity takes work, hard work, and Lewis sets before each reader a pretty stout challenge at the end of Mere Christianity to truly live out this transformed life worthy of our calling as a follower of Christ. He contends that there is nothing ordinary about the Christian life - and, just as men have been great tyrants or great saints, to Lewis the concept of Christianity should force men into thoughts of greatness - not for themselves, but to represent the greatness of the One Whom they serve and represent.A great read for every Christian, Mere Christianity is simply a classic to be read and reread time and time again."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is another great book by C.S. Lewis. I actually read this book a few times before becoming a Christain and each time I got to the end I felt like, \\"Yeah! I TOTALLY agree!\\" But then I found I coulnd't explain the logical progressing from non-believer to beliver to anyone else and so I fell back to my fuzzy-state of semi-belief. However, it is a very good book for putting cracks of hope into non-believers hard protective shell. It certainly placed a few fractures into mine!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"If 'because the Bible says so!' is not enough of a motivation for you then Mere Christianity is the book for you.Mere Christianity proposes a reasonable and rational argument on behalf ofBiblical principles. Lewis' grasp of morality and human nature support the sovereignty of Godly ideals by showing how they apply outside of a purely Christian context into everyones everyday life and character.If you wish to understand the nature of goodness and the many 'whys' behind it Lewis pieces answers together with supreme simplicity, reason and logic. It will equip you to defend the Gospel, deepen your understanding of morality and familiarize you with Jesus teachings without the fire-breathing rhetoric of dogma.Get it!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Mere Christianity is a book that should be read by all Christians. It is a great exploration of the basis for the faith.C.S. Lewis examines numerous arguments about the existence of God, the basis for natural law, and a system of morality. In addition, he explores several questions that trouble many who are searching for answers such as why God would allow evil to exist, the nature of God, and many more.It also contains excellent analysis of issues such as the personhood of God, the trinity, and the issue of free will.Lewis is a master of using analogies to explain issues that may be difficult. Those who are believers already will especially appreciate these parts.Although this book may not convince atheists or agnostics about the existence of God, it will surely provide much food for thought for those who are genuinely seeking as well as solidifying the views of Christians.The author does a great job addressing issues such as whether or not Jesus was just a great moral teacher. He leaves the reader with no doubt that is not a possibility. His arguments that Christ is either a liar, a lunatic, or God is very compelling.I have read this book about three times over the last 20 years or so. It is excellent and I continue to find new nuggets each time. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This is an amazing book. C.S. Lewis has an awesome way of explaining Biblical principles with remarkable analogies. This parallel between the Bible and real life experiences really helps to get the point across that C.S. Lewis is trying to make. It is one of those texts where throughout book I have several pages bookmarked that I plan to come back and read again.Lewis really goes in depth with his writings about many Christian morals, theology, behavior and beliefs. Many of the chapters that Lewis wrote or included in his book were lectures or articles that he created at the university he taught at. He sometimes includes people's reactions or questions that others asked him about his material.The book as a whole is excellent. It discusses many topics that are of discussion among Christians and even non-believers today. It was amazing to see just how evident it is that God created us for His glory.Highly recommended text!"},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C. S. Lewis was perhaps one of the most brilliant logicians of the twentieth century, and this book shows him at his best. Extremely complex questions are dealt with in a language that everyone can understand, and the case he advances for belief in the Christian God is impressive - even, in a way, almost fullproof. That said, however, he is not without his faults, and I'll risk sounding like a hairsplitter by pointing out one or two.First of all, Lewis, like most Christians, is very keen to emphasize the uniqueness of Christianity and to differentiate it from all other faiths. To this end, for example, he classes the Eastern faiths, in particular Hinduism, as a form of Pantheism. His definition of Pantheism is basically this: A Pantheist believes that God and the Universe are one, and that, as he says, \\"if the universe ceased to exist, so would God.\\" But this is a caricature of Hinduism. It is true that Hindus believe God to be present in the universe, and the universe to be, in some respects, a manifestation of God's consciousness. Yet they do not deny that God exists also outside and apart from the Universe. The Universe, after all, is for them a dream in the mind of Brahma. The world of Spirit - completely outside the material universe - is indeed emphasized by the Hindus even more than by the Christians. And surely Christians too agree that the physical universe - all of it - exists only by the will of God. If He were to withdraw His will, it would immediately cease to exist. What is the difference between that and the Hindu idea? One of semantics, it seems.Again, Lewis claims that the Hindu looks on suffering and evil in the world and says \\"all this is God;\\" and Lewis claims that Christians scorn this attitude, which seems to attribute evil to God. But there is a basic illogic in Lewis' attitude here. If the Universe and everything in it it exists only by the will of God, which Christians don't deny, then presumably the suffering and evil in the Universe must, in some way or other, be part of God's pland. Put it another way: Christians admit that God created Satan, or Lucifer. Admittedly, he was not created evil, but chose to go that way himself. However, the Christian God is omniscient, and must surely have been able to foresee that Lucifer would \\"go wrong\\" - yet God still created him. This means that evil too, in the Christian sense, is \\"of God,\\" in that God allows its (and Satan's) existence in order that a greater good may come of it. What then is the difference between this idea and that of the Hindus? Lewis chose to ignore this question, and I'm quite certain he did so because he could not find an answer.In reality, the difference between the teachings of Christ, Krishna and Buddha are scarcely detectable even with a theological microscope, and all apparent differences, when examined closely, turn out to be based on little more than semantics. It's a pity Lewis couldn't see that."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Lewis is one of my favorite authors. I always get something from reading his books. A few years ago I was assigned &#34;The Screwtape Letters.&#34; I decided instead to purchase this complete book because there were more selections that I wanted to read. I read every book within this collection. They are presented in their entirety. I have returned to a few of the selections again and again. The book is the size of a textbook. It has a ribbon bookmark which is quite helpful. This is a book you do not let sit on the bookshelf. This book I would recommend to anyone. I was required to read a few of the selections for my studies in Christian Ministries, but I think C.S. Lewis could and should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I got this as a Christmas gift for my niece and god-daughter. I've read it many times, and though you could argue that this work (which was originally delivered as talks delivered to the troops leaving for WWII) is a re-hash of ideas stated perhaps better by GK Chesterton in Orthodoxy and The Everlasting Man, this is a wonderful book.It does a great job of stating the main ideas of Christianity thoughtfully, patiently, and often humorously. And Lewis takes you through from his own viewpoint as a former atheist, so he is aiming at the &#34;outside looking in&#34; crowd.Highly recommended for anyone who wants to understand the gist of Christianity without being patronized, condescended to or lectured."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"Even though this is a well known classic, I just read it recently and I can understand why it's a classic. It's easy to read but deep at the same time. I loved it. It's a great introduction to the Christian experience for Christian people and it answers people who don't believe at the same time."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"My adult children asked for this book for Christmas and are very happy with it. It has a beautiful design and is a keepsake item as well as good reading. The only thing some may not like in this compilation of C.S. Lewis's works is the cumbersome size of it. One has to decide if the convenience of having all the text in one attractive binding outweighs having multiple copies of books containing the same material, and that is completely an issue of preference.The book was delivered in a timely manner and was packaged well for safe delivery of the contents."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"I got this as a stocking stuffer for my mom and she really enjoys it. The version we got has a pretty cover, too, so she sometimes puts it in a tray as a coffee table book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"One of the all time classics, this is a great book for group study by Christian groups of any denomination or persuasion. The term \\"Mere Christianity\\" means \\"the beliefs that ALL Christians agree on. This is probably the best defense of the faith from the 20th century. It is written is simple language that anyone can grasp, yet Lewis' reasoning is astonishingly clear and, to many, convincing. He makes no appeals to the bible or the church tradition, but relies on everyday observation and reason. This might also be a good starting book for someone who is not a Christian but want's to learn a bit more about it."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"This was an incredible book. Lewis argued for why he believed in Christianity in a way that could make a person on the brink of believing or not, believe. The reason is he used logic, rather than emotion, and therefore the person sees concrete reasons. Another thing that worked in his favor is he never says, \\"Christianity believes this thing is wrong, therefore it must be illegal.\\" While I did disagree on some things, for example, that women should submit to their husbands, that doesn't deter my opinion of this book."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"In times when the morality and the common human sense seems to be in decay due to the relativity subjected to these concepts, Lewis, in an understandable way and with a variety of examples, elucidate the reality of right and wrong hidden in the human being exposed as the Law of nature. With that, as a start point, the author give sense, in many ways, to the human behavior and clarify why the christian moral is the most proper way for a person to live."},{"Title":"Mere Christianity","review":"\\"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good testimony.\\" -- Hebrews 11:1-2 (NKJV)Each Christian emphasizes certain elements of faith somewhat differently than many others do. Keenly aware of such differences, many believers aren't clear about what virtually all others accept. Mere Christianity provides that different synthesis in a stylishly written and clear way.C. S. Lewis also manages to bridge the gap to how non-believers think to create a route from their moral feelings to appreciating the need for repenting of sins and redemption by a Savior. From there, the evidence for Jesus being the Savior is presented.The explanations are equal parts common sense and caring concern for those who don't yet know the Gospel. Anyone who wants to begin to understand the Christian faith should read this book after becoming familiar with the book of John in the New Testament.Although I have been sharing my faith for many years, Mere Christianity helped me to appreciate better ways to share what I believe with others so that more may appreciate the road to Salvation.Praise God for this book!"},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"Timeless erotic awakening? YAWN. The painfully self-conscious, self-induced angst of Isadora Wing set my teeth on edge. Her overwrought self-indulgence made me want to reach deep into the book and strangle the pabulum right out of her. This is one of a genre of thinly-veiled self-aggrandizing narratives of How The Writer Came To Find Her Voice Against All Odds. Only thing is, there really are very few odds opposing her, so she had to make stuff up out of whole cloth.The narrator is a daughter of a charmingly eccentric New York family with access to the founts of power a West Coaster could only dream of. Histrionic diatribes against the corruption of an Ivy League education fall flat on readers who would trade life and limb for access to that very thing. Lengthy relationships with Freudian analysts and Isadora's acceptance of their imaginary explanations for made-up neuroses are beyond tiresome. Finally - and perhaps most offensively - Isadora finds her voice only after being treated abominably by her lover and in turn treating her husband just as badly. This sort of selfishness can only be understood by a baby boomer, I humbly submit, and those of us who've come after the Most Self-Indulgent Generation will have no truck with it.Having said all of the above, at least I hated Isadora enough to read the entire book."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"This is a real classic of the 60's generation, marking the onset of the sexual revolution with an era of honesty about sex, and especially the carnal desire of women.Definetely one of our greatest living authors, Jong has the courage to shock people into the realization that women and men are more alike than we sometimes want to believe.Very funny, intelligent, and yes, perverted, this book raised eyebrows when it came out, but it's still a fast-paced, fascinating and brilliant read.Move over, Roth, Miller, Robbins. Perverse exhilaration is no longer the realm of men."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I read this book in the 1970's as a teenage male hoping for a sexy book by a liberated young woman. And on that level the story was disappointing. The main character Isadora has natural sexual desires (a still-controversial theme in the 70's, I suppose) and engages in a couple flings (zipless encounters), but this is hardly a sex novel. Instead, the story scores on a different level, one of an unfulfilled woman on an escapist journey through Europe. What is she running from? Her family, and perhaps conformity, society, even her own confusion. She is doing so in a world where the role of women is slowly changing to a more liberated venue. Many readers will identify with Isadora's rebellion against both societal expectations and her feelings of being unfulfilled. Others may dislike Isadora's (or Ms. Jong's) seeming privilege and self-indulgence. I guess you could see it either way, or even both. Still, this is a pretty good book, one that has now sold 20 million copies."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"The novel contains some unkosher stereotypes that detract from the sincerity of Isadora Zelda's enlightenment. Isadora seeks to create an unmolded definition of herself -- a non-suicidal, female artist free of male obsession. However, she mocks her African-American brother-in-law for being white because he is a wealthy doctor who enjoys golf (as if he is not allowed to define himself outside of typical views). Isadora wants others to value her poetry but mocks all greasy (her words) Arabs for writing poems. She wants a lover who will understand her complexity. Nonetheless, she takes the close-minded attitude that all Germans loved Hitler. Stereotypes and racial bias litter the novel (even her second husband is an inscrutable -her words again- Chinese man). I could not enjoy Isadora's rise to empowerment because her accent seemed dependent upon the lowering and dismissing of other people."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"The beautiful thing about 'Fear of Flying' is that, if you are an intelligent, educated woman, you will see yourself in it and its protagonist, Isadora. All the more so if you are in your 20s or 30s, a career woman, and/or entertain artistic ambitions. As you read, you will find yourself constantly smiling in recognition and nodding in agreement and understanding.'Fear of Flying' captures the thoughts, fears, obsessions and self-destructions that all women indulge in but are afraid to admit. The great liberation I found in Erica Jong's novel was not the zipless f uck but rather \\"Wow, it's not just me!\\" about the stewing insecurity under the veneer of confidence and success. And, by itemizing those insecurities, she castrates them of their power.'Fear of Flying' is not about sex but, rather, how women seek to define and obliterate themselves through sex and through love. Isadora's sexual journey is pretty tame and ultimately not very liberating, and therein is the book's main point.Women will find 'Fear of Flying' affirming, and men should read it to better understand how women process their emotions and experiences. It would make a great gift for the well-intentioned but clueless boyfriend or husband.The narrative in 'Fear of Flying' is a bit wanting, albeit it is an idea-driven, not story-driven, novel. The Freudian aspect is also a bit overdone; it dates the book in this era of pop psychology and self-help, and is confusing to this generation no longer schooled in Fruedian theory.Nonetheless, it is an amazing book. Sadly, the need for women to learn to live within themselves, to claim their own destinies, remains as controversial a topic as it was decades ago. We haven't come that far, baby."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"First off, I'm a guy, so perhaps I'm off base on this book in terms of how &quot;real&quot; or &quot;true&quot; it is. My apologies for that. At the time I read it, I was a not-quite-but-almost-naive college junior, so perhaps I will learn in time.But regarding this book, I thought it was pretty insightful. After countless late nights of sitting up and listening to the woes of my women friends, I could easily detect echos of FOF in the conversations.This novel spawned at least three sequels. Perhaps someone with firsthand (rather than my secondhand) experience with the issues presented in those books could comment more specifically on them. I'll limit myself to saying that while I did not find Fear of Flying to self-serving or overly didatic, I did find its various sequels to be so, the degree worsening as the chronology did.*Fear of Flying* is an Excellent Book, ladies and gentlemen. I highly recommend it men and women of all genders (who says we only have to have two?)."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I was on an Antarctic research vessel and came across (so to speak) this book in the ship's library. What a find! I kept sneaking back to my cabin all through the day and staying up too late at night to keep reading it. It's been a long time since I've been this interested in a book on so many levels. It's smart, witty, honest, sexy, introspective, insightful and above all, laugh-out-loud funny (the scene in which Pia, Isadora and the boys make an \\"exquisite corpse\\" story is priceless).In the character of Isadora Wing, Jong has given all commitment phobes a heroine that they can relate to: she is NOT crazy, she is NOT fickle, she is just painfully aware that there is only one time around on the ride of life and wants to make sure she gets the most out of it (think Carrie Bradshaw decades before there ever was Carrie Bradshaw).The plot of the story is great, but the best parts are Jong's observations on the pursuit of sex, love, self, and good writing. Any writer who has ever experienced the fear of facing a blank sheet of paper, of believing that anything you have to say is worth saying, should read this book.Erica Jong is a smart, talented and witty writer."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"As an eighteen year old girl in the nineties, guilty of psuedo-intellectualism, staggering self-deception and a general lack of self-confidence, this book comes as a suprise. A suprise in the sense that I was astonished (and thoroughly excited) to have come upon a writer that has the ability to enunciate with remarkable clarity so many of the self-conflicting emotions that are the confusing, frustrating reality of the woman who thinks too much. Jong's mind wanders around issues of society, family, femininity and intellectualism in a way that will strike any serious member of the human race as uncannily familiar. She makes elusive parts of the human psyche tangible in a way that makes the reader feel that he or she has felt that exact same way before, but has simply been unable to express the emotion adequately. To be fair, while in many ways the author's self-centeredness makes the novel extrememly accessable, it sometimes drags it down as well. Within the light, yet poignant, reading Jong often becomes involved in showcasing her educated background in a way that fails to add to the novel. There is a heavy dose of sexuality, but nothing that offends so much as causes cautious empathy. The main character's musings about her sexualiy seem real, yet her experiences seem contrived. Overall, the novel is essential reading for the frequently self-examined soul. Don't think of it as a work of art by a serious master, think of it as if you yourself have taken every truth you ever stumbled upon and woven it around an extravagant education and a fantastic fantasy of a story."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"Before making reservations for a solo trip to (and in) China that will require six flights and leaving my husband of 20 years home for two weeks, I pulled my 36-year-old, faded, hardcover copy of \\"Fear of Flying\\" off the shelf. I spent the last two days re-reading it. We have come a long way, baby. I bought \\"Fear of Flying\\" when I moved to New York, solo, at age 22, and it's survived numerous purges of the bookshelves ever since. Why? I guess it's classic in its own way, a relic of the era before AIDS and before being socially conscious meant doing something, not just wearing hippie-inspired garb and having vaguely liberal attitudes.The thing that consistently struck me about the character Isadora White Wing was that she is not a fictional character. Through every scene I felt that I was reading a memoir, a self-portrait, not a novel. It's all GIVE, GIVE, GIVE to ME, ME, ME because I am so SPECIAL, SPECIAL, SPECIAL. Not once does Jong describe an event or situation in which Isadora does something giving or caring for another person, for a husband or lover, other than opening her legs or mouth -- which was one hundred percent for her benefit or pleasure anyway. She does not cook a meal, make a home, give a gift, bestow any genuine affection. She does not have a kind word for anyone, including, of course, her sisters and parents, all of whom are skewered relentlessly. It is supposed to be satire, I guess. But it is not funny. Especially the chapter about visiting her sister's family in Beirut, Lebanon.She describes hiding as a girl among the mink coats in her mother's closet which reeked of \\"Joy\\" perfume, and pretending to disown her parents on family trips to Paris and London. She makes fun of secretaries and in fact anyone who has a job. Poor, poor Isadora. What about the rest of us who grew up in small tract houses -- not sprawling apartments on Central Park West or Riverside Drive -- and never got to eat at a Denny's, much less in Paris caf&eacute;s or the first-class dining room of a luxury liner. We attended public universities and got jobs where we had to be at a desk every morning. To me feminism means supporting all women, not just those as privileged as she. In a later book (okay, I admit I've read more of Jong's oeuvre) she makes fun of \\"gray-faced commuters.\\" At the time, I was commuting via Metro North into Manhattan every day and I did not find her description amusing.In 1973, yes, it was daring for a woman to lard her prose with four-letter words beginning with F, C, and S. Now it is a little sad to read so many of them, sprinkled on so many pages, apparently for their \\"bravery\\" and \\"honesty.\\"Rereading the book has actually made me interested in finding out about her \\"crazy\\" first husband, the model for Brian. What happened to him -- he who typed all her college papers because she wouldn't learn to type? And her psychiatrist second husband, the model for Bennett. How did he feel about being an army doctor in Germany? How did being married to her affect his life and career?It is remarkable how every human with a penis (and without) found Isadora so irresistible. And welcomed her back, no matter what she did. Perhaps inspired by this book, way back when, I behaved a bit unconventionally with two men in my life. It didn't work out so well for me. When my \\"crazy\\" first husband learned that I has spent an evening with someone else, I got beaten up. After a lot of hard work I ended up with an order of protection, not a book contract.It is ironic that Amazon sells this title with nonfiction, self-help books about overcoming fear of flying written by pilots and flight attendants. Which book would be more helpful? Hmmm..."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"A very trippy novel filled with Freudian imagery! The explicit erotic fantasies and &quot;bitchiness&quot; of the main character, Isadora Wing, were entertaining. However, I found it to be very depressing in general. Although it is refreshing to see a female author write with such sexual inhibition....the plot seems to be lacking realism. Isadora actually made me nauseous at times with her bad selection of boy toys! I think a visit from the personal hygeine fairy would have been nice. She was definitely a woman who was playing with a few cards short of a full deck! In my opinion the first few chapters were the best...and the conclusion was disappointing and left me wanting more closure between Isadora &amp; her husband!"},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"\\"This is not a book for those who are easily shocked - it may date back to the 70s, but it pulls no punches, and, for example, the main character refers to parts of her body in very direct terms.Although I enjoyed reading it, I doubt whether the material in it all actually holds together well as a novel. In particular, the chapter entitled The Madman (chapter 12?) registered with me as very striking, but it did not follow on where the previous chapter left off, and this is where the disjointedness of the book began. The chapter is given credit at the front of the book for having been published in a magazine, albeit in a different version, and, unfortunately, that is how it reads in the context of the book to that point - it is in a different style, and, although the content is very good, it does not fit in. The two or three chapters that follow it also do not, with the result that, whereas this may not be as much of a problem as the one hundred and fifty odd pages of diary in Anne Bronte's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall that breaks that novel's back, it is then not possible to resume, as Jong, seeks to do, the narrative approach that preceded this group.With this (major) exception, the book is very well written, and Jong shows the breadth of her reading by making literary references that are utterly convincing in the mouth of her heroine, rather than, as such allusions can be, for the sake of it or to impress the reader and/or make him or her feel knowledageable that they have been identified.Give this book a go, but it is questionable whether it lives up to some of the more extreme claims that have been made for it, however well it addresses sexual and other issues, because the characterization is not wholly convincing: for example, a British psychiatrist who is a devotee of R. D. Laing might have said 'ducks' all the time as term of endearment, but I rather doubt it..."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"Browsing the bookstore the other day, I came across a new edition of this & realized it's been THIRTY years since this book was published! (Actually thirty one.)I read this book about ten years ago. I was 18 at the time & from then on, greedily read all her novels (and poems) ever published. Jong taught me not to be ashamed of my sexuality, but to embrace being a woman and to go after what you want. At that time, I was conflicted, mainly because I was feeling so \\"open\\", but yet felt I should not venture out of my normal \\"good girl Baptist upbringing\\". I read her novels in secret, afraid of what others would think of me. Not long after this very book, I started to bloom into what was being stifled inside me all long.I can now say that I am happily married with two young boys. I let myself roam freely & basically went after what I wanted & needed. I know that through that discovery is how I found my soulmate & developed love with all the sparks, too.Take the time & read this classic & all her others. Keep an open mind & enjoy. My favorite thing about Jong is that she simply says all the \\"dirty\\" & \\"not-so-nice\\" things we women think of all the time. Such liberation to read her work!"},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"This is a wonderful book for young ladies and women to read, beginning at 15 years old, because by this age girls question what it means to be women. And because their mothers didn't have the opportunities that are now available to us, this book is a wonderful place for women to explore their own thoughts about who to be.Isadora, the protagonists in this story, represents every woman at some time in our lives, searching for our own definition of what it means to be a woman.She struggles with unfinished business with her mom, as well as with each of her sisters, who insist that she be a mirror of them.Unlike many stories from the classics, Isadora doesn't die in the end, nor is she locked away from her desire to find her own definition of who she is.She realizes through new decisions that she makes, after she acts out her fantasies, that it is self-destructive to count upon other people's concept of who she should be, and what her desires should be.This novel moves quickly, is humorous, and very engaging.Another point that makes this novel so unique is that with eroticism as a strong part in this book, it has substance, and many life lessons to teach anyone who is open to explore her or his reality.Also, while this book does offer many lessons for women, rather than marking passages, and showing it to the men in our lives, I recommended that those parts that mean the most to you become the parts that you study so that you demonstrate what matters most to you &#65533; he will be more receptive by this method."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"This is one of my favorite books so far. Isadora (the main character) does not whine, but pushes against a society in which male sexuality dominates. I found it funny, smart, and timeless. I would hope that anyone who reads this would come away feeling inspired and free. Jong is an excellent writer of the human condition and this book transcends genders. It is an adventure of the spirit and of one woman's sexual (r)evolution."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"You've ever studied feminism-- you're interested in how women's fantasy-life works, you are a woman, you are a man who wants to understand women (or not), you think that perhaps you need a new man/woman in your life to complete you, you need to be completed by yourself, you think maybe you're crazy but aren't sure the therapist is working.... you have these long, detailed fantasies about.....This book, considered a consciousness-raising classic of the second wave of feminism by some and smut by others (as the author discusses in the intro), is well-written, analyzes some of the best parts of an individual (who happens to be a budding \\"lady writer\\")and who discovers herself (quite accidentally in some ways). It does have some rather strongly worded fantasies-- and one could probably go on for days about the *potentials* of the ZF (and not look at the pool guy/girl the same way again)-- but in all, it's truly a story about identity, the truth behind our fantasies, and how a woman of the 1970's era (and unfortunately for our progress, today too) sometimes gets by (or fails to) in life.I enjoyed the first half immensely, found myself skimming a little in the middle part (not as gripping because it was painful to witness) and was interested enough by the end to want to know what happened after the book's last page ended. So give it a go-- and when you see the rest of us in elevators smirking, you might wonder why."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"Fear of Flying is a good book. Not great, not terrible. It had a chance to be great, don't get me wrong. The trouble is, it's a book about a woman realizing that her liberation is incomplete. Which means that she spends a considerable amount of time realizing this (chapters 5-12, about 120 pages of the book). The rest of the book is great, but during most of the middle, she's being dragged around Europe by someone who won't even remember her name (though he does try). She's not liberated until the last few chapters, and by then, we sensitive males have grown tired of Isadora being subjugated. Why isn't she strong? Why doesn't she see through everything? If you want to read this book to see what strong women really think, you'll get disappointed and depressed by the time you get to chapter 12. Until then, Isadora doesn't want to control, she wants to be controlled, and that is exactly what I expected this book to counter.Read the beginning, read the end, skip the middle, if you like. You won't miss much...when FOF is good, it's very, VERY good. When it's bad--eh, it's good afternoon reading."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"A friend who generally has great taste in literature recently gave me this book. My problem with it has nothing to do with the language. I actually found it refreshing to read a female author speak like a man. I think anyone who finds it offensive needs to wake up. My problem is that I don't think it is an empowering tool for anyone, specifically women. I can't stand these self-deprecating intellects who have an impressive ability to grasp a situation but then fall flat on their face when it comes to acting on it.About halfway through, I found myself despising the main character, which is weird because I tend to be sympathetic to even the most unlikable protagonists. I couldn't relate to any of her decisions. I couldn't understand why she was attracted to Adrian and surrounding herself with men who clearly wanted to control her. She seemed like your classic example of a woman too smart for her own good. Maybe that's the literary genius behind the book, but I found it frustrating. It seemed like for all her feminist thoughts and ideals, she could never act on any of them. It made her seem weak. I only finished it because of my obsessive nature when it comes to reading. Personally, I found it uninspiring, tedious at times, and self-indulgent."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"Plot summary: A young married woman searches for \\"the zipless fudge\\" (Thank you Amazon Censors). \\"Fear of Flying\\" does not have a strong plot. It's basically discussion/dialogue and self reflection. It's told in the first person and is semi/autobiographical.Words to describe this book: Modern, relevant, satisfying, funny, humiliating, truthful, shameful, sexy, refreshing, surprising.In the beginning:I was struck by how modern and relevant the language in the book is, especially with the use of the C word...come on you know what C word I'm talking about.The main character, Isadora Wing, is smart, rich and vibrant right from the start--and she is funny, too. Read \\"The History of the World Through Toilets\\"--just read that part--so funny *especially Germany.*The middle: Lags a bit--but thankfully it's an easy read, so not too much suffering required.Upon finishing:Comes to a funny, kinda happy though quite satisfying conclusion. I will recommend \\"Fear of Flying\\" to certain friends in their twenties.Fave quote: \\"Life has no plot. It is far more interesting than anything you can say about it because language, by it very nature, orders thing and life has no order.

I did not expect to like it so much. Sure, some of the ideas and references are now rather outdated (the book was published in 1974) but at the time it first came out, the novel must've been revolutionary and groundbreaking for women. Many controversial themes are explored through the character of Isadora White Wing: sexual freedom, artistic freedom, marital dissatisfaction, a woman's desire to call her own shots and to be able to love whom she pleases. The book overflows with warmth, courage, and sometimes wisdom as spoken through the musings of the young female protagonist (Isadora is not yet 30). Reading this book had quite an impact on me. I read all the author's other books. The writing is simple and straightforward and very, very candid.

Virginia Woolfe said that women authors hadn't found an authentic female voice, but Erica Jong can join Jane Austen on the list of women writers who definitely have found an unapologetically female voice.

Jong's heroine is well read, eduacted and a true writer: scattered, mentally tortured and non-committal, yet very likeable.As we read the adventures of Isadora we can see a once weak woman begin to discover herself.

I know, I know. In '73 when it came out, it was lauded as one of the greatest works of literature of all time, and it is. It was one of the first books to explore the feminist psyche in such an unapologetic way, and one of the first to do so written in the style of a fictional memoir. However, I wouldn't have really been able to relate to it as deeply in my Twenties, but now that I am well into my Forties, I can appreciate the psychological truisms that would have eluded me as a younger reader less experienced in the ways of love, sex, and relationships. The book is witty, shocking in its exhibitionism, but most of all, it's honest. I don't know of any woman who hasn't thought or felt this way at some point in their life about the men in their life and how it all relates to their own sexual identity. As a bonus, the writing is stellar but for a few issues.Isadora is a neurotic nightmare and an existentialist's perfect women. This book deals with some serious subject matter, but Isadora's cutting wit lightens the load of what might have been a depressing and oppressing story.This is real woman's fiction, and in my opinion, any woman will hard-pressed NOT to see a bit of herself in Isadora even if she doesn't want to admit it."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"This is a very adult book.

I came across Erica Jong's novel, Fear of Flying, a couple of weeks ago in a dusty pile of second hand books at my son's school Christmas Bazaar. Two days ago I picked it up again to keep me company during a nasty cold, and yesterday I closed the last page, wishing there were more - not because I needed &quot;closure&quot; (is it only me, or does that word make other people itch, too?), but because I found far more of myself on those yellowing pages than I ever expected, and I wanted to see how it would all turn out. Though I wasn't blessed with Isadora's wealth, I certainly enjoyed the fantasy of having it, while at the same time experiencing a vicarious roller coaster ride of oh-so-familiar emotions.Agreed, the book is anything but politically correct, but neither was it hostile. Come on, Grown Ups. I think we're old enough to deal with a sterotype, (perhaps) see its humour (remember Cheech and Chong - or have they also been blacklisted?), and on occasion, the grain of truth behind it. Have we become so precious that we can no longer laugh at ourselves, and is it forbidden to chuckle at those around us? Sorry, PC's not for me.In Been There, Done That 2002, Fear of Flying may no longer be shocking, but its reflections remain relevant.

Making us laugh along the way was just an extra added bonus.Personally, I'm taking care of my daughter's lack by buying FOF for her Valentine's Day present.

Because reading this book, I BECAME Isadora, fell in love with Freud, realized that a Zipless F*** is one of my goals in life, and that even an analyst needs an analyst (which practically guarantees me a job for life).

To those on that five year marriage barrier, where \\"they have to decide whether to buy new sheets and stick it out or throw the old ones out and split up\\" (and thats a qoute from the book), this book will lay everything out in witty and sarcastic laymans' terms.

This one in particular is my first-read, and personal favorite. I've read Fear of Flying atleast three times in the last ten years, and continue to recommend it to female friends with a bent toward the literary. Critics sometimes compare Erica Jong to Anais Nin, which I find unfair; the two authors do not belong in the same genre. I find Jong's writing much more sophisticated, entertaining, imaginative, and interesting. She speaks to the heart and soul of modern, literate women, as Fear of Flying proves resoundingly. It truly is a contemporary classic."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I decided to read this book based on a conversation with a friend that had read it several times, mostly when first published. I had high expectations for the material and found myself disappointed. The characters are detached and unlikable in my view. The psyches of them are complex which was intriguing, but i would not read it again."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I wasn't even born when this book came out (I'm only 20), but I thought it was great. I dream of the ZF!!! I really enjoyed this book and I lent it to my best friend who still hasn't given it back to me. I think the themes in the book are applicable to life as a woman today. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"Fear of Flying is a book I liked and could not not understand at the same time. It offered women in a different prospective, but it was more laughter than powering."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"Erica Jong's novel &quot;Fear of Flying&quot; is a wonderful must-read for all women. It is a rich novel full of literary allusions that are sure to please even the most picky of readers. This was a perfect companion for me as I traveled around Europe and ended up spending a year in France. Her descriptions of places are dead-on right. A reviewer was right: this book is liable to scare men...and rightly so!"},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I read the first several pages at the bookstore and could not wait to bring the book home. What a disappointment it turned out to be! A 100 pages into it, I was so disqusted with histrionic Isadora, the book sailed across the room into the trash can. While the story did offer insight into the \\"female condition\\" that was certainly applicable to our time, the main character, with her narcissism, immaturity, and complete lack of appreciation for the lifestyle that her \\"neurotic\\" family provided for her, was simply too unpalatable. Why or why all the psychoanalysis? Was she a victim of childhood sexual abuse? Was she violently beaten and emotionally neglected? Did she encounter terrible trauma as a child or adolescent? If not, then what explains the incessant therapy?I am not usually offended by profanity, but ongoing references to c--t made me wince. Perhaps, Ms. Jong felt that throwing these around was a sign of psychic liberation; to me, it felt like a constant stream of vulgarity that detracted from the story. And what is with the obnoxious name dropping? Ms. Jong is clearly a well educated woman but she goes to such lengths with her never ending references to authors and literary characters that it all becomes supremely annoying, especially because it brings little or nothing to the story. Also, I do not understand what drew Isadora to Adrian Goodlove except for his smart turtlenecks and cussing, or how she could flit from one European country to another, constantly complaining of this inferiority or that while being completely useless herself.Overall, I failed to grasp what made Fear of Flying a \\"seminal feminist classic\\". There are books that are infinitely more informative and insightful that have withstood the test of time. This work, in my humble opinion, was a waste of time."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"Erica Jong's Fear of Flying is a tough read and long at that. Some parts are not so easy to understand, as the story jumps a little from present to main character, Isadora's past. It's good once you get through it though. And yes, the language is a little crude, but only enhances the mood and theme of this early 70s novel."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"A WONDERFULLY WRITTEN BOOK REFLECTING THE EXCITING PERIOD OF SOCIETAL EVOLUTION WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED - WHICH HAS MORE THAN HELD ITS' OWN OVER THE DECADES.

IT'S GREAT!!"},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"Erica Jong is still as relevant today as she was 21 years ago. She tells it as it was and still is. This is a must for all young ladies even in the 21st century. I enjoy her descriptive prowess and her point-blank in your face attitude to life...you may not agree with her, but you can't help but to admire her. I'll leave my copy for my daughters to read in the near future."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I am a man, and I read this book because Bob Dylan talks about Erica Jong in one of his songs. Athough no classic, this book is well worth reading. She breaks through some walls regarding women and their sexual role/place. Of course the main character is white, affluent and Jewish so it still suffers from being trapped in the upper-middle class mainstream. It would have been better if the protagonist was an 18 year old skinny black girl from Ethiopia who comes of age in an era of sexual and personal liberation. Nonetheless, read it if only because Bob Dylan talks about her."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"This is the first book I've read and actually could truly feel what Isadora was feeling. Fear of Flying was refreshing to read. It gave me hope as a woman. It is getting me through College."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I bought this book when I was fourteen because I thought it would be sexy. I scanned the book for dirty parts, then shelved it when I couldn't find anything very steamy and returned to the bodice-rippers under my mom's bed. Many years later, I opened the book as a different person. Married, childless, and still confused about what I should do with my life, Isadora Wing spoke straight to my heart. I laughed at myself when I learned that FOF does have a few sexual encounters, but they tend to be awkward, disappointing, and often uncomfortable. No wonder I didn't notice them when I first thumbed through. I was looking for the descriptions of perfect and seamless couplings found in romance novels, and that sort of language just wasn't there, accept for in Isadora Wing's fantasies about the &quot;zipless f---&quot;. Isadora has big ideas, firm convictions, passions, but is often held back with fear and insecurity. The plot of the book is not nearly as important or engaging as Isadora's ruminations on love, sex, hypocrise, and searching for good examples of women to look up to. I think every woman should read this book, especially if she is married and getting just a little bit itchy. If it's really bad, have your husband read it, too."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I picked up this book in my mother's garage about 3 years ago, when I was 18. I admit that I was interested in it because of the sexy cover quotes like &quot;steamy!&quot; and &quot;shocking!&quot;I read it. And it's turned out to be one of my favorite books. Not because it got me hot and bothered.. it wasn't any more &quot;steamy&quot; than an episode of NYPD blue, but because I found myself identifying so much with Isadora's plight... her urge to find herself, to balance her love for her husband with her urge to find the &quot;zipless f***&quot; and to do it all in a society that frowned upon a healthy sexual appetite in women.Some people have found that the novel is self-serving and self-righteous, but not a drop of that came through to me. As a matter of fact, I was shocked to hear it!I loved the book and I think most young women would too - which is why you're hearing a heartfel reccomendation from me!"},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I get a little peeved when I read some reviews of this novel passing it off as some sort of salacious, &quot;Peyton Place&quot;-ish trifle meant to shock midwestern Americans. The truth is, over thirty years since its appearance, that the reviews Henry Miller and John Updike offered were no less than prophetic. The book is a genuine work of literary art and craft, frank but necessarily so in the same way &quot;Lady Chatterley's Lover&quot; was. Jong's style is compelling; her opinions, questions, and searches for her character's validations are no less valuable today. Perhaps a good portion of people were in a more open state of mind in the early seventies, more willing to experiment with lifestyle, substances, morality, even music and art. But are people today in less need of this kind of open consciousness? One only needs to examine the current political climate to see that we're heading for a revisionist version of McCarthyism. So perhaps the views expressed in &quot;Fear of Flying&quot; bear reexamination.This book has so many ways to praise it one hardly knows where to begin. But as a man too young to read it in 1973, I am profoundly grateful to Ms. Jong for the opportunity to read and grow with it now and, no doubt, many times in the future (seeing it back in print, I quickly purchased 3 copies to get me through several more planned readings in the coming years). This edition features the new 2002 afterword by the author, which is invaluable. Jong's perspective on the value of the book, its uncertain early history, publishing stats, and humbling effect on the lady herself add to the novel's resonance. This may be told from a much-needed woman's persepective, but I refuse to label it as &quot;women's&quot; or &quot;feminine&quot; lit. This towering work should not be so conveniently monikered. Its far too challenging, and important, for that. How about simply &quot;classic&quot;?"},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I saw the book in one of those big franchise book stores and the cover caught my eye, white with a zipper half unzipped revealing red underneath. Now that I have read \\"Fear of Flying\\" the cover seems very symbolic and provacative just like the book.From the dedication to the afterword I was captivated by this book, a true literary work about a woman seeking self. It is not a chick lit book but true literature. I couldn't beleive I missed this book all my life, I am in my early thirties and had never heard about it but wish I had it starting in my teens.Every woman, every man should read this book it gives great insight on the insecurities of women. From sentence one I felt like Isadora Zelda White Wing spoke to me of my own doubts and emotional struggles. All of a sudden I was not alone...I was not lost, her journey was mine and mine hers.This book was about getting your passion back along with your identity, not sex or fantasies as so many want to dwell on. Although she is very candid about her sexual exploits(Isadora's) and the language is very forward but its relevent to the story.As a woman, I can say that the idea of the zipless f...k has had an appeal but after reading her encounters with Dr. Goodlove you have to re-address your impulses and figure out what you really are looking for. I think that was the true teaching of this book........find out who you really are not what or who defines you."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"Jong's writing is witty, clever, and insightful. This was also a pretty brave book, coming out when it did. I think her characters and situations (for the most part) were quite believable. Here's my gripe: Jong's major theme is that women (at least her heroine) yearn for love and security, but also adventure and excitement. What a revelation! I am a man, but guess what, folks? I'd kind of like to have a loving, dependable, child-rearing wife at home while I go off around the world having exciting affairs with other women. Pretty amazing that women might want that too, huh? My other gripe is that Isadora, while (see above) witty, intelligent and insightful, is also wealthy enough to be a lifelong world-traveler, have endless shrinks, countless affairs, and to complain about the accomodations on ocean cruises and Paris hotels. Poor baby; we all have problems like that. Given her social status, it's tough to sympathize with 300 pages of whining about problems that confront all women AND all men. I give this three stars despite the unsympathetic protagonist and because of Jong's writing ability."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"When I was a college freshman I wrote a paper critiquing Adrienne Rich's essay &quot;When We Dead Awaken.&quot; Rich argued that women writers had it harder than men because there was no tradition of writing done in a genuinely female voice; women who wanted to be heard had to write like men. I argued against that reading, saying that all writers, regardless of sex, had to struggle with how to adapt their voices to the accepted canon. But now, four years later, I'm starting to see Rich's point.I realized while reading Fear of Flying that I haven't read a single book written by a woman in the past hundred years that sounds like something I could have written (in terms of voice -- questions of technique and craft and all that aside.) When I started Fear of Flying I thought that maybe I'd finally found one. I read it because a week or so earlier I'd read Jong's book on Henry Miller, The Devil at Large, and learned that Miller apparently saw Fear of Flying as the female-authored version of Tropic of Cancer.Maybe the reason why I was so frustrated by Fear of Flying is that it came so close to getting it right, to being the sort of book that I've wanted to find: something written by a woman who is as honest and funny and brave as the male writers I admire. But in the final analysis, Fear of Flying wasn't quite it.It was a combination of factors. Fear of Flying felt too self-conscious, just a little too infatuated by its own cleverness. (I suppose feminist critics would tell me that I've been brainwashed by the male literary establishment, that if the same self-conscious &quot;cleverness&quot; came in a novel written by a man I'd find it admirable.) And the symbolism was just a bit too heavy-handed -- the book's protagonist has the last name of Wing, but it's her married name -- &quot;fear of flying,&quot; her &quot;wing&quot; borrowed from someone else, from a man... yeah, yeah, we get it. And the dashing yet terminally flawed man who tempts her away from her husband bears the last name of Goodlove. Didn't Dickens beat this whole &quot;foreshadowing via surname&quot; thing to death in the 1800s?But my problems with the book run deeper than that. The whole novel focuses on the protagonist's struggle to overcome her fear of being alone -- but where are the books written about women who AREN'T afraid of being alone? Why is the fear of being alone not even an issue for most male protagonists?A moderately entertaining read though."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"\\"Fear of Flying\\" presents an honest and often brilliant perspective on female sexual desire and artistic ambition. Like Sylvia Plath's Esther Greenwood in \\"The Bell Jar,\\" Erica Jong's Isadora Wing is based on a Salingeresque approach to a woman who is both intellectually precocious and sexually curious. Like the young Holden Caulfield, both Esther and Isadora use powerful satirical voices to question restrictive social norms. Yet, while I admire Isadora's literary sophistication and her strong feminist bent, I'm also disappointed that she lacks awareness of her socioeconomic privilege. Besides having an Ivy League education and indisputably high intelligence, she is cheerfully jobless, as she has unrestricted (zipless?!) access to traveler's checks and an American Express card. Isadora's pursuit of the \\"zipless f***\\" as she travels throughout central Europe is made possible by her unlimited use of bucks.When Isadora aims to break free of her neurotic Upper West Side family, she seems not to notice that she owes much to their wealth and cultural sophistication. Similarly, she takes for granted her somber but supportive husband, who appreciates her intelligence and encourages her in her writing. With unconcealed contempt, Isadora describes the uneducated and consumeristic army housewives who dwell in Heidelberg, seemingly unaware that had she been born into less fortunate circumstances, she could have been one of them. Had Isadora come from one of the less fashionable boroughs of New York City, from a less educated and moneyed family with more immigrant cultural baggage, she would have had a much different story to tell.In twentieth century American culture, the privileged classes always had more access not only to better education, but to greater sexual freedom. (The Kennedy family and the culture surrounding Camelot are the best known examples of this phenomenon). Although Isadora Wing has become a feminist icon and a symbol of the sexual revolution, readers must not forget that her sexual experimentation is supported by her wealth and her intellectually sophisticated social class."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"Erica Jong really accurately describes the complexity of relationships, desire, love, dependence and freedom. Even though this book is seen as a symbol of the women's liberation movement in the 70s (which is before I was born), it's not at all out of date.I read Fear of Flying straight though, looking for the answers to the most difficult questions: how do I remain independent without just being lonely? how can we control love, others, and ourselves? what makes a relationship work? where does sex come into the equation? what's love got to do with it? and what do you do when a relationship is pretty darn good but not perfect?The book doesn't have an answer key, and doesn't try to simplify what is inherently complex. Instead it is vividly real, and sticks with you long after you're done reading it."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I had heard so much about how this book was so 'liberating'. It is not at all. It is deeply conservative, if not reactionary. It finally admits that women cannot do without men, are helpless, disorganised, flighty (indeed) and generally useless unless some man with an appendage is telling them what to do. For all her evocations of women writers Isadora is the opposite of them. Is this meant to be her tragedy? Her fear? If so, it never comes across that way. She is too privileged, self-indulgent, whiny and obsessive for us to really care what happens to her. And yet it is funny and in some places deeply inspired. But Portnoy's Complaint was better written."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"My friend gets on me all the time because I don't read many female authors. While we were having fun with it he referenced Bob Dylan's song Highlands from his Time Out of Mind album where he sings about Jong. I had to check it out.I am all about women being independent and leading their lives on their own accord - but when they talk about it and drone on and on about it, it irritates me. This was the book's downfall for me. Jong's main character, Isadora, either acts on impulse or does what she thinks she should. Never once did she do anything because it was what she wanted. But that is OK - because there lies the theme of the book. As the reader, I felt that Jong was trying to describe a woman who had for so long lived her life based on what was seen as acceptable by others. When Isadora was able to assert herself she was told it was wrong or had to analyze it with her countless therapists. Her character finds what she thinks is freedom in a lover and embarks on a trip accross Europe while leaving her husband behind in London. In this lover she finds that things are still the same for her - and I think that the key is realizing that the only thing all of her past experiences have in common are herself. By the end of the book it seems that she realizes that she is no longer the victim of a series of circumstances she had no conrol over - and she embraces the power of hindsight to move forward in her indepence and make choices of her own. To me that is such a cool move for the Isadora - but it doesn't happen until the last few pages and the main part of the book is so full of all her baggage that I nearly didn't finish it.Overall it is an OK book, but I just didn't like Isadora enough to really like the book. I found her to be whiney, possibly histrionic and someone with tons of issues I didn't care to hear about.Here is the note about it that I wrote to my friend after he hassled me to finish it and said if I didn't I was a weenie - I think it summarizes Jong's theme quite well...My decision to not finish Jong was my way of asserting my independence - why burden myself with a task that I derive no satisfaction from... and after all, how can I let a man attempt to dictate what I read?You'll be happy to know that I finished it. I thought maybe there is something in the ending that will make it worth it. There really wasn't and I guess we'll just have to disagree on this one. I hope you are rolling in your satisfaction of oppressing young women by teasing them and calling them weenies until they do what you want. Sheesh.-- Mel"},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"Few writers have the quality, or is it style, that Erica Jong has. The story unfolds as if she is sitting across the table from you and finishing before the check arrives.The story isn't just about a sexual affair in Europe, you know her too well by the end of the book. She finds the words that you can't when it comes to express sexual feelings.[...](getting off in your mind) everything Erica Jong writes is enjoyable and enlightening, but this by far is her best work.In addition to being well constructed novel, \\"Fear of Flying\\" was the catalyst for the women's liberation movement in the early 70's. Male or female, everyone should read this."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"\\"Fear of Flying\\" by Erica Jong has been praised for its air of liberation and liberating it may be--for some women. I find it hard to relate to a woman who today would most likely be on the highest dosage of Prozac. At the same time however, the book does explore themes such as fear, guilt, freedom and love in a way that I believe all women can relate to. As for liberating, if you need to hear a tale about some crazed writer, her fears, her angst and her mis-judgments to feel liberated, then this is a great book for you.Erica's use of symbolism and stream of consciousness is masterful. The book is entertaining and well written but in the end it is just one woman's crazy experience. And if that crazy experience provides the inspiration that some women need to \\"break free\\" from their socialized behaviors, so be it."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"My first time reading this &quot;classic&quot;. Jong was way ahead of her time as it doesn't even feel dated.

Love it and I would always recommend it to everyone who like good literature."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"This book was recommended to me years and years ago, and only recently did I finally get around to reading it, inspired in large part by a friend of mine sharing the glorious passage where Jong fantasizes about what she calls \\"the zipless f____.\\"I found that it's certainly dated in parts---all the kvetching about psychoanalysis and psychoanalysts---but the central issues are timeless: individual desire vs societal pressures, the raw impulses of the body vs the demands of the socially conditioned mind/heart, the still-all-too-common cultural hypocrisies around sexuality and gender, the endless ups and downs of the habitual monkey mind exacerbated by an advertising-driven consumerist society, etc. And Jong is a masterful stylist---her prose is a pleasure to read, even the few dated or melodramtic/narcissistic parts.Ultimately though, this book is an unwitting illustration of Buddhist philosophy---the last two pages are worth skipping to if you find the rest of the book unpalatable or unappealing. In a nutshell, Jong experiences a kind of enlightenment while soaking in the bathtub of her estranged husband's hotel room, waiting for him to arrive after having run off with another man for the previous couple of weeks and living precisely the kind of anything-goes, totally unfettered and hedonistic life she had always dreamed of and been so afraid of before, only to find that it's not all that either, but realizing it was necessary and beneficial for her to go through it anyway.I loved Philip Roth's \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\" but have to say that \\"Fear of Flying\\" has more depth and universality, in addition to being equal or better in terms of reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"What a great book to read decades later! I laughed out loud so many times! At 55 years old now, its really pathetic how we havent come very far since the 60's and 70's and women just fall back into their roles, probably because its easier! Men should read this book with an open mind, but I don't really know if that's a possibility :)"},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"After readingDream Junkies(great new novel, I highly recommend it), which could also be called Fear of Landing, I realized how in 20 years the Fear of Flying of Erica Yong has come full circle, for many single women like myself. So I wanted to read one more time Fear of Flying to see if I still enjoy it, and although by today's standards is rather tame, the writing is as intellectually vivacious as ever, and I enjoyed it as much as the first time. A must read for any woman, I'd think. By now it's a classic."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I was a little disappointed with this one. It has dated a little, but is cleverly constructed. Is it semi-autobiographical I wondered. It is not as readable as I first thought, but I persevered, and found that Erica Jong has some good logical ideas."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"As a child when this book first came out, I remember hearing that this book blew the lid off women's sexuality, and thinking it must be very \\"steamy.\\" Finally reading it nearly 40 years later, the book was not what I expected....it's not sexy at all! (Maybe it never was.)The story of Isadora's dilemma of loving (or thinking she is in love with) two very different men--her uptight analyst husband and a freewheeling British analyst she meets at a conference--bored me. Her reliance on the men probably made sense in the 70s, but today seems dated. In addition, the two men sounded repulsive, which made the whole situation the opposite of sexy. The issues with her family of origin did not interest me either, although if you are Jewish you might feel differently.So why did I give it four stars? What shone were the parts where Isadora talks about writing. It was almost like two different books--as if the author's true voice comes out when she writes about writing, making those parts seem so much more authentic than the rest of the book. The honesty of this alone, plus its standing as a groundbreaking work, earned it a 4 in my opinion.Overall, Fear of Flying is worth reading, partly as a relic of a certain time and place. But there are also timeless sections that will ring true to women today, and particularly women writers. I found myself underlining many lines about guilt, indecision, the ways we torment ourselves unnecessarily and the challenges of writing honestly and truthfully. This book was not at all what I expected, but I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I have loved this book since it was first published. I do think, however, that Erica Jong and her loyal readers would be very surprised to see it categorized as romace fiction as it for the cyber Monday sale. Romace. Really?

When the novel ends, Jessica is back in New York City, pregnant with William's child. As with any theatrical piece, you must willingly suspend your disbelief and ride out the fantasy. Jong may be the best writer of historical fiction yet with her view of the interactions between men and women."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"This book is one of the most honest books I have ever read. I could not put it down!It was written before I was born but I still felt a strong connection with the protagonist.

I think it is an honest view of a life of a young woman in a search of herself and her path in life told in a framework of her sexual encounters... I would not call it a sensual book, but it is not the point of the book anyway. I enjoyed the way Erica portrayed her boy-friends and husbands stripping them of all their 'protective' layers and presenting them as they are in their glorious 'nakedness' :-) Also I could relate to many female issues mentioned in the book, and I believe that even though we are already in 21st century the book is still a very refreshing read, and many women feel exactly the same as at the times when it was written and published.Thank you Erica!!!"},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"It's hard to find women writers who take a flying leap into the dark waters of self discovery.

Protagonist Isidora likes to sleep around, and since 'effing' was so critical to her, she should have become a hooker.

I thing that Isadora really needs help."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I first read FEAR OF FLYING in 1977. I was 15. My algebra teacher nicked it from my hand, threw it in the trash can and told me it was pornographic garbage, but I was already halfway through the book and smart enough to know that wasn't true. I rescued the book and spent a few weeks in detention, but it was well worth it. FEAR OF FLYING blew my tiny mind on several levels.Because of the open discussion of sex in FEAR OF FLYING, some of the other important themes get back-burnered. For me, having been raised in the 1960s attending Wisconsin Synod Lutheran churches and schools that were dominated by German culture, the greatest impact of the book was how it made me rethink everything I'd been taught about Jews. (Unscrupulously greedy. Killed Jesus. Automatically going to Hell.) Here was the fresh antidote to the heartbreaking guilt of Anne Frank and Corrie ten Boom, along with an electric cattle prod of enlightenment for a child indoctrinated with the party line about how Jews caused the Holocaust by telling Pontius Pilate, \\"Let his blood be on us and our children!\\"Erica Jong's brilliantly wry descriptions of her family, observations about psychoanalysis and running inner dialogue about desire, ambition, pleasure, displeasure, sanity, insanity and womanhood freed my mind in a way that every 15-year-old mind needs to be freed if the 50-year-old to come along later is to be anything close to happy. Erica Jong's wit and intellect profoundly impacted my understanding of literary craft, and I went on to consume everything else she wrote. My evolution as a reader serendipitously coincided with her evolution as a writer. I consider her body of work a major element in my education as an author.So now I'm 50, and I just now finished rereading FEAR OF FLYING for the first time since I rescued that battered paperback from the trash. It holds up beautifully, despite the intervening years. The world has changed, but the human heart has not. It never has and never will, and that's what blew my tiny mind this time around. FEAR OF FLYING is a book that begs to be revisited and deserves a place in every enlightened woman's library. Highly, truly, passionately recommended."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"It has been 36 years since Fear of Flying was first published, and in the years since, Germany has changed, the place of women have changed, sexual mores have changed, and Jewish America has undoubtedly changed as well. Is this book still relevant? Do the questions that protagonist Isadora Wing-- part fictional, part based on author Erica Jong's own life, still speak to us? It's hard to say.But the jokes (for the most part) are still funny, I found myself smiling at this or that absurdity despite myself, despite sharing virtually nothing in common with Isadora. I could sense that the references were timeless, even though I didn't get most of them. And the writing is still high quality-- after finishing this book I started reading a book by another writer published in 2009 and I had to stop because found myself nitpicking almost every sentence as awkward or too literal or not descriptive enough or too wordy.The plot is threadbare- an overachieving, deceptively self-effacing writer with the kind of paranoias that overachieving people tend to have- is given an experience \\"to write about\\" by an Englishman she meets at a psychiatric conference in Vienna. After some agonizing, she decides to take it, a luxury afforded her by a permissive husband who's response to catching her cheating is not violence or abandonment but something that you'll have to read the book yourself to find out. As she goes through her trip with this guy she sprinkles on the literary references to prove her sophistication, sprinkles on the frank sexual passages, and you get to know her family, her first husband, and other background.It's one person's experience and it's not your experience or my experience. But it's pleasurable to read a book like this as long as the writing is so good. It does make you wish that all partners would be so understanding and that all sexual flings would result in \\"a 19th century ending.\\""},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"This book is, if nothing else, masterful in its delivery, prose, wit, and message. I was captivated from page one and reveled in the perspective, the commentary, and the timeliness of the themes -- this book was originally published in 1973, albeit you would be hard-pressed to argue that the material is altogether dated or irrelevant today. As another reviewer already indicated, this book would be easy to pigeonhole as \\"feminist\\" lit, but to do so would be a terrible injustice and would further deter those of us -- men -- from reading what ought to be required reading anyway. This is a book destined to be a classic."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"The heroine is a bloody racist (which is taken for wit, I guess). What a turn-off."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I finally picked up Fear of Flying at the library after hearing about it for decades. I stayed up til 3am reading in fascination, but the shallowness and self-absorption of Isadora didn't describe most of the women I know. Her sexual life and fantasies seem more masculine than feminine, especially her desire for completely anonymous sex. Isadora is an unflattering stereotype of women, showing them as neurotic, masochistic, indecisive, and frivolous. There was little material concerning the objectification of women or the desire to have an authentic and soulful relationship, topics which concern many women. There are some insights and intelligent writing, but overall Isadora doesn't represent most women I know."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"A very witty, funny, insightful and honest book that had surely passed the test of time. With her brilliant writing, Erica Jong had candidly and courageously voiced the hope, the fear, the joy, the anxiety, the desire, and the frustration of being a woman. She did all this with a wonderful sense of humor.I've enjoyed this book very much and more than one time. It has a permanent place on my nightstand. Every time, I want something good to read, I just simply pull this book out, randomly open at any page and start reading. Works every time. Thank you Erica Jong!"},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I very nearly gave up on this one. I'm a woman in my 30's. I have always considered myself a modern, liberated woman. I had a memory of this book on my (feminist) mother's bookshelf, and of being titillated by the racey cover. I had heard that it was a seminal feminist book. So, I finally decided I should fill in this gap in my literary repertoir and read it for myself (or, actually, listen to it for myself).However, as I listened I found I really despised the main character. I was completely unable to relate to her. My generation is very different from hers. I am happy in my marriage, my interpersonal relationships, and my self-image. I've never felt oppressed or smothered by anyone. This woman just seemed disgustingly whiney, neurotic, and childish.I am stubborn, though. At first I kept myself going by telling myself how good it was to see how far we'd really come since then. I thought it was heading for all kinds of extreme endorsements-- live in communes, forsake all commitments, want nothing more from life than perpetual free sex and empty \\"freedom\\". I kept thinking, thank goodness the pendulum has swung back from that extreme into some sanity!In the end though it didn't go where I feared it would. It more than redeemed itself, and I'm glad I stuck with it. It's about a woman finding her own identity, and while the details of path she took to get there ARE rather dated, the journey itself is as pertinent today as it ever was. It IS a wonderful insight into the dilemmas of being a woman, of the differences and conflicts between the sexes, and of what it means to really grow up and be a whole person."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I have tried to read this book over the years three or four separate times. Each time I was unable to get past the opening scene. Where's the sex I wanted to know? What's with all the shrinks, and God they are a dull bunch. This is supposed to be an erotic book right? Turns out the place I needed to be to get this book was a long time in coming.Here's what Marco Vassi--the most intelligent erotic writer of all time-- said about erotic writing and Fear of Flying in particular.\\"Fear of Flying is an extraordinary erotic book, but it's basically a literary novel. The eroticism is of the novel. Erotic literature is literature in which eroticism is the novel. It focuses on that. It also implies a certain degree of description, a certain hard core. And to find novels in which you have plot, character, literary quality, plus detailed and real moving descriptions of ____ is a rarity.\\"Writing about sex and writing to arouse the reader are different things which too often get confused. I would like to see that change. Just because someone writes honestly about sex, or thinking about sex, does not make the book an erotic book, even if one or two passages really make your blood boil.*What about those \\"detailed and real moving descriptions of _____?\\" Almost all of the sex scenes presented in this book were disappointing at some level. When she is having sex there isn't much emotional connection, when she is emotionally connected, or really turned on someone can't get it up. This is a very different reading experience than something like the arcade scenes in Exit to Eden. What you will find in this book are honest discussions on the topic of sex: sexual freedom, sexual fantasy, sexual repression, sexual confusion.Call me stunted, call me slow, but it has taken me a long time to say these things out loud so to find someone else who has already done it so well is a gift. Here's a passage that I marked all to hell it was so relatable. For me it was liberating to see these words in print.\\"Perhaps sex accounted for my fury. Perhaps sex was the real Pandora's box. My mother believed in free love...Yet of course, she did not, or why did she say that boys wouldn't respect me unless I played \\"hard to get\\" ? That boys wouldn't chase me if I \\"wore my heart on my sleeve,\\" that boys wouldn't call me if I \\"made myself cheap\\" ?Sex, I was terrified of the tremendous power it had over me. The energy, the excitement, the power to make me feel totally crazy! What about that? How do you make that jibe with \\"playing hard to get\\"?\\"Vassi says this is, \\"Basically a literary novel.\\" Thank you! This was my thought as I read though the passages that changed point of view, tense, and fell smoothly into profound or hilarious rumination. Isadora does lots of fantasizing, especially what I suspect both women and men can relate to--the zipless _____. Intrigued? Read the book. I would say the purest version of this for me has always been found in books, alone with my authors and their words...After you read the book you can let me know what you think.When I started raving on Facebook a family friend said she hated the book. Apparently Isadora comes off as whiny to some.Fair enough. I can see this, but I would also argue that we hardly ever nail the guys for the same things when they are angsting about finding their place in the world, droning endlessly about their feelings of isolation, or how trapped they feel at the prospect of a new family or a career change. They aren't whining, they are making sense out of important issues. We might even call them philosophers! (A wonderful book that centers on this quite a bit is Kenzeburo Oe's A Personal Matter which I also reviewed. Wonderful book, the author eventually won a Nobel prize.)I could agree with some of the reviewer's comments about the plot, about the main character Isadora's \\"problems.\\" She created a lot of them, and she is not always sympathetic. I could have cared less. What I will continue to recommend about this book are all the passages that sum up a particular situation or emotion, frustrations I had felt that someone else had finally legitimized. Erica Jong fictionalized several situations I had also found myself in, resenting the hell out whatever was going on and hating myself for smiling the whole time because that's what good girls do. Can't embarrass the man and his intellectual or physical failings, though he thinks he is being honest and helpful for pointing out yours.What I find morbidly interesting is the fact that this book came out the year Roe v. Wade was passed. Could women in 1973 imagine that we would still have to listen to politicians make snide remarks about birth control in the year 2012? Maybe they could, maybe they were less optimistic than I am. For 2012, none of the situations or thoughts presented should be shocking. I've had much more graphic conversations with my friends over coffee at Starbucks, but I imagine in 1973 to see these thoughts in print, and to have people talking about zipless _____, Tampax, and running away with that handsome stranger was something to see indeed.To judge Fear of Flying, without benefit of the same social and political climate has got to be a mistake. To read this book now, I have to consider all the women who came before me, who divorced their husbands because they were not happy, who demanded to be taken care of in bed, who decided against having children so they could pursue their life's goals. All of this surely could not have been as common and as acceptable as it is now. I would love to hear from any women who were adults at the time Fear of Flying came out and get a sense of what you think has changed if anything.I can understand women who worked for a certain level of equality becoming impatient with Isadora and her angst, they were too busy making changes to stop and worry about anything else. Good for them, I send a sincere thank you and say God Bless. I would also would argue that being impatient with Isadora doesn't make the angst any less relatable. Who hasn't paid careful attention for half an hour while a male loved one spouted facts about a new civil war book he's reading, only to have him put on an impatient face two minutes into your own explanation of something you find just as fascinating?I would almost argue that the frustration the reader may feel with Isadora for making the decisions she does, staying with and listening to all her stupid male analysts, her infatuation with the infuriating Adrian, are part of what made me appreciate the book. My reactions to her behavior said a lot about me and I learned things about myself from having that experience. It is much easier to judge other women than to admit that we are often also mirrors of each other's behavior. Sometimes I was ashamed to admit I had done some of the same things I was frustrated with Isadora for. She struggled with guilt for leaving a man who would in the end equal a lifetime of unhappiness and sacrifice. I know some women who say they don't have time to write, to work on their art, to do any number of things that are important to them because hubby spends their after work time on his hobby. Someone after all has to look after the kids. At least they aren't being bitchy and demanding like Isadora though. Where would we be if everyone were like her?In the first few years of my marriage I am ashamed to admit I hardly read any of the books I loved so much because my husband, who doesn't read, felt left out. Me, who came to that marriage with three full shelves of books and about ten different projects in mind! Erica Jong has gone farther in identifying that dumb female need to make everyone so happy than anyone I have read before. She also did a beautiful job showing us how we force these ideas on our friends and our daughters. (Another reason I need to spend more time with the women.) In Isadora's bitchiness, and refusal to just go along in many situations, I was reminded how easy it is to give up my own happiness, my own strength, my own ambition to take care of kids, hubby, friends who need me, whatever. Certainly they all matter to me, and certainly I cannot only live for me, or I would cease to be me, but does it have to be one or the other? Isadora Wing, though confused and clueless sometimes, stands up for herself, and when she doesn't she stops to consider why. It was in these moments that I felt the most grateful.What I did through most of the book was fold down pages and mark passages with my thumbnail until I was able to get ahold of a pencil. Don't read this book for the story or for any kind of lesson about anything, unless of course you find something relevant in that. Read this book for what is relatable, good and bad. Here is one of my favorite passages:\\"So I learned about women from men. I saw them through the eyes of male writers. Of course, I didn't think of them as male writers. I thought of them as writers, as authorities, as gods who knew and were to be trusted completely.Naturally I trusted everything they said, even when it implied my own inferiority.\\"That last line almost made me ill it was so applicable to me. The passage goes on to give examples and when combined with all the men who keep telling her what is wrong with her and the fact that she listens to them makes the point yet again. Well what the ____ are you listening to them for? Makes you want to slap her and then hug her for finally coming to her senses. I challenge any woman to tell me she hasn't ever done the same thing.And guess who contributed a blurb...Henry Miller**!\\"It is rare these days to come upon a book written by a woman which is so refreshing, so gay and sad at the same time, and so full of wisdom about the eternal man-woman problem.\\"What I find interesting about the Miller quote is that he sees the problems Erica Jong shows us as \\"eternal.\\" Maybe they are when you consider that in some ways not much has changed about the dynamics between the sexes, we still routinely give up our dreams to support Him, nurture the family, while neglecting ourselves, and when we do finally stand up and take charge, we have to contend with a fair amount of guilt for doing so.Maybe for me what is terrifying to admit is how easy it is to give up our best selves for some ideal that we can't even identify in the real world. Ever since I read this book I have had even more reason to hate The Princesses.Read this book. You may hate it, but I would hazard a guess that even then you will find some of yourself in this crazy woman's thoughts and fantasies. This is an important book that I can't believe more women haven't read, and men for that matter. I also guess that everyone who reads it will take away something different and am eager to hear from anyone willing to discuss the book.*Anyone read Outlander? My word, there were a few scenes in there that really worked for me, though the book is classified as a historical romance.** See my review of Tropic of Cancer. I love Henry Miller, but I never found much of his writing all that erotic either."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"When I can see a reflection of myself within a novel, it is fated to become one of my favorite books.Published in 1973, Fear Of Flying tells the story of Isadora Wing a twenty something woman who travels to Europe with her husband for a conference in the process, discovers herself.The book is snarky, cynicall, funny, emotional, raw, honest, sexy and a great read.I reccomend it to any woman between 20 and 30, it will change your life."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"A book Henry Miller himself called the female equivalent of Tropic of Cancer, Jong's in-depth look at her life and the choices she's made and how they impacted her future are revealed through this outstanding work. Isadora, the book's protagonist, longs to be a serious writer, free from the restraints of writing about the compositions of others, wanting nothing more than to create her own masterpieces rather than critique those of others.Not only does Jong open our eyes to the possibilities that lie within the main characters, but also she allows us the opportunity to see those within ourselves. Her words echo true today as the struggles of Isadora are not limited to the period in which she lives. It's rare to find a female perspective of the struggles of marriage and the contemplation of infidelity. Oftentimes when encountering such problems, female protagonists \`take the high road', seemingly oblivious to the reality that yes, women do in fact cheat. Jong's frequent mentions of Simone de Beauvoir, whose phenomenal work The Second Sex depicts the role of the woman throughout history, remind readers that despite the obvious feminine undertones, the author depended heavily on the opinions of her long-time lover, Sartre. Fear of Flying instead takes the path of a woman who, while married to her quiet and boring husband, craves excitement in the arms of her roguish beau. Frequently debating the choices she's made in her life, Isadora explores the role that past decisions have caused in her present situation. She tells of her first husband whose psychotic breakdown leads her to seek out a less volatile, seemingly safe marriage to a Chinese psychoanalyst, and in turn, her affair with an arrogant businessman.A particularly poignant reflection by Isadora describes choosing to have children as an arrogant decision. Her mother has always insisted that she would be a famous artist if it hadn't been for her children. The modern woman strives to have it all, a successful career balanced with a happy family. But isn't the reality that having a child is often a selfish choice? Ask any mother why she wants to have a child, and her response typically (coupled with a dreadful glare) includes something about you'll never know the love you can feel for another until you see your own child. Jong explores the possibility that women can actually lead perfectly satisfactory lives without children. Shocking, I know, but it's a reality echoed by a number of women choosing not to do so. I guess that it's hard for those who feel that they were put on earth to be mothers (seriously, that's what some say) to realize that there is a great big world out there, full of possibilities which are not really open to those with children, or at least are not as accessible.Isadora often contemplates ridding herself of both her husband and her lover. The ambiguous ending symbolizes her rebirth; while not sure of the direction in which her life is headed, she's at peace with herself and the decisions she has made.Fear of Flying is a remarkable book - it's a definite must-read for women who value themselves and have the desire to live a happy, healthy life based upon one's own choices rather than those suggested by society."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"OK. I'll admit that since I was born in 1967, I missed the sexual revolution. After reading FEAR OF FLYING, I am almost glad I did miss it! This book, to me, seemed nothing more than self-serving name-dropping references to supposed cultural ideas and icons who incidentally did not stand the test of time. I think that Jong must have meant this book for people who were alive during this time. A lot of the references seemed to me to be awfully obscure. A real classic work can handle cultural references without making the reader feel as if the author is being condescending and only showing off her education. This book seems to me to just be a showcase for Jong's own insecurity. I expected more emphasis on fantasy and sexuality and less on pseudointellectualism and shallowness. This book has been compared to PORTNOY's COMPLAINT. I find PORTNOY to be a much better character, much more developed and more honest. At least I did not need Who's Who nor Facts on File to read Roth's work! DON'T BUY FEAR OF FLYING. It is a waste of time and money. If you want mental masturbation, simply get a dictionary and a vibrator."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"While there are many levels to this book (see the reviews below), what particularly appealed to me was its author's call to courage. In short, &quot;Fear of Flying&quot; is inspiring (to me) in that its main character is a very recognizable person who attempts to deal with very recognizable fears and anxieties. I have read it with great enjoyment on more than one occasion, each time being left with new insights and perspectives. Thankyou, Erica Jong."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"Once upon a time, we ignored the rules or rewrote the rules or realized there just weren't any rules, after all. Sex was just sex: Good, bad, ugly and funny. Especially FUNNY. And - oh, my! - it could even be GUILTLESS. There is certainly some lovely erotic classic liturature out there, as some reviewers have pointed out. But, honestly, when I'm speeding along in the dark via Amtrak or stuck in the elevator with that guy from marketing, suspended somewhere between the 43rd and 44th floors, it's the ZF that comes to mind, not Lady Chatterley.I loved this book when I first read it. Maybe it just has to be right right time of your life...."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"I tried giving it a shot but the book is (1) not sexy, as it is marketed, (2) about a lurid main character/narrator whom I can't follow, (3) filled with 1970s-style Freudian psycho-bull that attempts, amateurishly, to explain gender roles and relations, and (4) very solipsistic. It doesn't seem at all like fiction but the bickerings of a sexually frustrated woman who thinks too much about herself and who doesn't seem to be all that bright but manages to parade under some kind of feministic pseudo-intellectual banner. I just found the narrator despicable and didn't finish the book. I can't believe it has such a high review on Amazon, which means, I guess, that the majority of people reading it in 2011 are people who are already sympathetic to the book or author.Don't bother. If you want sex pick up Anais Nin or Zane or Philip Roth--anything else that has a story or good prose style, just not this."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"Before I typed my review I looked at some of the others that were posted. My copy of Fear of Flying is the one published in the 70's. I mainly decided to read this book since I have been looking at it for a few years and I just never had the time. I am glad I did read it. I was too young to read it when it was first published and had never heard of it before I owned a copy.I decided to read Fear of Flying for a change of pace. I sure chose the right book for that. When I started reading Fear of Flying the title of the first chapter caught my attention. I have read books with cursing in them before but not one with it in the title. That didn't stop me from continuing the book, that made me more interested.If you are needing a change in what you have been reading then pick up Fear of Flying. Fear of Flying is a story of what a woman really thinks about when it comes to sex. I found myself laughing inside while reading Fear of Flying.Isadora is the lead female character who is married to Bennett, an analyst. Isadora is a writer. The story revolves around Isadora and her feelings about family, sex and what she really wants out of life. Her sisters think she should stop writing and start a family. Isadora doesn't want to become like her sisters yet. I found myself thinking of times when I felt my marriage was going bad and realizing I had the same thoughts as Isadora.Fear of Flying was an enjoyable read even though at times I felt confused or lost in the story. Every man and woman should read Fear of Flying if you are in a relationship and you feel bored with your relationship. You will certainly look at your relationship differently. I rate the book 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Fear of Flying CD","review":"Erica Jong takes us on an intrapsychic merry-go-round as her heroine searches for the right blend of sexual satisfaction, secure attachment and love.

The photographs are first rate."},{"Title":"The City of Women: A Sequence of Poems and Prose","review":"This latest work by award-winning poet Sherod Santos -- who has been referred to in reviews as both Keatsean and Rilke-like -- breaks with the conventions of the genre to create a montage of untitled meditations, narrative prose, memory fragments and songlike passages, as well as verse. Less a collection of thematically related pieces than a prolonged inquiry, &quot;The City of Women&quot; represents, as Santos writes in the first of the work's three parts, &quot;the story of my life/In love,the buried life I know little about,/Perhaps know nothing at all.&quot;The raw beauty of Santos's images and the musical grace of his language wash soothingly over the imagination, lending even the darker portions of his work -- and there are many -- an elegance that somehow makes the terrible more bearable.Santos does not shy away from the more unseemly, ugly aspects of interactions between men and women, nor does he portray himself as the protagonist above reproach. Even as one is &quot;in&quot; love, he tells us, it is possible to feel sad, lonely and bereft. Every alliance, he seems to conclude, will spawn its share of betrayals great and small, recriminations, shame.Yet &quot;The City of Women&quot; is not driven by a nihilistic vision. Throughout the poem-sequence, we are treated to divine glimpses of love at its best; even his parents' doomed marriage, Santos says, provided evidence of the power of love to rise above individual failings.While Santos provides few comforting answers for his readers, by the end of this work we understand better what the questions are. He offers this stark examination of his own vulnerabilities and frailties so that we may be courageous enough to face our own."},{"Title":"Peter Graves","review":"I read this book about 25 years ago, more or less, and I still remember it like it was yesterday. A marvelous mix of adventure, fantasy, and suspense, with a light touch of science fiction. One of the many reasons I loved this story was because the plot, while wonderfully zany, just never stopped moving forward. The story follows the exploits of Peter Graves, a rather swashbuckling youngster, as he meets the inventor Houghton Furlong and becomes embroiled in a scheme to raise a huge amount of money in very little time. Peter is the kind of kid we all would like to have been (and some of us may have come close), but what's magical about this book is the way in which DuBois (the author) takes a fantastic plot point - Furlong's inventions - and presents them as feasible and believable concepts. This story works with a minimal suspension of disbelief, and it's a pity that it's out of print. By all means, look for this title. You'll thank yourself for the effort expended to obtain this book. A truly worthwhile read - funny, exciting, memorable characters and scenes, and an otherworldly &quot;feel&quot; that is reminiscent of the Narnia books or the world of Willy Wonka. Fabulous storytelling - quirky sensibility - great fun!"},{"Title":"Peter Graves","review":"The central story revolves around the eccentric, yet kindly inventor Furlong, and the mischievous yet responsible Peter Graves, who must somehow find a way to _make money_ out of Furlong's amazing invention.Suppose that all _you_ had to work with was six golf-ball sized lumps of an amazing antigravity alloy, with an upward pull of fifty pounds each... And no time to make more or interest a big company in the invention. How could _you_ use them somehow to earn $40,000 in one summer?The incredible combination of whimsical fantasy and prosaic down-to-earth realism... the incredible story that sort of rambles in a picaresque way... wonderful for reading aloud because every chapter stands on its own, but a page-turner all the same... and an almost unique blending of illustration and story. It is NOT an illustrated story; it is NOT a series of captioned pictures; the two work together.And I didn't even tell you about the game of follow-the-leader, with Peter trying to shake off his followers by taking them to various risky places (with dramatic point-of-view perspective illustrations from the top of a suspension bridge...)

Published about 20 years ago but it was in perfect shape."},{"Title":"Hidden Face of Eve: Women in the Arab World","review":"Nawal Al-Sa'Dawi's book The Hidden Face of Eve is absolutely essential to any global study of feminism. While it's true that the book was written in the 70s, it's important to note that many of the subjects Sa'Dawi examines are timeless - especially with regard to patriarchy - which in many of its manifestations - remains unchanged to this day and is not emblematic of any single nation, or of any single religious dogma.Sa'Dawi opens by recounting the night she and her sister were subjected to circumcision. Her child's mind remembers the sound of rasping butcher knives, and the account is both heart wrenching, and yet somehow, removed. Sa'Dawi emphasizes that female circumcision, or FGM, is NOT Islamic - despite what many Egyptians mistakenly believe - and openly condemns the procedure in all its various extremes.One cannot help but feel enormous respect for Sa'Dawi for her work as a doctor in poverty stricken villages, for her outspoken and vigilant opposition to inequity, - even within her own family - and for her graceful scholarly look at the history of the oppression of women. Indeed, Sa'Dawi's political activities led to her imprisonment under Sadat, but she continues to work for the cause of social justice even under the current political milieu which has, yet again, sought to silence her. Nawal Al-Sa'Dawi considered running for president, but withdrew her candidacy because she was repeatedly kept from legitimately campaigning. It's a shame that Mubarak is unwilling to have an open election. Could he be afraid of losing to a woman?Initially I was drawn to Nawal Al-Sa'Dawi because the idea of Egyptian feminism, or Islamic feminism seemed wholly unexplored by western scholars. Her examination of the veil, or hijab, and its origins is put into both historical and Islamic context. Truly over the years the veil has come to mean many different things to different people. In a world where the word \`terrorism' and \`islam' have become almost synonymous it's more important than ever to understand the mentality of post-colonialism. Today, Arab youth are daily striving for an identity which is independent of western influence - enter Islamism, enter the veil, enter the extremism we see reported daily in the news.An absolute MUST-READ for anyone seeking to understand patriarchy, post-colonialism, Islamic culture, and what motivates the current trend in Islamic countries toward extremism..."},{"Title":"Hidden Face of Eve: Women in the Arab World","review":"The Hidden Face of Eve is a collection of short essays on female suppression in Egypt including female circumcision and the imporance of the hymen in society. Saadawi is a female doctor in that region. She begins by describing her own circumcision which was forced and traumatic and done when she was a very young girl. She goes on to describe many cruel things that she saw as a doctor including botched circumcisions and mutilations done to brides to get a good bleed on the wedding day and prove that the woman had a hymen. Each chapter is kind of a mini-essay on some topic off of these themes. The chapters feel as if they are meant to stand alone. There is a lot of overlap from one chapter to the next, and the book feels more like parts than a whole.If the subject matter is what you are looking for then you will get a lot of it here. Much of what Saadawi is saying is anecdotal and based on what she saw or had heard of as a doctor rather than gathered statistical data. This makes sense in that this isn't the type of information that lends itself to surveys. Much of it deals with really private and painful experiences. It might be good to temper this with a more mathemathical approach so that this would bring the feeling for the people involved but there would be big picture objectivity from elsewhere."},{"Title":"Hidden Face of Eve: Women in the Arab World","review":"Interesting look at Egyptian women's lives. It sounded like the 1950's or 60's but I was surprised to see the book was published in 1980. I hope things have improved since then but I think her observation that women will continue to be subjugated by men as long as they do not have any valid means of supporting themselves is fairly true. It was a bit of a surprise to read her theory linking the evils of Capitalism and women's issues- freeing women from unpaid labour in the house to being used as a cheap sources of Labour."},{"Title":"Hidden Face of Eve: Women in the Arab World","review":"It appears that most of Saadawi's books were written and published during the early 1980s, with nothing really new thereafter, besides reprints. She had her own website in 2009, in which she noted her displeasure with U.S. President Obama's speech to Muslims in Cairo, Egypt. In HIDDEN FACE OF EVE she reveals that she is anti-capitalistic, and supports some form of a socialist economy. In HIDDEN FACE OF EVE she clearly establishes herself as Egypt's most outspoken feminist. She opposes any genital mutilation of girls, and rails against fundamentalist Arab governments that curtail educational opportunities for women, and rebukes the Muslim cultural norms whereby men prevent women from having the same \`human rights' that men have: easy divorce, owning property, voting, dating, etc. She was imprisoned for a month in 1981 for opposing Egyptian Pres. Sadat's recognizing the existence of the Jewish state of Israel. Rather than recognizing the stronger fighting spirit of Israeli soldiers during the 1967 Six Day War, or the lack of battle stamina of the Arab soldiers, Saasadawi offered a novel idea as to why the Israeli military routed the Palestinians from Palestine: because the Palestinian males were so afraid that the Israeli soldiers might abuse captured Palestinian women, instead of defending their homeland, \\"one of the factors that forced the Arabs to leave the West Bank of Jordan during the 1967 war was their desire to protect the \`honour' of their womenfolk\\" (p. 2); flee, instead of fighting! Heroism, indeed! The author faults the psychologist Freud in misunderstanding women (p. 152). She writes a lot of detailed analysis in explaining why the male-dominated Muslim culture so oppresses women. She rebukes the Islamic idea that women are Satan's handmaidens. She refers very frequently to the Quran/Koran and the ahadith to either support her feminist beliefs or to rebuke Muslim male malevolence. Nonetheless, she still concludes that Islam is the solution rather than the problem for women -- if only the male imams would recognize Eve's sexual enlightenment that is hidden beneath her veil."},{"Title":"Hidden Face of Eve: Women in the Arab World","review":"The Hidden Face of Eve is a collection of short essays on female suppression in Egypt including female circumcision and the imporance of the hymen in society.

Most of the toys are essentially stuffed animals. Many have pockets to hold other items, a few with magnets or velcro to attach to the child, other toys, etc. The games feature standards like ring toss, bean bag toss, matching, tic-tac-toe. There are a handful of puppets and dolls- again very standard- pop-up, topsy-turvy, etc.Based on the photos of the book, I expected original concepts for soft toy making. The author has a wonderful sense of color, whimsy, and pattern. I had high expectations. I was disappointed to find the usual types of cloth toys and games from my own childhood rather than new and innovative games and uses of materials. If I take the time to make these toys, I just don't see them really inspiring my children's play time."},{"Title":"Easy-to-Sew Playful Toys: 25 Soft Toys with Interactive Fun","review":"I am dissappointed by the projects in this book. In many cases, the instructions indicate that parts should be glued together when sewing them together would be simple enough and would increase the longevity of the finished work (important considering the end user).

It introduced me to modular origami back when I was just making boxes and cranes. The instructions are excellent and I have made so many models for gifts, decorations, you name it! Fuse's models decorate my bookshelf and have delighted many of my friends and family members. This book is definitely for more experienced folders, however I do have a friend that borrowed the book and had never done origami before, and he used some of Fuse's methods to build an amazing bridge of his own creation. You can use the methods to create models in the book as well as your own pieces of art. I HIGHLY recommend this book and any other written by Tomoko Fuse."},{"Title":"Unit Origami: Multidimensional Transformations","review":"This book is absolutely fascinating. I am a graphic designer by profession and love all crafts. This book has transformed the way I look at paper. I would have never imagined that it is possible to make such objects.

This is a great book and would recommend it heartily. Nothing but Brilliant."},{"Title":"Unit Origami: Multidimensional Transformations","review":"Elegance is the only word to use in describing Fuse's deft and sometimes beautifly simple modular designs. I routinely use it in teaching Geometry. It takes about 20 minutes to teach a high school or middle school class to fold a single unit. Mass production like this makes it easy to build a really impressive 30-unit stellated icosahedron. The photographs in the book are awesome, and frequently inspire the most unlikely kids to fold. Fuse's UNIT ORIGAMI is the most readable, best illustrated and most complete work I have on modular origami. Easily the best of my English language collection.

I'd never been all that keen on unit origami until I discovered her brilliantly structured folds. The individual units are clever and sometimes almost fractal. The process of folding multiple units is meditative, and the final puzzle of interlocking them to form a geometric unit is a delight, made moreso by the great solidity of the finished piece - all without adhesives! A book I'd recommend to folders of any level!"},{"Title":"Unit Origami: Multidimensional Transformations","review":"Fuse has written a book all about one of her favorite areas of origmami: modular creations. Modular origami is created when you fold multiple copies of the same unit and then work them together to create a larger model. It looks gorgeous, but can be very time consuming and frustrating if your model is made of 60 units. I like this book alot, but it is clear that Fuse's ability to fold is light years beyond mine. Still, she always gives clear directions and diagramms so that if you are patient you can make gorgeous models."},{"Title":"Unit Origami: Multidimensional Transformations","review":"I am a teacher of students in 5th through 8th grade and I found this book to be a great addition to the geometry unit I teach.

The students were able to follow the great diagrams, made some beautiful pieces and had a concrete object of their learning. I would recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"Unit Origami: Multidimensional Transformations","review":"I appreciate Tomoko Fuse's work because her designs are simple, yet elegant, and they are very clearly explained and diagrammed. She approaches her subject in such a manner than she manages to demystify it so that the reader isn't too intimidated to attempt a project. Hers is the first name I turn to when I'm ready to move on to other techniques, designs, or styles. This book was no different in that regard. It is, as the name implies, instruction on creating multiple UNITS that will then be assembled into different shapes and designs. For that reason, I would say it is defintely for a dedicated enthusiast, as it definitely takes some patience to connect some of these units in a way that will leave the final model smooth and unblemished. However, this is the case with any modular or unit style origami, and not specific to Tomoko's work. If anything, she manages to take some of the mystery out of it in the process and even include encouragement where necessary. I enjoyed her little snippets of insight into her method and approach, as well as her deep admiration and reverence for the craft in general, which comes through in these writings. I fold paper because it gives me a sense of peace and satisfaction through accomplishment. Each new project is a tiny little victory when completed, and works as well for me as meditation. These many different units and connecting them in fun and different ways is certainly fulfilling for those who have that constant inner urge to fold, and then not knowing what to do with tons of cranes, birds, and boxes, etc., that you've created. I just fold different kinds of units over and over, then when I'm ready, I can attempt to connect them later on. There are enough different units and ways to connect them that I am stimulated for hours on end with no end in sight yet. If you are just beginning to fold, I would hold off on this book until you get used to something simpler, like her book \\"Origami Boxes.\\""},{"Title":"Unit Origami: Multidimensional Transformations","review":"Beautiful colour photographs, endless complex pieces of unit origami and clear instructions put this book above many others in its category.

For instance, after doing the tests and quizzes in the book, I was explained that \\"Being 43% Vata, 65% Pitta and 32% Kapha, you are intense and fiery, with a strong drive and self-control. Of medium build and strength, you feel sharp hunger and thirst and get irritable and feel faint if you don't eat on time\\".This was so true! For years I had struggled with food cravings, sugar imbalances and general grumpiness when I was hungry and didn't have food at hand. I was never able to be more than 2 or 3 hours without something to eat. I used to panic whenever I would look to what my day would bring if I couldn't organize myself around food.The book continues: \\"Hot weather is not your friend. You tend to communicate through your skin - glowing and radiant healthy and happy\\".So many people comment about my skin. I can't really cope with sun. A little sun feels as if it scorches my skin. And I always put cream on every day after my bath or shower because my skin feels so dry if I don't. But the point is that I live in sunny Cape Town, in South Africa! And EVERYONE loves the sun there! So I stand out like a sore thumb and everyone asks me why I am not tanned. I have always told them that I am not a lizard like them; that I am a salamander!! That I always need moisture in my skin... and I didn't know why until now!After reading this book I felt that I was put in the right track to continue with my search of tools to hold age at bay: I was able to add certain oils to my beauty and health regimes and I was able to focus my nutrition to re-energize and rejuvenate my system.And these were only the first few steps that I was able to take to add to my newly found body consciousness (as up to then I had only worked at soul level) to start to nourish my body, mind and spirit all at once.

This book differs however in that the friendship portrayed is Garden's Corner takes the reader on a dark ride into how friendship molds and shapes our behavior and destinies, enabling us to deal with life's challenges with the omnipotent knowledge that &quot;we are not alone.&quot; Little Speedy Copeland, a very lovable and vulnerable character, took me along on his personal and yearnful journey into self discovery and acknowledgement. Through his various observations, of friends and family, of life's many ups and downs, I was compelled to re-evaluate my own. I liked this book very much because it moved me without an overdose of sentimentality. I trust my heart strings and they're generally unaffected by pretentious nonsense. This book came across as a truly honest work of exceptional depth, despite some of it's sophomoric ideas, and sometimes claustrophobic atmosphere. It was well worth the read. I look forward to future works by Mr. Reed. Don't make us wait to long!"},{"Title":"Garden's Corner: A Novel","review":"I read Garden's Corner cover to cover and I must say that as an avid reader, I was immensely impressed. Mr. Reed's portrayal of good versus evil and his contrast of light versus dark took on a different dimension in the eyes of Little Speedy Copeland. Garden's Corner is a novel about relationships, comparisons and contrasts all through the eyes of a very intuitive teenager.I was blessed to have an exclusive interview with the author to gain some insight regarding his genre. Mr. Reed's ability to capture and contain the urban voice and viewpoint without exaggeration was evident in the persona and character of Speedy Copeland. As I read, I was reminded of the similarities of The Catcher in the Rye. However, Garden's Corner set on the stage of the Burrough of Brooklyn took a panoramic view of an urban odyssey of a teen with an &quot;edge&quot; in life. I highly recommend Garden's Corner for anyone who has a desire to know firsthand how children with an &quot;edge in life&quot; survive and perceive the world in which they live.Mr. Reed's narrative was truly inspirational and thought-provoking.Mr. Reed, thank you for sharing Little Speedy Copeland and his Urban Odyssey with us."},{"Title":"Garden's Corner: A Novel","review":"Garden's Corner concerns the psychological and physical journey of Speedy Copeland to recover from a gun shot wound and recover the purpose of his life. The novel has much of what good novels are about: an archtypical journey of youth to manhood, interesting characters, a likeable hero, some passages that are very powerful. But Reed misses the target. Speedy's clmactic speech is banal, very typical. While many people may not rise to these kind of occasions in their lives, in a novel our hero must. Speedy needs to say something more than what can appear to be an adolescent whine.Reed diverges in his story with other stories, whose purpose is to relate to that part of the story. He begins one such by saying how Miss Pearl, Speedy's grandmother, told him a prayer that he found meaningful. For several pages Speedy recounts his journey into religion to demonstrate that he is not religious, but that this prayer was meaningful to him anyway. The reader starts feeling: get to the point, what is the prayer. It is one we all have heard before. Not that a young person person cannot find this significant he hears it for the first time, but the build-up is less than the punch.There is a powerful short story in the middle of the novel about two black boys playing a one-on-one for the pleasure of a white coach. The reader may suspect that Mr. Reed has written this before and has pasted in his story. But the presence of this episode is relevant, helping to fill out the character and setting us up for the journey.The reason I believe the novel is flawed is the divergences that take place that are not necessary. At some point in time while reading the story, the reader will discover the truth that is the ending before one gets there. That is not fatal. However, with that in mind, Speedy ought to have a speech or narrative that has some punch. That was a big disappointment."},{"Title":"Garden's Corner: A Novel","review":"There is no doubt that with little effort, Douglas S. Reed could become a superb storyteller and first-rate novelist. It's my opinion that the author obviously has the great ability to place the reader in the context of a story. I could not help but have an affinity and compassion for &quot;Little Speedy Copeland,&quot; the book's central character. Through the course of the story, the reader witnesses Speedy's growth as a Black youth facing difficult issues growing up in the inner city. At the book's end, this reader believes that Speedy puts to rest some demons that have plaqued him for quite awhile.However, I do have some problems with the novel. While I agree that fiction does not need be (nor should be) a social dissertation on the issues of our complex world, I do believe that writers have a responsibility to not put forth oppressive rhetoric. At various instances, I found Garden's Corner to do just that (ie. regarding homosexuality and bi-racial marriage). I often think that many authors (and sad to say many black ones) must confirm a character's &quot;manhood&quot; by placing it in the context of homosexuality thus implying that gay men are less than male. As a Gay man, I found some sections of the book problematic. Mr. Reed is obviously a fine writer; however, I believe that if he would break down some of the walls around &quot;Little Speedy Copeland,&quot; the reader would find a much more interesting character and story. While I found the story at times riveting, I believe that &quot;Little Speedy Copeland's&quot; at times cookie-cutter solutions somewhat disappointing. At the novel's end, this reader got the sense that Little Speedy has somewhat evolved. I was left wondering what would a Garden's Corner Part 2: The Adult Years be like. How would a grown-up and mature Speedy deal with adult issues -- issues that were touched on during his teenage years."},{"Title":"Garden's Corner: A Novel","review":"Garden's Corner is a book that everyone should read.

Burning Questions of Our Movement\\" is one of V. I. Lenin's most important works. It lays out his strategy of revolutionary change. The Publisher's Note starts the book off, putting it in context (Page v): \\"In Lenin's concept a leading, a vanguard party could be only a party of revolutionary Marxism and this required at the outset a clear definition and rejection of opportunism.\\"This slender volume attempts to lay out an approach to revolutionary change. The key actor is the party, to serve as a vanguard for the masses, to make decisions in their name and in their interest. One function of the party is to accelerate the development of class consciousness among the Russian \\"have notes.\\" Lenin observes that (page 78) \\"'Everyone agrees' that it is necessary to develop the political consciousness of the working class. The question is, how that this is to be done and what is required to do it.\\" He responds to his own question (Page 79): \\"To bring political knowledge to the workers, the Social-Democrats must go among all classes of the population; they must dispatch units of their army in all directions.\\"This vanguard party would include professional revolutionaries and others, all bound together by the need to foment revolutionary fervor among the masses. In the process, vehicles such as the \\"'plan for an All-Russian newspaper '. . . is the most practical plan for immediate and all-round preparation of the uprising. . . .\\" He also identifies as enemies those who would urge slow, evolutionary change.This is, in the end, Lenin's tactical textbook, his blueprint for revolutionary change. As such, it is an important historical and political document. Will readers be convinced by his logic? Many will not, but it is nonetheless important to understand his sense of what is needed to bring about a revolution."},{"Title":"What Is to Be Done?: Burning Questions of Our Movement","review":"Every militant who wants to fight for socialism, or put the fight for socialism back on the front burner, needs to read this book. Every radical who believes that society can be changed by just a few adjustments needs to read this book in order to understand the limits of such a position. Thus, it is necessary for any politically literate person of this new generation to go through the arguments of this classic of Marxist literature in order to understand the strategic perspective for socialism in the 21st century. Older militants can also benefit from a re-reading of this work. Except for the obvious change of names and organizations from those with while Lenin argued on my re-reading of this document I was astonished by the appropriateness of the arguments presented.Militants of my generation, the Generation of \`68, came late to an appreciation of the importance of this book and spent a lot of wasted time and energy on other strategies. Those so-called New Left theories that ran the gamut from mild social reform through vicarious guerilla warfare to revolutionary terror had, however, one common axis- denial of the centrality of the working class as the motor force for revolution, especially in the advanced capitalist countries. Once the most thoughtful of us came understand the bankruptcy of our previous strategies Lenin's little book became compulsory reading. Lenin's What Is To Be Done? thus takes it place as one of the basic documents of the revolutionary Marxist movement along with Marx and Engel's Communist Manifesto.Although the book was written to address the disputes among socialists at the beginning of the 20th century the arguments presented have relevance today. And what are those arguments. There are three main points which are interrelated; the need for a fight against a reformist and for a revolutionary perspective to fight to the end for establishment of a socialist order; the need for a revolutionary organization of professional revolutionaries to lead the vanguard of the working class to socialism; and, the necessity for an independent vanguard both in its relationship to the working class as a whole and to other social classes. Although the political opponents that Lenin was polemizing against, and this document is a polemic, are long gone and his literary style would not be to today's taste these were and continue to be the defining issues of revolutionary strategy today.After the experience of one hundred years of reformist socialist practice under capitalism it is hard to believe that the fight against such a limitation of the socialist program was a central argument that animated not only the Russian revolutionary movement but the international social democracy as well. The fight against revision of the Marxist program of class struggle and the need to fundamentally change the structure of society that began in that period seeped into the Russian movement as well. Thus, it was therefore necessary to polemize against this trend. Lenin, and others, rose to the occasion. Their argument, in short, was- Do you fight to the finish against the old social order or not? In Lenin's case we know the answer. Readers can decide for themselves whether he was right.The controversy over kind of organization necessary to lead the masses to socialism has been present since at least the 1800's. The forms have varied over time from self-contained revolutionary conspiracies to revolutionary terrorist cells to mass reformist parties confined to the parliamentary struggle. Lenin brought a new concept to the organization question among Marxists not only for Russia but also after the seizure of power in the Communist International for international strategy. Simply put, if you do not want to make a revolution you do not need a vanguard party of professional revolutionaries. Moreover, these revolutionaries act as tribunes of the people fighting against all kinds of arbitrary action. If you do want to make a revolution, you need to address the organization question. The challenge is not to get caught up in the form. One thing is certain you cannot fight to the end against capitalism with a party that has two wings- reformist and revolutionary. Come the struggle for power and you have former comrades on different sides of the barricade. Study this question with care.At that time Lenin wrote (1902) the question of what classes will lead the revolution and what forces will it rely on was a central question, especially in the Russian socialist movement. In the West at the time it was obvious that the working class was the central agency and that it would rely on the urban and rural petty bourgeoisies. In Russia, however, which had not experienced some form of bourgeois revolution, the central dispute did not get resolved until October 1917 when the Bolsheviks relying on the peasantry, and especially the declassed peasant soldier resolved the issue. The results, of that victory, as they say, are the subject for another discussion. What s noteworthy here is how skeptical Lenin was of the liberal bourgeoisie this early as any kind of ally in the revolutionary struggle. That skepticism should be a signpost for today's militants. No, this should be etched in every militant's brain. Ally with whoever you can over democratic issues (as long as you retain freedom of criticism) but you must in the current American reality break with the Democratic Party- party of the liberal bourgeoisie This is one of the political textbooks you need to read if you want to change the world. Read it."},{"Title":"What Is to Be Done?: Burning Questions of Our Movement","review":"I don't get it. Not that book, that I get. What I don't get is why every popular Marxist book I read, I come away with an entirely different reading than the main stream interpretation? I don't possess faculties other do not, so what is it? Does Marxism make them look a little too hard in the mirror? Are the concepts too abstract? Is the moral duty put upon their shoulders too heavy?If you've heard about this book, and you probably have, you think you know it's a book all about how to establish an authoritarian vanguard party that works for the interest of the working class alone, to usher in some kind of despotic and nefarious branch of undemocratic communism. If we follow the trail of who told you this, and who told them that, all the way back until we find someone who actually read the book, where will we end up? Maybe Jay Edgar Hoover's office? Again I don't know. A long game of \`telephone' exist around this book, which really ought to be quelled by individuals doing their own reading. It doesn't help of course that Robert Service, a member of Reagan's cabinet I believe, wrote the curt two page introduction. Really two pages? One of the most historical influential works of the 20th century warrants a two page introduction by someone who occupies the polar opposite political spectrum.Although this is a political book about how to foment revolution, it is not a treatise like Locke, Hobbe's or Rousseau, it does not pretend to be ahistorical or maximizing universal rights. There is no state of nature, and no serious speculation on how things ought to look. This book deals with extremely contemporary issues of Lenin's day. As a result, it can be rather confusing, or at least, circumspect. Lenin is constantly citing newspaper and propaganda articles that the reader will not have access too. The names, and journalist he is referring too, are primarily people no one in the 21st century has heard of.Lenin is arguing against the reformist economist movement. This is a movement that believes Russia only needs stronger trade unions, and union activist, and believes this movement can arise from the spontaneity of the working class. Just as Occupy Wall Street ballooned up, rather spontaneously, without any serious prediction, the economists believe these sorts of movements, especially those that revolve around Trade Union activism, are what Russia needs. Moreover, the best trade union activism can do is make exploitation more bearable, but it cannot eradicate it wholesale. Therefore the economists are complicit in exploitation, and lack the courage to do their duty to end it. It's ironic that unlike Marx, Lenin constantly refers to ending exploitation as his moral imperative, and duty.Let's be frank, Occupy at best achieved a MINOR change in political narrative. End of story. Lenin would lobby the same criticism, with more venom and erudition, and he does, at the economist. If you really want revolution, not reform, you need to steer the revolution, there needs to be control, and understanding, not spontaneity without direction. It's easier to squash the latter, harder to squash the former. Moreover, you need theory. All revolutions of Lenin's day, and of ours, are focused on politics and economics, but they have no deep theories to them. When one really delves into the essence of Liberal and Conservative, Libertarian, and Republican, there is nothing stark to define these differences. They don't account for how society works either, they merely talk about the role of the individual, not how he came to be, why he does what he does, and when and how he can transcend his present relations. Lenin thinks we need something deeper than economics and politics, we need to synthesize it with theory, and of course that theory is Marxism (amen).Let's get to the major controversy though. Wasn't Lenin just advocating authoritarianism that guided the daft working class along? No. Lenin was quite convinced that revolutionaries could, had, and will continue to arise from the working class. But he wasn't a romantic, he knew good and well if you spend 11 hours a day with your mind devoted to one menial function, it's pretty clear you won't spend the remaining 5 hours of your day brushing up on theory, politics, and economics. It's the sad fate of liberal capitalism that the best theories most often come from those with undeserved leisure time. Moreover, he believed that his secret party ought to host debates and lectures given by his brand of Marxism, along with attending liberals, democrats, and economist. Once a stage was given to all views present, Lenin believed the theory of his group (the Social-Democrats), would easily prevail, for him this was the vanguard. The vanguard is the group with the most advanced theories and ideas of its day. Not a group of armed thugs.He does recognize that the group must remain underground and secret, and cannot be an open democracy initially. This is not because he prefers authoritarian measures, but because philosophical circles that discuss revolution, student activist, Marxists, etc, were all persecuted by the Tsar. There was no freedom of speech and expression, if you said what Lenin said you went to prison, and were tortured. Therefore, what is the most practical measure to ending the reign of the Tsar? Democracy is not and cannot be that choice. This leaves 21st century readers, growing up in the comforts of their day, with narrow hindsight to easily scoff at Lenin for not being more open. Maybe that scoffing is easy, but it's going to be a whole lot harder for that same scoffer to openly advocate the rule of the Tsar, and his autocratic regime, that quelled all freedom of speech. Once you realize you cannot, and morally should not, advocate the reign of an autocratic Tsar, you too are left asking what Lenin asked in the title of this book: \\"What is to be done?\\""},{"Title":"What Is to Be Done?: Burning Questions of Our Movement","review":"Democratic Centralism, the whys and wherefores along with history and positions detailing the split within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party.

We have carried the day.\\" Thus, the headline of the New York Herald stated about the perceived Union success in that seminal foray the day after the first Civil War battle at Bull Run. General William Sherman vilified them as \\"the buzzards of the press.\\" George G. Meade \\"strapped one of them backward on a mule and rode him out of camp\\" complete with a sign embellishing him as \\"Libeler of the Press.\\" In fact, Army commanders on both sides distrusted a free press they could not control. The \\"scoundrels\\" in this event are the reporters who roamed the battlefields chasing a story. The self-proclaimed Bohemian Brigade was a \\"group of men who tried to make sense of the most dramatic event in American history\\" and they did it by writing columns in various newspapers for the Union, Confederacy, and at point's abroad. Author James M. Perry writes that the civil war reporters, to many, were a preposterous, controversial, infuriating, and disarming band of rogues and heroes. Perry, himself a journalist and author of Arrogant Armies and recipient of the prestigious Fourth Estate Award, is a modern day version of those that packed the Civil War battlefields and then scurried to send their messages and stories either in person or by telegraph. This is what makes A Bohemian Brigade: The Civil War Correspondents unique; it is written by a son of their own, someone who is profoundly qualified to develop this wonderfully constructed chronicle of those reported on the war between the states. From the battlefield of the first encounter at Bull Run came the scouring assembly of news-seekers like Charles Charleton Coffin, Henry Villard, and Uriah Painter of the North, Peter Alexander and Felix Gregory de Fontaine who worked for Southern papers, and William Howard Russell of the Times of London. It was the first deployment of the Bohemian Brigade and the results were mixed at best. As described on the inside cover of the dusk-jacket, which by the way, is part of one the most aesthetically appealing book covers on the market, \\"much of our understanding of the American Civil War is based upon newspaper dispatches written under horrible battlefield conditions, and journalists' memoirs penned under more reflective moments after the war's end. As a result, modern American journalism emerged from the Civil War and Perry makes it clear that, thanks to the telegraph and the importance placed on breaking news and scoops, the conflict was the first instant-news event. It was a time of sending message using \\"the lightning\\" or the telegraph. Perry draws upon his experience as a newspaperman to show for better or worse that for the most part, these reporters put their lives at risk on the battlefield and he brings each reporter, \\"rogues and heroes alike,\\" to life in this wonderfully crafted book. There is no doubt they were pompous and arrogant, highly inventive, they lied and cheated, they got the story wrong more often than they should have, and they drank too much. By his own admission, Perry claims that, \`\`They did a lot of things reporters are still doing today.'' But they were also, Perry admits, that for all their faults, these correspondents who endured Civil War prisons, battlefield skirmishes, and intense colleague competition to get the story to print. In short, it is wonderfully readable narrative worthy revealing the historical significance of the battlefield reporter."},{"Title":"A Bohemian Brigade: The Civil War Correspondents Mostly Rough, Sometimes Ready","review":"A very readable book.

The book reminded me of some of my favorite &quot;anarchic&quot; novels of the '50s and '60s-&quot;Lucky Jim,&quot; &quot;The End of the Road,&quot; even &quot;The Crying of Lot 49.&quot; Sagoe, the journalist character, has a fascinating and scatalogical philosophy of life that parodies French existentialism very cleverly. The other characters include a frustrated engineer who becomes a great sculptor, a painter hard at work throughout the narrative on an epic canvas depicting all the main characters as versions of the gods of Yorubaland, and an eccentric white Englishwoman who has married an unsuitable Nigerian bureaucrat and befriended his more liberal mother. The book works on several levels--as farce, as cultural critique of colonialism, and as an exploration of the ongoing legacy of the Yoruba gods who animate and obsess the interpreters. Most importantly, it is an entertaining and unpredictable story full of sharp insights and surprises."},{"Title":"Interpreters","review":"This is to correct the \\"educated\\" reviewer who claimed Wole soyinka won the Nobel Prize for \\"The Interpreters\\". Soyinka wrote this novelvery very early in his carreer.

The \\"I lived in Africa for 10 years\\" reviewer never read the play in his/her 10 years in the country called Africa!"},{"Title":"Interpreters","review":"It took countless attempts and a few really long flights to finish this drivel. There is nothing in this book that should save it from recycling. Pity, a good tree was killed to print it. I wondered how on Earth it could get the Nobel Prize... And then I saw that Wole Soyinka was the first African author to receive it. And it was his first novel. That explains! The old f.rts from the Novel Committee chose an unknown author, made sure he is black and from Africa, and gave him the prize. You say it can't be? Why not? Obama got nominated for the Nobel after only 20 days in the office. What's the difference?As for the novel itself: the language is difficult and mostly annoying; characters are short-tempered loons with unpredictable and illogical behaviours; the story line is absent and is rather a hodge-podge of some unrelated and badly writen events. After turning the last page you ask yourself: what was the pont of all that? The only idea that is clearly defined is that whites are bad. Everything about whites in the book is bad. One of the main characters is simply a black chauvinist. The black professor is ridiculed and insulted only because he has European manners. The only \\"positive\\" white character is good because she tries to be black by being rude and arrogant. Do you think there is a moral to all this? Think again.And to all those voices of \\"indignation\\" that will accuse me of not knowing the African culture... Actually, I lived in Africa for 10 years and was a citizen of an African country.

At the end of the 1990's, Sine released Mustard Seed vs. McWorld, drawing attention to the incompatibilities between kingdom perspectives and contemporary Western values. The mustard-seed kingdom of God begins unnoticed - its progress is often imperceptible - but it transforms the world with its quiet, steady influence on the soul of humankind. McWorld, the unabashed Western pursuit of the biggest and the best, generates tremendous sound and light, but is devoid of enduring substance. Tom and Christine (Tom's wife) Sine revisit this analysis of contemporary society in their latest book, Living on Purpose. Once again, metaphor is integral to the approach.Boom City, the under-girding metaphor of Living on Purpose, is McWorld on a global scale. Conceived in the Enlightenment, nurtured in the Industrial Revolution, and now super-charged by the cyber-revolution, Boom City is a one-world economic order connected by satellite dishes, fax machines, and the internet. Its purpose is profit. Its price is personal serenity and negligence of the eternal kingdom.The Sine's suggest that if we are serious about finding God's best for our lives, it doesn't begin with the question, \\"What do I want and what turns me on?\\" but \\"What does God want and how does God want to use me to make a difference in this world?\\" We discover the answers to those latter questions when we listen for God's voice in retreat from busyness, in stillness, in reflection on the past, in the spiritual disciplines, in the needs of others, and in dreams and imagination (to name a few). Listening to God's voice enables us to discover our mission and set goals that are harmonious with our true nature as citizens of God's kingdom.Living on Purpose makes a great point, but suffers from a somewhat disjointed construction. It's not readily apparent how the separate chapters form a cohesive whole. More importantly, the book needs to give more attention to the mechanics of writing a mission statement and setting goals. As it is, Living on Purpose is largely anecdotal, which goes a long way to helping the reader understand what the destination can look like, but does little to help the reader actually get there. There are some great stories in this book - from individual business people and students who have discovered a kingdom-centered life to kingdom-focused communities and churches such as Mars Hill Fellowship, Burnt Street House, Solomon's Porch, and Temescal. Plus, the Sine's have included \\"off-ramps\\" or specific, practical ideas on how to live a kingdom-centered life. The anecdotes and ideas are inspiring. However, readers of Living on Purpose will need to refer to Stephen Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People or First Things First, or Hyrum Smith's What Matters Most, to get more practical help on writing a mission statement or setting goals. On its own, the book is liable to send the reader in a multitude of directions, trying ideas and copying examples without really doing the hard groundwork needed to form a personal mission statement and set of corresponding goals before launching into action. Read this book, but read with caution."},{"Title":"Living on Purpose: Finding God's Best for Your Life","review":"If the modern world is an expressway leading noplace (i.e. utopia), where can we find an offramp leading in a different direction, i.e. someplace? You are way too busy, too much in debt, too little related to your family and friends. You consider yourself a Christian, but what that means is that you may go to church on Sunday (if you have the time and the energy). You suspect that if you really believed that Jesus knew what he was talking about your life might look a lot different than it does. Is there a way out of the rat race to something more lasting and meaningful?You might consider Sine's little book another in the genre of self-help tomes focused on developing a personal mission statement and enhancing both your own individualism and your consumerist, careerist ambitions. In reality the authors are wanting to subvert all of that. Sine's countercultural goals here are community, mission, and a vital, life-changing relationship with God. If you are looking for that off-ramp then begin here."},{"Title":"Living on Purpose: Finding God's Best for Your Life","review":"I attended a seminar lead by Tom and Christine Sine the authors of this book.

They helped you with integrity listen to God.At the same time many friends were reading \\"The purpose driven life\\" by Rick Warren. That book did not connect with me as its language was not gender inclusive and it seemed more of a prescription: in the sense of do this: and this will happen.I prefer the way presented in Tom and Christine's book which is more of an exploration, it allows lost of _room for the Holy Spirit to speak_ to you in new and different ways.

This book requires MONTHS of studying. 6 months are needed just to go through the 150,000-word vocabulary list. I took the PSAT in the 10th grade and was disparaged by my score of 1390. The following spring, my father bought me this book. The first day I took the diagnostic SAT which Dr. Gruber includes in his book so as to discover one's weak and strong points. My score on that test was a 1440. Now I'm going to be a senior and I can't say I'm too disappointed with my 1580 on this test from the June test date.

For example, on a math question, there will be about four ways to go about solving that particular problem. The book will outline the four ways, show you which one was the best, and even show you shortcuts you never would have realized. Thanks to Dr. Gruber, multiple variable factoring used to be a process I saved for my TI-89. Not anymore. THe book showed me how to do it MUCH quicker in my head using simple math shortcuts and common sense.

This book is especially good in the math section, with a comprehensive review, but I would like to see more strategies and practice in the verbal section.You will also find lots of vocab tests, but these are the simple kind, in which you are given a word and you have to choose the best synonym; a bit tedious and old-fashioned, but still necessary.In a word, this is the best book you can buy.

It reads like a thriller - it does have a lot of details, as others have mentioned, and the authors do become very indignant at times, but I believe this is because the book was published a few years ago, when museums still dragged their feet to send looted art back to Italy, and it was not yet clear in the media whether the Italians had a case or were just being annoying.I first heard about the controversy in ARTNews, which takes pride in unbiased reporting, and even then, it was difficult not to feel at the beginning that the Italians were asking for too much because they were targeting so many American museums. Watson and Todeschini set out to present the Italians' case to the readers and needed an extensive description of the paper trail to avoid the appearance of bias. This might be unnecessary now that so many museums have caved in and returned art to Italy, but it was definitely important to include all these details in 2006 when the hardcover edition of the book was published in the States.I was impressed by the flowing, accessible style, and the authors' ability to make protagonists come to life. The book has left me with a better understanding of the current art scene, especially regarding dealers and curators, and of the issues surrounding looted antiquities. A tour-de-force."},{"Title":"The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities--From Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums","review":"The book deals with a fascinating subject and has a lot of details.

Peter Watson, Research Associate, McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research at the University of Cambridge, and Cecilia Todeschini, a researcher and translator, have written a passionate, provocate look at the looting of archaeological sites, which should be regarded as the definitive examination of this sordid issue. Their insightful work of nonfiction covers the successful exploits of the Italian Carabineri Art Squad investigation code-named \\"Operation Geryon\\" that has led to the successful prosecution of Italian antiquities \\"dealer\\" (a more apt description would be professional thief) Giacomo Medici, and the ongoing trials of his American colleague Robert Hecht, and disgraced former Getty Museum curator Marion True (Both of them have received ample publicity in The New York Times, Washington Post, and elsewhere.). The authors also - I believe - note correctly the scandalous behavior of many major European and American museums in acquiring antiquities of dubious or unknown provenance (This means that these objects were most likely excavated illegally by the Tombaroli (Tomb Robbers) on behalf of Hecht, Medici and others of their ilk.), of which two of the worst offenders include New York City's venerable Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Getty Museum near Los Angeles (It is no exaggeration to surmise that the Getty Museum's antiquities collection is based almost entirely on loot; a point which the authors return to frequently.). They also strongly condemn the actions of major auction houses like Christie's, Bonham's, and especially Sotheby's, for aiding and abetting the lucrative illicit trade in stolen antiquities.\\"The Medici Conspiracy\\" also tells the true story of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's acquisition of the Euphronios krater (two-handled Classical Greek vase) - a story which has yet to be told fully by The New York Times - which both opens and closes this book. To the authors' everlasting credit, they recount the courageous actions of a young Metropolitan Museum of Art curator of Ancient Near East Art, Oscar W. Muscarella, who strongly objected to the museum's purchase of this vase from dealer Robert Hecht, recognizing that this important object had been excavated illegally from an Etruscan tomb in central Italy. For displaying such courage, Muscarella was fired three times (Only the third time was related directly to the Metropolitan Museum's acquisition of the Euphronios krater; one of the other instances was due to Muscarella's campaigning for equal pay to be granted to the museum's female employees.) by Thomas Hoving, the Metropolitan's director, and sued the museum successfully, before he was finally reinstated as a tenured associate curator in 1977 (A year later, Muscarella was given the unique position of Senior Research Fellow, a title which he holds still at the museum.). More than thirty years after Muscarella strongly voiced his objections, he finally seems to have been vindicated, with the ongoing trial of Robert Hecht, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's commitment to return the vase to Italy sometime in the next year or two (A distinguished alumnus of our high school, Muscarella is widely well regarded for his excellent scholarship on the archaeology of Anatolia (Western Turkey) in the First Millenium, B. C., was a visiting professor at Brown University, and has lectured often at Brown and elsewhere around the globe.).I have a unique perspective on this issue given a longstanding interest in the relationship between commercial fossil collectors and professional paleontologists. You could substitute \\"fossil\\" for \\"antiquities\\" and obtain a sordid view of commercial fossil collecting that isn't too far removed from the authors' depiction of the \\"Medici Conspiracy\\" (But thankfully, there is better cooperation between some commercial fossil collectors and professional paleontologists; one notable example is the excellent relationship which the Black Hills Institute for Geological Research - the commercial collecting firm that excavated \\"Sue\\", the female Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton owned by McDonald's and displayed at Chicago's Field Museum - has fostered with distinguished invertebrate paleontologists from the United States Geological Survey and the American Museum of Natural History.).I strongly commend Public Affairs for recognizing the importance of \\"The Medici Conspiracy\\" by publishing this definitive tome. It is indeed definitive since the illicit global trading of antiquities is regrettably a cultural crime against humanity; it is the most comprehensive examination I have come across on this illicit trade. Anyone who is interested in art, antiquities, museum collections, and private collections should definitely buy this book soon. I promise, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities--From Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums","review":"These two authors are passionate, eloquent and fully knowledgeable in convincingly telling the full story about the looting of the antiquities of Italy and elsewhere and in identifying the culprits.

This book carefully and thoroughly uncovers the sordid truth."},{"Title":"The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities--From Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums","review":"Ever wonder where all the vases and statues in museums and antiquities collections come from? No? Join the club! As Peter Watson and Cecilia Todeschini demonstrate in meticulous detail, art dealers, auction houses and museum curators are also less than obsessed with the question, and their incuriosity has allowed a flourishing trade in vandalism, grave-robbing and trafficking.Watson and Todeschini illustrate this appalling practice through the case of Giacomo Medici (no known relation to Lorenzo of the Italian Renaissance), whose systematic pillaging of Greek and Italian antiquities has devastated the field of archeology and robbed these countries of their heritage. Let's say an ancient Greek vase comes on the market. This vase is supposed to have a provenance, a documented history of legal ownership and an explanation of how it came to be excavated. Both buyers and sellers are supposed to ensure that this provenance is accurate. How would such an item come to lack a provenance? It could be stolen from a museum or established collection, it could be a fake, or it simply could have been illegally dug out of the ground, never reported, and the paperwork manipulated to get it out of the country.Giacomo Medici used all these tactics and more, with the willing complicity of collaborators ranging from rustic tomb-robbers (tombaroli, as they're called) to the swankiest auction houses and museums all over the world, including Sotheby's, the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.It took the cooperation of police departments all over the world and an extremely complex investigation lasting over a decade to stop Giacomo Medici, whose bizarre habit of having himself photographed in front of his most successful antiquities was a key element in the case against him. The investigation may have been complicated but the motives of those involved were pretty simple. Ambition on the part of museum curators played a part, with everyone scrapping to get the most prestigious collections, but mainly this story is about greed.The irony is that so many players in this story could be so consumed by greed and so ignorant of value. The tombaroli found a buried room in Pompeii that had been untouched since Vesuvius erupted, and they chopped up the wall frescos to transport them more easily abroad and ruined the rest. A unique, unrepeatable archeological find, and it's treated like a stolen Dodge in a chop-shop.There are no car chases or fiery explosions, but THE MEDICI CONSPIRACY is a gripping crime story of epic proportions.--- Reviewed by Colleen Quinn (CQuinn9368@yahoo.com)"},{"Title":"The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities--From Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums","review":"When you have something small, easily moved, requires no special handling such as refrigeration, very valuable, and willing customers, it's pretty easy to guess what happens.This book is a window into the world of illegal art. It begins with an armed robbery and a chase. It develops into the discovery of a world wide network of theves and apparently willing customers who appear willing to spend literally millions of dollars for items the seller may have stolen.In the movies the purchaser is a private collector who is taking the art into his private collection, never to be seen again. Here though, the purchasers are big time auction houses (Southeby's), famous museums (Metropolitan Museum of Art, Getty).This book is a fascinating introduction to the world depicted in Pink Panther and Cary Grant movies."},{"Title":"The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities--From Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums","review":"The Medici Conspiracy by Peter Watson is an amazing account, thoroughly researched, beautifully written, with marvelous photographs.

The Medici Conspiracy is not the most deftly written, and at times seems more like a very, very, very long newspaper story than a book. Yet in the end the sheer force of the information it compiles, with detail and comprehension of the larger picture, leads to confidence in its conclusion: It is impossible to build, in modern times, a great collection of quality antiquities without relying chiefly on, and feeding and sustaining, unlawful traffic in looted items. The archeological countries also are at fault: If you leave hugely valuable items in the ground, and don't invest in excavating them under secure, academically and legally sound conditions, it is inevitable that illicit looters will do it for you."},{"Title":"The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities--From Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums","review":"Have been waiting for some time to read this book, and I really enjoyed it.

I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the subject, or anyone interested in looted art in general. If I have any complaint, it is that the book at times gives too much information, which slows down the pace of the narrative as the author reveals how the investigation of Medici, Robert Hecht, Robin Symes, Marion True, and others came to pass."},{"Title":"The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities--From Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums","review":"I give this book a definite four stars because it is a worthy representation of the story and gives the account of what happened with great zeal. The topic itself is fascinating. In my opinion, various Federal Art/Cultural Property Crime units would be well served by making this book mandatory reading for their agents. It stands as a clear insight into the dark realm of unlawful antiquities excavation, illicit smuggling and clandestine sale- an increasingly important issue in our \\"global economy\\" world where buyers and sellers can come together across oceans with little effort, and without regard to laws that may govern certain antiquities transactions.At times, it reads a bit choppy. A lot of this has to do with the fact that the authors were careful to include all pertinent data, instead of sacrificing the volume of fact for the sake of the story. I almost feel bad detracting a star for this, but if you're going to sell a book as a story rather than an academic study, I do believe certain concessions should be made for ease of reading.Nevertheless, still a great book, well worth purchasing. This book will probably become one of the classics on the topic of art smuggling and the attendant markets."},{"Title":"Russian Business Dictionary","review":"This dictionary only translates from English into Russian so it is likely to be nearly worthless for native English speakers."},{"Title":"The Divine Light Invocation: A Spiritual Practice for Healing and for Realizing the Light Within","review":"This is a work that is very empowering as we approach the 21 century.The more Light there is the healthier our planet will be.

She never details the specific problems that led to her quest for renewed faith in God. Although she has joined the monastery as an oblate--unlike the monks and nuns, she can leave to resume her married life and her book tours--she nevertheless feels that she has penetrated to the core of the monastic experience. Her descriptions of what the liturgy means to her, what the companionship of celibate men and women has given her, show us what has kept the Catholic monastery alive for nearly two thousand years. The topics of faith and spirituality, God and religion, monastic service and celibacy are interpreted through her own experience. She writes movingly and convincingly of her own feelings and thoughts, but I am left wondering just what it was that drove a married Protestant woman of middle age, who confesses to a &quot;checkered past,&quot; to seek haven in monasteries. Surely her life's experiences color her perceptions and interpretations of cloistered Catholicism. In addition, she identifies herself as a poet, and she is a conspicuous participant in many rituals as she walks ahead of hundreds of monks to begin the reading for a service. Her anecdotes and quotations beautifully present the understanding she has gained, but how close is that to what the lifetime monks and nuns experience?"},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"I stumbled upon this book one day. Taken by the title and the image on the cover, I bought it. I was not misled. This is one of the most soothing and comforting books I have read in a long time. Norris describes life in the Benedictine monastery where she is a writer-in-residence and an oblate. Her descriptions are terse and poetic. This book really speaks to me, because it helps me to remember that there's more to life - and more meaningful and fulfilling ways to live one's life - than the images depicted in the media. I long for a world where the most important things are not how much money you can make or how many people you can impress. In Norris' description of cloistered life, I see a glimpse of a world like that. I'm keeping this one on my &quot;therapy shelf&quot; to read when I feel battered by the world. It's a book to read slowly and savor, and to read again."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"If you liked Kathleen Norris' Amazing Grace you will love The Cloister Walk. It is a beautiful personal narrative of her faith journey as well as a journal about writing poetry. She uses such beautiful metaphoric language. A joy to read."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Folks, I've been listening to the audio version of _The Cloister Walk_, by Kathleen Norris and I have to say that I like what I am hearing.Ms. Norris is an Episcopalian--her bio says she started as a Presbyterian--imbued with an exquisite spirit for things Benedictine and monastic, granted to her by the Holy Spirit through her call as a Benedictine Oblate, which makes us colleagues of sorts, though we have never met.The book is Ms. Norris recounting her experience in various Benedictine communities and of the Spirit of charity, celibate chastity, adoration, and liturgy she discovered therein. She approaches spiritual exercises, the Word of God in the Bible and in the Mass, with the soul of a poet. In fact, she sees these sacred objects and activities first as poetry, endowed with the power to communicate hidden things through word and metaphor and song.Her chapter on \\"Virgin Martyrs\\" touched me the deepest. I have never heard the interplay of virginity and martyrdom so clearly explained before. In fact, in this chapter, Ms. Norris succeeds in rescuing for a feminist audience the true meanings of virginity and martyrdom, reassesing its value as a woman's assertion to her own identity in counterpoint to a world that holds a woman's body physical and psychological integrity as something of little value, scandalous even, and paradoxically anti-woman.I compare Norris' work on contemplation with that of Thomas Merton, without the latter's fascination for things oriental or his inclination to please everyone by being everthing to every one--and that's a sad, but true criticism of my beloved Thomas Merton.Now, the downside. Actress Debra Winger read the book and although she pronounces every word clearly and distinctly, she does so with so much flatness that she sounds unenthusiastic about the subject matter. She should've read this with wondernment; her business-like tone is too, well, depressing.Anyway, buy the book or listen to the tape if you're a busy person like myself. You won't regret either."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"For the life of me, I don't see what people get out of Kathleen Norris' writing! Her thoughts are jumbled, scattered, rambling, disjointed, and highly self-absorbed to boot!If you want to read a REAL book about monastic life, I recommend The Genessee Diary. Pass on this one. I feel that I've completely wasted the few hours I spent trudging through this tome."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"This book received excellent reviews; I had to satisfy my curiosity and read it. I slowly read, hoping to discover some great truths I may have missed these past 6 decades.The book is unique in that the author explains how monks and nuns live, work, and worship together in communities and also how she had the freedom to come and go as she pleased, worshipping in her protestant church as well.This is a nice book for tolerant people of any faith. Everyone can benefit from quiet reflection, from reading scripture, from singing hymns, and from praying. We all have the freedom to worship God in different ways. Kathleen Norris was curious about the catholic faith, although she remains a protestant. Her experience within the monastery is beneficial to her soul and she describes how, as a poet and writer, the rituals, liturgy, and hospitality within the monastic setting further her own understanding of spirituality."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Beneath its beautiful cover this book started well then rapidly became a modernist exercise in denunciation of matters, beliefs, situations that find Kathleen Norris' disfavor. She hides her complaints well at first with her pretense of praise for the ancient Benedictine traditions, but like M. Scott Peck's In Search of Stones, which this work reminds me of so much, it soon becomes clear the topics within have varying degrees of subject matter in common with what this misleadingly marketed book is about. I wanted a book about modern Benedictines and the experience of residing among them and instead got a bellicose, self-obsessed, self-congratulatory account of times selectively spent brushing up against a semi-monastic existence. A boring, frustrating, sometimes almost unfathomable letdown because in description The Cloister Walk sounded so good."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Like another reviewer, THE CLOISTER WALK was a book I intended to read and never got around to. I finally got around to it, and couldn't put it down. There are times, in writing about her life and her past, where I felt Kathleen Norris was writing for me, in my own life, and her prose is just lyrical. I was 1/2 way thru this book when I turned to my husband and said...&quot;I can't wait to read this book again!&quot;. Highly recommended for anyone who is slogging thru the world looking for a little direction in the day to day, and a little comfort and joy!"},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"When I think of cloisters, I associate them with gardens and labyrinth. I picked out the book because of its title and strong personal desire to learn how other find their pease in today's busy world. Ketheleen Norris has written a book that touches up on many aspects of religious life that many individuals apply knowingly or unknowingly in their everyday life.Ms. Norris takes moments from her personal life and applies them to her persoanl experience as oblate in Catholic order of Benedictine monks. This order of monks and nuns practices religion by prayer, work and meditation. She talks in this book about female saints and martyrs; celibacy, virginity and sanctity of marriage; importance of tradition and rituals. She is objective in her portrayals of monks and nuns she meets over the years and it is amazing to notice her transformation of sceptic into a person who finds her peace in prayer and church.This is beautifully written book and it is pleasure to read amongst people no matter what their religion (or lack of it) is."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"One of the elements of Kathleen Norris which makes reading her so fundamentally satisfying is her ability to weave the words and thoughts of others so seamlessly into her own observations of endeavoring to live a life of faith. \\"The Cloister Walk\\" seems to do this with greater facility and to greater effect than \\"Dakota: A Spiritual Geography.\\"In \\"The Cloister Walk,\\" Norris, an apathetic Christian turned agnostic turned yearning Protestant, relates her experiences (physical and spiritual) as an oblate with the Benedictines. This is an accessible memoir of one woman's account of opening the eyes of her heart in her search for God and one that can be enjoyed by anyone striving to hear a still small voice within."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Kathleen Norris has lightly lifted the veil from the world of the cloistered square in a book that has universal appeal. Like the inspiring &quot;THE Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years&quot; by Richard G. Patton, Norris does not patronize when dealing with profound concepts. She has a deft touch when sketching the Inner view of the Benedictine life and it's beguiling scriptures. Where Patton's wonderful book depicts Jesus' inner search for God OUTSIDE of Religion, Norris' finds deep comfort within the structure and continuity of Religion. Both these authors take us convincingly on an inner journey, constantly tested by dilemma. These two remarkable books present both sides of the same coin, joined by the common bond of revelation."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Norris lifts the veil from monastic life, discussinghonestly and gently the real heart of the matter. As aProtestant and a poet, she is uniquely situated to bring the lessons of the cloister into everyday life. She dwells at some length on such lessons as chastity, scripture, and the lives of the saints. She does spend what I took to be an unwarranted amount of time discussing claims of misogyny on the part of the church, but on the whole, the work is well- balanced, and well worth the time."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"I was very looking forward to reading this book because it came highly recommended and because it seemed to be a guide for walking in the footsteps of many dedicated Christians. I am sorry to say that I was a little disappointed. Although many parts of the book are really excellent, Ms. Norris spends too much time making commentary instead of just sharing the experience. I really enjoyed when she shared how she was moved by prayer, to a point of conversion. And how the experience of the cloister strengthened her sense of self, and her marriage. But the chapter on St. Maria Goretti, while making a valid point, was overkill. Still it is worth the effort through the tedious parts, for the nuggets of wisdom which are also to be found there. My recommendation, skip over the platitudes and embrace the jewels."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"As someone who is familiar with monastic life and customs, this book really didn't do much for me. Most of it is wide-eyed wonderment at the way these people live which, at least for me, does not inspire deep spiritual thinking and reflection although the other reviewers seem to have gotten something from it, so that's good for them. The fact that this book appeals to so many people shows the lack of depth America has in its religion. Her &quot;golly gee&quot; attitude and continual repetition of stories showing how &quot;normal&quot; monastics are is very tiresome and is no different from how the media and Hollywood portray religious life. A big problem with the book is her writing style. She has to constantly remind us she is a writer and the techniques she uses are very obvious. The better writers use writing technique and style in an unobtrusive way, getting their points across without calling attention to themselves. Another annoying facet of this book is her constant mention of women and their contributions to religion and life. I am among that group of people who is very tired of having &quot;inclusivity&quot; shoved down our throats. Perhaps her next book will display some depth and reach out to a larger audience. She could also use a good editor."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"This is one woman's journey, sketching her life, her troubles, and her spiritual salvation through a Benedictine Monastery. Quoting the Bible extensively, Ms. Norris tells of her experiences with the Monks and Nuns. She is a writer, a searcher and a poet. Words are her vehicle to explain life and God. She sees the poetic in the mundane, and the special in the everyday. It is worth reading, even for people who are &quot;non-biblical&quot;. I found it interesting. The cover blurb reads &quot;. . .Strange &amp; Interesting . . .&quot; which is apropo."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Norris' book was so highly praised that some disappointment was inevitable. There are some good insights, but they're mixed in with pompous, snobblish, quirky, cranky, and deliberately obtuse comments. Her language is frequently adolescent, with pointless vulgarity or slang. She is remarkably self-centered. Her model for this is Thomas Merton, but it's a pity she imitates all his worst habits!"},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Why does Kathleen Norris never mention her father John Norris, who was a wonderful father to Kathleen Norris, and was a very accomplished Musican with the United States Navy Band, did she hate her father? and that is why she ran away.? If so, she finally came back to earth and has helped others by her fantastic God Given Books"},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Kathleen Norris is a terrific writer, and everyone says so, it seems. She has the poets gift for finding beauty everywhere, and makes you want to see Lemmon, S. D. which is no mean feat, I'm sure. Her account of her experiences with the Benedictine monks is wonderful, generally. And she has that great gift of seeming to write for all of us.My only objection to the book has nothing to do with style, or her lyrical prose, but with her use of obscenity-twice- about a third of the way through. It is just so unnecessary--even if you don't see it as wrong--for this to be found in a book on Christian Spirituality. To me, it keeps me from recommending the book to some who might otherwise really benefit from seeing the world through Kathleen Norris' eyes. Which is a real shame."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"If you're expecting a book that details the authors in-depth experiences with Benedictine spirituality or a how-to book on retreats. Then this is not the book for you. This book should have been called \\"The Cloister-Lite Walk\\". And as a Catholic I found this book to be very offensive.This book centers on the happenings of the author's daily life with a sprinkling of her \\"not-so much about\\" experiences with Benedictine spirituality where all of the chapters are laid out according to the Liturgical year (Saints days / feasts days).For Catholic's looking for some insight on Benedictine spirituality and retreats...be forewarned. This book is written by an author who claims to have returned to her Protestant roots and wants to share how Benedictine spirituality has had an influence on her life.But if you scratch past the surface of this, you will find that contained in the book are stories of Benedictine religious who are not in the least faithful to the teachings of the Catholic church.For example, on page 12 she speaks of a monk named David....\\"he purchased an amulet of a whale's fluke... The woman who sold it to him said it had been blessed by a Methodist bishop, but he could also take it to a priest of the old religion. \\"I did\\", he said. \\"It cost me a six-pack of beer and a carton of cigarettes\\"You will also find ALOT of ANTI-CATHOLIC BIAS in this book. The author states that the writings of Saint Jerome cause modern women to think that \\"women must be either virgins or whores, either blessed or cursed, while men are simply sexual athletes, slaves of lust\\". (page 24)Assumes that in the hospital where she was born that the nuns being who they are \\"one of them may have baptized me in secret\\" (page 88) That celibacy in the Catholic church should show us how \\"we need only look at newspaper accounts of sex abuse by priests to see that celibacy isn't working\\" (page 116).The author shows her true ignorance as to the origins of the sex abuse scandal. I recommend that readers get ahold of the book \\"Goodbye, Good Men\\" by Michael S. Rose which shows that celibacy is far from being the reason why the horrors of the abuse of children by priests occurred.The author then takes a much-loved Catholic saint \\"Maria Goretti\\" and reduces her to nothing more than a virgin-patsy used by the Catholic Church just like Marilyn Monroe was by those she knew in her life and states that Maria Goretti \\"in a curious way she reminds me of Marilyn Monroe\\" (page 223). On top of this she agrees with what was said in article on Maria Goretti that states \\"that a woman was better dead than raped\\".... And by canonizing her, the church has seemed to many to agree.\\" (page 224)The author appears to think that it would have been better if Maria Gorretti allowed herself to be raped and shouldn't have defended her virginity. This kind of liberalism trying to pass as a book showing her respect towards Benedictine spirituality whilst at the same time throwing out her little anti-Catholic jabs is reason enough for any devoted Catholic to pass on this book.A final example of her anti-Catholicism is the chapter entitled \\"Women and the Habit: A Not so Glorious Dilemma\\". The whole chapter uses quotes from nuns that speak of the horrors of wearing a habit. One nun states that in taking off the habit \\"We had to take it off and dump the medieval baggage that went with it.\\" (page 321)This is the kind of book that liberal Catholic's and anti-Catholic's alike will eat up gleefully. For those of us faithful to the teachings of the Catholic church I DO NOT RECOMMEND this book."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"This was not at all what I expected. It was just nostalgic rhetoric, didn't have any real depth to it. I stopped reading it after maybe 30 pages."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Kathleen Norris' magnum opus, The Cloister Walk, has provided the entrance into monastic spirituality for almost as many people as any work in history, assuming, of course, that the people who purchased her book read, mark, and inward digest the meanings contained therein.It is a truly remarkable achievement--one born of contradiction and ambiguity. A woman has found such spirituality and insight in communities predominantly organised and lived in by men (I wonder how different or similar this work would be had Norris concentrated on visiting convents?). A protestant has found a home in her own soul for many of the most 'catholic' of practices. Where these insights and practices lead are different at different times, ever changing yet ever constant.Norris structures her book (and structure is very important for monastic types) in a similar fashion to a monastic day and year. She follows a liturgical calendar, and fills in the gaps with reflections and stories of experiences.She uses the daily cycle to great effect--for instance, on April 2, the day of Mary of Egypt, Norris incorporates the story of Mary into her narrative in much the same way that monastics incorporate such stories into their practice and contemplation: 'Monks have always told the story of Mary of Egypt to remind themselves not to grow complacent in their monastic observances, mistaking them for the salvation that comes from God alone. ... Repentance is coming to our senses, seeing, suddenly, what we've done that we might not have done, or recognising, as Oscar Wilde says in his great religious meditation \\"De Profundis\\", that the problem is not in what we do but in what we become.'Norris reflects on the difficulties she encountered on her journey, with the monasteries, with her family, with her career, with those who just couldn't understand what it was she was trying to accomplish or find. Much like anyone who tries to discern and follow a call to vocation in life, there are joys great and small, and difficulties great and small, fulfillments and doubts, and lots of reflection. She is frank about her struggles to believe, and finds solace in the doubts of others. 'I believe that Teresa became a uniquely valuable twentieth-century saint, a woman who can accept even the torment of doubt, as she lay dying, as a precious gift, who turns despair into a fervent prayer for others. I think of her as a saint for unbelievers in an age of unbelief, a voice of compassion in an age of beliefs turned rigid, defensive, violent.'Norris reflects on hospitality, prayer, study, work, community, solitude, silence and music. 'Music is serious theology. Hildegard of Bingen took it so seriously as a gift God made to humanity that in one of her plays, while the soul and all the Virtues sing, the devil alone has a speaking part. The gift of song has been denied him.'There is a true spirit at work in this book, that reaches out in many different ways to people of all backgrounds. This is true of monastic practice, which is essentially Hebraic in structure, Christian in intent, and universalist in outreach and hospitality. The issues which concern everyone in the world are present in the monastery in ways which give a new perspective. Take, for instance, time: 'In our culture, time can seem like an enemy: it chews us up and spits us out with appalling ease. But the monastic perspective welcomes time as a gift from God, and seeks to put it to good use rather than allowing us to be used up by it.' Time slowed down at the monastery, and that is a blessing to many in the world (and one of the blessings Norris particularly finds), but this slowing allows a recognition of the spiritual aspects of even the most mundane of daily practices.Finally, I am touched by the infusion of poetry, artistic imagery and wisdom literature throughout the text. Her quote from Emily Dickinson is one which I will take to heart. 'Consider the lilies,' she wrote to her cousins late in her life, 'is the only commandment I ever obeyed.'"},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this book. I tried to stay with it, thinking it might get better but ended up putting it down after about half way.The author focuses more on her personal, anecdotal stories then her actual time spent in the monastery living among the vowed. Absent was any insights or conversion gained by her experiences with the religious, which was more what I was looking for.Anyone wanting to understand more about the depths of faith gained from religious life should spend their time and money reading some of the saints instead."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"A former student gave me this book knowing my sister is a nun. Kathleen's incite on the monastic life brought me closer to my sister in way I've never had before. It also reaffirmed my faith and brought a breath of fresh air to my spirit. I gave a copy to my sister and she gave copies to many of her friends.I read each chapter like a gem and continue to re-read it. Kathleen gets to the essence of her faith."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"First of all, after reading a few of the reviews of this book here in amazon, I have to wonder: are you reading the same book the rest of us are?That said, this book fully deserves five stars. The author is smart, devout, and eager to learn. A Protestant, she tells of her experience in a monastery over a period of several months. I believe the person who would get the most out of this book is either a Protestant or a \\"seeker\\" eager to grow spiritually. We Protestants know too little about the traditions of our Catholic brothers and sisters: there is a rich spirituality there we can draw from (and vice-versa.) This is not a difficult book to read, yet it is not an easy book to read, either. It's easy in that the author writes so honestly and plainly it's like talking to an old friend about her experiences. However, since nearly every chapter is profound one can't skim through this book like a Grisham thriller. The very nature and objective of the book is to be food for spiritual growth. It takes a while to chew some of this stuff. I recently picked the book back up after reading the first 275 out of 400 pages. I set it down for months, not because it's boring but because, I suppose, my subconscious mind needed to chew on those 275 pages a while. The book has been lying around as if it knew I was going to pick it back up at the right time.How many books can you say that about? Precious few, my friend.Add this most substantial book to your devotional reading and , after reading it, I guarantee you will find yourself picking it up over and over over the years."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"This book is a singular resource for writers and, I presume, other artists and those &quot;non-artists&quot; who perceive their work as a vocation.Some of my favorite passages in the book explore today's insidious attitude that people who claim to be &quot;called&quot; to something are merely &quot;self-indulgent&quot; folks who shun their true responsibility to pursue as much wealth and &quot;productivity&quot; as possible.Norris' journey as a writer/poet and her immersion in monastic life are exquisitely interwoven to create (without directly posing) a question about whether &quot;the monastic path&quot; is much different than any mindful immersion into a meaningful life."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Having read Kathleen Norris' &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; I was eager to hear more from this gifted author. &quot;The Cloister Walk&quot; was all I had hoped for and more. Norris' sometimes painfully honest recollections of her spiritual journey will resonate with any reader who has battled both the demons within and the church without. Norris' mix of humor, storytelling, and church history undergirds her compelling description of life among the Benedictines."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"There is little I can add to all the wonderful reviews that have covered this book. It is a wonderful peak inside monastic life, and the impact that the monastic lifestyle/worldview has upon a soul. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"As a lapsed Catholic and a searching person for the meaning of organized religion in my life, I found this book rich with bursts of insight. The various personalities in religion; aspects of life within the Benedictine church; and a variety of small, beautiful critical thinking essays on the meanings of icons and values are some of the topics Norris explores in her chapters.Overall, they are thought-provoking and reveal a person who is more than a visitor to the ways of the Benedictine.I only gave four stars, since I found her writing style a bit distracting and the organization of the book not exactly conducive to easy reading. It's true that each chapter is a handful, but the editor might have done Norris a favor by facilitating the outline of the book."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"I must agree with the Boston Globe's description of this book as both strange and beautiful. The Cloister Walk is mesmerizing. An extraordinary book that is at once memoir, poetry and meditative reflections that can leave one poised in long moments of silence. Norris, in sharing her experiences as a monastic oblate, opens the door for the reader to experience the power of 'lectio devina'-- &quot;represents the power of words to resonate with the full range of human experience . . . [as one attempts] to read more with the heart than with the mind&quot; (xx). Norris carries the reader along into the hymns and prayers of Christianity and the Rule of St. Benedict. As Norris shares many passages from the monastic bible(dating back to the 4th c.), one realizes that not much has changed in the past sixteen centuries. Acts of violence against one another and our environment continue to be played out through the centuries. The bible is a book of philosophy as well as psychiatry with the power to heal our collective wounds. &quot;In expressing all the complexities and contradictions of human experience, the psalms act as good psychologists. They defeat our tendency to try to be holy without being human first&quot; (96). There are two faces to the heart: one of evil and one of good, we must be willing to accept both in our search for inner peace and harmony. Bogged down by dogmatic interpretations of the bible, I walk away from the Cloister Walk inspired and uplifted with a greater interest in understanding the true, unadulterated intention of the bible."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"When Kathleen Norris found her life in a shambles, she sought shelter in the cloistered world of the Benedictines. She never details the specific problems that led to her quest for renewed faith in God. Although she has joined the monastery as an oblate--unlike the monks and nuns, she can leave to resume her married life and her book tours--she nevertheless feels that she has penetrated to the core of the monastic experience. Her descriptions of what the liturgy means to her, what the companionship of celibate men and women has given her, show us what has kept the Catholic monastery alive for nearly two thousand years. The topics of faith and spirituality, God and religion, monastic service and celibacy are interpreted through her own experience. She writes movingly and convincingly of her own feelings and thoughts, but I am left wondering just what it was that drove a married Protestant woman of middle age, who confesses to a &quot;checkered past,&quot; to seek haven in monasteries. Surely her life's experiences color her perceptions and interpretations of cloistered Catholicism. In addition, she identifies herself as a poet, and she is a conspicuous participant in many rituals as she walks ahead of hundreds of monks to begin the reading for a service. Her anecdotes and quotations beautifully present the understanding she has gained, but how close is that to what the lifetime monks and nuns experience?"},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Book ReviewThe Cloister WalkIn Kathleen Norris' book, The Cloister Walk, she invites the readers into her life as a Protestant, poet, feminist, married woman who is drawn to the monistic life of the Benedictines. She details the struggles she has with reconciling what she knew as a child with what she is learning today. Kathleen also finds great joy in experiencing life as she does, and seems to have no intentions of converting to the Catholic faith; she is happy being Protestant. While Kathleen takes the reader on her journey with her, she takes time to fill the reader in on her past so that they can fully appreciate her present.This book was not what I expected when I first chose it specifically from its title. I was expecting a book about someone who is in a cloister and writing about that life, but once I understood what the intent of the book was I enjoyed journeying with Kathleen. I also found myself wanting to know what happened in her life once the pages ended. One of the biggest strengths of the book was that it was engaging and kept me interested in Kathleen's life. The book also shed some light on the Benedictine life and left me wanting to know more. In my position at my parish, I am often asked about good books. I can easily suggest this one as an option, though not as a book to obtain knowledge about the Catholic faith, but as a good summer read, which I think can often times be very valuable."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Kathleen Norris is a writer's writer. She is fun to read and her imagery stays with you. This book is one of those rare books that change the spiritual formation of an entire generation. Those who are looking for a spiritual guide won't do better than Norris as she takes us along on her own spiritual journey and discovers the ancient tradition of Benedictine spirituality. If you're not interested in spirituality--read it just because she's such a marvelous writer."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"I spontaneously picked up this book at the library the other day and have been more than delighted. This book is like reading a series of short stories on different subjects, i.e., marriage, friendship, sex, rural life, and others, but yet is woven in such a way as to thread in her experiences at a Benedictine monastery, which is really the core subject of the book. Her style is quirky and endearing, yet in many ways, fearless.I loved it and can't wait to read her other works."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"This is an extraordinary book! I bought it through Amazon for a friend, since I'm still devouring my copy -- having started 3 years ago! It is like exploring a deep mine, where there is something new around every turn."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Kathleen Norris takes her readers on a splendid journey into the monastic life and hence into the self. Her deeply reflective prose quotes some of the desert fathers and mothers on prayer, monastic living, celibacy, psychology, etc. I especially appreciated her critique of virginity and virgin martyrs of the Church. Norris' experience of monastic living combined with the wisdom of that tradition makes her book a fine read."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"&quot;The Cloister Walk&quot; offered encouragement for my spiritual journey into the &quot;cloister&quot; of God's love. For another helpful book like Norris', but specifically aimed for parents, check out &quot;The Family Cloister: Benedictine Wisdom for the Home&quot;, by David Robinson (New York: Crossroad, 2000). Peace."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"I've really taken my time reading or better yet savoring this incredible book! Norris writes with such a clear and down to earth style that you feel she is in the same room with you discussing her experiences. I would recommend this read to anyone who finds themselves at a spiritural crossroads, plateau, or &quot;dark night&quot;. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"The chronology from dawn to night works well, and the seasonal journey from September through winter, summer, fall is meaningful--in the form of a diary only loosely. Since I have yet to read Dakota, I found the geography confusing. She seems to take for granted that we can place St. John's in a specific place, and she tells about Benedictine monasteries in various states. I enjoyed her account of Christmas in hawaii. Her accounts of South dakota sent me to the atlas, and I found Spencer in the lower southeast corner, but she frequently refers to &quot;western dakota&quot; and specifically to the northwestern corner. Perhaps I'm too much the reader who wants to have a sense of place--I often read with an atlas handy. Her descriptions of the virgin martyrs and nuns in their habits have been helpful as I prepare to discuss Chaucer's Prioress and other tales--for example, the Physician's tale. The book has been a stimulating read, and I look forward to DAKOTA."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"I loved the book -- used it for my morning devotions for about three weeks, reading a bit a day. Her topical, short chapter focus is perfect for this approach. I also passed it on to my sister who is reading it; we now talk about how we understood each passage as she reads. Great discussion starters."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"This is the most wonderful book on spirituality I have ever read, mostly because it was not a didactic. Kathleen Norris writes as a poet and a genuine soul, not someone looking to tout his/her 14 steps to peace with God. Her honest and beautifully written observations about the ups and downs of monasticism, and the revelation of the people who live as ascetics in the pursuit of God's love, provided a much needed reassurance to someone who has been abused and disillusioned by the contemporary Church that God loves us in spite of our best efforts and worst failings. I just finished it, and will be reading it again very soon."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Through this well-crafted collection of essays, Kathleen Norris reminds the reader again and again that neither poetry nor liturgy is the domain of the chosen few. Liturgy--meaning the &quot;work of the people&quot; and poetry--meaning the art of revealing meaning through words and images--is a calling that is lifegiving to us all. Norris's simple willingness to share her experience launches the reader into a contemplative space where new connections between the sacred and the mundane can be enjoyed. It's a refreshingly slow read--a tall glass of water in a thirsty world."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"This is an incredible book that has helped me to reclaim my faith in God and His Church.Kathleen Norris's stream of consciousness approach to chapter content allows the soul to bathe in a myriad of emotions, thoughts, and experiences. With one topic lingering in my psyche I was moved into a new context and experience at the start of each chapter. In some cases I truly wished that the some chapters would never end. The beauty of this approach is that a rich spiritual tapestry emerges over the course of the book. The mind spends a great deal of time pulling themes together across a number of days of reading, with a number of lightning strike insights resulting.A second amazing achievement of the book is that she opens up the Monastic experience for all to relate to. I never appreciated the essential role of monastic people, in our time and through history, until I too lived day to day with the dedicated souls of Saint John's. Whether you relate to this level of spiritual dedication or not, you will at least understand and see the courage it takes to pursue God in such a single-minded fashion."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"I've recommended and loaned out my copy to several friends and now regret that I didn't spend the extra money for a hardcover copy of this excellent book which I intend to read again should it ever be retruned to me. Reading over other reviews, I am surprised by comments that Norris is self-absorbed. To the contrary, I found her self-deprecating humor to be refreshing for a book of this genre. And although she rambles a bit, she always returns to her central themes regarding the beauty of the Benedictine way that brings order to chaos and a soothing, meditative approach to developing one's prayer life.Having spent two years as a second grader in Sr. Romuel's class in the mid-fifties, I had a special appreciation for those stories of saints and hermits. The chapter on the virgin martyrs was particularly entertaining!"},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"As a Benedictine woman myself, having seen many &quot;cloister walks&quot; in various monasteries, I was too intrigued, from the very first reading of the title not to read this! I can easily understand how readers who are not at all familar with Benedictine life in the US, especially those who are non-Catholic/non- Christian, might not get past the first chapter; however, as both Catholic and Benedictine, I can respond that that Kathleen has captured Benedictine life quite accurately. There are, however, some significant differences between male and female communities and, I believe, that the majority of her experiences come from her visits to male monasteries. The two most common experiences I had while reading Cloister Walk were: 1) laughing and 2) saying, &quot;ah, yes.&quot; Laughing because community life is humorous... no less so with religious vows than in any other large group. One has to be within it daily to know where to see it and understand its importance; And this she has done well. Much more common was the &quot;ah, yes&quot; response, as Kathleen did a &quot;poet's job&quot; of sharing the beauty, the spirituality and the every day holiness of life that I have also experienced as a Benedictine. Thanks, Kathleen; I hope our communities can live up to your reflections on them."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"I was expecting this to be a book about the monastic experience, but instead, it is a book mostly about Kathleen Norris, her life, and her social theories. There are a few nuggets of wisdom sprinkled here and there, but not enough to justify reading all the surrounding dross. Worse, there is no humility in the book at all.Instead of being a seeker of wisdom who went into religion and then wrote about her experience, Norris seems to be merely a writer with a gimmick of hanging out with monks and nuns to get a good book idea. If you like that sort of thing, you may like this book, but you should know what you're getting before you buy it.There is a hard edge to Norris's writing, an underlying anger and vulgarity. For example: \\"[N]ow we sigh, discouraged, hearing only the seeds of our well-worn, ludicrous sexual double standard which dictates that women must be either virgins or whores, either blessed or cursed, while men are simply sexual athletes.\\" And: \\"That we all begin inside a woman and must emerge from her body is something that the male theologians of the world's religions have yet to forgive us for.\\"She uses the f-word, apparently just to shock readers and listeners, as when she notes with self-congratulatory satisfaction that after one such use her driver appeared startled because \\"[S]he apparently had heard that I was a religious writer.\\" Well, regrettably, I had heard that, too.There is far too little introspection in this book. Norris too easily criticizes others while failing to look at herself and while rationalizing her own behavior. Perhaps I have been spoiled by reading Henri Nouwen, who seemed to always analyze the nature of his own feelings instead of criticizing someone else who may have brought those feelings about. But then again, Nouwen was a person of admirable humility, a quality Norris needs to work hard to develop.Norris has plenty of personal issues to deal with, as do we all. This book would have been much better if she had spent more time honestly wrestling with these issues instead of commenting on externals, offering social criticism and justifying her life as \\"a poet.\\""},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"THE CLOISTER WALK is a hodgepodge. In part it is a fragmented memoir of a fifty-year-old woman who was a poet and ten years previously, after being at loose ends for much of her life, had found sanctuary of sorts as an oblate with the Benedictines. In part it is a journal of nine months of experiences at a Benedictine monastery (St. Johns Abbey, in Collegeville, Minnesota). And in part it is a collection of religious writings, some spiritual in nature and some historical. One of my problems with the book is that those different parts or aspects of the book are too jumbled. The book does not cohere; for me it scatters into its 75 or so entries (ranging from one to eighteen pages) like the seeds of a dandelion on a breezy day.If there is one thing that unites the book, that is its author. THE CLOISTER WALK is not one of those books in which the author is unobtrusive. Kathleen Norris is on every page, and the reader is presented in full measure with her apprehensions and insecurities, her joys and epiphanies, as well as her preachings. At one point in the book, she writes \\"I am observing my life more than living it\\", and that characteristic imparts an introspective intensity that leaves me, notwithstanding my admiration for her, somewhat uncomfortable. The author who takes the reader on this cloister walk is not a relaxed person, and her existential intensity - existential tension, even - ends up coloring many of the things she shows and describes.Nonetheless, I found many parts of the book rewarding, especially the descriptions of contemporary monastic life, the discussions of the Psalms and the Book of Revelations, and the accounts of assorted religious figures from history, such as Mechtild of Magdeburg, Mary of Egypt, the Virgin Martyrs, and Ephrem the Syrian. And while, to my way of thinking, there is more than a little gibberish - for example, the passages on the difficult role of poets and artists in today's world - there also are nuggets worth salting away. Here's one:\\"In our culture, time can seem like an enemy: it chews us up and spits us out with appalling ease. But the monastic perspective welcomes time as a gift from God, and seeks to put it to good use rather than allowing us to be used up by it. A friend who was educated by the Benedictines [says], \`You never really finish anything in life, and while that's humbling, and frustrating, it's all right.'\\""},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"\\"The Cloister Walk\\" kept me company during a two-week stay in the hospital. Kathleen Norris is a good companion for those shadowy moments when I was asking myself some of life's harder questions.This author is a poet rather than a theologian, and she provides her reader with a thought-provoking record of a married, Protestant woman's time spent in a community of men in a traditional Benedictine monastery in Minnesota. It seems like a strange mixture. Why would a poet immerse herself in the closed world of the monastic community, and find solace in the closed yearly cycle of the liturgy?Poetry seems to lead many of its most brilliant practitioners to death, but Norris rejects this path. She rejoices in the poetry of the Psalms and quotes liturgical scholar, Gail Ramshaw: \\"If we are agnostics most of the time, we can believe at least during the liturgy.\\" She also reacts to the darker portions of the Bible:\\"Jeremiah's images are strikingly contemporary: infants dying of thirst, children on the streets with no one to care for them, the wealthy facing sudden ruin, young women being raped in a city gone mad: 'Jerusalem, Jerusalem, return to the Lord your God,' the young monk sings, and then a terrible silence in the church. And in my heart.\\"With her luminous prose and imagery from the natural world and from her own life experiences, Norris allows us to see the monastery, not as an anachronism from a more religious past, but as a living, healing community. She draws from the well of their ritual and their daily experiences, and answers her own question: \\"Are monks wasting their time in seeking to convert themselves, and the world, from evil?\\" No. Instead, she gains from them a sense of \\"what really matters in human behavior...if I accept the burden of my despair, in the monastic sense, then I also receive the tools to defeat it. I have a hope that no modern therapeutic approach can give me.\\"Nor does the author shy away from a more feminist theology than the current leaders of the Church espouse. One of her favorite writers is Mechtild of Magdeburg (c. 1207 - 1282/1294) a mystic, who was often at odds with the Church hierarchy:\\"When I began to read Mechtild, with her vision of bishops in the lowest circles of hell, her description of the corrupt clergy of her day as 'goats [reeking] of impurity regarding Eternal Truth,' I knew I had found the woman of my dreams.\\"The ultimate lesson that Norris learns from the writings of Mechtild, and from her own stay in the Benedictine monastery:\\"While the sense of monasticism as the center of the church may be lost on many people today, I think it still holds true, and hospitality is at the center of it all. In a world in which we are so easily labeled and polarized by our differences: man/woman, Protestant/Catholic, gay/straight, feminist/chauvinist, monastic hospitality is a model of the kind of openness that we need if we are going to see and hear each other at all.\\"This book is made up of a series of short biographical essays, each of them a 'lectio divina' or holy reading if approached with an open mind and a humble heart."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"As a woman who worships with both Protestants and Catholics on a regular basis, I thought that I would enjoy the perspective of a born and raised Protestant living as an oblate in a Benedictine monastery.I consider myself to be a somewhat literary person although not poetic and found the poet Kathleen Norris to be rather obsessed with language. I also found her to be rather obsessed with some aspects of church history. I learned more than I needed to know about the Virgin Martyrs and St. Maria Goretti. Like some of the other reviewers on this site, I was hoping to learn more about life in a monastery. Some of the human interest stories she tells towards the end of the book are moving and make me wish for more. The beautiful examples of holiness and long-suffering on the deathbeds of people she has known meant more to me than hearing about how many wounds Maria Goretti received when she was murdered.In fact, I wouldn't suggest that this book be kept by the bedside for nighttime reading because some parts are quite disturbing for reading at anytime but particularly as bedtime spiritual reading.I feel as though Kathleen Norris wondered if she'd ever again write a book and thinking perhaps that this was her last chance--she filled it with all kinds of material, from both the past and present. At least one reviewer commented that she wasn't focused--it did seem as though my mind was flying in every direction trying to keep up with her meanderings. Only occasionally did I feel inspired or uplifted. I honestly wonder how relevant some of this material is to the average Christian who just needs a spiritual pick-me-up and a peek inside the monastery walls."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"A beautiful, intimate book about the role of liturgy in modern life... her insights into life in a community are wonderful, and challenging. An inspiring portrait of a life worth aspiring to."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Norris' book keeps guiding people year after year, step by step along ancient paths of Benedictine spirituality. One of the qualities of Norris' writing which connect with us as readers is her edgy, skeptical, downtoearth sense of the mystery of God as unveiled within a Benedictine monastery. One of the reasons Cloister Walk has such longevity is that Norris spent months and months walking/praying/struggling in a Benedictine monastery, not as a novice nun like Karen Armstrong, but as a non-Catholic, non-male, non-monastic married protestant woman. She meanders her way around the cloister life, exploring here, poking her head into there, tiptoeing about behind over there, and pulling back the curtain up here, inviting us into the strange world, yet not so very strange ordinary spirituality of Benedictine monks. Norris is a Benedictine oblate, someone who promises to live according to Benedictine spiritual principles as much as possible according to our station in life. I too, along with about 25,000 others around the world, share Norris life as an oblate, and appreciate her way of welcoming us into the cloistered life. For another recently published book on Benedictine spirituality for nonmonastics, take a look atAncient Paths: Discover Christian Formation the Benedictine Way."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"After reading this book, a very supernatural thing happened to me. . .I started praying non-stop! And this pray basically went, \\"Lord, forget all about that other crap I asked for, just help me get my money back from buying that aweful book, \\"The Cloister Walk\\". It was a rambling, uninsightful book which talked at great length about being a poet and surprisingly little about the process involved in choosing the cloistered walk, which was more of what I was expecting. I love writing and poetry, but it should not dominate the discussion in such a book. I almost cried as I forced myself to finish the book, with my Grandma's words \\"Waste not, want not\\" at the forefront of my mind."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Although Ms. Norris book describes much of the beauty of the Catholic faith, it ultimately is spoiled by conceit and self-promotion.

I found the writing to be unimaginative and felt like the book had no direction. I was very disappointed and had forgotten it before it was even finished."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"It would be difficult for me to say a harsh thing about this book or the companion audio tapes read by Debra Winger. I was in a very confused and troublesome place in my like and this book introduced me to the wonderful simplicity and sense of the Rule of St Benedict, and gave me my first recognized touch of Grace.I enjoy Norris' writing style. She is quirky, down to earth. Unlike other reviewers, I like her familiarness, her occasional slang and language choices. She is a real person reporting a real experience, and that experience literally penetrated deep within me.What more could anyone ask for in a book?"},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"For many people, Kathleen Norris' story is somewhat familiar. She was raised in a faith tradition as a child, abandoned her faith, or at least put her faith on hold, then rediscovers her faith as an adult. Norris' experience is hardly typical, but it is definitely not \\"the same old story\\" with a different person telling it. Norris rediscovers faith accidentally, but it is not the Protestant faith of her youth. She is now a Protestant whose faith is colored by Roman Catholicism, particularly the Benedictine monastic tradition in Catholicism.Norris is a writer whose primary genre has been poetry. In 1991, she spent a year at a Benedictine monastery in Minnesota and entered into the life of this monastic community. From time to time she also traveled to her home and to various parts of the country for conferences or speaking engagements. The book is taken from reflections of that experience. In the book, she is connected to her life outside the monastery while at the monastery and while away from the monastery, she still seems to be very present to the life of the monastery. The life in the monastery has a certain pattern to it, based on the Rule of St. Benedict. The year follows a calendar, but it is the calendar of the Roman Martyrology which lists the days that various saints and religious feasts are remembered. The Liturgy of the Hours, chanted by the monks is essential to the life of the monastery as is time for personal prayer and reflection. As both an insider (as a person connected to the monastery) and an outsider (a Protestant woman in an all male Catholic community), Norris is able to make keen insights into the life of the monastery with a unique perspective.This is a book that should be read from cover to cover when the book is read for the first time. Since the book begins in September and concludes in August of the following year, reading the whole book rather than excerpts is essential to see Norris' growth in her understanding of monastic life as well as her own spiritual growth. After reading the book a first time, most readers will inevitably go back to favorite passages. I often reread portions in the book about the liturgical seasons such as Advent and Easter. I also enjoy rereading her understanding of \\"lectio divina\\" a prayerful method of reading scripture that allows the words to speak to a person's heart. I believe that as a poet, she is able to understand the richness of scripture both from a literary point of view and as a believer. Her experiences back home in South Dakota and her activities in her own faith community are also great excerpts in the book.Part of my love for the books is due to the fact it can be read and shared with so many people. More often than not, religious books speak only to a person who shares the same religious mindset. I have found myself recommending the book to lifelong Catholics as an affirmation of the faith. I love the fact that this Protestant woman has a better understanding and appreciation for many Catholic things than most Catholics do. I have likewise recommended the book to people who have been hurt by organized religion in general, and the Catholic Church in particular. Norris is able to see God at work in lives that she terms \\"messy\\" and flaws in the saints. Everyone can find him/herself in Norris' book. Most people I know have read this book slowly in conjunction with prayer. This is probably the best way to approach the book. This is also a book for people on a spiritual quest, but not a book for people who want an easy spirituality. Norris' profound insights are due to struggling with faith and belief and how faith and belief are lived in life. If living a life of faith can be a challenge, The Cloister Walk is the kind of encouragement needed as Norris shares her journey and we live our own journey."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"I first read Cloister Walk after deciding to write my senior thesis on her writings. I was intrigued by a writer who was a feminist, embraced Christianity, explored monasteries, and found an audience outside the conservative Christian market. As a person who has grown up with a strong faith in God and love for Jesus, I also longed for new ways to talk about God. Norris's honesty and exploration of what it's like to live out the beliefs and ideas of the Christian faith gave me confidence to explore my own experiences of these beliefs. Her chapter on the Psalms was particularly amazing. I felt like I was being set free with Norris to be honest with God and others about being human--complete with anger, doubt, and depression. Her theology, or speech about God, is grounded in everyday living. She finds God revealed in the simplest things, which is consistent with the Bible and the character of God--who chose to become a human in Jesus. This affirms for me that even the smallest things I do everyday are important to God--because he loves me enough to become someone like me."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"This book was a last minute grab from an airport newstand. Frankly, I expected to be disappointed. (Betty J. Eadie's &quot;Embraced by the Light&quot; and James Redfield's &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; had similarly let me down on a long flight.)I find that much of contemporary spiritual literature, although frequently heartfelt and sincere, is glib and unsubstantial. &quot;The Cloister Walk&quot; was different. It was thoughtful and aware, but maybe better than that, it was smart. Although the author's preoccupation with her status as a tortured poet was less than riveting, I appreciated the context that Kathleen Norris' scholarly impulses provided and I found that I could agree with many of her various points of view. (That whole virgin martyrs phenomenon does have a wierd legacy.)As I read, I felt much of my self-generated tension drain away from me. Norris took me along on the journey with her, and I was glad to go. She offered me a sense of the peace I so desperately craved.Let me say this, I'm a voracious and consumptive reader. Few are the books I revisit. &quot;The Cloister Walk&quot; is still on my nightstand, two years after I first picked it up."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Even most christians today seem to find the idea of the monastery archaic, extreme and unappealing. Here, Ms Norris, a hesitant believer, makes the convent seem appealing, beautiful and full of wisdom.Once you get past the gimmick - a modern poet finding centering in a monastery - there is still much to like about this book. It is a combination of a lot of things - a painfully personal journal, a catalog of discoveries and musings, a polished essay on laundry that was published in the New Yorker, and several brilliant pieces that stand as academic writing, ready for a feminist publication or academic journal.I think the latter were my favorite. It is informative and enjoyable to find Ms. Norris taking on the virgin martyrs, looking at catholic history and practice with a modern feminist eye, and finding much to like, and much to weep over. Another similar essay comparing the role of biblical prophets and modern day poets (both dwellers on the \\"margin\\" of society, yet deeply necessary to that society) is also excellent.Norris' respect for the Word is wonderful, as well. She writes much and often about the poetry of the Bible - psalms, Jeremiah - and how they fit and fill her life. She brings new life to what, for many of us, have been wrongly dead words.Her reflections on the monastery are good. She gives monks and nuns an earthy reality, talking about their quirks, their sense of humor, their doubts and struggles as well as their achievements, discipline, and success. She spends a fair amount of time digging into the heritage and history of monasticism and christianity - apparently she is reading Christian classics as she is living at the monastery - and I learned much about ancient monks, martyrs, and saints.There is much wisdom in this book, and I appreciate Kathleen Norris' awareness and poet's sensibility. It reveals a richness in the Christian tradition that I gladly and happily claim as a follower of Jesus. It's not all WWJD bracelets and \\"Left Behind\\" novels.A passage:\\"Not long ago I accompanied a Trappist abbot as he unlocked a door to the cloister and led me down a long corridor into a stone-walled room, the chapter house of the monastery, where some twenty monks were waiting for me to give a reading. Poetry does lead a person into some strange places. This wonderfully silent, hidden-away place was not as alien to me as it might have been, however as I'd been living on the grounds of a Benedictine monastery for most of the last three years. Trappists are more silent than the Benedictines, far less likely to have works that draws them into the world outside the monastery. But the cumulative effect of the Liturgy of the Hours - at a bare minimum, morning, noon, and evening prayer, as well as the Eucharist - on one's psyche, the sense it gives a person of being immersed in the language of scripture, is much the same in any monastery. What has surprised me, in my time among monastic people, is how much their liturgy feeds my poetry; and also how much correspondence I've found between monastic practice and the discipline of writing.\\"if you'd like to discuss this book, this review, or anything else with me, e-mail me at williekrischke@hotmail.com. i'd love to chat. :)"},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"A RING OF TRUTH: Like Kathleen Norris, I am a Protestant who lives in a small town and have been heavily influenced by being a guest in a Benedictine Monastery many times. Like Norris, I have been invited into the cloister. Her account has the ring of authenticity. By the time I finished the book I realized I was reading while listening to the CD of chants prepared at the monastery I most often visit.WHO WILL LIKE THIS BOOK? Norris is a poet. This book is a collection of sketches from inside the monastery, from monastic history, from her own small town, from her vacations, and from the cities she has lived and worked in. Some chapters are long, while others are short. Her themes bounce from chapter to chapter. If you like poetic imagery written in prose and are interested in this theme, you will like this book.WHO WILL NOT LIKE THIS BOOK? If you like to read technical manuals and books with finely structured outlines, you will probably not like this book. You may feel that Norris rambles too much and doesn't stay with her main point."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"Kathleen Norris brings to the table a unique perspective on the monastic life for two reasons:1.) She comes from a Protestant background2.) She is not writing from the outside to the extent that someone researching a novel would do.She is involved with the Benedictines as an Oblate. This means that she is actively involved in the life of the monastery the morning and evening Psalms, the liturgy, and other elements of the monastery. Thus, she writes as an 'insider' of sorts. The book is written rather liturgically in that she covers the topics as they crop up in the liturgical year. This includes different books of the Bible as they are read in the monastery, different saints and Fathers from earlier periods of Church history. She also delves into a diversity of topics on life in the monastery and the different difficulties of the monastic life. Yet she sheds a reflective lens on the Benedictines and it is far from the common caricatures that are bandied about by those who consider themselves \`paragons of wisdom' in the world today.It helps to see that striving for sanctity is not easy even to the Benedictines for often we get the stereotype of monks and nuns having some repressed view of humanity and its stresses/temptations. Perhaps the most important element (if one can be singled out) is that the monks and the nuns are shown in their humanity. This sadly is often not done. The monastery life may add up to a big fat zero in the eyes of the world. However, in Norris' book it takes on an aura of richness and splendour. She also does a wonderful job of showing the positive side of celibacy - which it seems the all-wise world wants to deface at any cost whatsoever. I cannot imagine someone reading this book and not coming across with a new vision of monastic life. A view that accompanies a realization that far from antiquated, the principles of the Rule of St. Benedict are applicable to all us in our daily lives. They would vary slightly of course in accordance with our states in life (religious, married, single, widowed, etc). Another plus is that the sections are generally shorter with few longer than 10 pages (many are about 1-5 pages or so). Thus unlike reading a novel where you have to at times stop in mid chapter with this book you are seldom too many pages from finishing the section you are reading.The book holds together and has a common thread binding the sections but at times it seems that the author has difficulty focusing on a topic without veering into another topic and then another. Other reviewers spoke of it being a series of shorter writings and that is probably how this book was written. As one who is not unfamiliar with the process of writing, I understand where the author is coming from but it might seem disjointed to some readers. Ms. Norris also shows how the principles she reveals in the monastery she applies to her everyday life including her marriage and her relationship to others. I recommend the book highly and feel that for those who are of the patient sort, the book will read quite well and they will mine many wonderful antidotes and unexpected jewels from it. For those who have difficulties in that area, this book could serve as an instrument of sorts to help with learning patience: the calming effect of meditation coupled with the rhythms of life. The ebbs and flows of liturgy and the gradual fashioning of persons being conformed them to the will of God. Themes in other words familiar to the monastic and which are so often shunned today by the wisdom of the world. Better though is the wisdom of God, which the world thinks is foolish. Ms. Norris' work provides a wonderful source for meditation and enlightenment and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"As a former monk, a former educator in the Catholic and public school systems, and as a present Roman Catholic priest, I found this book to be the perfect companion (along with Willa Cather) for a recent retreat less than thirty miles from St. John's Abbey. As an insider and an outsider to monastic living and lifestyle, it was interesting to read about how a complete outsider turns from traveler to pilgrim. Once one has encountered Benedictine spirituality, one's life takes a new direction. Norris blends her experiences, both &quot;secular&quot; and &quot;sacred&quot; into what the Gospel calls to be: disciples who try to do the best we can. I'm happy to see that she has found rhythmn in her life. She reminded me of that same rhythmn and balance that the great liturgy and monastic disciplines of the Roman Catholic church offers. This book helped me to remember where I have been and, more importantly, it helped me to remember my future and our future."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"The Cloister Walkby Kathleen NorrisCalling to mind the writings of Thomas Merton and Henri Nouwen, Kathleen Norris writes a deeply personal journal of spiritual self-rediscovery. Although a lifelong protestant, Ms. Norris explores the cultures and traditions of a Benedictine Monastery as she searches for deeper meaning and communion with God in her life. This is a book of great reflection, a story of a soul's journey in the midst of contemporary doubt and turmoil.The book takes place within the context of monastic life throughout the Church's liturgical year. It explores the rituals, ceremonies, liturgies of this life as well as the everyday existence of monastic life. Ms. Norris is strangely drawn to the cloistered community, one which is at once both apart, yet deeply (if somewhat obliquely) connected to life in general. The themes of liturgical renewal, ritual, contemplation, meditation and prayer speak directly to the hearts of all of us. In that life, the author addresses the sacredness of all life and its ability for renewal and spiritual growth."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"A friend loaned me this book as I was moving to a new city. That was 3 months ago; I just finished it last night. Every night, I have treated myself to one tiny chapter, or maybe two on a rough day. As a Catholic with some experience in the rhythm of communal life, it was like being wrapped again in the love of that community. It literally helped me calm down. I wish Ms. Norris could have coffee with all my lapsed Catholic siblings of her generation; as it is, I may dare to give one of them the book for Christmas. Thanks to the author for unfolding her story."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"A great book, that anyone could benefit by reading. For anyone suffering from depression or disappointment in life, this book is a must. Goes into great detail about what in life leads to loss of interest and lack of passion. Good common sense solutions. A very honest and transparent autobiographical account of a journey through the dark times of life and how to emerge from them in one piece emotionally and spiritually. Kathleen Norris is doing a lot of good with her writing."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"It's been a few years, but memory tells me this was - and is - a wonderful book. I suppose it makes a difference to have been to the monastery in Minnesota where the author went, and to have met Ms. Norris; nonetheless, she has a lot to say. Her thought-full exposition of the Psalms was particularly helpful, although I would have been happier if she had chosen a more recent translation (such as the NRSV or the CEV)than the often-difficult-to-understand King James Version. I have recommended this book many times, and continue to do so."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"This interesting book gives the reader an unusual inside view into the cloistered life, especially for those of us who would dearly love to have the experience but probably never will have the privilege."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"I've really taken my time reading or better yet savoring this incredible book! Norris writes with such a clear and down to earth style that you feel she is in the same room with you discussing her experiences. I would recommend this read to anyone who finds themselves at a spiritural crossroads, plateau, or &quot;dark night&quot;. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"I've always seen this book at book stores and I've always had in the back of my mind to read the book. I had no idea what cloister walk would be about. One day, I decided to take it out of the library and I started to read it and I couldn't put it down and I went out and bought a copy of the book, because the book was so moving. Ms. Norris, starts out telling what an oblate is. I've never heard of the term, even though i am Catholic. I didn't even realize that protestants or any other denominations, let alone Catholic lay people could join an order. Ms. Norris describes the workings of a monestary and she does a good job in pointing out that monestaries do not produce everyone in it alike. Quite the contrary. There are individualists in the monestary and they are characters. Ms. Norris's prose is very clear, simplistic and easy to follow. She talks about the importance of being able to hear the stories from the bible. On the whole, she tells s! ome fascinating tale, although once in a while, the book wanders, like a chapter on gardening, where she admits that she's no good at it, but it lets me wonder, why does she bring this topic up in the first place. I was hoping that she might have learned some tips from the monks on how to garden, or that maybe she had a tip or two on herbs, something that monks are known for. Besides these minor irrations, it's a supurb book."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"I stumbled on this treasure in early January 1997, and read the whole thing in less than a week. Reading it -- and pondering it afterwards -- was like being on a spiritual retreat.I was especially intrigued by the descriptions of Benedictine monastic life.I look forward to reading more from Norris."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"This is not a book one gives away but rather one that is shared with new copies for others that they also might share in the wisdom of its pages. Holy reading is what this is and remnants of the spiritual guidance gleaned by Kahtleen Norris's walk among and with the monks serve us well in needed moments of reflection and meditation. Weaving Scripture into the chapters as the cornerstone of the discussions only serves to make us all a little less theologically illiterate. Human experiences of anger, pride, listlessness, love,gratitude, generosity emerge instructively through the liturgical explorations and the wonderful stories that abound in this reflective spiritual journey. For all of us who would be much improved by partaking in an opportunity to vicariously experience some soul searching questions on life's pupose and meaning, I heartily recommend this lectio divina"},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"I had been curious about &quot;The Cloister Walk&quot; for many years, but have been inexplicably reluctant to read it. Recently I had the opportunity to listen to the abridged audio version of the book, read by actress Debra Winger. Now that I've heard the tape, I'm looking forward to reading the entire book someday.As a convert from Protestantism to the Eastern Orthodox Church, I found that many of Kathleen Norris' thoughts, feelings and experiences in discovering and participating in liturgical life paralleled my own. Her writings remind me of Orthodox writer Frederica Mathewes-Green, notably &quot;Facing East&quot; and &quot;The Illumined Heart,&quot; a well-known convert from the Episcopal Church.I appreciate Norris' penetrating insights into the monastic life. By living with the Benedictines, she was able to answer many of the questions that those of outside of the monastic life have undoubtedly wondered about.I'd recommend this book to anyone curious about liturgical life, monasticism or about going deeper in the Christian walk. While Debra Winger did an adequate job of reading this abridgment, I was unconvinced that she knew what she was reading about. Fortunately Norris' narrative is captivating on its own."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"I cannot recommend this book enough. I have read literally thousands of words on religion and the Bible (including the Bible itself in entirety 5 times) and I have never found a book so spiritually touching as this. Ms. Norris should be counted among the most gifted Christian authors of literature."},{"Title":"The Cloister Walk","review":"A self-serving autobiographical reflection.

But, something about the book ties it all together. It makes you think. At least for me it did. It helps me keep the importance of sleep on my mind. I did skip some sections that did not apply to me or that I did not think I needed helped with. I don't think it is a book for someone who has major sleep issues that require medical attention. But as a person who is busy, sucked in by internet or late night TV, or just being a night owl, this book helps me. Even after I finished it I have thought about important points in the book. Thinking of it has made me turn off the TV and get in bed when before I probably would not even have thought about it. I have not been getting 7-8 hours in as much as I should but since reading the book about a month ago, I have not had any nights of less than 6 hours of sleep.

The book is full of examples and helpful tips and includes worksheets for you to record your sleep during the four week program.If you're impatient to jump into the 4 week program you can start that immediately but I would strongly recommend reading the preceding chapters so you can eliminate problems from light, noise, pets, uncomfortable pillows and the like.Good Night covers all the basics of getting a good night sleep, including recommendations on snacks to help you get to sleep and ideas for decorating your room to minimise distractions.The book distinguishes between disordered sleeping and sleep disorders covering off the common sleep disorders and how they are diagnosed.

Though it sounds unrealistic in the modern world, that anyone would take a full hour to do this, the cool thing is that 1/2 of this wind-down hour is meant to be devoted to doing what the author calls \\"mindless chores\\" like folding laundry.

Highly recommended overall."},{"Title":"Good Night: The Sleep Doctor's 4-Week Program to Better Sleep and Better Health","review":"Surely all of us, at one time or another, have gone a few rounds with insomnia. When you've had trouble sleeping, you drag yourself out of bed in the morning feeling all achy and exhausted, just as if you had been in the ring battling an opponent all night. In his book Good Night: The Sleep Doctor's 4-Week Program to Better Sleep and Better Health, Dr. Breus coaches you on all the effective ways to overcome insomnia - ways that many of us would never even think of! - and put it down for the count. I found his book expertly written in a conversational and friendly style with suggestions and instructions that are easy to understand and follow.Part I of the book is called \\"Quick-Fix Sleep Solutions\\" and includes the first four chapters. You know what a bad night's sleep is, but what exactly is a good night's sleep? In chapter one, Dr. Breus explains enough about the science of sleep to give you a good foundation for understanding how and why a good night's sleep is necessary to feeling good and looking younger. Chapter two introduces you to the \\"Three Most Troublesome Culprits in Disordered Sleep...and How to Conquer Them.\\" (If you guessed that caffeine is one of the three, you're right; however, the third culprit might surprise you!) The discussion in chapter three is about the people in your life - your partner, children, and business associates - and how you can manage the disruptions in sleep they may cause. Chapter four is \\"The Extreme (but Easy!) Bedroom Makeover\\" and is one of my favorite chapters. In it you learn how to make small changes in the bedroom that add up to a big difference, enabling you to improve your quality of sleep!\\"Part II: From Waistlines to Face Lines: You Are What You Sleep\\" includes chapters five, six, and seven. Did you know that a poor night's sleep can undermine your diet, exercise, or combination weight-loss program? The first chapter in part two discusses how the body chemistry behind a good night's sleep can not only enhance your weight-loss, but acts as a \\"cosmetic medicine\\" that empowers your cells to rejuvenate and reverse the damage caused by age, stress, environment, and other factors. Chapter six talks about the important role played by quality sleep in the areas of exercise and sex, and how the right kind of sleep can not only perk up your love life, it can enhance those intimate moments with your partner. If you have ever thought that a nap in the afternoon was a good idea, chapter seven will show you how right you are, and Dr Breus explores different types of naps to help you choose the one that will deliver just the right amount of rest and energy without adversely impacting your sleep that night.Part III launches the remarkable four-week program, \\"28 Nights to Sound Sleep Forever\\" developed by Dr. Breus. Chapter eight takes you step-by-step through the first week of his comprehensive and detailed program to improve your rejuvenating, regenerating sleep. He leads you through a series of small changes from scheduling sleep time to relaxation techniques while you keep a Sleep Diary to record your reactions. Evaluation is the keyword for chapter nine; here you will take the second week to review your Sleep Diary entries from the previous chapter so that you may evaluate the effectiveness of each change, and try some new techniques if you need to. You also receive friendly reminders that help you to stay on track. Weeks three and four of the program comprise chapter ten; here you finalize and follow your personalized sleep program by combining and practicing all the bedtime routine, relaxation, and other techniques that worked well for you.\\"The Sleep Aid Industry\\" is the topic of Part IV of the book. Dr Breus answers a few common questions concerning sleep-aid supplements and pharmaceuticals. As a holistic practitioner myself, I especially value this information about the hazards of using medications or other \\"quick fix\\" techniques in attempting to attain quality, restful sleep. To close, The Sleep Doctor offers some excellent guidelines to follow in order to reap the benefits of a completely natural night's sleep for business and vacation travelers, and people who work evening or night shifts.The two appendices at the end of the book include a reminder list in outline format along with Sleep Diary charts, and a list of additional resources.I am delighted to have this book in my toolkit to recommend to stress-management clients as well as to other holistic practitioners.

Finally with more pain than I can handle I went to various doctors to get me started on a program to lose pain. I also knew my sleeping was terrible and partially because of that I was 40 pounds overweight.My new doctors told me to lose weight and exercise. Easier said than done.Went and got a book for an arthritis diet ( Mediterranean diet) and started exercising fast walks around the block with heavy hands weights. next bought an inverter table and tread mill. So I am exercising and lost 28 pounds. Still on diet 3 months...no processed foods. Will probably be on the rest of my life. Still bad sleep.Bought Dr Breus book Good Night with the 28 day program. He is a PHD sleep doctor, so I figured why not.His book is great and has lots of info to get started on a sleep program.First thing I did was buy his monogrammed Latex Foam bed at Famous Tate to reduce pressure points. Helped relieve 20% of pain. Next bought two new pillows and eye sleeping patches/shades. Then put coatings on windows and darkened the room. Next plan to go to bed everyday the same time and get up same time ( 8 hours). No TV or computer in bedroom and no TV or computer during the \\"sacred\\" 1 hour before bed time. No eating 3 hours before bed time.Getting up 2 times during the night to urinate. Possibly enlarged prostate. Now taking prostate supplements plus Dr Breus says if you have to get up during the night keep lights as low as possible and on for as short a time as possible. Scheduled for prostate and bladder biopsy.So far maybe 10% better sleep. A small improvement but I hope to get even better sleep as I stay on the program longer.Also Dr Breus has a free down-loadable meditation listening part to reduce tension. Also various stretching and good hygiene programs. Do your exercise sun salutes , take a multivitamin daily, take a warm bath before bed and change into clean bed clothes. Also the pros and cons of taking Melatonin, various herbs and herbal tea and much more. Lots of info to combat insomnia. Dr Breus does say if you have a bonafide sleeping disorder to see your doctor.What really helped in the book was Dr Breus insight into proper diet and exercise has on proper sleep. If you don't exercise you usually will put on weight if you don't sleep good and get your proper sleep cycles. Different hormones like GH and others are released will you sleep and help your brain tell you when you are hungry and not. Without proper sleep your hormone system gets out of whack. Also important was not having lights on in the room as lights wreck your sleep cycle. Much much more important information.I'm starting on the 28 day sleep program now.The one part of the book I was disappointed with was very little discussion about what pain does to proper sleep and how to releave pain without prescription or over the counter medications.Would of given the book 5 stars if more pain relief information given as an aid to better sleep. Recommended 4 stars."},{"Title":"Good Night: The Sleep Doctor's 4-Week Program to Better Sleep and Better Health","review":"Almost everyone has occassional problems with sleep, and of course some people have serious problems. This book is directed at both groups. It is divided into four parts. The first is a series of questionaires, the second is related to how sleep affects your weight, the third is a 28-day \\"boot camp\\" to help you sleep better, and the last deals with sleeping pills.The author gives some interesting statistics early in the book, pointing out that the average American gets 6.8 hours of sleep on weekdays, and 7.4 hour on weekends, for an average of 6.9 hours. He points out, however, that not only is the amount of sleep you get important, but also its quality. (As everyone knows, it is possible to get 8 hours of sleep and still feel unrefreshed.) He emphasizes that stress is one of the major things that stops you from getting enough sleep, and he also discusses the role that caffeine plays. With many of the topics he gives a quiz along with a suggested plan of action.Something I haven't seen in other sleep books is a detailed discussion of the importance of your mattress in relation to sleep. He dispels some of the myths, and also makes several suggestions on how to select a mattress. Another chapter that is quite different is one on the relationship between lack of sleep and weight gain. He gives some valuable insights into this problem, and it is a topic that has got considerable media interest lately.One of the central features of the book comes in part three, namely, a \\"sleep boot camp.\\" It is a 28-day program that would be particularly useful for anyone suffering from sleep problems. Some of the things emphasized in it are: establishing how much sleep you need, developing a better bedtime routine, and preparing your body for bed. One of the best suggestions, however, is to keep a sleep diary, and to use it effectively.Finally, he has an excellent discussion of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and points out that if properly used, it is more effective than sleeping pills.Overall, the book is up-to-date, and it definitely fills a need. It is shorter than William Dement's classic book \\"The Promise of Sleep,\\" and covers many of the same topics, but it does cover things that Dement's book does not. The author's writing style is personal, easy-to-read, and interesting, and he uses a lot of examples from his practise. The book is filled with \\"boxes\\" containing tips about sleep that are quite useful. One slight drawback is his lack of diagrams; he could use more.Barry Parker, author of \\"Feel Great Feel Alive.\\""},{"Title":"Good Night: The Sleep Doctor's 4-Week Program to Better Sleep and Better Health","review":"By understanding the science of sleep and the busy lives of his patients, Dr. Breus offers a workable program for developing and keeping successful sleep habits.

I mean - there's obviously a point to reading them, and Ramona presents a good case for that. But after reading a book like this it's hard to imagine that others haven't read it, or something like it... until I remember that until this past semester, I'd never even heard of Ramona.For those of you who, like me, had never thought to pick this book up let me just say that it will frustrate, awe, and inspire you. The story is one that speaks of epic, sweeping love and loss, but it's buried in pages upon pages of description which, back in the day before the internet, television, and radio, would have passed for entertainment but today just feels as if it's one more thing to push through in order to get to the meat of the story.Thankfully, I read this book for a classroom setting - so three days were set aside for us to get to the meat and actually talk about the themes and ideas in Ramona.Here's what I came away from this talks with:Even in a story, such as Ramona, when the author is seeking to shed light on the issues of the time (specifically the tensions between whites, Mexicans, and Native Americans), in order for Ramona to be related to she is given \\"white\\" characteristics - i.e. blue eyes from her Scottish Father.Sweeping stereotypes are made not only about the whites (and honestly, as far as stereotypes go, they were pretty harsh but necessary ones) but also about Mexicans. Even the Native Americans in this book did not escape judgement from Helen Hunt Jackson.Jackson has no problem spending 70 pages talking about the little things - making a bed on a porch, tension-filled relationship between Ramona and her adoptive family, and so on.. but she spends less than a paragraph on a vital turning part of the story. In fact, the action and result of this turning part happened so quickly I thought I'd imagined it happening and had to go back to re-read it.I understand from our discussions the importance of a book like Ramona and I believe that it's important that it continues to be read and talked about - but more than anything, I wonder how that will be possible with the changing of our culture. We talk in 140 character tweets - so how can we expect young adults today to be patient enough to read pages upon pages of description? It saddens me to think that this story is one of many that will end up lost as a result - so if you decide to read just one \\"classic\\" American story this year, think about choosing this one."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"I got the book exactly came how the seller said it was. It was fast shipping and in great condition. Thank you so much."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"Helen Hunt Jackson's two major books, CENTURY OF DISHONOR and RAMONA were on a reading list of mine when I was a graduate student back in the Upper Paleolith. I didn't like either book, but am forced to concede their value.RAMONA reminded me of trying to eat ten gallons of ice cream. It was too sweet, too melodramatic and I was lucky to avoid death by cloying suffocation from reading it.It is, however, a great example of late 19th century romance. People didn't have e-mail, text messaging, computers, TV or radio. Instead, they read! A lot of them read RAMONA and apparently enjoyed it a lot more than many of today's readers.It is dated, but that is its true value, in my opinion. Jackson doesn't step out of her skin, or her age, when she writes. Some of the dated, annoying stereotypes which roll off her pen illustrate the perceptions of the age in which she lived. For better or worse, that's their value.If you're interested in American Literature, Intellectual History, or regional literature related to California, RAMONA may be of interest to you. I have a copy and enjoy it in small doses as befits an aging Philistine."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"I truly enjoyed this wonderfully written work by Helen Hunt Jackson.

The Mexican TV has taken the book to the TV screen. Currently, the production is being presented in a local Hispanic TV channel."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"While appreciating what Helen Hunt Jackson was trying to do with Ramona, there are some aspects of the book which truly bother me. One can't help but wonder at her glossed over, hisoricaly nostaligic view of the mission system in California. The Native Americans who were in this system were kept in virtual bondage and horribly abused, both physicaly and sexualy and were forced to give up the lifestyles that they had known. I think Ramona has good intention, but like Uncle Tom's Cabin, the book it was modeled after, suffers from a severe case of historical nostalgia. It is, however, interesting to read the book from a modern perspective in the sense that reform literature has certanly changeg over the years! A good read, just beware of the hisorical inacuracies."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"If anyone is actually looking for a true tale of the plight of California Indians, don't bother to look at Jackson's novel.It is inherently racist, written by a woman who doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same likes as Upton Sinclair or Harriet Beecher Stowe.On one of her visits to California, Jackson called the Native Americans she saw \\"loathsome, abject and hideous.\\" In her novel, she doesn't stray far from this inherent indignation of another race. In fact, she most likely had no idea she was being racist, another reason entirely why this book should be burned. ALternately thorughout the book, Jackson refers to the indians Ramona and ALlesandro encounter as \\"patient creatures\\" (16), \\"poor creatures\\" (20), \\"wild creatures\\" (47), \\"faithful creatures\\" (353), \\"miserable creatures\\" (324), \\"vagabond bands\\" (286) \\"like beasts\\" without the Christianizing presence of the Missions (231). are they human? possibly. are they equal to the pastoral spanish who enslaved them that Jackson venerates so much? most definitely not.Secondly, ALlesandro could be the most anglicized Indian ever. He is most assurredly an abberation, physically looked like a mexican, was the most devout catholic, lives in a house that is like any mexican villa. INdeed, Jackson remarks that \\"There were not many such Indians as Allesandro and his Father. If there had been, it would have been better for their people,\\" (327) and that he \\"almost makes one forget he is an Indian.\\" (101).also, she refuses to create an interracial love story. the whole crappy book is predicated on the fact that Ramona is half indian. only when she is indian can she fulfill Jackson's debased notion of racial determinism.Besides the myriad moral reasons why this book is so terrible, it could be the most groandiose, verbose, and pooorly written romance book EVER. the characters lack any moral ambiguity which would make for interesting characterization and are constantly marked by sweeping romantic gestures that could better be classified as trash fiction than a literary classic.You'd find more entertainment from reading the yellow pages than wasting your time. The world would be a better place if the trees from which the paper for this book came from were still planted."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"Just when I had begun to despair that I might never truly fall in love with a book again, along came Ramona. From the first page, I was captured by the poetic nature of the writing. Some books can be read quickly, not so Ramona. Every sentence is crafted so carefully, every description so complete, some passages must be read over and over again just for the sheer pleasure of the prose. The plot combination of social justice and romance makes the book amazingly contemporary. The racism of this book is directed toward the Native American population and their story is a heart wrenching one indeed. The description of the startling beauty of the landscape and the lives of the characters stands in stark contrast to the breathtaking cruelty with which this nation took land from its native population. Ramona thrilled me and broke my heart. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"I have Heard Ramona by Helen Hunt Jackson described as a &quot;propaganda novel.&quot; That it well may have been in its day. But &quot;Ramona&quot; has not endured all these years because of a propaganda message. This novel has endured because of the trueness of the characters--The noble Alessandro, the patient, tender Ramona, the faithful Felipe, the just, stern, sad Senora Moreno.Even the minor characters are true to form especially the jealous, vindictive Margarita, the loyal Marta, and the strutting but endearing Juan Can.I rediscovered this book in a dusty corner of our public library and devoured in in two days.A book becomes a classic when it becomes part of your soul. The love story of Ramona and Alessandro has burned itself into my heart where it will remain forever."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"I just recently heard of this book, although it was a bestseller around the turn of the century, and was popular through the 20's. Modern readers may find the language and parts of the plot melodramatic and overly sentimental, but the characters are strong and memorable, the story is full of exciting incident, and the portrayal of the United States government still shocks. I grew up in California, but I had never really seen how \\"white Americans\\" appeared to the Native Americans and Mexicans who first lived here. \\"Ramona\\" gives the earlier settlers a voice. Erica Baumeister's review, quoted on the Amazon page for this book, states that \\"the book has the flaws of being created by an author who, although deeply engaged and sympathetic, had not experienced the life she was describing.\\" I don't agree--perhaps if I had grown up as an \\"Indian\\" or Mexican in those times I wouldn't find the book convincing, but as it is, it worked for me. The main characters, Ramona and Alessandro, are \\"fairy-tale-ized\\", but their story still touches, and the book still has power. Helen Hunt Jackson purposely wrote \\"Ramona\\" to call attention to the U.S.'s unfair treatment of Native Americans, but the two essays included in the Signet edition claim that, for all the popularity of the novel, it didn't bring results. For that, we have only our own injustice to blame, because this poetic messenger did her best to right some wrongs."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"I thought this was one of the best books I have ever read.

I initially held no respect for its &quot;Great American Love Story&quot; subtitle, but this book really hit me right in the chest. I liked that I was able to extract the characters' personalities from their words and tones rather than from paragraphs of third-person description. I liked that it piqued my interest in nineteenth century Californian history, especially the upsetting struggle of the Mexicans and Native Americans living there. And lastly, I liked experiencing the boundless love that flowed from the simple, strong and beautiful Ramona. A quick, colorful, emotionally satisfying novel."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"Ramona, set in early Spanish/Mexican California, weaves the tale of love between the Indian Allessandro and the Mexican-Indian girl Ramona. Rich, deep characters and vivid description of the landscapes makes this novel a great piece of California historical fiction. Through Jackson's powerful illustrations, the racism Mexicans and Indians both endured at the hands of White and Mexican settlers is experienced by the reader. Yet the love story is what makes this book and Jackson's romanticism of the landscape and the main charcaters only enhances Californians' fascination with Mission Revival."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"It has been a long time since I first read this book, but the subject matter will be around for a long time to come. Bewitching love story for which at least one beautiful song has been written, \\"Ramona\\" and possibly \\"Vaya Con Dios\\". It is a love story, one whose emotion most of us will recognize; another time, another place, from our own Spring Time; woven skillfully into cultural differences, that somehow begets bigotry, born of all the little differences that make each of us unique, but also make us strange and unacceptable to others who cannot accept differences from what they have always known.The descriptions of that far removed landscape and time are marvelous. The Old early Missions, the sheep, the priests who visit the valley in the traditional way on foot, traveling on ancient footpaths to bring religion to the people (and keep them religious), all are magical in their simplicity as the author brings forth their tale. She is also one of the first to dare write of things unsavory to the average conscience. She took conditions \\"as they were\\" and exposed them \\"for what they were\\" in the treatment of people displaced.It's a setting deep within the Old Spanish Mission Country of Southern California, among the sheep ranches, and steeped in Spanish Culture, strict traditions, and unforgiving religion. Times were hard, values were strict and anyone not fitting snugly into a pre-conceived notion of a pre-conceived group was hard-pressed to find a life to live in peace anywhere. It is in this life where Ramona grows up, a child of a misalliance between the former lover of the Senora Moreno's own sister and an Indian woman - that's a twist in the story to be discovered while reading it. The Senora, for a variety of reasons you will understand as you read, agrees to take the child Ramona in to raise, although she never accepts her, because she is not blood family. The description of Ramona is captivating, long black hair of the Indian girl, dark blue eyes of the Scottish father - truly she is beautiful, but it is also apparent that her beauty goes deeper than the skin; she is beautiful of spirit as well as of the flesh.Alessandro, an Indian lad, comes to work on the ranch early in the spring to help with the annual sheep shearing. Ramona quickly sees in him something she has never seen before - someone who will accept her for whom she is, without reservation, coupled with a gentle mind and character much like her own. She falls in love with him, adding another layer of \\"difference\\" to her half-breed status.Felipe, the beloved son of the venerable, strong and proud Matriarch, Senora Moreno, who rules not only the ranch but her son with an iron hand, falls in love with Ramona himself but knows he can never take her for his own, for many reasons. Those \\"reasons\\" finally dissolve during the tragic ending of the story and what remains of the life of Ramona blends again into the home she left as a young woman - as she tried to make a new life with a stranger she has loved deeply. As she is delivered back to a life of security, she is strangely serene - but never again will she feel wild, young excitement once experienced with Allesandro, the Indian. I offer one of the last lines of the epilogue - as she finally stands \\"quietly in Filepe's arms\\":\\"...how unlike was she to that Ramona who flung herself on Alessandro's breast, crying 'take me with you! I would rather die than have you leave me!'.....\\"Ramona is well deserving of it's place in Classic Literature - a love and strife story extraordinaire."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"I heard about the book while hiking at Seven Falls near Colorado Springs. HHJ was suppose to have gone to the overlook there to write, including parts of Ramona. This intrigued me and so I checked it out. I don't read much non-fiction, so I enjoyed the idea of a history based novel. It was enough of a love story for me to earn points with female friends, but enough of an adventure to keep me interested. One part of the book that I found distracting was the attempt at phonetic spelling of the Tennessee drawl of a few characters.

However, it is the story behind the story that is most interesting. What Ramona truly is....a middle class white woman's perception of what it might be like to be an Indian. Jackson was an abolitionist turned author in the 1830's. This is her most recognized and extensive work.

After the 1834 Secularization of the 21 missions in the chain founded by Father Serra, the California of the grandees slowly, inevitably began to fade into historical memory. Three groups were drastically affected by the disintegration of this social system--admittedly not free of innate injustice. Ruin fell upon the devout Franciscan fathers, the Hispanic hidalgos who had received vast estates from the King, and the Native Americans who first respected the land--ever at the bottom of the social chain.Depicted as the underlying moral evil of all three groups are theYankees--Americans in general, whose greed and violence destroyed innocent lives, trampled decades of royal justice and raped the landscape of Alta California with wanton violence and callous indifference. Dispersed among these recriminations and regrets the author weaves a grimly fascinating tapestry of love, psychological brutality, outraged or warped honor and overbearing pride.Senora Moreno rules her household with an iron fist and a cold heart, except where it concerns her only, somewhat nave son, Felipe, 20. A master at manipulation this dowager wields absolute power to her vast household and retainers but also behind the scenes, deferring only to aged Father Salvierderra, for whom she has had a chapel built.Keeping selfish secrets about her dead sister's half-breed daughter (who considers a marriage between a white man and an squaw valid?), she hoards both the jewels and the love int ended for the girl. Obeying only the letter of her promise to her sister, she never intended to honor the spirit of motherhood, thus condemning Ramona to be raised without affection.At 19 Ramona is lovely, sweet, gentle and genteel (thanks to her convent training) but sheltered in a simple country lifestyle, where she is kept in ignorance of the reality of the present world and her own, mysterious past. This tenuous status quo changes when the annual sheep shearing occurs, the year that 21-year-old Alessandro, the educated son of a chief, leads his band of Indians to the hacienda. Their hidden love smolders until it erupts in a passionate embrace, which is unfortunately witnessed and misinterpreted by the shocked Senora.Her outraged reaction and fierce determination to punish theculprits sets in motion a chain of events which result in both the loversfleeing the rancho. There follow years of persecution of this doomed pair, as they seek to live peacefully--in harmony with nature and man. Jackson includes heavy themes in this story: racial prejudice, the power of Catholicism, the tension between mother and son, and the regenerating force of love. Partly a novel of social protest, RAMONA--despite its semi-tragic denouement, remains a classic tale of old California, whose pathos and passion reach out to modern readers."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"This book might be the only romance novel that I've read in my life, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Jackson intended to stir American sympathies for the plight of Native Americans, which probably explains the flat perfection of her Indian protagonists, Ramona and her lover/husband Alessandro. The two are hounded pillar to post by greedy American settlers, with no recourse to law and no protection from church or state.I'd give the first half of the book five stars and the second half three. What gives it five stars? (1) The setting: Old California, just after the territory has changed hands from Mexico to the U.S. Both the Moreno ranch and the Indian villages and ruined missions were fresh and alive.(2) Senora Moreno. The wily, domineering matriarch steals every scene from her pushover son Felipe and blandly-angelic foster daughter Ramona. She's complex, and Jackson does a great job getting inside her motivations.And the three-star second-half? Well, when the book has to depend on Ramona and Alessandro for interest, it gets a little dull. The good-hearted Tennessee poor-white family that shows up livens things up somewhat, if only because the reader must expend great effort to translate Auntie Ri's orthographical-nightmare dialect."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"Ibi is right.

I only got into Helen and her work myself because of my interest in Emily and her world. \\"Ramona,\\" though wonderfully well-written and still readable, even historically important, is a 19th century romance, and therefore not \\"literature,\\" properly speaking, nor likely to turn up as required reading in any academic curriculum anytime soon. It's not easy for us today to imagine that age, back when the much more famous Emily Dickinson was still completely unknown, in which the too young death of Helen Hunt Jackson inspired a national day of mourning.Much of the historical interest of \\"Ramona\\" swirls around one of America's forgotten wars, much like Korea, in this case the Mexican War. To this day, Mexico still resents the loss of about half of itself to the burgeoning US, ceded to us by a corrupt pusillanimous Mexican government as essentially spoils of war, with matters considerably complicated by the discovery of gold in a huge chunk of it, California, a couple of years later. The issue in \\"Ramona,\\" however, has principally to do with the fates of the population of the vast new territory at the time, namely its Mexicans and Indians. The tragic destruction of their wealth, ancient land titles and treaties, communities, culture and even people at the hands of the inrushing American population, all under the diffident benign neglect of Washington government, barely stopped short of softcore genocide. Jackson, already a famous writer, as a young New England widow, relocated to the West for health reasons and subsequently remarried, was one of those American thinkers of the day who discovered and got interested in the plight of this displaced, distressed population as a social issue.Jackson wrote a detailed survey of the crisis, with which she bombarded congress, only to get no palpable reaction. Accordingly, she decided that what was really needed was some sort of public outcry, inspired by some sort of popular literature, after the model of her friend and fellow New Englander Harriet Beecher Stowe's \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\\" which had so inflamed the nation as to inspire the Abolitionist movement. The resulting opus was \\"Ramona,\\" the story of the doomed romance of a half breed Mexican rancher's daughter and a young Indian brave, their affairs caught up in the tidal wave of US immigration into their ancestral lands, and it's a dandy. No chick-lit here; it's a much different wild West as seen through the eyes of someone who actually lived there, written by a gal with a real gift for descriptive prose, eye for local color, and a keen insight into the inner motivations of her characters.In one sense, the book was a success; it was a huge best seller, and Emily Dickinson wasn't the only reader, by far, who adored it. In another sense, it failed, perhaps by being too good... certainly a far superior book to \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\\" The same general public who were enthralled by its vividness somehow never internalized its story as depicting a real national crisis about which someone ought to do something. In defense of Washington, it must be said that the tiny government of the day, what with Indian wars, Reconstruction and such, already had enough on its plate to tremendously complicate things politically for them, even without such a vexed issue as this one. However that may be, Jackson was not about to give up, continuing to tour and write about the Southwest despite her mounting health problems, which, unfortunately, killed her a couple of years later, with her dreams of social justice still unrealized. The legacy: a ripping good story that lived on for a long time after its author. Not to mention an ongoing sociopolitical crisis with which anybody who knows the Southwest at all is only too familiar."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"I AM 79 YEARS OLD AND 'RAMONA' IS THE FIRST REAL BOOK I EVER READ (UNLESS YOU COUNT DICK AND JANE).

The author, herself an activist, tells the story of the injustices that were done to the Spaniards, Mexicans and Indians by the early American explorers who came to California. Ramona, who is part-Indian. becomes the heroine in a tale of love and hate. The book is one of the most famous stories ever written about early California, and there have been annual Ramona-festivals in many towns over the years. There is also a town named Ramona in southern California. Most of the characters are very well drawn, but the main character of Ramona is lacking. This does not spoil the impact of the book.

Reading it for the second time, I have enjoyed it even more."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"I actually read a 1908 edition of this book but this was as close as I could find. I found Ramona to be a pretty good story but had trouble understanding why it was said to have been monumental in bringing changes to the government's treatments of Native Americans or why it apparently received such myth like status in certain parts of Southern California. I was raised in or had family in nearly all of the territory mentioned in Ramona (which ranges from San Fransisco all the way down to Mexico). I had never heard mention of the story until a local book dealer here in NC offered me a copy of it. It was only recently that I got around to reading it and I did like how well the book describes all the mountainous terrain I grew up in and miss so much, particularly the mention of manzanita trees which are so beautiful but are only indigenous to that area. Also the mention of all the missions, particularly the one in San Diego I visited so often was a nice mental vacation back home.Outside of the background, I was excited to read this book that was suppose to have been so life changing for the Native American people, as half my family falls in that category. Unfortunately, I was not struck by anything earth shattering. Jackson does talk about the government's early allowances of whites basically claiming public domain over the natives' homes and lands, which was definitely tragic but the true horror of what really happened at that time never really reaches the level it needs to to be moving. You would gain more from reading pure historical accounts or textbooks or visiting native area museums near the reservations. I found Ramona to be more of a love story than anything and even the love story was sweet but again, just short of really moving. Ramona herself goes through mental and physical maturity and it was nice to see her grow with each experience throughout the story but her love Alessandro struck me as mostly annoying to be honest. It seemed he spent all of his time in constant outrage, whining, paranoia, melodramatic smoochy love talk with Ramona, or just bat crazy. Granted his people had been through some hell, but even when things were good for him, Alessandro just never struck me as a real man secure in himself and I wondered what Ramona was fawning all over. Even Ramona at one point makes a comment that she jumped to hear Alessandro laugh because it was so rare.I saw one reviewer on another of edition of this book mention that it seemed that Jackson was trying to write how she assumed the Native Americans spoke and acted. That is definitely the impression I got too. Particularly with Alessandro but with many of the Native characters, they would either sound White-influenced or Mexican-influenced in their speech and behavior but never really Native American to me. Jackson's \\"Indian\\" dialog reminded me of the way they would make Tonto speak in the old Lone Ranger movies. Not to mention that Natives (at least the men lol) are not so open with their emotions and feelings, even with wives. There is a guardedness and stoicism that just wasn't well portrayed here.Like I said, Ramona is pretty good to get an idea of the Southern California landscape, and there are some great interesting characters - Ramona herself and especially the sassy Aunt Ri (though her deep Appalachian dialect makes for tough reading-at certain parts it goes on for pages!). The love story between Alessandro and Ramona is cute and bittersweet and you do feel for them through their joys and tribulations, but overall it just wasn't QUITE as moving as I was hoping for."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"As a playwright, I haven't been inspired to adapt a novel until I read Ramona. What works for me? The melodrama is, after all, average, and the love story...a little predictable. But there's something audacious about author Helen Hunt Jackson and her bold \\"Mother Jones\\" muckraking persona that constantly reminds you throughout the pages about the injustices committed against Native Americans. Yet, in spite of this heavy message, there's something utterly fascinating about its main characters--the beautiful Ramona, the daring Alessandro, the unforgiving Senora, even the wimpy Felipe. They create a powerful scenario worthy of intelligent, passionate drama. I, in turn, wrote the play which has been produced at PlayWright's Theater in Phoenix and at Arizona State University in Tempe. I've adapted the story, done my own interpretation of it, but the essence has remained the same."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"I had found a a very old handwritten letter written in 1904 by my Great Great Aunt, telling about her trip from Ohio to California. In it she mentioned visiting this book author's home and she encouraged her sister, my Great Great Grandmother to get and read Ramona! Well, I wondered if, by any chance, this book was reprinted and I found it on Amazon! It is a great read, my Great Great Aunt was correct!!!"},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"Several years ago, I read an article in the San Francisco Chronicle about this book. I was surprised, because I didn't even know that a book was written about how the indigenous peoples of California felt about the change from being governed by Mexico to being ruled by the United State of America. It was heartbreaking to read, but it's a must-read for everybody who lives in this country. May we never forget, so that it won't happen again."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"I loved Ramona. It was the most beautiful story I have ever read. A wonderful look at California right after it came under the control of Americans. A story that has history, romance, prejudice, love, loss, and everything in between . Please read this book. I only regret that I never read it until I was in my thirties. This is Helen Hunt Jacksons masterpiece and the attention that it gave to the treatment of Indians is remarkable."},{"Title":"Ramona: A story","review":"There is no doubt that Helen Hunt Jackson's novel Ramona is a classic -- the fact that it is still in print more than 125 years after it was first published is testament to that. The novel is primarily a love story set in Old California at a time when three cultures -- Mexican, Anglo and Indian -- were colliding. Jackson's intent was to create a story (and much of the events in the book were real-life events that she wove into her tale) that would bring the plight of the Indians to the attention of the white American population. And in that she had a fair degree of success, as her book was popular and there did seem to be some shift in sentiment towards Native Americans in the wake of its publication.All that being said, Jackson's writing is undeniably weak. Although she was a successful and popular writer in her day, to the modern reader her style is overly melodramatic. All of her characters are one-sided and under-developed. Aunt Ri, who is one of the more interesting ones, unfortunately speaks in a dialogue that is practically indecipherable. Near the end of the book, when some of her speeches go on unbroken for a page or more, I had to skip them entirely because it just took more mental effort to make sense of them than I was able to muster.Ramona, the main character around whom the entire story revolves, is just the sort of heroine that Walt Disney would begin to crank out, starting with Snow White in the 1930s. Abandoned as a child, raised in a loveless home by a foster mother who bordered on cruelty and neglect, Ramona is nevertheless sweet and good and perfect in every way. Oh, and captivatingly beautiful, also (natch). She starts out perfect on page 1 and remains so all the way to the end, and inspires near-reverence in everyone who encounters her. She is a total bore.This isn't a terrible book -- as a picture of the long-lost culture of Old California it is both effective and unique (I know of no other novels set in this time period that are so well-known as Ramona). But it is definitely not all that engaging, as evidenced by how long it took me to read it. I should have easily finished the book in two or three days but it took me more than twice that long, because I just wasn't compelled to pick up the book and read it.For those who are particularly interested and intrigued in the setting of Old California at the end of the Mexican era and the dawn of the American one, I could recommend this. Just don't expect it to rock your world, and you shouldn't be too disappointed."},{"Title":"Clipperton: A History of the Island the World Forgot","review":"When I first saw Clipperton on a map of the world and I googled it for more information, I was floored to find snippets of abandonment, starvation, rape and murder, and FDR's personal interest in this tiny atoll in the eastern Pacific, and eventually led to me reading this exhaustively researched book.From many obscure sources, the author did a great job tracking the chronology of discovery, early encounters, attempted development, military history and FDR's interest in the island, and overview of fauna and flora. To me, the most striking chapter was when a group of Mexicans were abandoned on the island; the men perished trying to row for help, and the women remaining on the island were left to starve and deal with the one remaining man on the island who proclaimed himself \\"king\\" and raped several of the women.Unbelievable history for such a small, isolated rock in the middle of nowhere."},{"Title":"Clipperton: A History of the Island the World Forgot","review":"Even in the Internet age this book is the best source of historical information about this French-owned island off the coast of Mexico.

D."},{"Title":"The Biopsychosocial Approach: Past, Present, Future","review":"I think there is a lot to learn from the Biopsychosocial model. But it is perhaps most instructive regarding what's wrong with the medical establishment. It is a clear example that doctors need to be taught what just about everybody else knows intuitively.To briefly summarize the Biopsychosocial model, it states that people's overall state of health is not just a simple matter of biological cause and effect, but rather is influenced by complex interactions between factors across the spectrum from microscopic biochemical events all the way to cultural and political forces. (Wow, no kidding? It would take a brain surgeon or a rocket scientist to not know this.) Come to think of it, that wasn't a brief summary. That is actuality it in its entirety. In fact, I may even have expanded on it.It is informative about the process by which people become doctors, that self-perpetuating establishment of near-autistic, first-in-the-class-to-hand-in-the-test, anti-intellectual, hyper-competitive, over-achievers.My background was in anthropology. There is plenty to criticize about the social sciences, but I'll save that for another format. After years of study in Biological and Cultural Anthropology, I switched to medicine, and felt like I had taken a trip backwards in a time machine. It was first evident in the little things, like referring to humanity as \\"Man\\" as if it was 1950. It came up in more insidious ways, for example when discussing genetic predispositions for diseases without awareness of the concept that races do not fall in neat, discrete categories. There was a two hour course in Medical anthropology, taught from 3 to 5 PM on a Friday afternoon by a professor who probably read his last anthropology text in the early seventies. As he lamented the loss of exotic primitives, I almost expected to hear him say \\"noble savages.\\" And this was in Rochester, the home of the Biopsychosocial. The term was thrown around as often as possible in the first two years, in the classroom, and then disappeared entirely during the final two clinical years.The problem with the Biopsychosocial model, besides its obviousness and its unwieldy title, is that it has no connection to the realities of the modern practice of medicine. The only practitioners truly doing Biopsychosocial medicine are the alternative medicine practitioners, and that is precisely why their popularity is growing (it obviously has nothing to do with the efficacy of their evidence-resistant treatments). They call it a \`holistic approach,' another wet dream of a contrivance that could only be truly applied by an omniscient provider with infinite time.Anyway, I don't mean to defecate on this book. It is actually an interesting book and I recommend it. I won't pretend I read it cover to cover but many of the individual essays in it are quite readable and thoughtful at times. I've worked with some of the contributors so I don't want to get too specific, I think they're all pretty decent cats (except for one, yeah you know who you are). So go out and buy this book, learn the history of Biopsychosocial medicine, and be a wiser clinician. Or be a wiser patient.And please excuse my cynical ramblings. I promise, I'm really a Biopsychosocialist in my bleeding heart."},{"Title":"The Biopsychosocial Approach: Past, Present, Future","review":"This book is a good review of the biopsychosocial model from its followers in the University of Rochester, disciples of George Engel. The biopsychosocial concept is however, rather oversimplistic and quite flawed in many ways, although it certainly had some advantages when it became popular in the 1980s. This book does not adequately critique the model. For such critiques, readers may be interested in my book The Concepts of Psychiatry, or Paul McHugh's The Perspectives of Psychiatry. I have proposed a pluralist model which has many of the strengths of the biopsychosocial model without many of the weaknesses, as well as having a more sound conceptual basis."},{"Title":"The Biopsychosocial Approach: Past, Present, Future","review":"The idea of physicians treating \\"the whole person\\" has become a clich&eacute;, but the goal is difficult to reach. This book will bring it closer. A pivotal document in medical education, this book will inform and inspire all concerned with the quality of health care. Written to be understood even by legislators and insurance executives, the text keeps technical jargon to a minimum, so the case histories throb with human interest, not \\"vital functions.\\" Organized in four parts--Clinical Applications, Research, Education and Administration, and History and Philosophy-the book celebrates the work of Dr. George Engel (1914-1999), who formulated the biopsychosocial (BSP) model to challenge the established, more narrow biomedical approach. Engel and his followers show how the psychosocial part can be defined, researched, taught, and learned. In Rochester, New York, where this model evolved, the level of health care is above average while costs are one-third less than the national average.A distinguished group of physicians and researchers, the thirty contributors spent six years creating a unified document about the still controversial BSP approach. They present their ideas and research findings with both confidence and humility, clearly and powerfully, a real gift to patients and their families, doctors, nurses and policy makers. Philosophers, historians and generalists, too, can confront practical and theoretical aspects of the mind-body problem in contemporary society. This is a work of lasting significance, a guiding light for needed improvements in a health care system that is strong but unbalanced, advanced in technology but lagging in relationships, suffering from serious but curable ailments."},{"Title":"A Serial Killer: David Berkowitz Son of Sam/Son of Hope","review":"Worst book ever, this is a rip off!

Because of herstrong resemblance to her mother, it grieves her father to look at her; he will not even call her by her true name, Kezia, because it was her mother's name as well. And since the death of Kazy's stepmother, Eliza, a loving and cheerful woman who was the only mother Kazy ever knew, Kazy's father is filled with sorrow at the sight of his other daughter, six-year-old Beth, who resembles Eliza. He has handed the care of his daughters over to his strict and cruel sister while he immerses himself in his duties as a canon at the village cathedral. Aunt Lattimer beats the girls and denies them any simple joys and pleasures. When Beth becomes a pale, frightened shadow of her former self, Kazy decides she's had enough. She takes Beth and runs away into the countryside, hoping to reach their relatives. They must escape persuit and survive in a harsh world. But Kazy is determined for little Beth's sake.

The oldest, Kazia, decides that she is fed up with her aunt constantly scaring her 6 year old sister and in the early setting of the sun, run away. During their journey, they encounter trials, tribulations, and hardships, as Kazy-her sister's nickname for her- goes from a young girl to a young woman. She is forced to let go of her childish behaviors and adopt adult-like ones in order to let her sister and her survive.This book deserves nothing less than 5 stars because it makes, as Shakespeare once said, \\" the reader laugh, the reader cry, and the reader love.\\" This book \\"Hit's it Home\\" with the way it makes you feel for these children struggling for their God-given right to survive. It will definitely make you appreciate everything that you have been blessed with.If you enjoy this book I'd also recommend The Goddess of Yesterday, White Dove, Lily's Crossing, The Pictures of Hollis Wood, and Sirena.

He has a 25th anniversary edition of this book out, but this review is on the original. Drury is a professor at Indiana Wesleyan University and has an obviously Wesleyan view which comes out in this book. I'm definitely not Wesleyan in theology, but I found a lot of things that I can adapt to my theological prism.One good thing is that Drury ends each chapter with a Bible study and then questions. Thus, this book can be used either for individual edification or in a group setting (e.g. a Sunday School class). I will say that on one chapter, dealing with security of salvation, Drury points the reader to verses that support his view and ignores those that I use for my different approach. This is an exception: Other than that, Drury writes from a strong Biblical perspective.The strongest chapter is on stewardship. I think he hit a home run on that topic, showing how holiness relates to how we use our money, possessions, and time.This book did an effective job of driving me to a stronger Christian life. You don't have to be Wesleyan to benefit from this book, though you might find areas where you disagree.

The lead character, Tor Kelsey, is full of charm, wit, and plenty of humility -- his self-effacing ways lead one to wonder how it is he doesn't realize his own attractive nature. The romantic relationship in this book was one of the most realistic ones Mr. Francis has ever written, possibly because the two involved spend enough time together to develop a real rapport (unlike some of his other &quot;romances&quot;, where the man and woman meet and suddenly have deep feelings for one another). While &quot;The Edge&quot; is less of a mystery than other books -- we know Julius Apollo Filmer's a bad guy from the start -- the characters are incredibly well-written and the book becomes more about seeing why Filmer does what he does and how he's going to get caught. The Lorrimore family especially was very well-crafted, from the needy and petulant daughter Xanthe to screwed-up teenage son Sheridan to the &quot;money can't buy you everything&quot; father Mercer. On top of everything else, Mr. Francis captures the beauty of the Canadian Rockies and the excitement of traveling by train. I know that before I die I will have to take a train trip across Canada, and that's due to this book."},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"While Dick Francis is best known for his easy-going mysteries involving horse racing, this book can be called one of the better railroad mystery novels. It may not be in the same class as Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express, but most of the action does take place either on board a train or at a race track.Like most railroad mystery novels, the setting and details are at least partially contrived. Imagine crossing Canada on a private train known as The Great Transcontinental Mystery Race Train which transports racegoers, horse owners and their horses while making stops for horse races. Railfans will find a lot of interest here including a private car, schedules, dispatching, switching, flagging, white flags, and even rail sabotage.Our hero, Tor Kelsey from the English Jockey Club, comes on board the train in disguise to watch a British horse owner suspected of murder and extortion. Tor immediately gets involved with the crew and with train activities. Particularly noteworthy is the mystery within a mystery as actors present an on-board mystery as the train (and story) progresses.Unusual for Francis, there is also a romantic theme. Our hero meets and becomes interested in a young lady, and this also develops as the train speeds on. This novel is not a nail-biter but moves along at the typical Francis leisurely but entertaining pace. He does a masterful job of interweaving so many different themes (horse racing, railroading, sabotage, romance, and a mystery play) into one great story,"},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"An enjoyable, almost lighthearted tale which makes a very pleasant read. A good assortment of characters, and a minimum of violence. Those who have taken long train journeys will enjoy it even more. As always with Francis, the story, though interesting, is less important than his exceptional skill in telling it. This may not be his best work, but it is still far superior to most other writers of this genre."},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"The train ride in Canada, a nice different setting, with the same mystery as most of his novels.

If you think i used eh too much, well better get used to it, because there was dialogue between Tor and the conductor which would litterally go on for a page like that."},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"At this point I have 30 or so Francis novels, and though some are better than others, this was the first to truly let me down. The premise is wonderful, but really goes nowhere, and soon the novel is awash with unintresting bit players whos outlines are very vague. The protaginist, Tor Kelsy, is intresting at first, but he to becomes leaden and unintresting for much of the novel. I would have given this title even less than 3 stars had the concept not been so fresh, and the burgeoning romance between Tor and his leading lady not been so touching. A mystery set on a train, given that the story must fit a certain schedule, should race along. This novel starts fast, then becomes mired in boing and unreal plot developments. If you are an ardent Francis fan, then you need this for your collection. If lookong for a mystery as a passing fancy, Mr.Francis has 40 or so better novels to help pass your time"},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"You don't have to love horse racing to love Dick Francis' books! His mysteries are meticulously researched and fascinating in his creation of characters. I read and re-read them so often, I put them on my Kindle Fire so they don't get worn out and falling to pieces. The same goes for &#34;Longshot&#34; and any others you might care to try. His books are a treat, don't miss them."},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"Very good late Dick Francis Novel.

Another great book by Francis."},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"I loved his book Under Orders, so thought I would give this a try. It is very slow and easily loses my interest."},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"As always the Dick Francis novels have very individual plots and characters, unrelated to the other novels. The writing and story lines are skillful, with the only constant being--there are always horses in the background.. Even though these stories are rather out of date, they never are boring and always provide a pleasant reading experience. As usual, this cross-country train ride from Toronto to Vancouver is exciting and satisfying."},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"pleased with the book I order that was shipped to my house in the appropriate amount of time in this year of our Lord"},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"Dick Francis is one of my favorite authors, and this book in particular is one of his best. He has great characters you can get behind, just enough humor, suspense and always a satisfying ending. If you like Dick Francis, don't miss this one. And if you've never read him, this is a great book to start with."},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"If there is anyone in the world who's a bigger Dick Francis fan than I am, I'd love to meet him/her. I've been reading (and re-reading, and re-reading) Dick Francis books since 1983, with the greatest of pleasure. As a writer myself, I've learned so much about story construction, character development, and using simple language to make a dramatic point, all from reading Dick Francis novels. A glorious education.THE EDGE, to me, is the very best. I've loved it since the day I got it in the mail from a book club and put it on my night table, and then idly opened it at bedtime, just to read a few pages. Didn't stop till I finished the book, around 5 in the morning. And I've re-read it dozens of times since. There is a plentitude of wisdom in these pages that somehow strikes right at your heart.Tor's boss, who tells him, \\"Thought before action -- if there's time\\". The mystery troupe who does Tor's version of HAMLET to open the eyes of the guests on the mystery train. The wealthy father trying to conceal the crimes of his disturbed son. The very bad guy who sets off an even badder guy, who has a bloodlust to derail and destroy the train. And Tor himself, who works for a living, because the ridiculous amount of money his family has left him, he knows could destroy him. Life lessons, all.The colorful descriptions of Canadian Rockies (I've got that on my list of dream vacations!), the usual Dick Francis horse races that are heart-stopping and lead inexorably to the next plot point, the marvelously sketched characters -- I love them all.I'm crazy about all of Dick Francis's novels -- but THE EDGE has a very special place in my heart. Try it. You might feel exactly the same way."},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"This is a different Dick Francis, as the action takes place almost entirely in a train trundling around in the Canadian Rockies. The writing is perfect, as always, and the setting is comparable with Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express, which I like, but The Edge is a better read. I lost the book three times, and bought a new one each time. The fourth is still with me, and I read it from cover to cover now and then, it is such a good read. I would think anyone who reads it would make a trip sooner rather than later to Banff and Lake Louise in the Canadian Rockies. As usual the hero is understated, self-effacing, and well-behaved in an old-fashioned sort of way. The romance develops almost insidiously as is the case in the best Dick Francis tradition. It is a treat to watch it evolve, and the ease with which the setting is sketched out, the characters delineated, and the plot developed, make it a true Dick Francis classic. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"How does Dick Francis manage time and time again, to give us such a likeable hero, faced with such impossible odds - and a story that grips us tightly from beginning to end?This time the hero, Tor Kelsey, is a young man who has a job with the British Jockey Club's security organization as their eyes and ears. He wanders around racetracks undercover, unremarkably dressed, unnoticed by all, but himself taking note whenever something's not right. A sweet old lady who acts as his telephone messenger for a while calls Tor \\"the invisible man.\\"Ironically Tor Kelsey is independently wealthy and doesn't need to work at all. He works to save himself from the emotional diseases of the rich. And for the fun of it.Finally Tor has an assignment that puts him head-to-head with the ultimate bad guy in the racing world. Julius Filmer finds ways to coerce people to sell or give him wonderful horses that they would not normally part with. But the Jockey Club can't prove anything against him because Filmer also has a genius for intimidating witnesses.And so Tor is sent on a train ride across Canada that's been designed to promote Canadian racing. The train is full of rich people who own racehorses, including Filmer, and their best horses are also on board. Horses and owners will be stopping at racetracks in different cities to compete, and in between races it's a non-stop party, with a mystery play thrown in to keep the passengers entertained.Disguised as an invisible waiter, Tor has one risky adventure after another trying to keep the train on track. One of his adventures is purely romantic.This is a thoroughly enjoyable novel, right up there with the best of Dick Francis."},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"I found this a slow read, but worthwhile or I would have given it up.The details in the book are very complete, so that you almost feel that you are on the train with the detective.Somehow the punishment of the villain seems to be less than the crimeinvolved deserved? The description of how the detective makeshimself blend with the background in an unremarkable way is very good as well. I enjoyed the book, but not enough to give it high marks."},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"I forget how good Dick Francis mystery's are. This was a great plot. Tor Kelsey works for the British Jockey Club and is asked to take a Transcontinental Canadian Train from Toronto to Vancouver with a bunch of horses, their owners, their grooms and a mystery tour. Disguised as a waiter, Kelsey is watching a villain the Club has been trying to catch for years. Julious Appollo Filmer is suspected of murder but it was never proven. So Kelsey is trying to catch him in an act of law breaking so he can be banished from racing forever. What he doesn't know is, he will actually enjoy the ride himself, even if he is a lowly waiter. I was given a Dick Francis book by my Aunt because she knew I liked horses. And yes, Francis's books are loaded with information on horses. But the mystery in these books are some of the best. It's been a while since I have engaged in a Dick Francis mystery. After reading this, it has me anxious to get lost in another."},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"This Francis novel combines racehorses with a Canadian rail excursion. If you love trains, this is the Francis novel for you. While the hero, Tor Kelsey is trying to outthink a villain, the race train riders are having a murder mystery enacted by professional actors. But who are the actors and who are the real villains? Take this thrilling ride to find out."},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"This is an easier read than most of Francis' works.

I think you'll like it if you suspend your \\"serious\\" reader side for a bit!"},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"I'll admit I had some trouble getting into it, but after the first few chapters I loved the book. I was unsure what I would think at first. I'd never read anything by Dick Francis before and I knew nothing about racing, but Francis fit a wonderful plot into this book."},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"I enjoyed this one more than any other Francis I've read. The horses are not the focus this time, but the romance and suspense of a train ride make for a terrific mystery setting. As always, the lead character is immensely likeable."},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"If you ever wanted to know what it's like as an undercover operative, this is an excellent example. The main charactor is very convincing in both his means and his methods. That's all. Just give it try and see if you agree."},{"Title":"The Edge","review":"For years, Dick Francis provided consistent, fast-paced, and fun mysteries set against the backdrop of horse-racing. My first exposure to his work was \\"Whip Hand,\\" and \\"Twice Shy\\" and \\"Reflex\\" hooked me. I've since read most of his books, but somehow missed out on \\"The Edge.\\"Francis, typically, explored a different hobby, talent, or industry in each book, setting his characters in England. In this novel, though, he takes his rich, single protagonist, Tor Kelsey, across Canada on a train. Tor is keeping an eye on an infamous figure in the racing world, ready to stop any criminal escapades, while disguising himself as a waiter on the train. Along the way, he flirts with danger, romance, and the power struggles of the racing world. The story starts slower than normal for a Francis mystery, piling on characters and backgrounds before gathering them all on the train (around page 90) and letting the real adventure begin. Even then, the next 200 pages spend more time teasing us than giving much action. The plot unwinds slowly, using the clunky devise of a murder-mystery acting troupe on board to shine some light, eventually, on the true criminals on board.I love that Francis tried something different here, though it had more promise than delivery. Tor is one of the flatter protagonists in Francis bibliography, and the fantastic settings of Canada are often ignored or quickly touched upon, where I had hoped for that sense of \\"having been there.\\" This train ride seems to drag, and some of the plot points are convoluted and unnecessary (such as the waiter vs. the millionaire disguise). The saving factor, for me, is the strong climax on the western side of Canada, during which some confrontations and revelations finally play out for those who are patient enough to get that far--and I, frankly, almost stopped much earlier on, which I've never even considered before with Francis.If you're a big fan, as I am, you'll enjoy this unique from the mystery grandmaster. If you're looking for his best work, though, I would go back to some of the earlier books for a true sense of the vitality and energy he brought to the genre."},{"Title":"The Waite Group's Master C/Book and 4 Disks","review":"When this gem came out in 1990, it was a Heaven-sent miracle for me.

This now out-of-print book from 1986 is one of the most important resources on Xenakis in English.It is a biography, but the focus is on his music and architecture, not his personal life. For me, the most valuable part of the book is the extensive coverage of his participation and leadership in the Resistance from 1941-1945 (19-30). This heroic movement against foreign occupation and fascism culminated in tragegy when the British demanded the surrrender of the Communist-led forces, which according to Xenakis had the support of 70% of the population, and the EAM and ELAS capitulated, leading to right-wing rule in Greece until the generals were removed from power in 1974. There is a great photo of Xenakis in Athens in 1974 upon his long-delayed return from a 27-year exile (229). The book includes several other black-and-white photos and drawings, including Xenakis with his wife and daughter (231), Xenakis at Persepolis in Iran (217), and Xenakis in the front row of a march in Athens on March 25, 1942 protesting the German occupation (21).This may be the single best book on Xenakis in English, butHarley'sis the most comprehensive on Xenakis's music,Conversations With Iannis Xenakismakes great reading, and then there is Xenakis's ownFormalized Music: Thought and Mathematics in Composition (Harmonologia Series, No 6), which is of course indispensable.Matossian does a good job of presenting context for understanding Xenakis's music, while lacking the ability to go into as much depth into the theory and construction of the compositions as Harley or Xenakis himself.(verified library loan)"},{"Title":"Xenakis","review":"Matossian knew the Xenakis family,and she gleaned considerable insights into Xenakis,the architect and composer. She traverses his life in work up to the middle Eighties,his life in Paris, the time of working for Le Corbusier.There are short yet comprehensive chapters hitting all the relavent points in his oeuvre. The early theories on stochastic music an alternative to the moribund state of serial 12-Tone thinking,also polytopes,a visual work with lasers. Xenakis had actually thought of a graphic representation utilizing lasers to beam across the earth,so if extraterrestial life exists it would have an image of us. She also discusses his theatre music,ones returning to Greece after the demise of the junta in the summer of 1974. This ended twenty years of exile,and also a Light and Sound Commission for the Shiraz Festival in Iran in August 1971, a sight on the ruins at Persepolis.. There is also a marvelous section on the theories of arborescences or &quot;branching&quot; ideas that Xenakis had sought parallels to the sonic world in terms of pitch-time. The profundity here is that the theories surrounding Xenakis and his music are seldom discussed in such a straightforward,lucid manner. Ususally if you read Xenakis himself,these theories are accompanied by high math items.Matossian has found a nice balance here in analysis of the music&quot;Nomos Alpha&quot; for violoncello&quot; and &quot;evryali&quot; for piano solo,two great examples, with excerpts and the science oriented theories that acompany it that Xenakis had discovered."},{"Title":"The On-Line Bible","review":"I have been using this software for the last three years.

Since then I have become a fan.&quot;Lights Out&quot; is typical of Abrahams' free flowing easy to read style and the length of this book, and infact most of his books, allow for a good 5 to 6 hour read.The juxtaposition of past and present in this novel is handled immaculately and the ending, although surprising, isn't so difficult to rationalize.The character of Eddie Nye is well created, gets the reader's sympathy, and I could imagine a movie of this book with the lead being played by one of our better young actors.

Eddie Nye - a man released from prison after serving 15 years for a crime he didn't commit - is a sympathetic and easy character to root for. His efforts to reconnect with his family and uncover the truth about the events that led to his being sent to prison drive the story line and keep the reader turning the pages. Many of the story's twists and surprises will be seen coming by most readers. Eddie's inability to see some twists coming makes him less likable.

Fundamental concepts of Bioinformatics are well explained."},{"Title":"Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics","review":"Unlike the previous review, I found the user perspective, rather than the mathematical perspective refreshing. I have been teaching bioinformatics to CS students for several years and all too often the students are great at algorithms and theory but do not understand the user they are designing for. This book teaches just that -- how to use bioinformatics from a user or researcher's viewpoint. Medical students and biologists will find it useful for direct applicability to their work, but I also reccomend it for bioinformatics students who need to complement their theoretical background with practical use. All too often, CS students of bioinformatics can design a great database with powerful access tools, but with a horrible interface because they don't have this perspective.Now, for the book itself. It is easy to read and covers all aspects of bioinformatics from a sequence perspective (information retrieval, BLAST, gene expression and microarrays, proteomics and protein bioinformatics, genomes and disease). The coverage of databases and URLs is thourough and the text is easy to read, yet useful. The book is comprehensive with one area seemingly missing -- it would have been useful to include a chapter on systems biology and/or cellular modeling and the tools available (i.e. E-Cell). The book is especially useful to a researcher who is trying to explore all aspects of a particular gene, protein, disease, or pathway using bioinformatics tools.The book is in stark contrast to the other Pevser (that is Pevzner) who wrote a bioinformatics book that surveyed algorithm theory underlying bioinformatics.This book is also useful for less technical professionals in industry -- the managers, lawyers and venture capitalists that pervade the biotech landscape all need to communicate effectively and they can surely learn that here, provided they have some background in cell biology first."},{"Title":"Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics","review":"I spent a lot of time looking for a bioinformatics text book that focuses on sequence analysis for a course I'm teaching.

Pevsner's book is laid out in a logical fashion and is designed to teach the molecular biology types the underlying principles of bioinformatics. It discusses pairwise alignments, substitution matrices, multiple sequence alignments, profiles, position-specific scoring matrices and phylogenetic trees with a good amount of detail. There's also a chapter on microarray analysis, but to get into that deeply I recommend Draghici's book.The 2nd half of the book discusses the genome organization and evolution of a variety of organisms (viruses, bacteria, eukaryotes, human), and was great for bringing me up to date on these topics.I strongly recommend this as a textbook for undergraduate or graduate students learning bioinformatics."},{"Title":"Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics","review":"This book is great and give me a lot of information in bioinformatics and genomic tools.

Once again the author has used the familiar story, this time of the kitchen squire who must prove himself by the quest of the scornful lady. Very different once more, the bare bones are merely present.Gareth has immersed himself in youthful, male troubles through his service to Lancelot and must prove his worth. Lynet has travelled from Queen Guinevere's land of Cambryn to plead with her to send aid in its dire need. Morgaine the evil shadow of the past two tales is once again at the bottom of this fresh threat to the kingdom.Lynet herself is in similar straits to Gareth, having made youthful errors of judgement involving King Mark of Cornwall, his wife Isuelt and Tristan. Shunned and shamed by this past, she now has only her family and their stewardship of Cambryn. Her sister and brother are enmeshed in the ancient magics of the land and sea, and she too is in danger from this heritage.Love and magic, terrible bargains and heart-breaking betrayals are all woven into the threads convincingly. A tense and rivetting story once again is unfolded. Well written and a page turner.I eagerly await the fourth instalment.Except that I understand that Luna, the Harlequin imprint publisher, has terminated Zettel's contract and book four is no more. This leaves a nasty taste for any reader. Dishonourable behaviour.However, I understand the book is still to be published in Australia later this year. Thank goodness."},{"Title":"Under Camelot's Banner","review":"Sarah Zettel continues her story of Camelot. Lynet is the youngest daughter of Chief Kenan of Cambryn, and when her father is killed by the oldest son, she must convince Queen Guinevere to return to her homeland and restore the public's trust in Camelot and Arthur. Morgaine threatens them every moment of the journey, stirring anger, distrust, and lust among Lynet's remaining kin and traveling companions.The story is wonderfully written (as are most of Zettel's novels), but Lynet is a weak heroine who never truly steps up to lead the fight. Other than convincing Guinevere to return to Cambryn, she does not accomplish much throughout the book. She spends a great deal of time using a spirit-filled mirror to affect minor changes in other characters, but instead of becoming one of her greatest strengths, this becomes an addiction for her. I felt more sympathy for her as a spirit-drug addict than compassion for her as a strong protagonist.Overall, this is a fun installment to Zettel's Camelot series, but it is not the best of the three. Hopefully the next heroine will have the strength to inspire both her fellow comrades-in-arms as well the reader."},{"Title":"Under Camelot's Banner","review":"Cambryn has no protection as the absent Queen Guinevere spends all her time in Camelot with her husband King Arthur. King Mark of Tintagel has gone mad after being cuckold by his Queen Iseult and Sir Tristan. Guinevere's steward Lord Kenan has gone to Mark with many of his soldiers to plead for protection. Kenan's son Colam plots to overthrow his father and ends up killing him. His sister Laurel declares Colam is an outlaw, which sends him to Morgaine for safety, but she bewitches him to use as a pawn against her sister Guinevere.Laurel's sister Lynet travels to Camelot to plead with Guinevere to bring her knights and men-at arms to keep her people safe from her lethal sibling Morgaine and their mortal enemies like the people of Eire and the Saxons. Lynet has with her a magical silver mirror, given to her sister by their mother, a sea spirit who took mortal form to marry Kenan. Guinevere agrees to return to Cambryn while Lynet sees through the mirror the deadly schemes Morgaine has put in motion with Colam her slave, Laurel the first target and Lynet not far behind unless Lancelot's squire Gareth can save his beloved.Sarah Zettel puts her own spin to Camelot using a more manipulative and not so pure Guinevere as a key player in her take on the legend. Lynet, filled with guilt for her role in the Iseult-Tristan affair, vows to do whatever it takes to save her homeland from those who covet it as a personal playground. UNDER CAMELOT'S BANNER is high fantasy at its best making readers wonder how Laurel's tale will hold up against Lynet's saga.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Under Camelot's Banner","review":"This is the third installment in Sarah Zettel's Arthurian series. In this story Lynet, a daughter of the steward in Cambryn is caught up in tumultuous times. Her brother murders their father and her sister sends her to Camelot to bring home Queen Guinevere to settle the neglect of King Mark and the unrest of the people.Things never are easy for Lynet, however, she is given a special gift from her sister which allows her to observe if not alter events in their home while she is on her journey to Camelot. After arriving at Camelot she finds she doesn't entirely trust Queen Guinevere but eventually discovers a trusting and eventual love interest, Gareth, squire of Lancelot. Meanwhile, back in Cambryn, Morgaine literally uses magic for evil ends to obtain her goals. It's a constant race against time and evil and Gareth and Lynet must find a way and soon to bring Queen Guinevere to Cambryn and King Mark to make everything right again.I enjoyed this tale very much; however, at times Lynet's addiction to the gift her sister has given her becomes tedious.

She has developed a philosophy of the arts called 'consilience' based on her Darwinian (biosocial) perspective which unifies biological and cultural viewpoints. The chapters cover her theory of mother/infant mutuality, the need to belong to a group, finding meaning, hands-on competence (making things), and elaboration (making special) as they pertain to the evolution of the arts in human development. My concern is mainly focussed on her ideas of a 'Naturalistic Aesthetics' found in the appendix. She aims to emcompass all the arts (music, dance, drama, visual arts) in developing criteria for assigning aesthetic quality to the artistic process (or is it product??) but fails to convince me that these criteria span all of the arts. For instance, the criteria 'strikingness' is something I would attribute to visual arts but certainly not music where the visual component is not a sense priority. She rightly claims that the meaning of aesthetics is currently fraught with ambiguity in its association with the definition of 'beauty'. Beauty, to me, is highly subjective and not necessarily a universal characteristic amongst all cultural groups. I feel until 'aesthetics' is properly redefined (possibly as 'the power to communicate emotion and value systems') we as arts educators looking for philosophies to give us direction, will continue to beat down the wrong garden path. I can only hope that Dissanayake will receive enough constructive feedback from scholars of other arts disciplines so that she can round out her philosophical viewpoint."},{"Title":"Art and Intimacy: How the Arts Began (McLellan Books)","review":"I have been trying for some time to write a review of this book.

Nobody can look at those babies in Chapter 1 without smiling, thus proving Dissanayake's points. My particular favorite is the little girl in Sudan absorbed in her drawing (p197).

Democracy for Dewey was both a means and an end to the building of a good and just society. In this regard he sought to develop strategies and methods for training students through learning and discipline to become socially responsible adults and conscientious citizens concerned with the rights of others and the common good and to be equipped with the knowledge and technical skills to be productive members of society in the context of our modern industrial world. Dewey is truly a giant not only of modern educational theory but of progressive humanitarian thought generally. Those who disparage him in a knee jerk fashion out of a misguided effort to trash the &quot;liberal establishment,&quot; like the Intercollegiate Scholastic Insititute (ISI) which named &quot;Democracy and Education&quot; as one of the five worst books of the 20th Century, have radically misconstrued Dewey's views which merit serious study and application in practice.

The ideas are fresh, original, and beautiful crafted and ordered; (3) \\"Education is Socialization\\" - an equation of broadly construed \\"-tions\\" that results in a statement that one can neither agree nor disagree with.I could be wrong, but nowhere did I read these ideas as explicit recommendations to be implemented, rather I read this book as a general exploration of educational aims and processes. Dewey (justifiably in my opinion) explores closely connected concepts which I imagine are left out of other educational texts, which is why some with pre-professional backgrounds in education count the length and depth of this book as a negative.His writing, in my opinion, is clear and concise (at least in comparison with other great philosophers) - writing that I would personally aspire to. His ideas, and I can't say this enough, are some of the most original I've come across. We didn't really cover the pragmatists in any of my philosophy classes.

I could read this book several more times and still not comprehend the full import of Dewey's work. This is not merely a book about education, but rather a complete philosophy of education which, of necessity, is a philosophy of individual life in the social world. Like any good philosopher, Dewey builds his argument brick by brick, each brick resting squarely on the bricks beneath it. One cannot fully comprehend and appreciate the entire structure until one has examined each brick in the composition and the logical relationship among the bricks. By necessity, a brief review of a work such as this will leave out many bricks and breeze over the connections from brick to brick. Any inaccuracies thus resulting are my own and not Dewey's failure to construct a solid argument.To the extent this book can be summed up, the overriding theme is that much confusion and debate regarding education (and, indeed, much of life), stem from false dualisms, such as the dichotomy between thinking and doing, mind and body, individual and society. Once we recognize that those dualisms are in fact simply interacting forces which shape individual experience and development, the aims, role, materials and methods of education become almost self-evident.Dewey begins his argument with an exploration of early childhood. From earliest days, all learning is experience, and all experience is learning. The infant must learn how to control his body simply by moving his body and adjusting to the reactions and feedback thereto. Such reactions inform future movements and so on, in an on-going interchange of influences which eventually lead to the mastery of skills such as sitting up, standing and walking, which are just as much mental feats as they are physical. Similarly, speech is learned through the interaction of the infant's own natural noises and the sounds she hears in her environment, particularly the sounds reflected back to her by other people. Hence, the infant is part of a social world from day one, and, like the material world, she both shapes and is shaped by such social world.By nature, humans are endowed with interests and aptitudes which draw them to certain experiences and stimuli which, if properly guided and allowed to progress naturally, result in each individual developing and contributing in rich, organic and meaningful ways in his or her unique capacity. But because of our false dichotomy between thinking and doing, we tend to isolate education either toward focusing on tasks and occupations or toward thinking, reasoning and \\"cultural\\" pursuits. This leads to a multi-tiered society in which the majority are consigned to labor at tasks considered menial and bereft of culture, while the \\"superior\\" class of people lead an idle life - supported by the laboring class - devoted to preserving the intellectual and cultural life. But because this intellectual life is disconnected from meaningful activity, it too is dry and devoid of rich experience. Hence, the upper classes and lower classes both suffer from such divisions, even if the upper classes are not fully aware of or able to grasp the cause of their affliction.Furthermore, while this split can work in a hierarchical, feudal society, it is incompatible with the ideals of democracy, in which each individual should be contributing his or her unique talents and interests toward his or her own development and the governance and progress of the whole. In a dualistic society where the majority of individuals are cut off from a true connection with the meaning and results of their occupations, there will naturally be many who can/will not contribute and instead will be a drain.Contrary to the frequent misunderstanding of progressive educational theory, Dewey does not advocate doing away with formal instruction or letting children simply do what they like. It's not that easy. It's a matter of structuring the educational environment so that students have experiences that relate to their prior experiences and to their experiences and interests outside the classroom and which spark new interests and associations. Through rich exposure, students are guided to explore and develop meaningful understanding which preserves the connections between thinking and doing and which cuts across and integrates material from various disciplines into a holistic understanding. You can't simply stuff a bunch of disconnected facts (what we commonly view as \\"knowledge\\" - the accumulated repository of past, settled experience) into a child's head and expect it to spark interest or pursuit. Rather, you start with the pursuit of relevant experience and the facts and knowledge will follow. As students integrate their own experience, they will want to know - and be in a position to understand - other people's related experience. Without such integration, there is no framework for such \\"knowledge\\".Furthermore, you can't teach \\"morals\\" as a distinct set of facts, rules or thoughts. Doing so implies a superior class which dictates to a lower class. Such dictates and morals only \\"stick\\" to the extent they are externally enforced because they are not truly part of the individual's self. Morals, like all other knowledge, must be learned through experience in the normal social environment. Again, the social environment must be structured to lead to desired behavior and understanding through experiencing consequences in a democratic environment.Sadly, our society seems to be turning ever further away from Dewey's ideals of full individual contribution in democratic life. At younger and younger ages, we are trying to stuff students full of facts and knowledge isolated from their relevant experience so that they can regurgitate this material on standardized tests which benefit not the child, but the adults enforcing such tests. This leads to students perceiving education as largely a dry and meaningless exercise to perform for the benefit of pleasing adults rather than for any intrinsic benefit. Furthermore, morals or \\"character\\" are being drilled into students as a collection of catch phrases of the \\"work hard, be nice\\" variety. Students are expected to comply unquestioningly with almost arbitrary rules regarding the minutiae of behavior, speech and dress with little understanding of the whys and wherefores of such requirements. These students are not being raised to be independently thinking members of a democratic society, but rather a compliant workforce for the world's corporate conglomerations. Interestingly, the heads of these conglomerations and governments tend to send their own kids to progressively oriented schools based on Dewey's theories. Again, we are cultivating a ruling class atop a laboring class, which is the antithesis of democracy.One jarring aspect of Dewey's writing to modern readers may be his descriptions and understanding of \\"primitive\\" or \\"savage\\" peoples. Such thinking is a product of Dewey's time when little thought was given to the different perspectives and paradigms of indigenous peoples and how such differences mask complexities in seemingly \\"simple\\" societies. However, even in the modern world, we still seem unable to bridge cultural gaps, and we still reduce societies alien to our own to simple caricatures. Every terrorist attack or outbreak of gang violence is simply evidence that \\"they\\" don't think or care about life the way \\"we\\" do. The possibility that their \\"savage\\" behavior might have something to do with our own relationship with them rarely occurs to us.This book is one of the seminal texts of modern thought and the \\"American Dream\\". It is not only a book on education (although it is that and should be required reading for every educator), but also a treatise on the roles and responsibilities of individuals in a democratic society and how best to prepare individuals to take on those roles and responsibilities. We have steadily - and silently - been losing our democracy over the past several decades as our public interests are sold off to private, moneyed interests which have profit, rather than societal benefit, as their motive. The fabric of our shared social interests is being rent, and individuals are being set against each other in pursuit of individual interests. But, as Dewey demonstrates, there aren't really individual interests separate from social interests. We are all intrinsically and inseparably related and dependent on each other.

Dewey as a writer might sometimes make us feel like kindergartners being lectured on mostly what we already know, but that's our fault, not necessarily his. His patience in building complex concepts from the actual basics is unparallelled, but he depends on the reader to retain in mind the outlines, to sort the key ideas from the supporting arguments, and to sketch the diagrams: for better or worse, there are no math-like formulae here. But his sense of those real basics--the respect he pays to everyday experience itself, that Cinderella stepchild of modern philosophy, is worth the effort it takes to follow him out.

These things are very vital in an educational system. This book displays all these characterisitcs.

This one is even better than &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles.&quot; You must read it."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy is a compelling and intriguing novel. Instead of most conventional novels that rely on plot, it places its emphasis on getting certain points and ideas across to the reader. It is a book meant to make the reader think, not as a leisurely Sunday afternoon story. The story takes us through a series of tragic events, starting first, in contrast, with Jude as a young child full of hopes and dreams, the primary dream being to go to Christminster to become a learned fellow. We follow his life as he marries Arabella, a woman who fakes a pregnancy to get Jude to marry her. Because their marriage does not have the foundation of love, it quickly crumbles and Arabella leaves Jude to go to Australia.Jude then decides to follow his old dreams and travels to Christminster, only to find it was little like what he had imagined. There he falls in love with his cousin Sue, who in order to spite Jude, marries the schoolmaster Phillotson. She despises their marriage, and soon asks her new husband to let her leave. After much contemplation, he consents, and Sue runs off with Jude. The two start a life together with Jude worshiping Sue and Sue constantly pushing Jude away. They will not commit to marriage, and live a life together looked down upon by all of society. After a while, they get a surprise from Arabella, saying she has a son that belongs to Jude, and that he will be coming to live with them. Father Time, as he was nicknamed, comes to live with them. He is a very depressed young soul, burdened by things way beyond his years. Sue and Jude have two more children out of wedlock, and constantly move from town to town to get away from the jeers of society.Just as things are starting to look up, as Sue seems to finally love Jude, Father Time decides to take things into his own hands and hangs himself as well as the other two children. Sue, being unable to cope with the situation, leaves Jude and goes back to Phillotson, saying it is her duty. Jude, left alone, is then visited by the vivacious Arabella, who gets him drunk so he will consent to re-marry her. Their marriage, however, is simply one huge lie, and Jude, from depression and a loss of hope, becomes sick and finally dies in his misery.The main topics looked at by Hardy seem to be about goals and marriage. Hardy clearly defines Jude's many goals, for instance his pursuit of knowledge and his pursuit to win the love of Sue, but just as St. Jude, the saint of hopeless causes, Jude is never able to achieve them. The idea seems to conclude that no matter what your goals are, you will never be able to attain them. This is a depressing thought, and though it may be true for some people, I believe it does not clearly express the true things that happen in people's lives. Most people, if they have a goal in sight, do achieve their goals, bringing themselves happiness.Marriage is clearly looked down upon in this book. Hardy shows marriage between both Sue and Phillotson as well as Jude and Arabella as a trap of unhappiness. He then contrasts that unhappiness with the life of \\"true\\" happiness that Jude and Sue had together, out of wedlock. This idea, in my opinion, is absolutely false. Marriage is meant to be the union of two people who love each other so much that they are willing to commit their entire lives to each other. It is meant as a means for happiness and love to blossom. Hardy's demented idea of marriage is clearly false.Even though some of the philosophies in this book tend to be skewed, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It made me think on an entirely different level. I could sympathize Jude's pain, and though it may not be a leisurely novel, it is a classic that I recommend any educated person should study."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"When I first read this book, all I could think was &quot;Oh my God. Another tragedy!&quot; I've come to the conclusion after reading this, 'The Mayor of Casterbridge' and 'Tess of the D'Burvilles', that Hardy must have either hated life, hated women, or both. However, my appreciation of this book has risen slightly since I have had to study it within the context of the ideologies it represents. (I am currently doing a unit on Victorian Ideologies at the best uni in Western Australia.) This still doesn't make the tragic ending any less horrific and unsatisfying and frustrating and just plain awful!!! Thinking about it now makes me cry! I couldn't cry when I was reading it because I was so mad! But in retrospect, how sad. Please take my advice and DO NOT read this book if you're feeling depressed! But for an insight into the ideologies that trapped both men and women of the Victorian era, 'Jude The Obscure' is certainly well worth a read."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I liked Tess of the D'Urbervilles a lot. I could not finish Jude the Obscure--not just because it was sad and tragic. I mean after awhile I got tired of reading about and feeling sorry for Jude and Sue who make most of their problems for themselves and then whine about them. I would describe this book as &quot;agonizing.&quot; And not nearly as good as Hardy's other books that I have read. It is true that I was not able to finish the book (I got about half way through) so this may discredit my evaluation."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"One hates to start a book review with a commentary on his other reviewers....but, in this case, one has no choice: Will you AP English students who haven't even had a chance to take the class yet please cease your activities. I just finished reading too many reviews that sounded like Keanu Reeves monotoning, &quot;Yo man, like,this book was a total downer. Go catch some waves instead.&quot; But, as they say, it's a free country and, if you want to make fools of yourselves, who am I really to stand in your way?Hardy was a great lover of the poet Shelley. In fact, after Jude the obscure, he devoted the rest of his life to writing poetry based on his poetic model. In this book there are so many references (for those familiar with Shelley's poem Epipsychidion), and even one whole page particularly referencing the poem by name and giving quotes from it, that I was astounded that nobody even mentioned it. I just figured that it was you numbskull AP students again (sorry, guys, hang in there), but then I thought back to MY AP teacher and reconsidered. Even she would not have picked up on it. &quot;Epipsychidion,&quot; in Greek, means &quot;soulmate.&quot; It was one of Shelley's last poems before he committed suicide by drowning at the age of 30. I could cite several examples of it in Hardy's novel, but the last few paragraphs of the fifth section of the &quot;At Shaston&quot; chapter where the poem is mentioned by name and several lines from it are quoted will suffice. This book is really Shelley's poem in novelistic form. As such, it is to be praised mightily. &quot;Epipsychidion&quot; is essentially the story (though the narrative breaks down in parts) of the poet seeking his heavenly vision of love here on terra firma: To find that vision in Earthly form. What greater meaning on Earth is there (Shelley and Hardy would ask)? There are moments (fleeting) when Jude and his new love do seem to achieve this happiness envied by the gods. But all too soon they are thrown into despair, their dreams lieing in tatters around them, shattered by the conventions and prejudices of the world. Shelley's poem was never finished. His drowning of himself got in the way.....So what are we to gather from all this failed love, cruelty, murder,suicide and misery....THIS, that the world is a terribly unkind place for intellectual visionaries. They are the best and the brightest among us and their visions are REAL, the most beautiful things we can experience. But their attempts to implement them repeatedly result in cruel failure. The Judes of this world will never be successes, more often miserable failures....But in other worlds?..."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure, by Thomas Hardy, shows that to follow the social and religious pressures of the world only brings sorrow and misery. This theme is proven by the misinterpreted religious acts of Sue, the lack of morals in Arabella, and social pressures that keep everyone from happiness. The story focuses on the life of Jude Fawley, a poor dreamer. He is unlucky to find himself, at an early age, in the care of his embittered aunt: who does not encourage or help him to hope for a brighter future. His dream, ever since he was eleven, is to go to the town of Christminster and study among the intelligent and fantastic scholars, however this dream is never found because of the mistakes and obscure actions that Jude, or those around him, take to follow the social norms.Throughout the book, Jude rarely loses his dream of being educated at Christminster, but because of obstacles along the way he finds himself more unhappy than before, and worse off. His dream is first detoured because of the untimely \\"courtship\\" with Arabella. Although Jude had no intention of remaining with Arabella, he would not let his honor, or his social faade, be ruined by not marrying a woman who carried his baby. Since the first day of their marriage, Jude regrets having been succumbed to the pressures of society. The legal action of marriage, which is forced by social pressures, only caused misery in Jude's life. He was unable to go to Christminster, and once he met Sue, the relationship was severely delayed because he felt he must be loyal to Arabella. Arabella, on the other hand, did not live according to social pressures. Although she married Jude, she left him quickly for Australia where she seemed to be content. She had another husband in Australia and no doubt other \\"one-night stands\\" with other men that she was able to seduce or get intoxicated. But, because she had the courage (or stupidity) to disregard the society's negative opinion on a woman being disloyal to a husband she was able to live freely. Even in the end of the novel, after she realizes Jude is dead, she goes to the boat races-disregarding what a normal member of society would have done. Although her actions are not moral or virtuous, she is able to live the life of her own choosing because she does not take to the extreme religion, social pressures, or moral obligations that others do.On the other hand there is Sue. Sue through parts of the book is able to receive full happiness by ignoring social and religious pressures, but still living a virtuous and moral life. In the eyes of society, one must be legally married to engage in intercourse, but because of Sue's fear of marriage her and Jude only take on the appearance of marriage. During this time she had happy times with Jude and the children; but as soon as she would start to think about \\"right\\" in the terms of others she would become upset. Whenever Jude and Sue attempted to get married, a socially pressured action, Sue would become upset and emotional. And as soon as her children died she became frenzied and looked to strict religion as the answer to her problem. If anything in her life went \\"wrong\\" from there on out it she believed it was her duty to suffer for the cause of religion. After not accepting religion for awhile, she became the complete opposite and punished herself by marrying and having intercourse with Phillotson. Her emotions against herself and her new belief that she needed to live a strict religious life, full of pious actions only cause her sadness. She was held back from love and made miserable by the pressures of society and religion that were around her.Between these two women, the burdens of society, and the standards of the church-going world Jude was trapped. While he studied and dreamed of going to Christminster he was laughed at by the world around him because they all knew that a poor low-class man would never be allowed or able to attend there. From the beginning there was no hope for him to become an educated man because of his place in the society. The people around him and the rules that created the society kept all the people in the level of society that they already inhabited. Then because of Jude's relations with Arabella, he was forced, by society pressures to marry her-crushing his dream of going to Christminster. Although Arabella eventually leaves, he is still linked to her emotionally (because of his upbringing) and cannot fully enjoy life. Once he meets Sue, he is once again, held back by the pressures of society. Sue is his cousin, and at first, they feel that a relationship together might be wrong; then Sue goes and marries Phillotson creating more social, and now religious, barriers. Throughout the entire story Jude continues to be blocked, broken, and torn apart by social and religious pressures slamming down on him. Whether it was his unfulfilled dream of going to Christminster, his chains of marriage with Arabella, or his heart breaking relationship with Sue, Jude was not able to get past the social and religious barriers to have a happy life."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This book was ok. I wouldn't recommend it unless a person was really into Victorian literature. The story is depressing and morbid."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"What can you say about this novel? The story of Jude's expectations and the downfall of his family is overwhelmingly tragic. I bought this novel for my teenager--hoping she'd appreciate how good she has it."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I first encountered Thomas Hardy through \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" where I found his determinism to yield excellent themes, plot and character. From there I went to \\"Return of the Native\\" and enjoyed it as well. Then I thought that I might tackle \\"Jude\\". This was some 40 years ago while a senior in college. I had remembered it as being sad and grim, but still worthwhile. Ostensibly I read an abridgement for, while depressing in the extreme, it did seem to move right along. Having forgotten a great deal of the narrative and story, I decided to read it again to see what new lessons I could glean.Unfortunately, this time I read the unabridged version. This tome is not only depressing, it is overly long, preachy, and boring. Hardy had decided to cover the entire Victorian world with this one. His themes take on religion, higher education, class structure of the day and, to some extent, feminism. To squeeze all these into his story and still make his convictions known to the public, he had his three protagonists--Jude, Arabella, and Sue Bridehead spew forth every mundane, arcane, and pontificating thought that he could place into their mouths--sometimes repeating the stultifying notions and concepts three of four times throughout the novel.This is a sorry threesome. They can never seem to make up their mind about anything, or if they do, they soon turn in another direction. Jude--tender hearted and learned, but weak willed and a doormat; Sue--stong and scholarly initially, she soon turns into a wretched conformist; and Arabella who, one must say knows that she is ignorant and a strumpet, is conniving and manipulative. (These three reminded me of the threesome in \\"Sophie's Choice\\" and perhaps \\"Jude the Obscure\\" is where Styron conjured them, for they are every bit as boring, long winded and tragic.)This novel, as well as \\"Sophie\\", could have ended with about a third of the ink that was finally laid to paper. Having gotten through the first three major chapters, one wishes that all three would die and that this book could be placed back on the shelf, never to be opened again. Unfortunately one must endure another four chapters and 250 more pages to be rid of it."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Having said that, I think reading Jude the Obscure was a worthwhile experience.It concerns the young man Jude, stonemason by trade, who dreams of a university education. His hopes and dreams are high at the beginning of the novel. But a series of events ensures that life does not have happiness in store for him. His academic aspirations are thwarted, he marries a vain girl in a moment of lust, and watches his real love - Sue - marry another. When he finally gives everything up, job security, social respect, his ambitions, to live with Sue &quot;in sin&quot;, there is a brief, uncertain ray of happiness on them before tragedy stikes again.The emotions I went through while reading Jude's journey and ultimate disappointment in life were intense. I felt despair, sadness, shock, and was ultimately left feeling quite bitter about his plight. BUT, I enjoy reading books that wrench out your heart and make you feel deep emotion, whether happy or not. Few books do that well in my opinion. That fact that Jude the Obscure did that for me, even though the emotions were negative, was the reason I gave it 5 stars.If you don't like being depressed by what you read, it is probably wise to avoid this one. If, however, you want a truly momentous emotional experience, you should definitely take time to read Jude the Obscure. Just be aware that the feelings it arouses are not pleasant, but it will definitely leave you deeply moved."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I read it in college. It is still one of my 5 favorites. I felt identified with the characters so much that while reading it I felt the same pain and agony of the two heroes.If you have read before other Hardy books then you may think this is another sentimentalist \\"soap opera\\" book. But it is not. This is a masterpiece of literature. I recommend that you start reading Hardy from here."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I remember this book -one of my 5 favourite- specially for the impact that made on me when I read it back in college. If you read first other books by Hardy you may think this one is a little sentimental and \\"soap-operistic\\". But this is trully a gem, a work of art.I felt identified with the hero and I could sense the things and places that show in the whole book. It is so real, and the feelings are so real and strong that you suffer with the characters.Trully a masterpiece. You must read it."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"One of the many things that amaze about Hardy is how widely his imagination roamed -- how much variety there is in his Wessex novels, though all are set in the same little geographic patch of territory, traversing the same cities and countrysides.Though it addresses sex and marrriage with a directness that is almost startling, JUDE is not so sensuous or earthy as TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES. It has a more male personality, suited to its protagonist; not poetic but leaner, more abstract and philosophical; not pastoral but urban, with churches, schools and colleges, the strongholds of civilization, as landmarks.Still, readers who take JUDE as an extended tract against convention aren't paying attention. It's true there are moments that ask to be taken as parable and passages in which you can hear the unmistakable voice of an author making a case. But the story of Jude and Sue is too complex and full of reversals to support any mere argument. They don't fare very well in Wessex, but it's hard to imagine any social conditions in which they would. They are fascinating but unexceptional people whose restlessness, neuroses, desires and ambitions would be thwarted anywhere -- and they are us. They aren't as attractive as Tess, or as Gabrial and Bathsheba in FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD, but they are arguably truer and certainly newer in fiction. They are citizens of the 20th century. This was Hardy's last novel, supposedly because of the outcry against it upon publication, but I don't know where he could have gone from here. It's as if he had a glimpse of the disintegration of human personality along with the achievements and monuments of the race. Where could he have looked next?I'm making the book sound grim, but it has many pleasures for the reader. Here Hardy seems to be holding himself to a higher standard as a novelist. The language is trim and swift, and the subsidiary characters are vivid and memorable, not just voices or stock figures. Arabella, Phillotson, the Widow Edlin are wonderful creations. And (as in TESS), the architecture of the story is dazzling and resonant, like a concert hall with perfect acoustics.In other ways, though, JUDE isn't characteristic of Hardy. A reader coming to him cold may as well start with JUDE as not, though it will give no real sense of his oeuvre as a novelist. If you're a Hardy reader, you might love the other novels and only admire this one, or vice-versa. Some consider it his greatest achievement (though for me, that would be TESS).Certainly it stands alone. The Victorian novel could go no further."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure centers on the life of a neglected commoner with dreams of breaking the chains of society, which hold him bound, and becoming a more educated and proper man. The only challenge that stands in his way is his poor choice in women. Unfortunately this stumbling block becomes more than enough to hinder the weaker Jude along his way. He is not only held up by the lower class, to which he belongs, but seems to be pushed down from the upper classes, preventing his natural progression from both sides of the social spectrum.The cunning Arabella Dunn, a poor country, first beguiles him using him as her escape from the very un-civilized life she had been leading. Having never had any real contact from members of the opposite gender, and no one that even pretended to care for him before, he was easily betrayed by his feelings. Thomas Hardy portrays Arabella as very manipulative only using Jude as a means for furthering her own well-being. She fakes a pregnancy to convince Jude to marry her, instantly stopping his education and centering his attention solely on providing for his newly acquired family. Hardly any time had passed and Jude had forgotten what he set out for. This reminds me of a quote I once heard, \\"Don't let what you want now get in the way of what you want most.\\" Far too often Jude lets his temporary desires distract him from his ultimate goal of gaining an education.Once Arabella leaves Jude he finally has the opportunity again to pursue his goal of becoming socially advanced. However, once again his pursuit of manipulative women prevents him from success. Jude pursues his cousin, Sue, who represents the women of the upper class. She has some of the education that Jude has sought for, yet this seems to do nothing for her as pertaining to life choices. Her marriage to Phillotson is just one example of how even the learned may not be wise. Her decision to pursue Jude following both their divorces, leads to further misery. Not being accepted by the community and never actually committing to marriage puts quite a strain on their relationship. Sue's indecision only prolongs the suffering of Jude and his poor choices. The punishment seems to transcend generations as Little Father Time decides to save him and the other children from this misery by hanging them in the closet one night.Not only does Hardy portray marriage as the main stumbling block along Jude's path but also as the constraint that prevents people from truly attaining that which will make them happy. First of all, Jude and Arabella seemingly have a marriage without love. The marriage appears to be only a social commitment to provide security and other comforts regarded by society. Sue is unhappily married to Phillotson even though he provides her with financial stability, an educated partner, and seems to be the ideal husband. Sue and Jude decide not to enter into that covenant sighting their youthful mistakes as precedence. Even without the confinement of marriage their love is unable to flourish with society looking down upon them and no real commitment rendered. Hardy implies that in marriage one must sacrifice of them for another who is looking after his or her own aspirations."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Thomas Hardy's book Jude the Obscure follows a common theme like his book Tess of the d'Urbeville's. This theme is conventionality verse morality. Hardy's subtitle of Jude the Obscure says it all, \\"the letter killeth.\\" This interprets to the letter of the law killeth, the social conventions of the Victorian Age figuratively and literally breaks Jude. The basic story line is Jude is first married to Arabella. Arabella tricked Jude into marrying her. Jude is in Christminister and meets Sue, whom he falls in love with. However, Sue gets married to Phillotson. After some time both Sue and Jude get a divorce and end up living together (and never marrying each other).It is evident in the text that Sue and Jude's relationship is looked down upon (they have trouble receiving lodging because they are not married). Despite the fact that the book shows marriage in a negative light and both women in the book have undesirable qualities this book is not an anti-marriage book. Also, this book could suggest the importance of marrying the right person, so that, one can be happy, but the overall theme is not to promote the importance of marrying the right person.Hardy uses marriage as the means to manifest the social conventions of the time. By convention Sue and Jude should not have had divorces even though they were participants in unhappy marriages. Even though they both had legal divorces the church shuns them because of their divorces. It is almost an unspoken rule, even though divorces are legally allowed socially they are not approved.Also by convention, they should not have been living together. Even Jude's son is pressured into the conventions of the time and in the end of the novel hangs himself and Jude and Sue's two sons. In a moral sense Jude and Sue tried to be true to their heart and defied the conventions of the time and attempted to live together. They do not go far enough, they should get married. Jude and Sue are still tied down by the social conventions and can not take the last step to break free of the conventions of the time. Jude and Sue are constantly \\"on the run\\" to avoid the stares and shuns from their neighbors.Hardy is clever in his use of symbolism. The name of the town is \\"Christminister.\\" This is town, which Sue and Jude have trouble finding lodging. People should be showing Christ like love; however they shun Jude and Sue. There is an abundant amount of irony with the church. The church should help and attempt to understand Sue and Jude but the church neglects the two.This book is an excellent example for the critique of social convention versus morality. The examples are poignant and the distressing end for the characters makes the criticism of social conventions self-evident."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"There are several novels written in the Victorian era about the life of common people and the struggles they encounter. Jude the Obscure is on the top of many best-seller lists and appears on many Great Literary Works lists, not to mention my own personal list of favorites. Jude the Obscure is a great novel to read if you are looking for complicated characters, emotional injustices, a complex story line, and unexpected events in each chapter. The novel Jude the Obscure, written by Thomas Hardy, portrays the life of Jude Fawley and his relationships with women, his religious obstacles, and other problems faced by a common person in the Victorian times.Jude is a stonemason who appears to be very religious. His list of faults includes a drinking problem, his ignorance of women, problems dealing with stress, and his inability to decide what to do with his life. In fact, when Jude is not able to deal with the issues in his life, he stops everything that he is doing and thinks only about the problem at hand. After this thought process, he begins to drink and hope that the problem will disappear when he becomes sober. Throughout the novel, there are two women who corrupt Jude in some way, either by turning him away from his religious ambitions, by degrading him in a social atmosphere, or leading him away from his dreams by putting their own first. The women in his life, Sue and Arabella, put Jude at an emotional high of loving him unconditionally or tearing him down to the point of causing him to drink. His two wives (which he has a different times) simply play on his emotions like a roller coaster throughout the novel and use him to get what they want out of life, which they too, are incapable of deciding. Several plot events explain Jude's religious beliefs and how he struggles to sustain those same beliefs in the relationships he has. It is his religious faith and the interactions Jude has with Sue and Arabella that shape the novel and the course of events.The author, Thomas Hardy, does a great job in illustrating the religious beliefs social expectations of the Victorian period. Hardy uses both women in the novel to portray the ideals of different classes of women on religion and worthwhile. He uses Jude and Phillotson to portray the differing ideals of religion among varying classes, but also to paint the social expectations of men in the Victorian period. Hardy uses the different social classes of the men to as an excuse for their behaviors. For example, Jude does not cheat on his wife while she is away for a year because they are still married. Because Jude values the bond of marriage both from the church and socially, he is faithful while his wife, who does not have the same moral standards, is off getting married to another man. There are several examples in the novel from all four of the main characters that will give insight into various aspects of life and the ideologies of people in different social atmospheres. Hardy also does a great job in describing each of the characters in a way that their description matches their personality traits or their ideals on life. Hardy also brings to life the scenery in which the novel takes place, allowing the reader to visualize the setting of the events. By drawing the reader in visually, he creates more of an emotional appeal and the reader becomes more involved with the events of the novel."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"When you watch movies nowadays, more than often you see many of the female characters portrayed as extremely weak in one form or another. In an intense battle scene where our hero is in trouble and needs someone to kick the gun a little closer so he can shoot his enemy, what is the he loves girl doing? Screaming her head off. She nearly ruins the happy ending by her inability to be useful.I found Jude the Obscure to be somewhat of a literature version of this classic movie scenario. The main female characters did move the plot along, but only in a downward direction. Jude starts out as a young man aspiring to achieve greatness in the learned city of Christminster. Soon, he is lured into a relationship with Arabella, for which he begins ignoring his hopes of high education. While this relationship is not entirely a manipulation of Jude by Arabella-he falls for her pretty hard, even without her trickery-Jude is ready to get out and head for Christminster when Arabella reveals her \\"pregnancy\\" and they are quickly married, to comply with the social expectations. Before long, Jude learns that Arabella is by far a much different woman than he first thought. His pushed-aside dreams of Christminster are mocked and trampled by her, and of course he must find a practical job to support them. It doesn't take long for Arabella to get tired of the situation-of Jude's sensitivity to the world, his hopes for education, and his all-around \\"sissy-ness\\"-and she heads off to Australia with her parents.Jude does end up moving to Christminster, where he meets his cousin Sue. For some reason, he falls in love with her. He decides that he likes this girl long before he actually talks to her. Love? Sounds more like attraction. At any rate, through a long and complicated set of events, Sue is married to Phillotson (ironically, the man from whom Jude got his love for learning), and later separated and divorced. Jude also obtains a divorce from Arabella. Jude and Sue develop a friendship, while she keeps him at a distance, knowing of his feelings for her. Arabella returns from Australia and comes to talk to Jude; Sue becomes jealous, and decides to have a \\"more than friends\\" relationship with him.Social expectations dictated that they should be married, and Jude is all for it. Sue has issues, though. She feels that marriage is nothing more than a ceremony that puts bounds and chains on something intangible, and although she and Jude go several times to be lawfully wedded, she always backs out. Without giving away too much of the plot, eventually it's more harmful to her and Jude to NOT be married than to go through with the ceremony. When tragedy strikes the family they have made together, Sue becomes our well-known female movie character. As Jude attempts to pick up the pieces of their broken life, Sue is unable to do anything more than repeat the same ideas over and over-it's a sign, this is wrong, we're sinning, religion is the answer. Quite the opposite from her earlier thoughts in the book, where Jude was planning to be a priest and she constantly disagreed with his religious and moral views. I honestly think that Jude and Sue could have pulled through their hardships if she would have done something more than just \\"scream.\\" Instead, she chickened out big-time. By her own uselessness at that critical point, Sue led to Jude's eventual death-she couldn't just kick the gun a few inches closer, and the enemy triumphed. Interestingly enough, I think Sue was the enemy. She was Jude's downfall.Despite all that (in fact, probably because of it), Jude the Obscure is a very good book. The characters are an adventure to become familiar with, and although for me it was frustrating, it was a good read as Jude's life went \\"down the tube\\" more and more rapidly. Best of all, you can't actually hear the annoying high-pitched screams I talked about in movies-you'll just have to imagine it."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Reading this novel, it seems that Hardy is putting women and the organization of marriage down. But at the same time as reading this novel I was also learning that in Hardy&#65533;s time women were sex-crazed harlots and men the picture of virtue who were deceived by the evil women. This helped me to understand that Hardy wasn&#65533;t exactly putting down women, but that he was depicting them as the world saw them at that time. As for the whole marriage issue, Hardy just slams that into the ground. He uses the characters in happy times and in sad times to show how distasteful marriage is. One of the biggest things that points out how Hardy thinks of marriage is how others look upon those who are married and those who are simply a couple. Sue sees that those who are not yet married are happy with one another and still find joy in each other&#65533;s presence. But when she looks upon those who are married she sees that they no longer are happy and find joy in other places. Arabella also sees this when she comes upon Jude and Sue together without their knowing that she is there. She is told that they have supposedly been married, but when she sees them she thinks that they are not because of how they hold hands and still wish to be with each other. This is rather ironic because she and her husband are at the same event but prefer to go their separate ways. By this example Hardy shows that happiness need not be found in marriage.Further he shows some of the consequences of a bad marriage through little Father Time. This boy comes to thinking of himself as a hindrance since he could understand what a hindrance was. If he had been born into a good marriage he would have felt loved and he would have felt as though he belonged. However, he was born to a mother who did not want him and a father who did not even know that he existed. Because he was not raised in a healthy home-life, he began to see the world before he was ready. His death portrays an extreme end to an unhappy marriage, but it all shows what can happen to those who are not wary. Father Time also helps to go back to Hardy showing how evil women were considered at that time. Today many people would consider it very immoral to simply leave their child to another to care for, whatever the circumstances may be. Arabella does not seem to mind though, she only cares when it seems that he has been with these people too long. So instead of taking him back, she simply sends him to Jude. Hardy portrays Sue as evil through Father Time by her talk with him right before his death. She tells him that it would actually be better had he and the rest of the children never been born at all. Now, she may not have meant it in quite that way, but that is how he took it, and so the passing away of the children soon after.There may have been something good about marriage and women in the book, but if there was it was hidden well. As a story it is good, but it is not something that I would want to be judged by, or to base my life on."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is a tale of a young orphan boy who has a perfect picture of his future painted. Being an orphan, he has very little going for him. He is not shown affection by anyone, especially his caretaker-his great aunt. He is constantly being chastised for the way he lives his life. Because there is not a single significant influence at home, Jude looks elsewhere for guidance and direction. He finds this positive influence in his school teacher, Mr. Phillotson. Jude sees good and potential in this school teacher, and wants to emulate him to the best of his ability. However, Jude comes face to face with his major weak point... a woman. Upon encountering Arabella the pig killer, Jude almost instantly forgets his aspirations of attending Christminster to gain an education and instead decides to marry Arabella.After having sacrificed time, money, and his dream of school, Arabella decides that she is going to leave Jude and move on with life. After drinking away his problems, Jude finally decides to move on and try to accomplish his dream of a Christminster education. It is in this town that Jude finds and falls in love with his cousin Sue. Upon befriending Sue, Jude takes a walk with her to find his old mentor and see how he has fared over the years. During their discussion with Mr. Phillotson, Sue is drawn to him, because he is able to teach her how to be a teacher. Jude worries about this, but has few options. Eventually Mr. Phillotson courts Sue and they are wed. Once again Jude is thrown into a fit of depression and drinking. Eventually Sue grows tired of Phillotson that she pursues Jude. However, staying true to the theme of the book, as soon as you have the person you love, you instantly fall out of love with them-and this happens to Sue.This book is story of more than love, marriage, and the problems associated with each. This book has a deeper meaning that Hardy means to convey. It is a story of life in general. Although love is the underlying theme, there are more problems addressed in the book. Those that have a worthwhile goal in life are rarely able to accomplish their dreams, and even when they do, they aren't happy as they envisioned they would be. This book is one of depression and failure. Somehow Hardy is able to make the worst-case scenario out of nearly every situation. A good read, but there are more uplifting stories out there if that is what the reader is looking for."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude Fawley, is an orphan trapped in poverty and a narrow working class paradigm, but in spite of these limitations, he dreams of a scholarly life in the university town of Christminster.Jude is smitten by Arabella, who tricks him into marrying her. After a short time Arabella leaves Jude to go to Australia. Shortly after Arabella leaves him, Jude moves to Christminster to pursue his dreams.While in Christminster he meets his cousin Sue. Jude had fallen in love with Sue when he first saw her picture. Now he is in Christminster where he can pursue his dreams of becoming a scholar and meeting Sue. The conversations between Sue and Jude, despite their differences, bring them closer together and they quickly become friends. Sue deflates Jude's dream when she marries the schoolmaster (the same man at the beginning of the book, who had promised Jude some books but never fulfilled his promise).Even after Arabella comes back into the picture, Sue and Jude get divorced from their respective spouses and live together without marriage. In the years that follow, because the couple is not married, they face a lot of difficulties and become social outcasts. In spite of their difficulties, they still love each other and the family they are raising together. An extremely tragic event shatters the family. The consuming guilt, brought on by the tragic event, leads Sue and Jude back to their former hated lives.It was a desperate try on Sue's part to say no to customs she didn't believe in, and a desperate try on Jude's part to live the peaceful life he wanted with the woman he loved, but just as life didn't grant him his dream of an education, Society denied him acceptance of the relationship he wanted with Sue. The shocking end was Hardy's way to convey his thoughts on love, sex and the institution of marriage, at a time when talking about love, sex, and criticizing the marriage constitution was taboo.Hardy was criticized for creating complex, overtly sexual characters like Sue and Jude who would act against established norms of marital and sexual behaviors. Sue, recognized her intellect but still used marriage as a way of having the career she wanted, She could not force herself to be attracted to her older husband, who was understanding and gave her a divorce, after which she was free to pursue Jude. Jude loved Sue deeply, but knowing that she was married, he still slept with Arabella, when she came back, because she was still his legal wife.Reading the entire 500 plus pages of Jude the Obscure was totally draining. The emotional torment that Jude experienced throughout his life left me depleted. Each and every person in Jude's life played a little role in aborting his dreams of happiness: the schoolmaster who didn't pay attention to a promising ambitious little boy, Arabella who was a totally self absorbed narcissistic woman, whose character along with Jude's character is clearly revealed during the pig killing ritual, Sue who truly loved Jude, but her love was a selfish love that was centered around her own demons of guilt and doubts. Even Jude's older son, was another extension to Jude's obscurity.In the end Jude became completely obscure to the people for whom he cared. I don't think Hardy himself totally understands the canvas he has painted and perhaps that is the reason Hardy turned to poem after Jude and wrote no other novels. It wasn't the controversy that took place in Great Britain and the United States over the scandalous nature of the book, which led him away from novels to poetry. But rather Hardy left part of his heart in Jude and was unable to retrieve it."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This book is a classic about the effect on people's lives when they choose to engage in behavior that is totally against society's norms.Story: The story itself consists of a number of vignettes. Each vignette is compelling and shows how the characters mature (or don't) well. The pacing dragged out a bit, but that is to be expected in a character driven story such as this one.Characters: This is where I am most conflicted. Hardy does a masterful job with the characters of Jude and Sue. Despite having many faults and maddening defects, I was able to feel sympathy for each character as the story progressed. Hardy's secondary characters are less impressive. Arabella is a stock villain, tempting and trapping Jude with no remorse. Phillotson is a stereotypical martyr character. If Phillotson and Arabella would have had some of the same complexities as Jude and Sue, I would have enjoyed this book a great deal more.This is a very depressing book. Jude's outlook is bleak at the beginning, and it never really improves. Still, it is a commentary on society and living in sin that is still applicable to today's world."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"If nothing else, it makes one's own life seem not so tragic!"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"The relationship between Jude and Susannah is one of the most beautiful (and codependent) in literature. Two well-intentioned (though impulsive) people are lost to public censure and their own consciences (trying to cope with unbelievable trajedy and explaining it as God's retribution--Susannah becomes a believer, but in a most horrible and self-sacrifical way). Their downward spiral is difficult to witness, yet Jude's love for Susannah makes the read bearable. Thomas Hardy is a person whom I wish I could have known---uncanningly intelligent, at times seems to channel the voice of the higher power--clairvoyant and insightful, and yet cynical--full of tales of worst case scenarios and victims of circumstances."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"In my personal opinion, Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy, is the most enjoyable, fascinating and memorable book I have ever read.

That is one of the things that makes Jude the Obscure so rich. If it had been a happy love romance it wouldn't be considered a classic. It instead challenges the readers to question the them which is on marriage. Hardy attacks marriage from every angle making the reader feel that there is no hope.Jude the Obscure has a rich plot that pulls you into the story. You feel for the characters in the book. You want Jude to be able to obtain his goals. You feel frustrated when he once again gets sidetracked from his goal because of his one weakness-women. If you like the classics, especially tragedies, than you will appreciate Jude the Obscure. It is good literature, has great symbolism, and the ending scenes will leave a poignant impression that won't be easily forgotten."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure was a very interesting novel, but I would not call it enjoyable. Hardy illustrates many different ambivalent characters, none of whom carry any heroic or acclaimed traits. The characters consist of Jude who has great potential, and aspirations but most of them are largely crushed by the way he handles his life and decisions. He lets the two female characters of the novel twist him and turn him in any, and every direction. He carries no stability and does not resemble any type of human being that has nobility. He has so many dreams and he works so hard to achieve them, but often he lets outside forces influence him and sway his priorities. This is the character that Hardy bases the book around, a man who has goals but they are continually cut down throughout the book. It also irritates me that the two characters who have this great amount of influence on him actually have no honor themselves. Arabella, his first wife is a woman who gets her way through life by dishonesty. She lies about anything and everything that will get her what she wants. In the beginning she gets Jude's attention by throwing pig lard at him showing from the start her lack of refinement. She is the first character that sways Jude from his long time dream of becoming a scholar, doing this through her many lies and deceptions. The second character that contributes to the degradation of Jude's character is Sue. This woman who is in actuality his cousin not only contributes in the detour of Jude's many dreams, but she also ruins the small reputation that he has. By teasing him, and refusing to marry him she creates a relationship that causes a great deal of controversy in their society. She continues to drag Jude's emotions until the very end never coming up with any achievements, and helping Jude do the same.Although I didn't particularly enjoy any of the characters that the novel consisted of, there were some major issues that are important especially looking at the time period that the novel was written. Having been published in a time period where sensitive issues were rarely spoken about such as the ones that are addressed made the book very unique. At that time period rarely topics were addressed like they are in Jude the Obscure. The book ventures into a great deal on the issue of society and it's constrictions. Having society be one of the main topics was not what caused the most uproar at the time. The references of the church and education probably did not attain a pleasant reaction preventing many of the readers from observing the more major theme of the novel. No I did not enjoy the book, but I do not thoroughly understand the time period that the first publication occurred at, or the type of society that it was released to. Knowing that such information would probably make the book a little more appealing to me, but overall I can not say that it was an uplifting read."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is a tragic novel that brings forth a very anti-marriage message, which was a shock to the strict Victorian society it was published in.

He is the ultimate trapped man waiting and hoping for redemption that never comes. He wants education, love, and a future for his children. These are all thwarted by both society and individuals. This book is wonderfully sad and depressing, perfect for a rainy weekend ALONE. This is not the book to read in the throes of love and optimism. Hardy's language draws you in and keeps you reading. I threw down the book five times in anger and frustration but HAD TO keep reading to find what happens next, I finished it within two days! The writing evokes the mood of the novel and the people involved so vividly that I could almost smell the pigs, hear the stonemason's tapping and feel the cold fog of Christminister."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I've read Tess before I read Jude, and reading the two of them in comparison has helped me understand Hardy's life philosophy a little better. As a piece of literature I think most would agree that Tess is a much better read, in style, subtlety, plot and character development, etc. Jude, however, is certainly worth everyone's while. I think the most telling point in the novel is when Jude goes to meet the composer of the beautiful hymn he's been singing in the church choir, and finds out that the composer is just as worldly and materialistic as anyone else. Jude is a romantic, sensitive, passionate man searching for a pure and natural beauty in a world that demands one to deny their natural instincts in exchange for money, status, and respectability. His tragedy, however, is not as keen as Tess's: Tess's was purely determined by fate and could by no means be considered her &quot;fault,&quot; whereas Jude's, it seems to me, could have been preventable from the start had he not succumbed to a whimsical impulse.&quot;Jude&quot; is one of the most vitriolic and direct attacks against the institutions of religion and matrimony that I have ever come across. The theme of a &quot;natural spouse&quot; as opposed to the &quot;societal/religious spouse&quot; is one much propagated by Hardy, and that is very much obvious in &quot;Jude.&quot; The conflict between the two puts Jude in a very interesting dilemma, around which the plot centers. In short, &quot;Jude&quot; is a very intense look at the ever-debated clash of the natural and the societal."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is a sad book of legendary proportions. Not until reading did I realize how utterly depressing/tragic it is. This doesn't mean it's bad; Tess of the d'Urbervilles (also by Hardy) is also depressing yet it is moving, and is an excellent read. Jude the Obscure, at least for me, falls short of the mark.Jude the Obscure is about a man who wanders (..literally across all southern England) looking for happiness in marriage and life. He's a deep-thinker who is incredibly naive and, due to bad luck and the social neurosis of the Victorian era, finds himself moving further away from his objectives with each passing...page! Just when you think Jude's life is about to turn for the better it turns horribly tragic. While similarities to Tess of the d'Urbervilles abound, Tess's tragic turn was expected and plausible. Jude's misfortune comes from nowhere, and so it seems like Hardy is playing a cruel trick on the reader.So I disagree with the strongly opinionated reviewers before me. Jude the Obscure is neither great nor terrible. I find it to be rather formulaic Hardy, which for many readers will be reason enough to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This book is about the struggle of having character. As such, it addresses perhaps a timeless question: should we follow our hearts and do what we want or should we follow convention and do what we think is demanded?Although they try desperately, and for a time succeed, Jude and Sue never fully escape the demands of conscious, obligation, and social convention. And it destroys them. Jude and Sue thus personify the agonizing struggle to make moral decisions. If we knew right from wrong, we would choose right every time. But, what makes Jude and Sue's struggles so painful is that they are trying to choose between right and right, or wrong and wrong. Either decision provides as much pain, although in a different way. So what do you do?Hardy doesn't give any easy answers. But, especially today when most of us all the time do exactly what we want, perhaps the question is worth thinking seriously about."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Regardless of what some uneducated or shallow people might say about this novel, it IS a masterpiece. For one, the way Hardy writes is wonderful. He does not give it to you easy, but he gives it to you. To recomed a Dickens novel in place of this is tragic. For one, Dickens was a man of the people and wrote for the people, often changing his endings and tittles to better suit audiences. Hardy obviously does not do this. Jude is clearly a late Victorian Age novel and even though it was not accepted during this time, Hardy's portrayal of 19th century England, the view points of sociey at that time, etc should be read now for not only historical reasons alone, but for the unique way Hardy presents them. Too, this novel is very sad. This is one reason it was not accepted at the time. However, readers should note that due to the publication of this novel, education was made more readily availible to people of lower socioeconomic classes. For me, that, meant that this novel made a diffrence, thus making it even more spectacular. Overall, for all those interested, Jude is by far a classic masterwork and should be read and appreciated by those who can fully grasp its power. More importantly, though, it is a true drama of the mind and of human existance and emotion."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This is the second novel by Thomas Hardy I've read. The emotionally-wrenching \\"Tess\\" was the first, and I decided masochistically I'd like a little more punishment. I will skip the plot-line and the criticism of Victorian-era conventions, all well-covered by others, and just give my impressions of how enjoyable a read it is.First, I think you should read the book without plot details given ahead of time, and NEVER read the introduction of a classic novel by Penguin or Oxford -- they will give it all away. Sometimes they even give away plot details in the footnotes, but Hardy is an author I'd recommend buying an edition with explanatory notes.I thought this book was much darker than \\"Tess,\\" but I didn't sympathize with the main character quite as much, although I feel I was a bit like him myself in my youth. I suppose Tess, being a woman, will get more sympathy, but the things that happen to Jude are far worse. Furthermore, the character of Sue is deeply sympathetic as well. As I read this book, and dreams got deferred, then tragedy mounted on tragedy, some things that happened were almost unbelievable. \\"Anna Karenina\\" is dark, \\"Ethan Frome\\" is dark -- but what happens in the last 100 pages of this novel is downright nightmarish, bordering on horror.After I read \\"Tess\\" I bought 6 of Hardy's novels and plan to read them all eventually, but I wouldn't read them back-to-back!"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This is the second Hardy novel that I have read. The first was Tess of the d'Urbervilles, which I enjoyed despite that fact that it was a tragedy. I found Jude the Obscure to be much darker and to the point that I didn't particularly enjoy it. I did relate to the character of Jude, and could understand his reaction to his situations. The reactions of Sue later in her life highlighted the danger of an incorrect understanding of the mercy of God, repentance and forgiveness of oneself.Recommended for lovers of tragedy. If you want to be uplifted, don't read this book."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"If there's one strange habit that's become a subtle part of my life it's that I have the hardest times remembering how I came across some of my favorite things, bands, movies, books, and Jude the Obscure is one of them. I was at a Barnes and Noble with a friend, looking at and picking up random books, when I came across this title. I read the synopsis on the back, informing me of how utterly bleak this book is supposed to be, that Hardy met with reactions so harsh that he never picked up a pen to write another novel until his dying day, and that, most importantly of all, it's the tale of a man's dreams continuously crushed before even gaining any kind of momentum, for the majority of his life.After I read all that, the book never left my hand, and that night I went home and took in at least 1/4 of the book in one sitting. There are so many moments and quotes in this book that I can personally identify with that reading it was probably a far more cathartic experience for myself than most others. Jude longs to be a man of the intellectual scene, reading as much as he can, studying numerous languages, latin, of course being the most important, and he never gets close to ever seeing any of his hopes come to life. His life is spent, for the better part, working low class jobs, stone masonry, etc. and falling for all the wrong girls.The women in Hardy's final novel depict the sex at their coldest, most malicious and self-absorbed. Arabella, Jude's first wife, tricks Jude into marriage by faking a pregnancy, and Jude being the soft hearted, love hungry puppy that he is, weds her, only to meet with crushing consequences. Then enters Sue Bridehead, Jude's cousin, a character, I've read quite a few books mind you, that is near the very top of my list of absolutely vile people, Arabella is there as well.Sue is so unconsciously full of herself, such a self-proclaimed goddess that it's sickening. For the majority of their courtship Sue never even so much as remotely returns Jude's love, which he notes on numerous occasions, to which she simply implies that she loves him but will never actually physically speak the words.And in the background is Philotson, the man Sue marries before Jude, and the man who, ultimately, unwillingly tears Jude & Sue apart for good. An older man, a teacher, and yet another miserable human being, lets Sue go when he realizes that she doesn't love him, but that she may love Jude. The very fact that Sue was a part of his life, and eventually absent, destroys his reputation, when they get \\"divorced.\\" He loses his job and has to take jobs akin to what Jude did his whole life, if not just a bit better.Sue is basically the poison of the novel. Every life she touches ultimately falls apart. Little Father Time, the son born of Jude & Arabella's time, hangs himself, along with Jude & Sue's two children, because Sue told the boy that the world is a harsh place and that they're better off dead. \\"because we're too many\\" I believe is what the suicide note reads.The day of the child's funeral, Sue, pregnant with third child, has a miscarriage. So, again, it's obvious, in my opinion, that Sue is the poison, destroying all those she comes in contact with, even the child inside her body.There are more disturbing moments in the book, although none nearly as absolutely shocking as the suicide, but I'm already running off at the mouth about what is, and always will be, my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Although Jude The Obscure may see somewhat depressing dark, and gothic I did enjoy the story of the character Jude. He admired his schoolteacher as a boy and wanted so bad to go to Christminister and become a scholar. The fact that Jude is a gentleman allows women like Arabella and Sue to stray him far of the path towards his goal. It makes me wonder what would have happened to him if he hadn't run into Arabella. After being away from Arabella he starts to fall in love with his cousin Sue. All Jude wanted was to marry her, however she did not want to conform to society after being married once before. The end of the novel is sad, however I really sympathized with Jude and felt like he did the best he could with his life."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude's life is short and miserable. His aspiration of becoming a scholar is thwarted when he is trapped into marriage by Arabella. But even without Arabella's manipulations, he is trapped in time, born many years too soon for the reality, instead of only the dream, that someone of a working class background can attend an institution of higher learning.He remains a stonemason and eventually unites with Sue Bridehead, not in a legal marriage, but one of heart and mind. Jude is ahead of his time, again, for this type of union to be socially accepted. Their rejection of a marriage contract turn them in social outcasts and their hardships culminate into a horrific event that affects Sue profoundly and causes the separation between her and Jude.For me, Sue is the character who leaves the most lasting impression in Jude the Obscure, even though it's not in a wholly positive sense. She is indecisive and at times so annoying that I clenched my teeth as I was reading. But the scene where she jumps out the window when Phillotson accidentally enters her bedroom is priceless and forever ingrained in my mind. She cannot force herself to accept him as a husband. Others, less free-spirited and emotional than Sue, might have been resigned or indifferent to being the wife of a dull, older man. Not Sue. Her spirit rebels because she wants to be with Jude, until she is shocked and overwhelmed by grief. Then she transforms into someone who can overrule her own will and submit herself to Phillotson. In the end she is crushed and as dead as Jude in his coffin.Jude the Obscure is bleak, but also surprisingly fast-paced with good dialogue and memorable characters. If the book had been more favorably received by critics upon its publication Thomas Hardy would almost certainly have continued writing novels. But he was discouraged by the cries of outrage and turned his attention to writing poetry. We'll never know what great books he might have written but the masterpiece Jude the Obscure is an exclamation point as a last novel."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Thomas Hardy has accomplished a miracle with this novel. He has written a novel equal in the strength of the ideas, the beauty of the writing, and the compelling nature of the story. If he had only done one of the three well, the book would be worth reading, but having done all three so beautifully has resulted in a masterpiece.I first read Jude about 10 years ago and recently re-read it. I was even more delighted after reading it again, and plan to read it a third time.Some of my literary compatriots have been put-off by what they characterize as stiff language in Hardy in general and Jude in particular, but I would encourage anyone to persevere...after a few chapters, it wears-off and then you will thoroughly enjoy the reading!"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Thomas Hardy... I wonder what his life must have been like in order for him to write such a tragic book. For those considering it, this book is a romantic tragedy of the highest degree. If your looking for a happily ever after, look elsewhere. But if your looking to run the gamut of human experience in books, this is one you will want to take up, I've never read a book that has taken such a sentimental turn for the worse than this. I hope this helps."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This is a sad book! Going through it, you can't help but feel sorry for Jude. He tries so hard and seems to fail at everything he's ever wanted. He's never really had any adult role models when he was growing up. This has made him vulnerable to the ploys of people like Arabella who tricks him into marriage twice. As for Sue, although he considers her the love of his life, you cannot help but wonder how she truely feels about him.All the females in this book are so flawed in so many ways. Arabella is the master manipulator as for Sue, she has some quite peculiar theories and ideas. Sometimes it makes them irritating.It's pretty sad and almost heartbreaking to see this man give up so much of himself for his love and to suffer so much for it."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Hardy's last novel before public indignation forced him to give up book writing (for poetry) really uses passion as a destructive force. As he takes his most likable male character in Jude and basically ruins him against his 2 least enjoyable female leads in Arabell and Sue. Sue more than anything is infuriatingly fickle and will either make you yell at the book or wish for her early exit. She's a real struggle to cozy up to and yet she becomes the voice for Hardy to express his disgust with social conventions and public morality and what is right and what isn't. etc... Probably contains his harshest plot twists. And as well, his most damning indictments against a rigid world dominated by rules and tradition. Jude is at once trapped and alive with his choices but eventually even his last ounce of love for Sue does him in. Since she's enough to drive even a saint to madness. Hardy really made her as exasperating as possible. Jude becomes a brave soul just for putting up with her... Each chapter takes place in a different location, perhaps to symbolize the characters' indecision. The more than unstable ones who can't seem to make up their minds. PS: a pig killing sequence is especially disturbing."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I've read all of Thomas Hardy's novels, and Jude is my favorite, followed closely by The Mayor of CasterBridge. I love Hardy's details; he almost always uses symbolism in his character and place names. Did you know Jude is the smallest book in the Bible? Well it is, and accordingly, Jude is a diminuitive character from appearances. Hardy's complex views on marriage and relationships really stood out to me in this novel.Above all, Jude values education's enlightenment, not just a degree. But the fool marries Arabella (for impatient, youthful lust), a worldly woman who could care less about Jude's unpractical philosophy. He, in turn, abhors her family's pig slaughtering business. Eventually, she runs away.Over time, Jude comes to know and love Sue Bridehead. She is an intelligent teacher whose love is mutual, but she refuses to marry him. First of all, he never officially got divorced from Arabella, and secondly, she is superstitious. Both have a history of luckless marriages in their family histories (they are cousins). Eventually they come to the decision that since they are morally upright, they can be married without the formalities. They have three children. All goes ok for a time.Then Arabella comes back with a child, Jude's child. She cannot keep him. This child is barely older than the other three and severely depressed. The child does not understand why people have children in such a cruel world. I won't tell you the ending, but be assured it ends in the worst possible way. I love the novel anyways; it has artistic integrity. The final collapse of Judes relationships is a moment of 'pathetic catharsis.' Catharsis is always associated with tragedy (Greek, ie - Oedipus), but I think Hardy actually pulls it off in this pathos story. Catharsis is a brief moment of intense grief that causes the reader to pause, to learn.Morals in the story: Don't get married too quickly; use your head. Also, marriage requires formalities to protect us from the world's cruel darts. It doesn't matter how upright you are; environmental chaos will try to destroy you anyways. That's why Hardy saw the need to have marriage promises formalized. We should not think that we're so strong when we don't know the future's misfortune."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure, is rather compelling, but not a book you can't put down. Where its grip on the reader lacks, its attacks on a repressive social structure dedicated to conforming to religion make the story applicable to any time and place.Jude, the main character, begins his life as a lower class boy with aspirations to become a great scholar in the illustrious universities of Christminster. Jude puts his heart and soul into a dream he believes attainable, but society and his vices derail him. Hardy shows even an honorable high hoping young man cannot reach the heights of society unless he conforms to its traditions and obligations.Marriage is the example that demonstrates the main characters obligations to society. Jude can't pursue an academic career because of his requirement to please society by marrying Arabella. Jude and Sue are unable to pursue their truest desires because society thwarts them due to their unconventional relationship. The story seems to attack marriage, as none who impart in it are happy, but Hardy is really trying to say that it is society's regard and adherence to tradition that only allows for a mainstream view of life. Society would rather have a man and woman living miserably under marriage vows than living happily but unconventionally in a stable but unmarried family. It is society's harsh judgment that ruins people; not marriage.The book starts off with some sensual action and then moves a bit more slowly as it delves into the interplay between characters that exemplifies the books theme. The pace finally picks up again as the events at the end of the book become more feverish and intense.Overall, the book compresses the reader as he feels the graveness of society's judgment upon unconventionality. It is also intriguing to see the characters fight for what they believe is right despite society's heavy hand upon them."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Before reading Jude the Obscure I had read Tess of the D'ubervilles. Being pretty young, the writing style of Hardy was a little bit hard to follow and I floundered during so many inferred scenes of the book. i.e.when Tess all of a sudden just has a baby. I think that was freshmen year in High school the first time, but I have since read it again, and along with Jude, I quite enjoyed it. I learned to love the scenes that made you infer, or guess. I love his language and it is beautiful to know that almost every person, every thing and place has significance and has been thought about.As morbid and sad as Jude may have been, I thought it was an amazing book. Hardy makes you think long and hard after he hits you tragedy and fate. It seems that Tess and Jude could be brother and sister books, there were so many characters and ideas that paralelled, which made Jude so much more interesting to read. I think one of my favorite parts of the books is the fact that although a lot happens from start to finish, it is the simple emotions and lives that make the story. I like thinking about symbols like the pig in Jude and the birds in Tess, it is also amazing to me how Hardy can bring everything back together through these symbols. On page 386 Arabella says, \\"You couldn't kill the pig, but you could kill me.\\" I like how consistent Hardy is in his meaning behind symbols, and also how reliable it is to know that every cities name and every characters name has been thought over and has meaning to the story.When I finished Jude, I wasn't quite sure what to think. The results were so extreme and tragic, that it was hard to place the exact meaning. I think though, what I got from it was the difference between true love and lust, also the debate between fate and choice, not to mention, what the book said about education, religion, marriage, and society. For my own sake of sorting things out, I'll go through each of these and what I understood of them. Education; Jude's education and love of knowledge seemed to be a constant thing that he strived for. He dreamt about Christminister, and when he finally got there, he was told he shouldn't be there, yet through his entire life he never gave up on the idea of education and books, he ended up dying in the city he loved, and on his last walk through the town he saw the men he'd always wanted to be, their spirits were laughing at him. Next, religion, there was not nearly as much written about God and religion in Jude as there was in Tess, but there was still many conotations to it. It seems that many of he and Sue's defining moments take place in a chapel. There is also the characters directly related to religion, Mr. Phillotson, and the name Jude is the name of a saint. I've run out of time, but I loved the book, I love to read Thomas Hardy. I cannot even begin to imagine putting together so many characters and situations and ideas into such beautiful words and images."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This novel renewed my fascination with the written word. Hardy's prose has a uniquely akward elegance, his characters truly live within the text, and the story grips us and keeps us up at night. Horrifying and invigorating at once, it kept me dreaming of certain possibilities dreamed of one hundred years ago, and still yet to be realized.A comparison to Tess can reveal a great deal about the past fifteen years in American culture, considering the fact that Jude has begun to overshadow Tess in the eyes of social critics as Hardy's greatest contribution. After reading these two novels, I believe they show us how far we've travelled in terms of gender equality: just as far as we had travelled one hundred years ago. Jude's new-found popularity shows our own subtle shift from a culture failing to recognize the plight of the victimized woman, to one underhandedly rejecting the emergence of the outspoken, independent, &quot;modern&quot; woman. More than that, these books remind us of exactly who suffers in the wake of our obstinance.In its time, this novel was one of the few in history to affect real social change. It was the sited inspiration for the re-organization of the English Public Education system. Unfortunately, not all of the ills of society can be cured with fiction. We're still working on some of them, Tom. Please have patience."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"In &quot;Jude the Obscure,&quot; Thomas Hardy masterfully balances his narrative between an incisive criticism of many of England's entrenched cultural institutions and a thoughtful portrait of the &quot;love square&quot; of Jude, Arabella, Sue, and Phillotson. Instead of being a bleak work of social realism in which each character is grotesquely locked into his or her social milieu, &quot;Jude's&quot; characters are passionate and articulate, despite the conditions that plague them. Additionally, Hardy does not offer the reader a mere snapshot of his characters' lives: each main character matures and struggles with his or her beliefs, thereby developing a vitality, which, again, I feel is unique for a novel that addresses such a breadth of social issues, from education, to alcoholism, to the conventions of marriage, to the sense of being thrown into the world. One of the best novels I have read in a while, &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; has a mature, balanced vision that can be appreciated from a variety of perspectives, each reading possessing a singular fullness."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This book, as I'm sure you have heard by now, is unbelievably sad. Yet, it lures you into its spell and keeps you connected to the characters, though what each of them go through is horrible. For, within this sad, miserable love story, is a beautifully poetic tragedy. Perhaps the way it's written is what makes me think so. I love the classic Greek tragedys, myths, and legends, and from what I have read, Hardy was influenced by these same things. In any case, it captured me. It has the fable-like magic of &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles,&quot; while still holding its own as a unique work.I love this book and the author who wrote it. He had a great talent for cutting the excess and presenting a simple picture of life's complex situations."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Supposedly, this book was burned by the Bishop of Wakefield when it was first released, and Hardy's wife was furious at him because people would think it was autobiographical. The response to the book was the final nail in the coffin that caused Hardy to stop writing novels.Jude Hawley is born into a changing world-- a world that's changed enough that a poor boy can dream about a university eduction and a professional future. However, it hadn't changed enough for that dream to yet be realizable. Hawley instead is entrapped into a hasty marriage and sacrifices his dreams of further education. Even after the marriage is dissolved by the wife removing herself to Australia, Jude continues to be haunted for the rest of his life by his early mistake-- dooming himself and his true love to a lifetime of misery.The book is bleak. The characters (Jude and Sue, primarily) can't live with the choices that law and religion demands, but they can't live outside them either and their attempts to do so only drive them down deeper. The central thesis of the book, and the one that was so shocking a the time, was that these moral and legal strictures prevented people from fulfilling their dreams and living happy lives. Jude the Obscure challenges the sanctity of marriage by building a tragedy about people trapped by its convention.An important and challenging book. It continues to be relevant today."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Ready for four hundred pages of sparkle and sunshine? \\"Jude the Obscure\\" is about a group of people whose every hope and dream is gradually crushed to a fine powder and blown away by the winds of despair. Hardy is his usual unforgiving self in this grim, discomforting tale of educational goals thwarted, marital bliss destroyed, childhood innocence corrupted, and spiritual redemption viciously mocked. Those who might suspect that this is a recent example of the current cultural debasement of family values would be amazed to know that this novel was written not in 1995 but in 1895. Upon its publication, Hardy was criticized for his pessimism when all he was did was herald the arrival of the pessimistic twentieth century.\\"Jude the Obscure\\" is not an indictment of education, marriage, family, or religion, but rather Hardy's bitter commentary on how society misuses these institutions to defend its shaky beliefs and practices. Jude Fawley, the title character and society's puppet, is a young man trying in vain to transcend his environment. A stonemason by trade, he dauntlessly studies Latin and Greek with the rigorous mind of a classical scholar in preparation for entering the ivy-covered Gothic halls of Christminster, a college town supposed to evoke Oxford. Two things stand in his way: He is too poor to afford the tuition, and he marries an ignorant farm girl named Arabella who discourages his academic aspirations.Separated from Arabella but still legally married, Jude begins a relationship with his pretty cousin, Sue Bridehead, after he moves to Christminster to be nearer his goal, supporting himself with various stonemasonry jobs. Sue marries Jude's former teacher, Richard Phillotson, many years her senior, also rejected by Christminster and now a local schoolmaster. When Phillotson realizes that Sue's heart belongs to Jude, he sorrowfully but graciously cuts her loose, whereupon she goes to live with her lover. The irony that Hardy emphasizes is that the two couples in the novel who were never meant to be--Jude and Arabella, and Phillotson and Sue--were the ones who married, while Jude and Sue, the only mutually happy couple, are unmarriageable to each other.Sue is the most interesting, and arguably the most tragic, figure in the novel. At first she appears to be a devout Christian, working in a shop that makes religious ornamentation; but she soon reveals herself to be as cynical as Jude is earnest, acknowledging that she and Jude are descendants of a fractured family for whom marriage seems not to be intended. However, towards the end of the novel her character is transformed by a misfortune so violent and sickening that it has the power to convince her that she is being punished for her sinful ways. A pious person would be probably cheered by choosing conventional morality after such an incident, but Sue, fearful of the wrath of a divine force she can't know or control, is only made more miserable by feeling pressured to accept the undesirable situation of living with her lawful husband.\\"Jude the Obscure,\\" even more so than Hardy's other famous novels, is swamped in loneliness, frustration, disillusion, anger, and hopelessness, all delivered by the relentless fist of fate, and it is exhausting to imagine the emotional abysses he would have had to plumb had he decided against all critical opposition to continue this avenue of his career. Hardy, like Jude an autodidact but unlike Jude a professional success nonetheless, is plaintive about a social system that prevents talented people of poverty from realizing their potential while requiring them to live holy lives. His response was to write a book that would shock the public, not to shame them, but into seeing what he saw."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"As are Hardy's other books, Jude the Obscure is not an &quot;easy read.&quot; Appreciating Hardy's work requires a little work and the ability to pay attention and to think a little along the way. But the effort pays off. Jude the Obscure is a great book about the human condition, at least as it exists for many people. Like other Hardy characters, Jude Fawley makes a mistake early in his life and continues to pay the price until the day he dies. He commits an act of folly that seals his doom, and nothing he can do can make it right. This would be merely sad or melodramatic were if not for the fact that Jude is a truly good man with truly good intentions. It is this that makes his story truly tragic. Not only is he trapped by the consequences of his early act of foolishness, but he is also trapped and eventually dragged down by the conventions of a society that is more concerned with status and class than with character and ability and more devoted to mindless tradition than to a considered morality. Most of what can be said of Jude also be said of his love, Sue Bridehead, although I found her to be a less believable and sympathetic character. I was surprised by the frankness with which Hardy deals with sexuality in 1895, and I can understand now the furor this book apparently caused in Britain and America upon publication. Hardy is a writer of great power and insight. He also knows how to build a great story. And he is a novelist of ideas. He has his faults, of course. At his worst, he is wordy, obscure, and pedantic. But at his best, he is one of the most emotionally moving of writers. At times his books flash briliantly with passion. At times, he is heartbreaking. Jude the Obscure is a novel that no lover of fine writing and a great story can afford to miss. The novel has haunted me for weeks since I read it, and it probably will for a long time."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Prior to reading Jude the Obscure, I had a smattering of knowledge about the religious uproar it caused upon publication, which led Hardy to abandon novels and focus merely on poetry. His work being denounced and burned by the churches, Hardy felt that if that was to be the treatment of his work, he would no longer produce the work.Now that I have read the novel, and having attempted to place myself in the mindset of the later 19th century morals and ideals, I can begin to understand why such an uproar was raised.First, the story...Jude Fawley, of poor and meager birth, aspires to academic greatness. When it is recommended to him that he stay on the 'blue collar' course he has begun, and not wish for more, he decides to educate himself, one day hoping that it will position him for greater things.Jude enters into a hasty marriage, which by later standards would be described as a 'shotgun' wedding, which he eventually comes to regret, and ends. Enter his cousin Sue, who becomes the love of his life. Sue also ends an unsatisfactory first marriage, freeing herself to be with Jude, whom she loves as well.What follows is a descent into tragedy and despair, with numerous twists and turns along the way. Not wanting to spoil them, I will not divulge.However, the remainder of the novel touches upon many, many themes that amounted to raising of the ire of the church in response. Divorce; childbirth out of wedlock; loss of faith in God; questioning religious ideals and teachings; all these and more are present in the latter half of the novel, and so much more.Upon finishing the book, I was left to question were these really Hardy's own feelings illustrated in his work, or simply a realization of a course of events for the characters, and not a reflection on the author's beliefs. That, however, bears further reading on the life of Thomas Hardy.Where I find fault with the novel is in the characters, and it is merely a distaste with their actions. Sue, the heroine, spends far too much time vacillating about her love for Jude and her desire to marry him. When Jude tries to do the right thing by Sue, and respect her wishes, she claims he has 'given up too easily, and doesn't seem at all disappointed'. Jude's first wife, Arabella, displays an utterly selfish, self-absorbed personality, and was, for me, unlikeble, and unsympathetic. Jude, a character capable of learning Latin and Greek and engaging in other scholarly pursuits, seems completely naive in the ways of the world, and further seems blinded by a sense of duty over a sense of the rights and wrongs of others. His actions make him appear to have no regard for himself, until the very end.Perhaps this is exactly as Hardy meant the characters to be seen, perhaps not. I did enjoy the book more than I expected to, and apparently more than others who have said to me \\"What on earth are you reading THAT for???\\". Hardy is not a comedy writer, and one should not expect a glamorous, cheerful, tidy ending, it does not exist here.While not the greatest of classic novels I have read, I can certainly see why this one has been discussed for over 100 years. While Dickens peppered his stories with levity to break up the gloom, Hardy continues on a downward spiral, leaving his characters in despair within and without. I recommend it to readers who enjoy a good characterization of later 19th century life in England. But if you are looking for something to put a smile on your face, Hardy might not be for you."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure, the last novel written by England's greatest novelist, is often called Thomas Hardy's masterpiece. I do not quite agree, but it is certainly in his top tier, which puts it with the all-time best novels. It is absolutely essential for fans of Hardy, English literature, or tragedy as well as anyone alive to art that is profoundly moving and deeply thought-provoking.Jude in many ways culminates Hardy's novelistic career, portraying several key themes and facets more clearly and fully than previously. The marriage institution had rarely fared well in Hardy, but this is his most devastating critique - nay, one of the most devastating of all-time. Hardy questions it on all fronts: historical, social, religious, and moral. He also thoroughly explores a wealth of related issues: sexuality, male/female relations, love, etc. Very few writers have written of love so movingly or honestly; Jude shows nearly every aspect - from euphoric first love to cynical bitterness - so vividly and emotionally that everyone will relate to one or more parts. All told, the love depiction is extremely bleak; Hardy has little hope for successful relations and generally portrays love itself as fundamentally destructive and lust even more so. They distract from what are really more important things and can even wreck dreams, which of course does not make it any more resistible - even if one knows it.This is the novel's most famous aspect, but it has a wealth of other important themes. Keeping its 1895 publication in mind is important, as it deals with many issues central to late Victorian society - mostly ones that few wanted to discuss or even admit existed. Hardy truly had his finger on the contemporary pulse, and his unorthodox views led to near-unbelievable controversy, which gives Jude great historical value. However, it is also universal in the best and truest sense. Many problems dramatized here are unfortunately still very real; even more sadly, most seem inherent to the human condition. Class problems are one of these - always important in Hardy but perhaps never so clearly. Hardy was an autodidact, as are many of his characters; he routinely shows just how hard it was for the poor to become educated, much less use education for advancement, even if they wanted it desperately. Jude explores this with great depth and subtlety, shedding much-needed light on a perennial social failing and many overlooked personal tragedies. The English education system itself is thus taken to task, as are self-proclaimed intellectuals. The novel also more than hints at what Hardy later called the Imminent Will - a blind force governing human fate. The characters seem to have very little or no control over their destiny, being prey to vast forces beyond their control. Hardy is often said to have an almost malevolent attitude toward characters, arranging chance and circumstances so that they do the most possible harm to essentially undeserving victims. This inevitably leads to very elaborate plots and heavy reliance on melodramatic coincidence, which some have always disliked. This is of course one's right, but those who think he could not plot without such things miss the point; he had a very dark view of life, lacked belief in a benevolent force overseeing humanity, and thought change and chance usually affected life for the worse. All this comes across very powerfully; Jude may have faults but is far more sinned against than sinning. Hardy has drawn him too specifically - and, some have always said, too autobiographically - for him to be an Everyman, but we identify with and have great sympathy for him because of his core frail humanity. What happens to him could happen to almost anyone, making his story all the more believable and thus all the more tragically affecting.As all this suggests, Jude is very modern; most of Hardy's views were very advanced, and the novel was on the very cutting edge of late Victorian ethics, philosophy, and theology. The marriage issue of course takes on a central church issue directly, but the discerning will see more fundamental religious criticism. Though he almost never gets credit, Hardy was a proto-existentialist, consistently dramatizing the intellectual and moral consequences of living in the modern, post-religion world. Jude shows just how black that world can be and vibrantly conveys the profound changes that were even then transforming every aspect of it. Hardy's work is well-known for showing modernity's ache - how rapid advancement in everything from technology to religion was quickly making obsolete a rural agricultural society that had been virtually unchanged for a thousand years. Like much of Hardy's work, Jude is partly set in Wessex - a part-real, part-dream setting based on his native Southwest England. Perhaps no one equals him at making place so important that it is integral to the story, and setting is never mere background with him. The lush, minutely described rural landscapes are as compelling as ever, but Jude is unique in being substantially set in Christminster - a relatively large town, based on Oxford, outside Wessex proper. Oxfordians have long been fascinated by Hardy's depiction; he did much on the spot research to maintain his usual verisimilitude, and it shows. He truly seems to bring the city alive to an extent rarely even approached, much less achieved, with any location. Those who appreciate this Hardy aspect will thus not be disappointed, and those who stereotype him as using only rural agricultural settings will be pleasantly surprised.Important as all this is, the characters in many ways make the book. Jude is one of Hardy's great creations, and Arabella is one of literature's most intriguing and nuanced female villains. The most interesting character may be Sue Bridehead, a curious and uneasy mix of the Victorian female ideal and the rapidly emerging New Woman. Hardy's Preface notes that an early feminist told him Sue was literature's first real feminist, and so she is in many ways. Hardy himself was almost a proto-feminist and uses her to explore many issues of importance to women at the time and indeed now. In particular, he shows just how hard it was for even the most staunchly independent and freethinking women to stay true to themselves - or even stay alive - in such a drastically oppressive society. We see how marriage was virtually the only method of subsistence and how women were all but forced to marry grossly unsuitable men. For a man of the era, much less of Hardy's age (fifty-five) to have even been aware of such things, much less to dramatize them with discernment and sympathy, is truly remarkable. The feminist was disappointed by what Hardy does with Sue in the end, saying no woman would have written so, and D. H. Lawrence was later fascinated by her for similar but subtly different reasons. It is easy to criticize Hardy for losing nerve and falling back on prevailing stereotypes, but it is important to remember a few things. First, the event that pushes Sue over the proverbial edge is the most harrowing I have ever read; even the darkest Russian literature - nay, even Greek tragedy itself - does not equal it. I will say no more because all should experience it for themselves - and indeed it cannot be reproduced -, but it must be asked what would drive a woman (or anyone) to extremes if this would not. Second, and probably more importantly, Sue's plight and all it leads to epitomize Hardy's dark philosophy. Showing things as they should be was not his goal; he showed them as they are - which is of course not what most want to see. A wide range of ideologies may find this far from palatable, but he wisely noted that there is an obligation higher than any ideology - Truth. Few have equaled Hardy at showing it, especially the dark side so many refuse to see, and Jude is a seminal instance.Jude may not be the easiest Hardy novel to start with; a work like Far from the Madding Crowd or The Mayor of Casterbridge is probably better. However, this should be one of the first Hardy novels anyone reads, and those who have not read him should start immediately. He is not only one of the world's greatest writers but seemingly more relevant and influential with each passing year, and this is a masterpiece of the highest order - essential Hardy, which means it is simply essential."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"He was a poor boy who felt things those around him couldn't feel. He felt pain and compassion towards helpless animals. He levitated while reading books into a charming world of imagination and fantasy; the words that lifted him were the same words others considered boring and complicated. He saw something more, unseen by others, from floating phantasms and phantoms to vivid dreams. Eventually he joined their obscurity, away from the surrounding idle vision and hollow souls.Thomas Hardy's last novel \\"Jude the Obscure\\", tells the story of Jude, a visionary and intellectual orphan growing up with his aunt in the humble town of Marygreen. As we turn the book's five-hundred pages we witness the formulation and maturation of Jude's character and the successive failures and misfortunate events cast upon him.The adjective \\"obscure\\" is not confined to Jude's character; it is rather used repetitively throughout the novel to describe situations, places, circumstances etc... The obscurity manifested in the actions and thoughts of the characters is not part of them, but rather shed upon them from their society and the positions it entitles them to.Such obscurity comes to light when we observe the constant confusions and internal struggles suffered by both Jude and Sue, his lover, soul-mate and cousin. Jude is shattered between his dreams, intellect, religious faith and animal instinct. At one point of the novel he says \\"people go on marrying because they can't resist natural forces, although many of them may know perfectly well that they are possibly buying a month's pleasure with a life's discomfort\\". Jude is shattered between his religious conviction and aspiration of becoming a priest and his human instinct, until at last he decides he was unfit for such vocation and burns all his theological books. At times he regrets reading and studying, as he knows that he would go on being a stone worker, yet his resting hours were always dedicated to his books.Though from the beginning of the novel an aesthetic dreamer, Jude soon discovers that reality encompasses all dreams, hopes and fantasies. The society denied him all chances of happiness. He had thought that if he couldn't get the education he had longed sought, the presence of Sue beside him would condole, or even obliterate, his great loss, but even Sue was collared from him like his career and efforts.Towards the end when Sue threatens to leave him after the significant change in her mentality, Jude wonders in rage \\"Perhaps the world is not illuminated enough for such experiments as ours! Who were we, to think we could act as pioneers.\\" Even though Jude had determination, he wasn't strong enough to contend the multitudinous problems that confronted him and fight long enough for his beliefs.The other character almost equally important as that of Jude's is Sue Bridehead, his cousin. At the beginning of the novel Jude's aunt makes a brief reference of her as a girl who shared Jude's passion for reading. Then when Jude decides to move to Christminister, his aunt tells him that she happens to be there at well. He takes her picture, which he finds very pretty, searches for her, but despite that never dares to go and tell her about their relation. It was she who took the initiative after discovering that he was her cousin.Like Jude, Sue has a distinct character which develops and undergoes significant changes.We see her first as a reckless intellectual who is charmed by -and encourages-men's love to her \\"Sometimes a woman's love of being loved gets the better of her conscience, and though she is agonized at the thought of treating a man cruelly , she encourages him to love her while she doesn't love him at all\\" .However she is repugnant by their sexual desire in her. She sent Jude a letter telling him he can love her if he wants, however even after she went to him she didn't like him kissing her a lot \\"I think I would rather go on living always as lovers, as we are living now, and only meeting by day. It is so much sweeter for the woman at least, and when she is sure of the man\\". It was only when faced by the seriousness and likeliness of Jude's returning to Arabella that she finally agrees to \\"go further\\" and \\" intensify\\" her \\"liking\\" of him by marriage. Unlike Jude, however, Sue didn't have any feelings for Philloston except those of respect ad friendly love. Her brief marriage to him was unbearable and once she chose to throw herself from the window than to have him touch her.Faced by the death of her children ,however, Sue finds herself unable to hold to her convictions and she yields to the religious thought of her society leaving Jude behind.Christminister is the embodiment of mystery. The mystery of dreams. The mystery of time. The mystery of loss. The obscurity of mystery. It is the place that sums up Jude. The place that built him and turned him to an additional edifice of its ancient and glorious architecture. The core of his heart; his Jerusalem; his \\"centre of the universe\\".Arabella and Philloston can be better described as ghosts than as characters. They are the ghosts of past and convention that haunt the freedom of the rebellious couple, following them like shadows so that they look obscure in the eyes of the society. Whether consciously or unconsciously they act with a determination to normalize or destroy them.The only winner at the end seems to be Arabella. The story unfolds with her preparation for marriage amidst the tragedy of a dead Jude and a dying Sue. She was the one capable to be cruel and heartless for her carnal desires within the limits of accepted tradition and social conventionalism. She could murder a pig in cold blood to eat, and lawfully- yet immorally-entrap a man to marry her for her own comfort, support and protection using virtue and weakness as a justification.Jude suffered because he pursued his dreams. In his quest of becoming something more and going out of the gloomy conventional track of his society he lost everything-his children, his love, his life. However a sense of mollification underlies the tragic end of the story, for even though Jude dies after a lifetime of suffering, he dies at an early age, before he could live long enough to witness further humiliation and anguish. It is a romantic ending for someone who searched, someone who tried; someone who was pulled back, and abandoned."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude The Obscure goes against the normal strain in its treatment of topics ranging from marriage, ambition, dreams, and class-society. The book takes shocking twists and turns, and even though the subjects are often depressing, the sheer shock of what has just happened makes you want to read more. Hardy's main character is Jude, a poor, parentless boy whose ambitions far exceed the restrictions his class would put on him. Throughout his childhood he pushed himself in the studies of academia, he would always be seen with Latin books while delivering bread to the villagers. Eventually, as Jude grows he decides to move to Chirstminister-Jude's dream starting from his very early days of youth. Christminister is the center of all academic pursuit and home to the greatest colleges of learning. We follow Jude's adventures there, along with all of his attempts to being admitted into one of these institutions. This is not easy for a young man who has no money or family status behind him. One of Jude's great battles is between his burning desire to achieve higher learning, and his weakness towards women which draw him away from this goal. The elements which Jude's eventual children present, make an outlandish story even stranger by their actions. Certainly Hardy intended the children to present us with some additional lessons to consider while contemplating the book.The book was difficult for me to read, as mentioned in other reviews, the depressing subject matter and gloominess is not inherently an inviting thing. However, by unfolding the story as Hardy did, following the dreams and failures of young Jude, I learned some lessons that I do not think I could have otherwise. I received a strong personal impression in the importance of not giving up on yourself. That even if your opportunities are not optimal, or you environment is not perfect, that you still have the ability to reach for your dreams. And at all costs you should not give up on your dreams, or believe that you are not capable of accomplishing them. I also thought a lot about the acts the society would have us perform, which are not securely right. Having read the book forced me to reflect about the daily choices I make, how many of those are really mine, and how many are artificial restraints institutions would have me believe I must make.While I have read more entertaining books, I would have to recommend this one because of the unique perspective it presents. Hardy message allows us to think about important issues in a light not often seen through."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Obviously Jude the Obscure is a classic and everyone should read it some time.However this version is not the best although not for the reason the previous reviewer described. I do not know if it has been updated since the time of that review but currently, there is no problem with the arrangement of the text on-screen.Unfortunately, Jude the Obscure had many revisions during Thomas Hardy's life and it is unclear which of the editions this copy represents. Additionally Jude is full of obscure (get it?) literary and cultural references that would have been far more decipherable by an 1890s British reader, but that are--sadly--lost on me and most without annotation, of which this version has none.Finally, like most free Kindle editions (and far too many of the full-priced ones), there are no chapter breaks programmed into the text, so it is not possible to flip through the text to find something you have already read. I also have the paperback Oxford World's Classics edition and I don't think I will be able to discard it as a result of getting this version. Still: free is free."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"It seems to me, after reading a couple of Thomas Hardy novels, that although Hardy's stories are rich in narrative, they're working on a more abtract level or meant to convey more universal themes. My impression is that the point of the novel is made in the very title of the book. One doesn't have to consider this story in the context of the 19th century. The same set of circumstances could have occurred in any century. Jude was living his life according to his own values; outside forces played upon his choices, and the results were unfortunately, unhappy for Jude. I guess in today's competitive world where people believe they control every turn of their destiny, it may seem the outcomes in this novel should have been different. But, look again. You'll simply find a man living his life the best way he knows how to."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This was Thomas Hardy's last and most dark (obscure) novels. A true masterpiece! Hardy exells himself in describing every little emotion of Jude and Sue: two outcasts from society, seeking refuge in each others love, but with a grim conclusion. Though, Hardy's extraordinary insight in the souls of his two greatest creations is astonishing, it is the pureness and simpleness of the story that is most striking.This is truly one of the best books I have ever read"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is a tale of a young orphan boy who has a perfect picture of his future painted. Being an orphan, he has very little going for him. He is not shown affection by anyone, especially his caretaker-his great aunt. He is constantly being chastised for the way he lives his life. Because there is not a single significant influence at home, Jude looks elsewhere for guidance and direction. He finds this positive influence in his school teacher, Mr. Phillotson. Jude sees good and potential in this school teacher, and wants to emulate him to the best of his ability. However, Jude comes face to face with his major weak point... a woman. Upon encountering Arabella the pig killer, Jude almost instantly forgets his aspirations of attending Christminster to gain an education and instead decides to marry Arabella.After having sacrificed time, money, and his dream of school, Arabella decides that she is going to leave Jude and move on with life. After drinking away his problems, Jude finally decides to move on and try to accomplish his dream of a Christminster education. It is in this town that Jude finds and falls in love with his cousin Sue. Upon befriending Sue, Jude takes a walk with her to find his old mentor and see how he has fared over the years. During their discussion with Mr. Phillotson, Sue is drawn to him, because he is able to teach her how to be a teacher. Jude worries about this, but has few options. Eventually Mr. Phillotson courts Sue and they are wed. Once again Jude is thrown into a fit of depression and drinking. Eventually Sue grows tired of Phillotson that she pursues Jude. However, staying true to the theme of the book, as soon as you have the person you love, you instantly fall out of love with them-and this happens to Sue.This book is story of more than love, marriage, and the problems associated with each. This book has a deeper meaning that Hardy means to convey. It is a story of life in general. Although love is the underlying theme, there are more problems addressed in the book. Those that have a worthwhile goal in life are rarely able to accomplish their dreams, and even when they do, they aren't happy as they envisioned they would be. This book is one of depression and failure. Somehow Hardy is able to make the worst-case scenario out of nearly every situation. A good read, but there are more uplifting stories out there if that is what the reader is looking for."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"A thought provoking book about the troubles of life in the real world (especially regarding marriage), Thomas Hardy's \\"Jude the Obscure\\" is a worthwhile read. The story is quite good in its own right, though I thought the end to be too abrupt and a little too cynical. I have never in any of Hardy's writings, however, known him to end on a happy note.The book begins with Jude's childhood, when his schoolmaster leaves their small town for the city of Christminster, a college town renowned for learning, where the schoolmaster hopes to become a student. The boy Jude soon resolves to follow his schoolmaster, and obtaining several texts on Greek and Latin (the languages spoken in the colleges of Christminster), he begins his studies with a feverish fascination. As he gains proficiency in these languages and as he slowly obtains books, he expands his studies. Then one day when he is a young man apprenticed to become a stonemason, he meets a young woman named Arabella, who convinces him that he loves her. They have a romantic relationship until Arabella tells Jude that she thinks that she is pregnant. Being honorable, he marries her for the sake of the child, but there is no child after all, and Jude is married to a girl that he soon discovers that he does not love. She makes him neglect the studies he holds so dear and soon they both begin to be quite miserable. Finally, she asks Jude to let her leave him, which he consents to. She moves to Australia and he to Christminster, where he meets another woman who captures his heart. Sue is his lasting love, and though she is his cousin (they had never before met), they fall in love.The book is ultimately one focused around romances. First, there is Jude's romantic and unrealistic dream of going to the city of Christminster and becoming a scholar. And secondly, there is his romance with Sue, a young, intelligent, and independent woman. The first question Hardy asks deals with the first romance and goes something like this: \\"Why does social position stop a man that is otherwise eminently qualified from achieving his dreams?\\" And the second question is \\"Is it better to remain unmarried-always in the state of a lover, giving rather than expecting anything from your companion, or is it better to be married, bound to each other for all of life in order to gain acceptance of men?\\" Jude and Sue are constantly frustrated by the society they dwell in as they try to live out their very unconventional lives together in peace and happiness, taking care to harm no one.The book is very well written, and I enjoyed it more than \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles,\\" another book that I have read that was written by Hardy. I'd recommend this book for deep thinkers and people not afraid of a disappointing ending. Jude and Sue's unconventionality causes you to question what you once held for granted. A careful analysis of those institutions seems necessary after reading \\"Jude the Obscure.\\" I hold that to be one of this novel's greatest values within the world of literature."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"As soon as Thomas Hardy was named as the author, I knew that it was bound to be depressing. However, for a depressing novel, it was quite powerful. Its power lies in the prose laden with Biblical allusions, the contrasting characters of Sue and Arabella and in the universal truths about the thoughts of women and men that it brings to the surface.Hardy is a very eloquent writer. His passages of prose are always meaningful.One of the reasons that his prose in Jude the Obscure is so powerful is because of the allusions that Hardy makes. This book is essentially arguing against the organized religions of his day, but he does it with beautiful Christian allusions. He compares his characters to Christian characters that have done and had similar experiences. It weaves the two books together so that it almost seems that Hardy's characters are really these good Christian people and that the people who belong to the organized Christian church are far removed from the real point of the Bible. His references to the Bible give the text new levels of meaning that simply stating what the character felt like would not have done.Another way that Hardy made his message more powerful was through the use of foiling two characters, Sue and Arabella. They both misuse the protagonist, Jude. Although they are quite different in their backgrounds and mannerisms, they both have the same personality flaws, such as selfishness. Because Hardy made them seem really different from the outset, it makes it all the more noticeable when they start to mistreat Jude in the same way. It is through Hardy's use of devices such as foiling in order to point out character flaws of two totally different women that he is able to point at some fundamental truths about women and men.He foils Sue and Arabella to show some of the defects of women, but he also compares Jude to Phillotson to point out the flaws of the male sex. This was the most intriguing factor in the book to me. There were many times when I would see some of my actions right there before me on the page with a nineteenth century twist. It really didn't feel like Hardy had just written this book in the nineteenth century because there were so many universal truths. But since I knew that he had written it a long time ago it convinced me all the more that what I saw in Hardy's characters that was also in me must be a trait possessed to me degree by all women in all ages. Hardy understood men's and women's timeless character traits well enough that he could create somewhat realistic characters for us to see ourselves in them.Jude the Obscure is worth while if you are interested in exploring the unconventional views of organized religion in the nineteenth century. It is also worth reading for anyone seeking insights into the mind of the opposite sex or why the sex you belong to behaves the way they do."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This tragic book brings forth issues relating to class, love, and marriage. Hardy illustrates the ties they have to one another and the different ways they trap individuals. In the early stages of his life, being in a lower class sets the stage for the traps that Jude will find himself in through out his life. He is limited in the things that he can do, but still he continues to have a goal reaching towards an education, even though it is next to impossible. The desire and the potential preside in him, but the situations he encounters quickly throw his dreams of gaining an education aside. The class barrier once again blocks his path when he falls in love with Sue. At first she marries another as a way to get ahead socially in life. After suffering through that marriage, she turns to Jude. The two never marry and the people of the town find their relationship to be inappropriate, and that situation doesn't better its self after Sue bears two children. The social class barriers that prevail during this time period trap Jude and don't allow him to move on and find the life that he searches for.Jude struggles with relationships and marriage all the way through this book. His affections and marriage to Arabella never have a chance of working because they only touch the surface of true emotion. Arabella's social status is even lower than Jude's so she only marries into a higher social class to benefit herself. There is no true affection, and that results only in misery. His relationship with Sue has the potential to be a great one. But, there are many factors that lead to the deterioration of their relationship. When Arabella returns claiming that Jude has a son that begins to tear apart the relationship that has already been ridiculed by the town people. The attempts to keep their relationship are shattered by the murder and suicide of all Jude's children. Sue leaves Jude and returns to her ex-husband to live out her life in misery and sorrow. Jude's life is ultimately run by these relationships and keeps him trapped until his death.Although I have never read Hardy before, it seems as if his views on marriage are very negative. Every single marriage in the book falls to pieces. None of the characters seem to realize the divinity in marriage. Marriage is just a thing that people do. It's a social trap. At one point in the book Arabella compares her ring to a padlock. From this work it shows that Hardy doesn't even believes that marriage works. None of the characters marry for love; they all marry for social reasons. The thought of giving yourself for the relationship and to build it, never even crosses their minds. I wonder if this same theme crosses over into other of Hardy's works. The never ending mishaps in this book frustrate me. In some ways I felt sympathy for Jude because he couldn't release himself from the women that in a sense hold him captive. But in the end Jude the Obscure is a great tragic tale of a man that never gets the courage to stand up for himself and get what he wants."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Hardy wrote Jude the Obscure at the height of his career. Does the book reflect his mastery? Or does it fall short of his capability? At the time of its publication, Jude (like Tess) received critical admonition from the public: The blatant sexuality and the unfulfilled/unheroic main character won over fanatics and made enemies of literary elites.I picked up this book out of boredom, believing I'd put it down after a few pages. I enjoyed Tess from High School, but Jude for leisure? I was wrong: Hardy's poetic melancholy and rythmic cadence drew me in yet again. I was mesmerized by Jude, Arabella, and Sue. Though their conversations seem forced and some of their characterics unnatural, I felt sympathy for their deterioration and sadness. And in my feeling this, Hardy has accomplished a great poetic influence.I really believe that Hardy could have written a greater Jude the Obscure if he was unhindered by the public. Though his true passion lay in poetry, he had much potential in prose. Too bad this was his last novel..."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"A very good book.It is shocking and disgusting but that is the beauty of the book.The initial part seems like another story of ambition but the twists in the plot shocks you.I started the book thinking it would be another mediveal romance like Hardy's Tess of d'uberviles or Far from the madding crowd but....In fact it is a good book for anyone.Even for those who are quite familiar with the mediveal stereotyped plots, the book is a releif.It is surprising that the book is not so much discussed as many others which are said to be surrealistic.Though the plot is not at all surrealistic, the story would sent us to a sort of frenzy by its sheer twists showing us how irrational rationality can be.It is a must read for anyone intrested in serious literature.Whatever be the contentions against the work , it acts as a link to the Victorian era .Not just the story but the reactions to the book, seen in the victorian era is quite enlightening about the life and times then.Hardy is different here.So a Hardy enthusiast should read this book to get to know another face of the author.The book must be approached with caution and certain level of academic intrest and knowledge about the era.Only then a reader can appreciate the work to its fullest.On the academic viewpoint , i would say on a personal note that even for a non-english, non-european and non-litearture student the book went a long way in giving a glimpse of the life and times of an era and aroused my intrests.Thomas hardy pulls me towards England - to see the great cathredals, to walk throught the moors, to see the rural England. Of course i dont hope to the see the same England that he saw but i can see it through his words and that is enough for me.Probably once i visit, who knows, my dreams might be shattered...."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This has been one of my very favorite books since I was about thirteen... and every time I read it, I still get the same feeling from it. It's very tragically written, in classic Hardy style, where nothing will ever work out as it should... but despite that, you find yourself hoping that it will, even though the doom of the well-written charachters is inevitable. Jude Fawley is a very well-developed charachter, and you don't forget him any time soon. A good read, for perhaps early highschool and older."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"We see women of type &quot;Sue&quot; all time but we never can understand them as was potrayed in the book.

AT the same time that I was really intrigued, I was really glad it was over. I haven't read Hardy for so long. It was a welcome return."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"The issues of marriage, children, passions and revelations of the ordinary dominate this detailed and gripping novel.Hardy's tragic novel leads the reader along the lives of the main character, Jude, and his lover, Sue so well that it's a small wonder that this book hadn't been made into a feature film before this year. This is a book of longing for dreams, but finding only stark reality again and again. Though this point may not be a happy one, Hardy's concern for his characters and their settings make this book impossible for the reader to set down for any length of time. A must read."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Grow up. By the way, you're not a comedian."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Thomas Hardy's final novel, published in 1895 is a TOMEJude the Obscene By TOMEas Haryd"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I have read four of Hardy's novels and loved them but I didn't like this one and didn't even finish it. For one it is not an engaging novel. Usually I can't put Hardy's novels down but I was reluctant to pick this one up. Second Hardy seems to blame \\"society\\" for everything that goes wrong in Jude's life. This is a huge departure for Hardy who normally writes about flawed characters that create their own misery and troubles. Blaming social pressure not Jude's personal acts is a departure from his other books such as The Mayor of Casterbridge.I personally had no sympathy for Jude or the other characters in the book. I also found the anti-marriage theme troubling. Jude chose to enter a relationship with Arabella who was completely wrong for him. People who knowingly enter relationships and then marriages with inappropriate people are completely responsible for the misery that results. Saying that social conformity is a bad thing because it asks men to take responsibility for the offspring they produce is troubling. Yes Arabella tricked him into marriage with a false pregnancy but he chose to become intimate with someone knowing pregnancy was a possibility. Hardy's theme of victimization is so annoying I don't plan to read anymore of his books."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I read this book in high school because my demented English teacher wanted all of us at 16 to share her pain from a lifetime of mistakes. The book horrified me then, and it horrifies me now. As I approach 30 I deal with many of the issues that Jude had. Women, you can't life with them, you can't fit them in a blender. I don't want the resposibility of a family, but don't want to die alone. I think that a lot of my fear of marriage and commitment have to do with this book. Women can and will ruin your life, and getting married is the first day of the end of your life. It is crazy how my life has progressed so far to mirror this book, and I can only imagine that I will marry my current girlfriend that I know is wrong for me, and have a terribly unhappy life where my kids will kill themselves in a closet. Oh, did I put spoilers in? It's an old freaking book Jack so shut your pie hole. Did I manifest this book to become my life story? I don't know, but if I hadn't read it I truly belive that I might have had a chance of being happy in this life."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"(This is a response to Ms. Kate Wiggin's review of JUDE THE OBSCURE in the form of a review of that same book.)Ms. Wiggin,While I firmly believe that your review of HAMLET improved upon my own and deeply appreciate the courage you displayed in directly praising me, I can offer no commendation for your critique-or should I say, exaltation-of JUDE. After reading your review for the ninth time, I have come to the conclusion that it is some strange species of bilge that could easily be classified as unscrupulous toxic waste. You, Ms. Wiggin, strike me as a very dull-witted little girl whose only whetstone probably exists as a rather blockheaded father. I am about to begin my own discussion of JUDE and thus will no longer linger over your writing. Your entire review is comprised of nonsensical cant that both contradicts itself and makes ridiculous, irrelevant references. It deserves no further attention.JUDE THE OBSCUREThis, Hardy's final novel, is in no respect a masterpiece. I cannot imagine a novel in the entire Western Canon that is any worse. All of Hardy's other 13 novels, though exceedingly melancholy, seem to have been written by another person: as with Shakespeare and EDWARD III, Hardy's mark of authorship is absent. Possibly they were written secretly by Hardy's wife, cousin, brother, sister, psychiatrist-who knows?Jude's pursuit and relationship with Arabella throughout a substantial part of the first half of the novel is utterly revolting. His attempt to educate himself is comically hopeless. His love for his cousin Sue is a scene from America's Ozarks. When Hardy tries to make a grand statement on marital intercourse/surplus procreation through Father Time's acts of murder and suicide \\"because we are too menny,\\" it comes across as more grotesque than tragic. In the final pages of the book, the record for the greatest amount of melodrama in one novel is attained. The following is the novel's atrocious finale (speaking of Sue's condition following the death of Jude):\`Well-poor thing, \`tis to be believed she's found forgiveness somewhere! She said she had found peace!'\`She may swear that on her knees to the holy cross upon her necklace till she's hoarse, but it won't be true!' said Arabella. \`She's never found peace since she left his arms, and never will again till she's as he is now!'SUMMATIONIf you share my opinion of this novel/recognize its abundance of faults (i.e., the words), there is no need to despise it. Oscar Wilde once said, \\"One must have a heart of stone to read the death of Little Nell [from Dickens's OLD CURIOSITY SHOP] without laughing.\\" The same should be said of JUDE."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Being an English AP student, I was given this book to read over the summer. I was hoping for a book with at least something enlightening or interesting in it, but I found this book to be nothing more than useless. Nothing can save this book from being what it is: overdramatic and overpraised. Jude is a pathetic loser, Sue has no control over her emotions, and they are both idiots. I was glad when the children hung themselves, as it was the single most entertaining part of the book. Who the hell names a kid \\"Father Time\\" anyway???? A tale of incest and stupidity..... forget it. read this book if you want to punish yourself. This book made me angry and will do so for any reasonable person that picks it up and makes it all the way through."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I agree with Mr. Myers' observations about this book's merit and his mention of its relation to Percy Shelley. I, like Mr. Myers, am substantially smarter than the average reviewer (or moronic AP student), and therefore must say that I am one of the few people who can truly appreciate the unique aestheticism of Hardy's transcendental, impressionistic, amorphous, and quasi-sublime genius.Hardy's novel, though a bit melodramatic and self-conscious in comparison to his better works, still stands, as only Mr. Myers and I can adequately recognize (as I said before), as one of the great monuments of western literature. Jude's progression from an empty life with Arabella, to a sort-lived and star-crossed fling with his cousin Sue, to his ultimate separation and isolation is one of the most heartbreaking stories ever. Hardy related more to Tess than any other character, but still feels a relation to Jude's involuntary attraction to suffering.After the completion of this novel, Hardy, as Mr. Myers told us, wrote poetry that suggested a great deal of Shelley's influence for the rest of his life. I am shocked, though, that no reviewer, not even Mr. Myers or a stupid AP student, mentioned that Hardy turned to poetry after the critics and public ridiculed and castigated him for writing JUDE. I seem to be the only reviewer knowledgeable and well-read enough to know that."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Besides Jude the Obscure, I've read Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge and Tess, both of which fascinated me. I find that although I don't enjoy the plot of the books necessarily, I enjoy reading them so much that I'm not able to put the book down. After I finish reading Thomas Hardy's books, I am left feeling less than enthusiastic for my future, but at the same time renewed with passion to make my future all that it can be. There is an underlying message in all of Hardy's book, one of consequences. Those who sow actions of wrongdoing will eventually reap misery. Jude gives up the things that he wants most for instant gratification."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"An opening word of caution: if you've ever winced at a movie where the bad guy won, leave Jude the Obscure on the library shelf. Because we're not talking about a book where the protagonist merely loses. He loses spectacularly. If you feel cheated because you just found out the ending, don't worry: the first half of the novel will leave you so full of pessimism that you won't be able to accept anything but a tragic conclusion. It is hardly surprising that author Thomas Hardy gave up novel-writing due to the almost universal displeasure voiced by his conservative English readers.The story outlines Jude's progression from ambitious young boy to hopelessly distracted and troubled young man. However, his problems are not used by Hardy to ridicule human weakness, but rather to take pot shots at selected targets, namely women, marriage, and the upper class. Jude himself seems to bear little blame for his misfortunes when the story is finished.The plot and pace of the book often resemble a rookie driver's first attempt at operating a stick shift. Certain parts grind along, taking significant amounts of time without a critical purpose. Others race ahead without warning. The majority of the time period of the central relationship in the story is summarized with a single sentence: \\"Two whole years and a half passed thus.\\" Dialogue seems to be strongly favored to narration, and at times significant energy will be required for the reader to plow through the elaborate conversations of certain characters.The characters themselves are generally convincing, although often maddening. As suggested earlier, Jude really winds up as a tragic hero. While his weaknesses for alcohol and women are hardly ignored, they only serve to emphasize his humanity and evoke greater sympathy. The beginning of the book sets us up for a stereotypical feel-good, rags-to-riches story. As Jude fails in one aspect of life after another, it simply reinforces to the reader that the vast majority of us are condemned by our averageness to lives of mediocrity. Perhaps even more compassion should be poured out to Richard Phillotspon, Jude's childhood mentor and eventual competitor for a woman's love. He makes a very selfless and thoughtful decision on behalf of the said woman, and then suffers a mighty backlash from society. Despite this, he does not regret his choice or complain about having made it.Our two male heroes are sharply contrasted by the feminine presence in the story. Sue Bridehead, the most significant female, makes horrendous decision after horrendous decision throughout, and despite her uncommon education and knowledge, she offers limited justification for any of them. However, her weakness is almost loveable when juxtapositioned with the blatant evilness of Arabella Donn. This woman dupes Jude into marriage by the basest means imaginable at the beginning of the book, and her reappearance at the end of the story only reinforces her true wickedness.Despite his biases, Hardy should be given full credit for his ability to evoke sympathy. The plot, while bordering on being too neat and tidy, is believable enough to give credibility to his arguments. While taking significant time to develop, the storyline is carefully manufactured to defend largely indefensible positions and blame scapegoats in a compelling manner. It seems that Hardy wrote this work to create irritation within the reader, and direct it at the targets of his choice. If this is the case, then his mission is accomplished. In light of that fact, it is pretty obvious why it was not wildly popular at its first publication. However, if you are one who enjoys being irritated, this book is definitely for you."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"At no risk of giving away the ending, I'd say Jude the Obscure isn't a gem, but its worth reading. Aren't we just swamped with depressing novels coined \\"great classics\\" from the middle ages and on? They are all full of dejection, tragedy, mortality and painful plots. Well, Jude is no exception. It falls into the ranks of these sorrowful books, containing nothing extraordinary (like some happiness) other than its unorthodox morals. Was anyone ever happy back in the ol' days? According to classical literature, no. Jude the Obscure is another masterful way to induce discouragement and bleakness...well done Mr. Hardy, you've done it again.At the same time, if you can handle just one more sufferable novel, I'd recommend Jude...and if you like sappy soap-operas, I'd definitely recomment Jude. Admittably, the story is highly intriguing with a rich plot defined by rich diction. Hardy is a marvelous writer, and you won't be left unfulfilled after reading him. Maybe a little depressed...but not unfulfilled. It is hard to not become twisted into the plot, angered by the characters, mesmorized by Jude's myths, and lost in the fluent descriptions. Symbolism and good literature is appreciated as well as enjoyed...but I'm tempted to stamp on the cover \\"Another Depressing Classic\\" so a bunch of trendy humanists can gawk over it and talk about human suffering with herbal tea in their hands.

I couldn't relate to the characters at all. Except maybe Arabella. Jude and Sue were tremendously sad characters. Jude was obviously an intellegent man, but idiotic in his view of Sue. Sue was a sorceress, contented only when messing up other people's lives and leaving them broken-hearted. Though very well-written and to some extent heartfelt, Jude to me was a classic with poor morals and suicidal mortals."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude The Obscure is a heart-rending, tragic tale about an ordinary, rural boy, who seeks to make his name at Christminster (Oxford) university. His aspirations to learn are readily felt by the reader and the heartache felt by Jude on being refused admission to learn is only a beginning to the tragic tale that Hardy sets out hereafter. Having experienced an unsuccessful marriage with Arabella, who could not sympathise with his desire to read and learn, the reader is forever hopeful that he will eventually find somebody who is able to share his ambitions and respect his sensitive nature. It is this hope that stays with the reader throughout the remainder of the book. Jude and Sue's story, though more tragic in its day, still strikes a chord with anybody able to sympathise with the horrible irony of their situation. Although standing outside of society and detesting the morals and conventions of the time, both Jude and more so, Sue, cannot fight against the poverty th! ey are pushed into or the religious teachings that they have been brought up believing. It is their poverty that leads Jude's son to hang both himself and Jude and Sue's other children and it is this same poverty and the tragedy of the children's death that forces them apart. The children's death to Sue signals that her and Jude should not be together but have responsibilities to their past (once again Hardy's attack on the damage caused by religion). Their 'forbidden' love labelled as such because of the religious Victorian morals only serves to increase their poverty as Jude's chances of either securing a successful job or gaining admission to Christminster become ever more few - exposing the class-ridden society for what it meant to its victims. Hardy's only fault in writing Jude the Obscure is to expose too harshly the innate weakness of Sue (who seems unable and unprepared to throw off the shackles of Victorian society) and the inability of Arabella to empathise with ! Jude's desire to go to Christminster."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I never thought something could upset me this much.

This is one of my favorites from Thomas Hardy."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I greatly prefer Far From The Madding Crowd and Tess of The D'Urbervilles to Jude The Obscure. The misconception of Hardy as a cruel bringer of doom and gloom is based on this novel. Unlike FFTMC and TOTDU, there are no happy blissful moments in Jude the Obscure- simply non-miserable ones.Jude is a working class country boy who dreams of studying at Christminster (Oxford). Jude is thinking with something but it isn't his head when he marries buxom country wench Arabella Donn and pursues his free-spirited cousin Sue Bridehead. He is constantly distracted from his books by his baser needs and the only saying that his family are not made for marriage. His tragedy is his obscurity- like so many of Hardy's characters, he dares to be awkward and pays the price.Jude himself is rather feeble-headed but one can empathise with his fervent dream to study at Christminster, which he is not suited for and is not the paradise he believes it to be. I like Sue Bridehead although her frigidity isn't really explained- though to be honest, it was daring enough of Hardy to explore behind the bedroom doors. We have to wait for DH Lawrence to publish Sons and Lovers before we get a book like that. Arabella is an interesting character- in one respect, she's the typical country wench, arousing Jude's baser needs but in another way, she represents the country lad in him, that rough and uncultured part which he keeps trying to flee from yet keeps coming back to torment him. She is spiteful, uncouth, selfish, and at two points in the novel shows extreme moments of cruelty. However, both women are very spirited in the Hardy manner.What I miss from Jude The Obscure is Hardy's descriptions of the country. At times they went on a bit but a lot of the time they were beautiful and evocative, such as the opening chapter of The Return of The Native. Instead of the passion and spirituality Hardy usually associates with the country, the country represents the things that will always hold Jude back. There are some nice descriptions of Christminster but they're not on a par with the country ones. Hardy seems troubled by his previous assertions and his desire to tackle the injustice of society, outside of his usual landscape, means that although the novel is comparatively accessible in light of other writers of the period, it is not his most accessible work. If you're a Hardy beginner, start with Far From The Madding Crowd, or Tess, if you have a strong constitution.The critics hated the novel, nicknaming it Jude the Obscene. It openly (well, as open as you can be in the nineteenth century) explores sexuality and Hardy dares to write a male protagonist whose feebleness is overshadowed by the brilliance of the female characters. Men identified with Jude- and they didn't want to."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Thomas Hardy beautifully portrays rural English life during the late 19th century. Having spent time in south England, it is easy to feel absorbed in the places and times brought to life in this novel. The characters feel very real."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"In the postscript to the preface of Jude The Obscure, Thomas Hardy quotes a German reviewer of the novel. Sue Bridehead, the heroine, was described there as \\"the first delineation in fiction of the woman ... of the feminist movement - the slight pale \`bachelor' girl - the intellectualised, emancipated bundle of nerves\\" that modern conditions were producing. The book's reception \`cured' Hardy of the desire to write another novel, and all of the above happened before the dawn of the twentieth century.Jude The Obscure is a novel about relationships within marriage. Hardy's opinion was that legal ties between men and women ought to be breakable once the union had achieved dysfunction. It was an opinion that differed from that expected by the age. It prompted a bishop to burn the book, rather than the writer, who was unavailable at the time.Thomas Hardy's Jude Fawley was adopted into a baker's family, and harboured an ambition to self-teach himself into a classical education in Christminster's learned colleges. His schoolmaster, Mr Phillotson helped a little. Jude's ambition was always somewhat far fetched, though he applied himself diligently to his studies and achieved a great deal. In his formative years, he also learned the stonemason's trade to allow the earning of a living. On a country walk he then took up with Arabella, the daughter of a pig farmer. Having found himself stuck, he tried to learn how to stick real pigs but somehow the penetration never came easy. The couple parted, apparently childless.Sue, Jude's cousin and thus a co-member of a family reputed for its marital failures, was always a soul mate for the young man. But she never quite seemed up to the task of giving herself, giving of her self. Thus, when she married Phillotson, the much older, staid and perhaps already failed schoolmaster, his lack of demands on her fit exactly with her assumptions about how married life would progress.Sue certainly knew what she wanted from life and did everything in her power to secure it. Safety, security, respectability, perhaps property were top of her list. Arabella, the pig farming barmaid who lured the nave Jude, was similarly single-minded in pursuing her own, rather different interests. After leaving Jude, she takes up with a new man and hops it to Australia, apparently for good.Sue and Phillotson finally dissolve their marriage by mutual consent to allow Sue to pursue her desires. She and Jude, who love one another dearly, then make their lives together. They do not marry. They live as brother and sister, with lust on one side of the bed and revulsion on the other. A child arrives by train. The wizened-looking boy is Jude's, Arabella claiming she was pregnant before the couple separated. Sue and Jude offer a home for the waif, and then two more whose family fortunes have fallen on bad times.And then tragedy appears. Their world falls apart. Sue craves the responsibility of marriage, perhaps merely for the respectability she has lost, so she returns to a new marriage with Phillotson. As before, it's just for the show of it. Jude develops consumption.What happens in Jude The Obscure is the meat of the book. How it happens is less important than how the characters justify their actions, effectively their reactions to what life offers in response to their imagined aspirations. How these people seek to justify themselves tells much of what they think is expected of them by others, by the society at large. Thus the novel appears to be a study - even a treatise - in selfishness melded with self-obsession, but this is always shrouded in a coded justification that cites the need for social, societal, even sanctified heavenly approval.In many ways, Jude The Obscure's men are its victims, its women coldly triumphant, its tone vaguely misogynist. It has little time for the establishment, which is often portrayed as a conspiracy to promote misery. Christminster, Oxford in other words, is thought of as a great centre of high and fearless thought. But in reality it is \\"a nest of commonplace schoolmasters whose characteristic is timid obsequiousness to tradition.\\" The alternative, self-congratulatory selfishness did not appear to be much better. Thus Jude The Obscure has much to say about our own time, about public virtue and the need to live according to the socially expected."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"The book is new and arrived sooner that I expected.Thank you for include a book mark. Everytime I buy something here, Im so happy. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This is the second of Hardy's novels I have completed reading, the first being Tess of the D'Urbervilles. The latter was an instant favorite of mine and I can now say Jude the Obscure joins that category.Jude, poor Jude, aspires to be a scholar despite his meager upbringing of being orphaned and raised in a low income household. His intrinsic pursuit of happiness and determination is marked by his complete devotion to learning and acquiring worldly knowledge, with ecclesiastical texts being a close second. The supremely mental and spiritual pursuits of Jude eventually are sidetracked by his human, fleshly nature, which is one consistent theme prevalent in the novel. There are a lot of contrary themes, really, representative of the duality of human nature: Christianity counters Paganism, the battle of spirit versus flesh, marriage and single hood, pragmatical against emotional, ecstasy and despair, etc.The book is relative even to this day and age because Hardy captures the internal human struggle very accurately. There are plot twists that you get hints to, almost intuitively, but the execution of these changes catch you by surprise.It is depressing and tragic, there is no doubt, and has a sobering effect on the reader. You want Jude to find the happiness he's longed for and to see his dreams comes to fruition after all his sacrifices.When I finished the book, I thought back to those first pages of it when Jude is a naive young boy and had his future spanned in front of him. The Jude who had hopes and dreams and who had no semblance of what will befall him in his coming years. I couldn't help but then think to myself, \\"What if?\\""},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Ah, the novel that made Thomas Hardy stop writing. When this novel was first published, it was so controversial it is said that the Bishop of Wakefield publicly burned it. I can definitely see why. This novel questions not only marriage and the laws of the time, but also religion, the class system, and society in general. Add suicide to that and you have yourself quite a book for 1895. Although shocking at times and still relevant today, it doesn't quite have the impact now that it did then. It would be too hard to give a brief summary without giving away some major plot points, so I won't even try. I will say that I'm not always fond of the classics that I've read, but I think this one is a really good book. The old writing style gets a little annoying at times, but the storyline makes up for it. This is a not a book for the faint of heart. It's sad, depressing, and tragic. If you're looking for something light and happy, don't choose this one."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I very much enjoyed the beginning of the novel. However, toward the end, things became a little too dark. I'd been warned that it was Hardy's darkest, but was still unprepared for the plot twists.Hardy's word choice, foreshadowing, and imagery were very entertaining, but the plot was unenjoyable towards the end. Character motivation also was rather abstract. I had to read this book for my Eng102H class, and if I had picked it out for pleasure reading, I would not have finished it. It was obscure to say the very least."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Parts of this novel affected me very deeply and really broke my heart. One grisly scene near the end of the book is the most horrifying I've read since Capote's In Cold Blood. The little child, nicknamed \\"Father Time,\\" is one I will never forget. It makes us ponder on just how many children are born feeling that they are unwanted. Sad, very sad. But Hardy tugs our heartstrings to make us more conscious of the suffering in the world. If we ignore it, it will never get better.Most of Hardy's novels are very \\"modern\\" in tone and style. The plot rushes along at a fast clip and Hardy's message is loud and clear. He wants us to try really hard to make this a better world for the kids, and for ourselves. It's a beautiful, but very disturbing, little gem of literature."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"The edition of \\"Jude the Obscure\\" that I believe you're seeing on this page -- the Signet paperback, with the two horses on the cover -- first came out in '61 and hasn't been touched since then (except to add a bibliography in 1980). There is a helpful 11-page afterword by Al Alvarez, but that's it. Signet has just been reissuing and reissuing the same thing for over four decades.With the Signet, though, there are no footnotes; you're just getting the bare text. That means that you'll have zero help with Hardy's rustic or ecclesiastical terms, not to mention the abundant Latin.In short, get this one:Jude the Obscure (Oxford World's Classic), in which said defect is remedied. And unlike the Signet, in which the text has adjusted to reflect modern spelling and pronunciation, the Oxford's World's Classics is Hardy's original text as he saw it published."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I found the first part of the book to be pretty interesting; here is a nonconformist couple bucking the weight of Victorian mores and standards to live life according to their inner callings--actually, to live life in a way that's much taken for granted today--and I wondered what Hardy would do with them. I was pretty certain he wouldn't write a polemical celebration of nonconformist freedom like, e.g., D.H. Lawrence. Though this is my first Hardy novel (I don't count having read Return of the Native in high school or watching Roman Polanski's \\"Tess\\"), I'd read enough of his poetry to conclude he had a dark and gloomy side, mournful and fatalistic, an unerring instinct for turning things toward misery and loss...So there was a bit of suspense for me to see what Hardy would do with these free spirits of his who more or less reflected worldviews of his own.Well, without getting into the grisly details (in an effort not to spoil any of the plot's surprising twists), let's just say that in the second half of the book Hardy pulls out all the stops and sets Jude and his true love Sue down a path of unremitting grief, loss, and bewilderment. Hardy appears to be shooting for drama on the scale of Greek tragedy, with Jude confirming as much by likening himself to Agamemnon. The problem for me is that this story--two individuals clashing with the mores of Victorian England--is just not a stout enough framework to hang all the extreme emotions and heavy drama that Hardy unleashes. Jude and Sue have, as a couple, simply flouted Victorian morality by getting divorces and living together; and Jude, individually, had the gall to think that he, a working-class lout, could gain entry into the hallowed halls of English higher learning. I kept wondering why they didn't just pull up stakes, forsake small-town life and move to London where people wouldn't care as much. But Hardy turns it all into a transgression against cosmic law (at least that becomes Sue's view of things), requiring cosmic revenge through a tragic turn of events--again, like Greek tragedy.The problem for me is that Hardy's made it pretty clear in the first part of the book he thinks societal norms about marriage and class are hidebound, stifling, and absurd. For the first part of the book they're mere social constructs that are worthy of scorn and rebellion; then they suddenly become eternal values, the violation of which results in awful, tragic consequences.I wondered if Hardy was just making fun of Victorian morality, skewering its self-importance by inflating it to the inappropriate level of high tragedy. But Hardy is too believable a dramatist for one to conclude that all the howling and agony are there just for sport. The drama may be more than the situation justifies, but it's compellingly and artfully written. The moral of the tale seems to be, then, that those who flout society are doomed to a tragic end. Or maybe just that this particular couple was doomed to a tragic end for flouting society. Either way, I find it pretty unconvincing.It's too bad that Hardy couldn't have drawn more on the satirical in his writing; it appears he had a wry sense of humor. One description of marriage (between Jude and Arabella): \\"The landlord of the lodging...had doubted if they were married at all...till by chance overhearing her one night haranguing Jude in rattling terms, and ultimately flinging a shoe at his head, he recognized the note of genuine wedlock; and concluding that they must be respectable, said no more.\\" Hardy also seems to be giving a bit of a wink with names he uses: \\"Sue Bridehead\\" for the most reluctant bride on earth; \\"Sarcophogus College\\" for one of the dreary, morbid schools at Christminster; \\"Mildew Lane\\" as the address of gloomy lodgings in which Sue stays; and \\"Temperence Hotel\\" where Jude and Arabella are anything but temperate.But these instances of humor are mere blips on the screen in \\"Jude\\". Hardy seems determined to cast his story in terms of sin and retribution, drenched in misery and anguish. It seemed overplayed, hence unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is easily one of the best-written stories I have read in a long time. You will probably think Jude and Sue are so weird they are from another planet. In a way, you are right.It may help you understand it a bit better if you think of it this way:Jude has Asperger's syndrome. Sue is a \\"Highly Sensitive Person\\" (HSP).On top of these problems, Jude is a young boy ready to have sex but not mature enough to be married and have responsibilities. His cousin Sue is a young girl ready to \\"be loved\\" but unready to have sex.Life repeatedly rushes Jude and Sue into the very things they are unprepared for and things get VERY bad quickly. The author, who obviously has baggage, is trying to make a case against marriage.I found myself caring for these characters, even though I knew that the story could not possibly end well. I found myself vomiting when the murder takes place.Do not read this book unless you are willing to have your traditional values unseated very painfully."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I watched the movie \\"JUDE\\" when I was a kid and ever since was stranged by it. I recently read the novel and to be honest, was very depressed from it. And I am and have always been a tomboy, someone who is hardly ever emotional... This book was one emotional trip due to many of its themes, as so many other reviewers here interminably wrote about and so I won't go into the many tradegies of Jude's life. I very much felt, and sympathized for both Jude and Sue and related to their harsh society they had lived in and that we delude ourselves to have changed since 1895. Because I did see the movie (and I must say that, even though it deviated from the book, it was nevertheless suitably done), I wasn't so much surprised by the chain of events. Many here criticized the bleak, grim tale of Hardy's \\"Jude the Obscure\\" on several specific events, but for me, I found the very ending of the book to be the saddest, austerest part of it(spoilers). Jude's death, I felt, was the Hardy's most horrendous, picturesque description of the ill guy I came to love and admire, lying in a couch, coughing and wishing his death. Regretting ever being born, Jude is alone (sueless) on his deathbed, feeling the warm wind of summer as it drifts in the room bringing with it musical notes from a graduation ceremony he himself never had the option to attend. The one thing I am not closed on, is the title for the book, which to my understanding was the third and final. But as my sister asked me: \\"why the obscure?\\" I answered I thought it was Hardy's mockery of society by naming its absurdity. This is because as one very fast realizes when reading this book, it is not Jude that is obscure, but rather society is, for forcing people unto structures, institutions and ways of life that from their foundations were never executable. I recommend this book to people who are emotionally stable."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This is a harrowing story about one man's utter helplessness against the winds of destiny. Jude is an orphan boy with a vision and a passion for life that is cruelly challenged and ultimately thwarted by forces beyond his control. His is a tale of fortune and fate, of desire and despair.But what struck me most was what I took to be the novel's sub-theme: unrequited love. I wonder if this is what Hardy sought to convey through his subtheme: that love, though it seeks to transcend the loneliness of life, is itself always a lonely endeavor--never fully mutual because it is inherently unequal."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"\\"Jude, the obscure\\" was almost Thomas Hardy last book. When it was published in 1895, the novel received reviews that were so negative that the writer resolved never to writer another novel. But there is a reason for such a negative reception of the novel. This book attacks some of the most important institutions for the British: education, social class and marriage. His narratives are known for the tragic heroes and heroines who are in the service of his critical tone. In this book it is not different. The title's Jude isn't the only one used for this purpose. Hardy creates one of his best characters in the book: the free-spirited Sue Bridehead.Love and tragedy walks hand in hand in \\"Jude, the obscure\\". Jude Fawley dreams of going to a university. But he is an orphan raised by his working-class aunt, who can't afford. He is lead to a career as a stonemason. Although inspired by the ambition of town schoolmaster, Jude can't leave the village after marrying a young woman named Arabella. But their marriage didn't work, she moves to Australia.But another woman will touch his heart. He meets his cousin Sue, and tries no to fall in love with her. She is going to marry shortly. But she is not happy with her husband, and leaves him to live with Jude. But the problems are just begining in Jude's life.Hardy's narrative deals with characters living in a circle of self-erected oppression that they cannot break free. The society, that cannot accept their rejection of convention, is the main cause of this oppression. As people who chose their will, Jude and Sue are ostracized. The fact of the society doesn't accept their marriage is one of the main causes of their tragedies.Jude's obsession with education, going to Christminster University becomes more and more important toward the end of the book. Alongside with Sue, college represents the thing Jude aspires but can't have.With \\"Jude, the Obscure\\", Thomas Hardy created an allegory of the ties that society uses to keep people in the place it wants us to be. His writing is evocative and his characters very human, aspiring common things that fall short when a repressive society is ruling."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"In my own personal quest to read as many of the \\"classics\\" as possible I picked this one up some years ago after seeing it referred to by many critics and writers as a beacon of excellent prose. I was pulled into Jude's world almost immediately and it took a while to escape it completely when I had finished the book. It's not pessimistic, it's just that Jude lives a tragic life and Hardy expresses it to the fullest. This book started me on a quest that didn't end until I had devoured each of his other novels and a biography of his life. As good as the others were, this one tops them all."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Thomas Hardy has much to offer the reader in this, his final novel before he committed himself full-time to poetry. It caused a storm of controversy when it was first published before the end of the 19th century. With its frank (but not graphic) descriptions of sexuality and its emphasis on the fact that only the two people involved need to consent to a relationship--not their priest or minister, not their families, and certainly not society as a whole--\\"Jude\\" shocked the public. It stands now as a beautifully sustained character study of a broken man and his steadfast love for the unsure Sue. Jude is a rock and it is fitting that he makes his living carving stone. Sue is birdlike, dainty, emotionally unstable and absolute catnip to Jude. Beyond this, they are distantly related and that adds a certain fillip to their interactions. The impatient reader will have difficulty understanding Jude's unwavering devotion, but it is evidence of Hardy's skill that he makes Jude make sense."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I just returned to this novel after twenty-five years: I first read it as an undergraduate and found it rather depressing, even slightly morbid. Well, it's still pretty dark, but the drama of thwarted desire and misplaced passion resonates, for a middle-aged reader, in a way I never imagined as a teenager--when the future seemed limitless. Then, too, there is the language, the ebb and flow of sentences, the rythmic exactitude of descriptions. If nothing else, Hardy reminds you that even the most critically-acclaimed novelists currently writing in English are still just kidding around."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"&quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; is the story of the self-destructive foolishness of the highly gifted Jude Fawley (ryhmes with 'folly'), which gradually takes him from a chance to become an Oxford scholar in spite of his provincial upbringing to a pitiful death it is better not to mention. This book is a well drawn example of a tragic waste of life and of great gifts, and as such it can be seen as a masterpiece of moralism in literature. It is hardly one of my favorite books, protraying as it does the brutal self ruination of high promise, but it does not lack in quality what it is missing in consolation."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obcure is really a book about life. It involves Jude's search for happiness. Of course, he never quite achieves happiness because something is always in the way-preventing him from being happy. He starts out as a young lad living with his working-class aunt, dreaming that one day he may study at Christminster. The problem is as he grows he falls in love with a devilish girl named Arabella who tricks him into marrying her. Inevitably the marriage goes sour and he goes to Christminster, while she moves to Australia. Jude then meets his cousin Sue. He sets her up with Phillotson and they get married. Sue is then not happy and leaves to live with jude. As you can see this is really just a soap opera, but isn't life really just one big soap opera. Arabella then comes back to Jude with a son in Australia. Basically Jude feels responsibility to go back to Arabella and Sue goes back to Phillotson. Jude then dies soon after.It's quite interesting how Hardy devises his plot. It's quite a dark novel, filled with every character's problems. Through this book we see that what society thinks is the right thing to do isn't always best for everyone. The climax of the book is a horrifying murder-suicide of Jude's children. This is no doubt a book that makes you think about the psychological aspect of life. It's a good read if you like the fact that none of the problems actually get resolved and trying to solve problems only makes new ones."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"The story is such that you feel that the tragedies and the emotions he depicts are always possible even if they are to the extremes. Love between Jude and Sue is looked down upon but this story has evolved beautifully on this love. I bet Hardy was criticised in his time although now people get to enjoy this story."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Spend the whole book feeling sorry for Jude, if that was the goal of the author fine, but never really got to the point that I could recommend this to others, sorry. Just left me flat."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is the last novel written by Thomas Hardy, about a young stone craftsman (Jude) living in Wessex, England, who dreams of studying at Oxford University and for that purpose moves to the town. But he cannot afford to pay tuition and is turned away. In the meantime, he is seduced by an earthy barmaid (Arabella) into a disastrous marriage. He then falls in love with his cousin, the sexless intellectual rebel (Sue) who is already married to his former teacher (Phillotson). Jude and Sue run away together and try to form a life, but it's plain that they are doomed.From start to finish, the novel is imbued with foreboding, doom, and human weakness. Hardly a light of humorous moment is to be found. Although it was written in the 1890s, there is barely a hint of modernity. It may well have taken places in the 1700s or even 1600s. Harding attempts to critique the Victorian conservative morals of his day, strictly interpreting marriage, as well as its class stratification denying advancement to Jude. To fit his tragedy, he must create numerous partial, incomplete characters, including a frightening little boy known as \\"Father Time\\" who seems more like a zombie than a person.Hardy's passionate invective against Victorianism was clearly needed, and before his time, given the harsh reaction to this book, which resulted in him being ostracized and banned from writing. But to the modern reader, it is utterly incomprehensible. The characters seem to fret and fro endlessly and bring themselves to tears over nothing. Because society has changed so much since the 1890s, the central drama and conflict of the novel no longer makes sense to the modern reader. A firm historical background in Victorian conventions is needed to be wholly understood before one can make sense of this book. Numerous references to English and Classical writers are also made which may be unfamiliar. In short, it is no longer relevant to to-day."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"If you fell that you are so happy and you are looking for something to put you in depression, this novel will be a good choice. It is about a guy (Jude) full of ambitions since his childhood and the through the pages, you will read that he lose them one by one. I don't know why I kept reading it to the last page, maybe it was some commitment as I purchased the book. I read the novel after that I couldn't understand totally some events occurred in the last edition of movie for the novel. I am looking now for a comedy novel to relief me from pain of depression caused by this story."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is a depressing book. Thomas Hardy portrays the main character, Jude, as a man with no morals and no backbone. The novel is full of immorality, beginning when Arabella reveals she is pregnant just to get Jude to marry her. Later in the book, Jude and Sue live together and have children, but they do not marry. These instances highlight the immorality and wickedness portrayed in the novel. Another quality Jude possesses is the lack of a backbone. He lets women run over him and tell him what to do. They also trick him and lie to him.Another thing I do not like about this book are the characters in general. None of them seem to have any redeeming qualities. There is no character that I liked. Each character has many evil things about him or her, and they lack positive traits. Arabella can be described as a \\"woman of the world\\" without feelings and sympathy. Sue appears at first to be a good, moral person, but she turns out to play with Jude's thoughts. Jude is just a miserable man who lacks courage.This book is full of tragedy and misery. It is inevitable the reader will feel sorry for Jude. I caught myself saying \\"Awww, poor Jude\\" many times throughout the novel. Then at times I would remember he brought much of the tragedy on by his own actions.Hardy's attitude to his novel is unclear. When reading the book, we are taken through Jude's life, and we witness many things that seem to only affect Jude. Even though we are allowed to enter into the consciousness of the other characters, their motivation seems based on selfishness. The book is full of lies and deceptions. There is no serenity, peace, or understanding in the novel. It seems like the world is moving so fast, and when Jude attempts to comprehend what is going on, he is left behind.Love has the power to create suffering or happiness. In this book, the tension of the love relationship is increased when a third party comes into the picture. Without the presence of Phillotson, Jude and Sue's relationship may have been quite simpler. She may have seen marrying Jude as the right thing to do. They could have gotten married and could have been a happy couple. Hardy did not let this happen; he chose to leave the reader with the dark view of love.The only thing that redeems this book in any way is one of the themes it contains. This is the marriage theme, which is ambiguous in the novel. One could suppose Hardy's view of marriage is one of abhorrence. This may be because of Jude's cynical view of the issue. On the other hand, marriage can also be seen as a good thing because if Jude would have gotten married for the right reasons and if he really wanted to, he would not have married Arabella in the first place. Plus, great tragedy comes from the decision not to marry Sue, but to live with her and pretend they were married. I agree with the second view of marriage. I like how Hardy leaves it up to the reader to decide which view he has of marriage. This is probably the only thing I like about the book."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"After finishing Jude the Obscure, the reader is left with many questions that ask how Jude's life could have gone so haywire. He is caught in a love triangle with two unstable women, who ultimately keep him from his life-long dream, of receiving an education in the town of Christminster. He finally comes together with the woman he truly loves, yet she constantly pushes him away, not ready to give him her entire heart in return. One of Hardy's themes in Jude the Obscure, is that of love, but the primary focus and theme in the book is on marriage.Jude marries the trampy Arabella in his early 20's. She is in an even lower social class than he is and doesn't understand or care about Jude's educational goals in Christminster. Their relationship is mainly based on physical attraction and is void of any real commitment and mutual respect. Arabella leaves Jude, fleeing to Australia, leaving Jude the opportunity to set his sights on Christminster.In Christminster, Jude falls madly in love with Sue, his cousin and a schoolteacher. Sue resists Jude's affection at first, and marries Phillston, as a way to boost her education and career. Her marriage to Phillston is miserable. Sue is completely repulsed by him, and refuses to even sleep in the same quarters. Phillston grants Sue the option to leave and they divorce. Jude's divorce with Arabella is also finalized, thus leaving Sue and Jude free to marry. Yet they never do.The town is very judgmental and unaccepting of Jude's and Sue's relationship, especially when they have two children out of wedlock. At around this time, Arabella comes crawling back to Jude and says that they have a son. So, Jude and Sue then take his son in their care, while Arabella runs off again. Father Time, Jude's son, is very insecure and disturbed. In his situation, what kid wouldn't be? Yet, Jude and Sue fail to realize the extent of his depression and insanity.Sue walks into the house one morning, to find that Father Time has hanged their two children as well as himself. This horrific event makes Sue believe that her relationship with Jude is cursed and that the deaths of their children was a punishment from God. To do penance for her immoral behavior, Sue leaves Jude and goes back to Phillston, believing she doesn't have a right to be happy. Jude returns to Arabella, becomes sick and dies, heartbroken.Hardy obviously isn't a fan of the instiution of marriage and makes that clear in Jude the Obscure. Marriage is a trap for both Jude and Sue. Perhaps it was Sue's horrible marriage with Phillston that made her so reluctant and unwilling to marry Jude. In the end, both felt tied down to their previous spouses and forced to return to their own unhappy marriages.I really didn't like this book, perhaps I'm somewhat an idealist and believe that Jude and Sue could have gotten their lives together, as a couple. Jude is such a pushover. He never really stands up for himself, or does what he wants. His life is run by two unstable women, who never think much about anyone else but themselves. If you like tragedies, you'll love Jude the Obscure, which is a series of tragedies one right after the other."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Probably a book best read in the depths of a deep and dark winter - I found it way too depressing. Although I can enjoy 'bleak' as much as the next man, this book just does not do 'bleak' well (try Patrick White for that). It is simply dull and depressing. By way of example, the character development is poor, surprising for quite a long book - the major characters never emerge much beyond cardboard cut-outs, set in variations of their unconventional ways. Honestly, I found myself wanting to slap them with a \\"get over yourselves!\\" Hardy's prose does take you to the time and place, however many other authors \\"do the nineteenth century\\" better (Dickens, Eliot, Gaskell). And far too much of the dialogue in this book was tedious and unrealistic.In terms of themes, Hardy has a bit of a rant over the hypocrisy of established religion, the inaccessible ivory towers of tertiary education and the stigma of non-conforming - but really, most of the troubles experienced by the characters seem self-inflicted or exacerbated by their shallow, self-destructive natures, which detracts from the points Hardy was presumably trying to make. Unfortunately, for me, this book does not resonate. I will try another Hardy, as I expect this book may not have been one of his better efforts - certainly not in the realms of great literature as claimed by some reviewers. I suggest readers try Silas Marner as a much more effective piece in the 'self-effacing man' genre.For Kindle users - the book format was fine, presumably the problems noted by previous reviewers have been fixed."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is a novel typical of those written in its time period in England. When I had read fifteen pages into the first chapter, I turned to the title page to see the date-1895. That's correct, this is the time period of The Scarlet Letter fame. For those who are unfamiliar with The Scarlet Letter, it was written in the mid-1850s. The Scarlet Letter would have made an excellent short story of about twenty-five to thirty pages. It made for an extremely dry, slow novel. Jude the Obscure impressed me immediately as following after the same tradition. The difference: Jude the Obscure is twice the length.Remarkably, however, Thomas Hardy manages to salvage his style. Before too long, I was actually drawn into the tragic story of Jude. He began as a character I could closely identify with. He was born into a working-class family, and he had lofty dreams of a life of distinguished intellectual greatness. He taught himself almost everything that he knew of higher learning, and planned to move to a place where he could be formally trained.Of course, none of this works out; otherwise, it wouldn't be much of a story. To cut it short, Jude fell in love with Arabella (whom he met when she threw pig parts at him), got her pregnant, and gave up his childhood dreams for a marriage with her. After all, Jude says, \\"it was better to love a woman than to be a graduate, or a parson; ay, or a Pope!\\" The remainder of Jude is largely a recounting of his tragic sexual and marital relations with his cousin Sue and later, with Arabella again.It is difficult for me to sympathize with the pathetic Jude or even credit him as a character by the end of the story. Here is a man who is so determined that he teaches himself languages; he studies tirelessly in an effort to prepare for university. His character is strong. Yet in a matter of weeks he decides that he doesn't care anymore. I've seen men distracted by women before, but he wholeheartedly dumped his dreams and ambitions in favor of a pretty woman with a pig bladder. From there he proceeds rapidly downhill for 350 pages, personifying every possible malfunction of marriage.This malfunctioning marriage seems to be the sole unifying theme of Jude. Yet it is difficult to put a finger on just what Hardy is trying to say with his story. If he were trying to display all of the shortcomings of marriage, why would Sue, who self-righteously opposed marriage as an unnecessarily binding bunch of paperwork, wind up back sharing a bed with her first husband? If he were using the trouble that came to Sue and Jude by trying to live out of wedlock as a tool to show the power and security of real marriage, why is Sue portrayed as being so unhappy to return to Phillotson, her first husband?All in all, Jude the Obscure was just not my kind of book. I visited the local paperback exchange a week ago and picked up a few novels by Isaac Asimov. In the author's note, Asimov stated what has become an inspiration to me in my writing (many will recognize this as similar to a famous saying by Twain):\\"I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing-to be clear. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer Prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics- Well, they can do whatever they wish.\\"If only Thomas Hardy could make up his mind on what he wants to say and say it, I think we could all be spared an incredible and thought-stifling novel."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"thomas harding's overly descriptive writing style backfired in this would be entertaining novel. hardy should've realized that the harsh reception of the novel by the public was probably more because it's boring than because of the controversial text. hardy ruined a perfectly good plot with excessive description and annoying detail."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"As with many of Thomas Hardy's books, Jude the Obscure is a book that satirizes society's views-this one of relationships and commitment. At the beginning of the novel, Jude is a young boy in Marygreen (a part of Wessex) gains an interest for the city of Christminster. At this young age he committed himself to becoming educated enough to one day attend one of the many colleges at Christminster and become a decorated scholar or minister of the church. One day while returning to Marygreen from a job as a stone mason, he meets Arabella. Her entire view of marriage is a social engagement by which a woman attaches herself to a man and allows him to care for her and carry her expenses. She attracts Jude's attention by throwing a piece of raw pig meat at him, and coerces him into marriage by making him believe that she was pregnant. This arrangement, Jude believed, would only postpone his ability to attend a mighty school in Christminster. After their divorce, and a lengthy intermission, Arabella again gets Jude to marry her by keeping him drunk for several days. As made manifest by her use of a false hairpiece and the way she artificially produces a dimple in her cheek, Arabella is a character that portrays the faade of marriage. Her view of relationships was entirely superficial, something for society to see. There was no substance to her or to any relationship she was engaged in.After their divorce, Jude finally moves up to Christminster where he is rejected by all the colleges. He realized that what he had hoped for as a boy was just a fantasy. Here he meets Sue, a cousin of his, and falls in love. Sue, who really loved Jude, only wanted the security from a relationship without ever having to give a commitment (why she always avoided marriage with Jude). This later led to Jude's downfall. Sue was extremely manipulative and controlled Jude and his emotions as though she were merely pulling and releasing strings. She was often childish and impulsive by drastically doing things and making rash decisions. She knew how Jude felt about her, but seemed to find more enjoyment by avoiding that which she felt was the natural course of nature. Ultimately, she only brought suffering upon herself, and unimaginable anguish upon Jude.Jude was a boy who wanted nothing more than to \\"be somebody.\\" He had great goals that were thrashed before his eyes by selfish women who knew his weaknesses. Had Jude been a confirmed bachelor, he would have had little problem in achieving his goals, and Hardy would have been without a book that illustrated the follies of marriage in his day. For example, it is pretty sad by knowing that two people were married by their indifference and mal disposition toward each other. Whenever he recovered from a folly with either of the aforementioned women, he would return to his roots at Marygreen-more going back to the basics-reset his goals (which ultimately led to Christminster) and set out to only be shoved off course by a pretty dame. Hardy's book, being well written and easy to follow and read, if nothing else illustrates what I definitely do not want in a relationship. It is a story like you find in the Bible, one that shows the potholes in life so that you may avoid them."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I didn't enjoy reading this one. I know Hardy isn't the most cheery writer, but this was beyond just depressing -- it was boring. About halfway through, I was tempted to just skip the rest but I trudged on to the bitter end.This may have been scandalous when it was published, but why couldn't Hardy have done a better job with the ending? The almost Dickensian sequence of hard-to-swallow tragedies was too contrived for my taste. Was Hardy afraid of writing a happy ending for this unconventional pair, or did he want to display the worst-case effects of a rigid social code of behavior? Either way, it all became pretty unbelievable.From a historical point of view, as a jumping-off point for a discussion of the social constraints and morals of the period, Jude is a success; it certainly seems to have set off some fireworks when it was first published. As casual reading, I can't recommend it."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This book will not put cheer in your heart. Few books I have read recently have been so consistently and methodically depressing as &quot;Jude.&quot; His utter naivety in being pulled into mistake after mistake and wasting away his life makes you want to shake sense into him. The worst part is that he is not a bad man, he just makes poor decisions. Or perhaps I should say he allows others to make poor decisions for him. He wants to push societal norms on the one hand and conform to them on the other. And he, like most of us, does not have the courage or ambition to break through and achieve his goals. In the end his environment, created by his own folly, drags him down and guarantees his unhappiness. The reason for my ranking of 3-stars is that I didn't find the book compelling or particularly thought provoking. It described a situation I find often in current society. On the plus side Hardy is an excellent writer and the book moves you to emotion."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"As a British person, I am perplexed as to how this novel could possibly change the view of the Seatle resident on the Brits (see review by Seattle). I dread to think what his or her opinion of the Brits was before this novel, let alone her revised opinion of us since reading the novel. It is amazing how simplistic some of these prejudices are, especially since they can be re-vamped in such a shallow way by reading a Thomas Hardy novel, which completely sums up British culture in a nut shell ( I think not). I always think it's advisable that to hold an opinion, you must have an educated and broad justification for it. That means until you know what you are talking about, remain respectively non-judgemental about other people etc in the world.Nevertheless, this is a wonderful book by the great Thomas Hardy. It is dark, moralistic and tragic, so don't expect a pleasent Jane Austin type read. The film, made from the book, starring Kate Winslet and Cristopher Eccelston, is a superb adaptation of this novel.

I liked Jude and had hope for Jude, but everything came apart and continued to get worse. I was crushed by the end. Not something to read for encouragement."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This is classic Thomas Hardy--a likeable hero allows himself to be ruined by the opposite sex and the hard realities of life written in very descriptive, poetic language of bygone years. Jude, the hero, is a very humane, decent sort of man who although poor, aspires to become educated and enter the priesthood. He is self-taught and disciplined and seems to be well on the way to achieving his goals at the college when he meets a crude pig farmer girl and becomes intimate with her. She tricks him into marriage and immediately they have major problems and part. Jude then sets out for college only to meet his cousin and erstwhile soul mate, Sue. Sue is quite a character, a bizarre mixture of feminist, scholar, teacher, flirt, rebel, and self-absorbed fool. She is on an emotional roller coaster and takes Jude with her. She toys with Jude's affection and that of an older school master, leading them both on although she is repulsed by physical contact. She marries the schoolmaster only to suddenly want Jude back and leaves her husband. She and Jude then begin an unmarried life together and produce children, as well as taking in Jude's son by his wife. Their life is full of problems and ends with a tragedy involving the children. Through it all Jude remains a likeable, moral character of sorts who tries to accept his lot in life and shoulder responsibility, only to be dashed down again and again.I could not help to like Jude, as I also liked Tess in Hardy's other similar novel. Jude is hurt by his propensity for the wrong women as Tess was hurt by men of low morals. I found myself getting annoyed by his love for selfish Sue and hoping he would get away from her before it was too late.This is a dark, despairing kind of novel, stark in its realism about human nature and the consequences of wrong choices and going against the norms of society. Yet, it is a good read and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"How does one really describe this masterpiece?The heart-throbbing beauty and pain and sadness is beyond description.If only we were all Hardy,and we could do justice to this climax of creativity and passion.My heart ached for Jude...that poor lost soul whose longings and desires and over and over again aborted.The shocking reality of this work and all the characters is masterful.Jude the Obscure is a hand blindly groping for meaningfulness in our chaotic world,and we feel that it succeeds."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"&quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; is a rare find! Jude Fawley is a kind, decent man who falls prey to that which many of us do - love and the blind faith in that which we desire. The story is incredibly well told. The manner in which the children are found dead seems to reach out from the book and grip the reader with heart-wrenching sadness. I found myself sobbing at the incredible grief and distress this child must have felt he caused his parents. As a result, he takes his own, as well as his siblings, lives. The note he leaves behind grabbed my heart. I read this book while on vacation, and although it is not what one would consider a conventional &quot;beach read&quot;, I found myself unable to put it down. I even named my cat Jude after reading this because Jude Fawley is truly one of the most beautiful and kind people ever depicted in literature. An animal rights activist before his time, Jude was rewarded with the kindness and sensitivity he so freely gave to others."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"One of Hardy's later works, &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; displays the author's sure hand in depicting Man's capacity for suffering.

Jude often becomes sidetraked from his true goal, but often begins to fight as soon as he realizes what he has done. The story is beautifully well written, with characters the reader can sink their teeth into. Hardy is a master of the human condition, he understands the underlying principles of life and portrays them vividly so that we all can learn important lessons from reading his work"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy is an intriguing book. It is the story of a young man named Jude who aspires to be a religious preacher. In Jude's pursuit of this goal, he is faced with opposition.Jude is a poor orphan boy who lives with this aunt. He works by day and studies by candle light to get into Christminster, a special college for theologians. All seems well until a voluptuous woman distracts one Sunday from his studying. Before he knows it, he is not longer studying and married to a woman he does not love.Jude falls in love with another young woman. Society frowns on them for she belongs to another.Through the credible characters of Jude, Arabella, Sue, and Philloston, Hardy shows the effect society has upon the weak individual. Some would have you believe Jude the Obscure is an awful book, but it is not. It is a book that makes you think. When I was done reading it, I though, \\"Now what has that got to do with anything?\\" It has a lot to do with everything. It covers the subjects of God, love, fate, and society. What Hardy has to say should be heard. I recommend reading Jude the Obscure."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure, written by Thomas Hardy, is the story of Jude Fawley and Sue Bridehead. It follows the development of their love for each other and then their demise as lovers. I did not enjoy this book. I found its characters to be feeble and its theme twisted.Jude Fawley is a penniless orphan raised by his aunt in a small English village. He is inspired by his schoolmaster Mr. Phillotson to pursue a goal of attending one of the great universities in the town of Christminster. His dream is crushed when the universities reject him because he was not properly educated, and more importantly because he is not of the upper class. While in Christminster Jude falls in love with his cousin Sue Bridehead who is a rogue in society. Sue is well read and opinionated. Before becoming acquainted with Jude, She had lived with a young scholar that loved her. The two were never married because Sue desired to live as comrades and not sweethearts because she did not love him. The entire novel follows the love affair of these two outcasts of society.I found that I could not become emotionally attached to these characters. Jude and Sue constantly assumed the role of victim. For example, Sue promises to marry Jude's old school master Mr. Phillotson. She tells Jude that it is Mr. Phillotson's plan that Sue will complete a teacher training school, and then the two, as a married couple, will take a position at a double school (a school for both boys and girls). Sue acts like the victim of Mr. Phillotson's planning; she does not even consider that she could reject the plan just like she rejected the young scholar of her early days. After several of these incidents, I became desensitized to the suffering of the characters. Hardy lost his ability to manipulate my emotions by creating weak characters that never reacted to their surroundings, but were only acted upon by society.Thomas Hardy must be given credit for building consistent characters. Both Jude and Sue remain predictable throughout the novel. This quality leant credibility to the characters, because everything they did fit with their personality. I could believe that the characters were truly spineless human beings. They never surprised me by doing anything bold or courageous.I also found this novel to be distasteful due to the fact that I was left in a quandary as to the theme of the book after I had completed my reading. It appears Hardy was writing a criticism of the institution of marriage, but that can be debated. For example, Hardy pens the following statement by Sue as she and Jude attempt to marry in the Superintendent Registrar's office: \\"Jude-I don't like it here! I wish we hadn't come! The place gives me the horrors: it seems so unnatural as the climax of our love! I wish it had been at church, if it had to be at all. It is not so vulgar there!\\" (284) From this statement I would assume that Hardy is against marriage. But at the point in the novel that this statement is made, Jude and Sue had been living together for some time. It can thus be argued that this sentiment arose from not performing the marriage ceremony at the proper time. The theme of the novel would then be that marriage is necessary and must be done properly. I must confess that Hardy forces the reader to think and ponder in order to derive the themes from the novel. But I prefer a theme that is not so debatable.I rate this novel as deserving two stars. Thomas Hardy creates consistent and credible characters. He also provokes the mind of the reader to ponder his novel. But his characters were cowardly and his theme unresolved, which is unsuited to my taste in literature."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This book is about marriage and expectation. It concurred the cruelty of outer world than their heart, like the wall between purity and public status, like the worldliness of education. In my youthfulness, I don't understand the connection of marriage and love, but I did realize the real sin that God gave us for breaking it."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"But oooooh it's good! _Jude_ is really long, and not an easy read (keep your dictionary handy). I'm glad I read it as part of a class. Hardy has plenty of time to craft his characters in this book, and they are crafty indeed. I have never felt such strong emotions towards a literary character. By the time _Jude_ was over, I hated &quot;her&quot; SO MUCH...but you'll have to read it to know who this &quot;her&quot; is. Good luck, and don't get discouraged, it's worth it."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This is free but also impossible to read the way it is formatted. The first few pages (that was as far as i got) were all centered text and I assume the rest of the book is like that too. It is very distracting and for me it is unreadable. Off to find a different version..."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy is a compelling and intriguing novel. Instead of most conventional novels that rely on plot, it places its emphasis on getting certain points and ideas across to the reader. It is a book meant to make the reader think, not as a leisurely Sunday afternoon story. The story takes us through a series of tragic events, starting first, in contrast, with Jude as a young child full of hopes and dreams, the primary dream being to go to Christminster to become a learned fellow. We follow his life as he marries Arabella, a woman who fakes a pregnancy to get Jude to marry her. Because their marriage does not have the foundation of love, it quickly crumbles and Arabella leaves Jude to go to Australia.Jude then decides to follow his old dreams and travels to Christminster, only to find it was little like what he had imagined. There he falls in love with his cousin Sue, who in order to spite Jude, marries the schoolmaster Phillotson. She despises their marriage, and soon asks her new husband to let her leave. After much contemplation, he consents, and Sue runs off with Jude. The two start a life together with Jude worshiping Sue and Sue constantly pushing Jude away. They will not commit to marriage, and live a life together looked down upon by all of society. After a while, they get a surprise from Arabella, saying she has a son that belongs to Jude, and that he will be coming to live with them. Father Time, as he was nicknamed, comes to live with them. He is a very depressed young soul, burdened by things way beyond his years. Sue and Jude have two more children out of wedlock, and constantly move from town to town to get away from the jeers of society.Just as things are starting to look up, as Sue seems to finally love Jude, Father Time decides to take things into his own hands and hangs himself as well as the other two children. Sue, being unable to cope with the situation, leaves Jude and goes back to Phillotson, saying it is her duty. Jude, left alone, is then visited by the vivacious Arabella, who gets him drunk so he will consent to re-marry her. Their marriage, however, is simply one huge lie, and Jude, from depression and a loss of hope, becomes sick and finally dies in his misery.The main topics looked at by Hardy seem to be about goals and marriage. Hardy clearly defines Jude's many goals, for instance his pursuit of knowledge and his pursuit to win the love of Sue, but just as St. Jude, the saint of hopeless causes, Jude is never able to achieve them. The idea seems to conclude that no matter what your goals are, you will never be able to attain them. This is a depressing thought, and though it may be true for some people, I believe it does not clearly express the true things that happen in people's lives. Most people, if they have a goal in sight, do achieve their goals, bringing themselves happiness.Marriage is clearly looked down upon in this book. Hardy shows marriage between both Sue and Phillotson as well as Jude and Arabella as a trap of unhappiness. He then contrasts that unhappiness with the life of \\"true\\" happiness that Jude and Sue had together, out of wedlock. This idea, in my opinion, is absolutely false. Marriage is meant to be the union of two people who love each other so much that they are willing to commit their entire lives to each other. It is meant as a means for happiness and love to blossom. Hardy's demented idea of marriage is clearly false.Even though some of the philosophies in this book tend to be skewed, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It made me think on an entirely different level. I could sympathize Jude's pain, and though it may not be a leisurely novel, it is a classic that I recommend any educated person should study."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"If there's one strange habit that's become a subtle part of my life it's that I have the hardest times remembering how I came across some of my favorite things, bands, movies, books, and Jude the Obscure is one of them. I was at a Barnes and Noble with a friend, looking at and picking up random books, when I came across this title. I read the synopsis on the back, informing me of how utterly bleak this book is supposed to be, that Hardy met with reactions so harsh that he never picked up a pen to write another novel until his dying day, and that, most importanly of all, it's the tale of a man's dreams continously crushed before even gaining any kind of momentum, for the majority of his life.After I read all that, the book never left my hand, and that night I went home and took in at least 1/4 of the book in one sitting. There are so many moments and quotes in this book that I can personally identify with that reading it was probably a far more cathartic experience for myself than most others. Jude longs to be a man of the intellectual scene, reading as much as he can, studying numerous languages, latin, of course being the most important, and he never gets close to ever seeing any of his hopes come to life. His life is spent, for the better part, working low class jobs, stone masonry, etc. and falling for all the wrong girls.The women in Hardy's final novel depict the sex at their coldest, most malicious and self-absorbed. Arabella, Jude's first wife, tricks Jude into marriage by faking a pregnancy, and Jude being the soft hearted, love hungry puppy that he is, weds her, only to meet with crushing consequences. Then enters Sue Bridehead, Jude's cousin, a character, I've read quite a few books mind you, that is near the very top of my list of absolutely vile people, Arabella is there as well.Sue is so unconsciouly full of herself, such a self-proclaimed goddess that it's sickening. For the majority of their courtship Sue never even so much as remotely returns Jude's love, which he notes on numerous occasions, to which she simply implies that she loves him but will never actually phyically speak the words.And in the background is Philotson, the man Sue marries before Jude, and the man who, ultimately, unwillingly tears Jude & Sue apart for good. An older man, a teacher, and yet another miserable human being, lets Sue go when he realizes that she doesn't love him, but that she may love Jude. The very fact that Sue was a part of his life, and eventually absent, destroys his reputation, when they get \\"divorced.\\" He loses his job and has to take jobs akin to what Jude did his whole life, if not just a bit better.Sue is basically the poison of the novel. Every life she touches ultimately falls apart. Little Father Time, the son born of Jude & Arabella's time, hangs himself, along with Jude & Sue's two children, because Sue told the boy that the world is a harsh place and that they're better off dead. \\"because we're too many\\" I believe is what the suicide note reads.The day of the child's funeral, Sue, pregnant with third child, has a miscarriage. So, again, it's obvious, in my opinion, that Sue is the poison, destroying all those she comes in contact with, even the child inside her body.There are more disturbing moments in the book, although none nearly as absolutely shocking as the suicide, but I'm already running off at the mouth about what is, and always will be, my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This is one of Hardy's best works, with his typical exposure of Victorian and Edwardian double values and moral bankruptcy. It is brilliantly, poetically written, and outlines a tragic tale of love and anguish."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Thomas Hardy was a brilliant writer who is incomparable in our day. Jude the obscure tells the story of a young man with a strong desire to better himself and is taken advantage of due mostly to his innocence, honesty and forthright moral character. The story is told in words so beautifully written it stands next to poetry. A fine example of classic literature, Thomas Hardy's novels are a must read for anyone with the desire to expand their love of good story telling and the english language."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"The digi reads edition doesn't even have a table of contents making it completely useless in the classroom. There is no way to navigate by book sections, chapters or anything of the like. If you are reading straight through for fun, this might be fine, but if you are reading critically and need to quickly navigate sections it's pretty much impossible."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"- ever, ever, ever, ever, ever! I have never felt this intensity of pure love for a person who I'm told is fictional? He stares out at you, so real you could touch the stubble on his chin. You'll take each loss so personally, and feel each disappointment with such ferocious, physical pangs! Oh, his poor judgment. His bad, impetuous, foolish choices (like mine!), hard knox, followed hard upon by brittle, fleeting true love.The details of the characters make this book great. I loved reading about Jude's struggle to learn Latin. I loved his whimsical sympathy for the hungry rooks. I loved his simultaneous attraction/revulsion for Arabella. I loved the description of her slaughtering the pig, and then later her removing her hairpiece. I loved Jude's tribulations as a mason in the great Cathedral. I loved the complexity of his feelings for Sue. I loved his defiance and obstinacy in the face of death. Oh, he was so brave and stupid and romantic and deluded and smart and thwarted and alone. Read it for Jude!"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Interestingly, this is the last book Thomas Hardy wrote because it was received so poorly. In his introduction, Hardy writes that the publication of this book cured him of any thought he might have entertained about writing more. It is in Hardy's typical style of marriage gone terribly wrong.Hardy challenged the laws and even religion of his day. Characters on more than one occasion remark that their consciences go against everything they have been taught mainly by society and religion.Jude is an aspiring scholar who doesn't have enough money to go to the university in Christminster. He spends his childhood and young adulthood preparing for a chance to go. Jude is tricked into a marriage, but before long his wife leaves him. He eventually moves to Christminster, but finds he is unable to attend because of social prejudices and lack of money. Jude falls in love with his cousin, who married a school teacher. eventually, she returns his love and moves in with him. I will not tell the rest of the story for fear of ruining it for you, buy it, it is worth reading for yourself/."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"More than most novels I have read, JUDE THE OBSCURE consists of an extraordinary number of reverses of position, changes in thought, and zigzags of principle. With a background of rural England or smaller towns such as Oxford, (called Christchurch here) this dark story describes the tragic lives of two people who dare---far before our time---to consider love and marriage in a different way. Jude Fawley aspires to be a scholar or even a minister of God, but wanders into an unfortunate conventional marriage with Arabella, a barmaid with an eye for the main chance. He becomes a stone mason, but pores over Latin and Greek texts by night. Despite forewarnings of the unhappiness in marriage which runs in his family, he falls for a cousin, Sue Bridehead, an ethereal, philosophically-inclined woman, who loves Jude in return but marries a dry schoolteacher despite that. Later, as Jude's wife has run off to Australia and as Sue regrets her decision, they come together at last, only to go through a series of extraordinary vicissitudes. One cannot help but wonder if Sue is not more than a little mad. Rain, wind, dark church towers, and damp stones fill this story with atmosphere, but the constant changes in direction and convenient appearances of previous characters at propitious moments may prove a little aggravating. Though these can be taken as criticisms on my part, I admired Hardy's last novel as an attempt to do a very difficult thing---to show the lives of two ordinary people who at some moments transcend their ordinariness with sublime courage, only to lose their way and sink back into the sordid murk of daily existence and terrible tragedy. The characters, in the end, achieve nothing, yet they lived, they too reflect the extraordinary variety of the human condition. Jude, the character, reflects on his life, saying, \\"...it was my poverty and not my will that consented to be beaten. It takes two or three generations to do what I tried to do in one; and my impulses-affections-vices perhaps they should be called-were too strong not to hamper a man without advantages, who should be as cold-blooded as a fish and as selfish as a pig to have a really good chance of being one of this country's worthies.\\" Hardy's condemnation of middle class hypocrisy and the narrowness of \\"scholars\\" comes through constantly. Set against the entire array of world literature available, perhaps JUDE THE OBSCURE is not at the top of the scale----Hardy's indecision as to the direction of his plot prevents that---- but it is still a good novel."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This novel is just one step shy of being a true and great masterpiece. But it's still excellent and its near perfection makes it a compelling read. It's also a deeply moral work, although attacked upon publication as an insult to marriage and religion. No, it isn't. It's the story of a decent Christian guy named Jude who has dreams of getting educated and becoming something in life, so he teaches himself Latin. He meets and falls for a pagan girl named Sue, with whom he has nothing in common. Love works in mysterious ways. Although Thomas Hardy's writing is powerful and gripping with great storylines, his stories are ultimately tragic and convey his pessimistic view on life. But I prefer unhappy endings anyway. He's my favorite Victorian novelist.David Rehakauthor of \\"Love and Madness\\""},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is an intersting book, which which begins with a small boy that is kind,loving and quite likeable. I found myself feeling sorry for him and his hard life. He is an orphan and lives with his great aunt that doesn't exactly treat him like family. Jude has a sensitive soul with a zest for learning and leads a religious life, and all through his childhood he dreams about going to college. He longs to travel to Christminster, the city of religion and learning, and all of his fantasty's point in the direction of this town. In between his dreaming and studying he decides to become a stonemason to support himself. Everyday he begins getting closer to his dream of reaching Christminster.So here you have this interesting fellow, Jude,on his happy path to fullfilling his dream, until the fatefull day when he comes across his biggest weakness--WOMEN!! Arabella, the pig killer, is Jude's worst nightmare because there is just something about women that Jude cannot resist. I found it quite ironic that Arabella killed pigs for a living, becuase in many ways she ends up killing Jude's soul. Women have mystical powers over Jude. Later in the book he falls for his cousin, Sue, and she has full reign over him; worse than Arabella but her powers are softer and not as forcefull. Sue is the women that Jude adores more than anything else in the world. He ends up living with Sue hoping that someday they will marry--especially as their family begins to grow.Throughout the book, Jude is juggling between his dreams of being educated, his devotion to religion, and the roles of these two women in his life. There is a backdrop of religion and it plays an important role in the book because it creates a contrast to the lives of the characters. Jude begins religious but after he encouters Arabella and Sue his dreams of learning quickly start to vanish and he begins digging himself in a hole that has no end. Before he knows it his roots in religion soon are pulled out and he becomes hopelessly reliant on the love he feels for Sue. Part of his departure from religion results from Sue being liberal and not very religiou, which in the end takes an unexpected twist as Sue turns to religion for comfort.This book is actually quite depressing as is weaves in-and-out of the lifes of Jude, Arabella , and Sue. These three people have no control over their feelings and in the end they all end up in miserable positions. I recommend this book only if you are in the mood to read about three depressing and unhappy lives. But the book does have interesting ideas about religion, marriage, hopes, and ideals, and the way they all intertwine and relate to the life of Jude the obscure. After reading this I realize that obscure is an understatement, and I no longer feel sorry for him, but find myself asking why Jude is such a naive fool."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I read this rather difficult novel in one weekend. The story of Jude Fawley's rather turmultuos life is engrossing and memorable. It seems that some people in life always make wrong decisions, and things never really go their way. Jude is one of those people. I couldn't help but feel sorry for the idealistic young man who only hoped for one thing, to study at Christminster and live a life in the church or university as a scholar.If I only had half the enthusiasm and drive that Jude started out life with, I would be successful beyond my wildest dreams. Yet Jude was never able to benefit from his hard work and study. He was constantly held back by family obligations, work, society and poverty.As depressing as Jude the Obscure is, I loved it from beginning to end. I felt that there are some valuable lessons to be learned from the book. Unconditional love, the ability to look beyond financial boundaries, and the value of hard work in order to achieve goals are some of the things that today's readers can walk away with."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude Fawley was a man of simple needs. All he wanted was to study at a university and eventually become a minister. Jude taught himself to read in Greek and Latin. No man was as humble, decent and kindly as Jude and no man was a deserving as Jude of achieving his ambitions. Perhaps it was never to be. Jude's first wife, Arabella, the coarse daughter of a pig butcher, tricked Jude into marrying him. Jude's second \\"wife,\\" Sue, a cousin, was as intelligent and bookish as Jude, but was cold, inflexible, self-absorbed, and very neurotic. She proved to be the undoing of not only Jude, but also of Richard Phillotson, a former school master, who was as good and decent as Jude.Jude loved Sue tremendously, but family legend dictated that any Fawley family marriage was doomed from the start. Few men in all of literature appeared as lonely as Jude, and few men were as deserving of being loved as was Jude. In one scene, Jude saves his beloved Sue's life after she gets soaking wet after she jumps from the window of her training school. In one of the book's many metaphoric descriptions, Sue is seen dressed in a dry suit of clothes owned by Jude, and looks very much like him, suggesting that Sue may be Jude's alter ego. In a comment in the book, it is seems that Sue is more like an apparition than an actual flesh and blood woman. After much dithering, rather than marry Jude, Sue instead chooses to immerse herself in religion as a form of penitence for the shocking and extremely disquieting loss of their three children. Sue had previously considered herself a non-conformist, a pagan, however, her self-centered coldness to Jude after their great loss, is the antithesis of womanly love.Much of the tragedy in this book can be attributed to British morays during the Victorian era. British views at that time on marriage, sex, and co-habitation ruined many a character in the book, as it probably did in real life. Scandal must be avoided at every turn, just for the sake of appearances. Love may be easily crushed out, destroying people's lives in the process._Jude the Obscure_ is a sad and often depressing book, but very worth while reading. It is loaded with metaphors, which while adding to the book's complexity, often open it to many interpretations. Arabella's fake hair piece, her vanity pertaining to putting dimples on her face, the lugubrious little boy named \\"Father Time,\\" and the oddly colorful and joyous festival at the end of the book are just some symbolism in the book. If there is a message to be derived from Hardy's masterpiece, it is that life, even for the best people, is very unfair. Call it Karma, or whatever, but maybe some people are doomed to suffer."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Thomas Hardy's novel, Jude the Obscure, was a very insightful book, but I found its depressing content reminiscent of The Jungle. This is definitely not a novel that I would want to read sitting out in my garden on a sunny day,but rather for educational purposes only. It's examination and criticism of society makes the reader think, which is an essential element in any good novel.As in The Jungle, Jude the Obscure seems to make the characters' lives worse and worse and worse. The novel begins with high hopes for it's main character, but soon turns into a never-ending landslide of tragedy. The story follows Jude Fawley, who in the beginning of the book is full of dreams of going beyond his lower class station and on to college in Christminster. To do this he studies from books given to him by his old schoolmaster, Phillotson. Jude is a very compassionate and kind-hearted soul who wouldn't hurt a fly and when he is 19, he develops a crush on a local girl named Arabella. She seduces him and then pretends to be pregnant, so that Jude's sense of duty forces him to marry her. The marriage eventually falls apart and Arabella takes off to Australia with her family. Jude then goes to Christminster to pursue his aspirations, but is blatantly rejected. There he meets his cousin, Sue, and falls in love with her. Sue, realizing that Jude loves her, plays with his emotions, and marries Phillotson, the old schoolmaster. Hating the relationship, she asks to be freed from the marriage. Eventually, she likes Jude, but they never officially marry. They end up going from town to town because of the bad reputation surrounding their relationship. During this time they have two children, who are eventually murdered by Arabella and Jude's child, Father Time, who commits suicide after the murders. This drives Sue mad. She then returns to Phillotson, although she can't keep from cringing at his touch, as a form of penance for leaving him in the first place. This leaves Jude alone until Arabella comes back and gets him drunk, so that he will remarry her. Jude, completely broken, dies not too long after the second marriage.Bad experience after bad experience, nothing remotely uplifting happens! It is just depressing and painful. Not to say you can't learn a lot from books that aren't pleasant. This book examines society in a very pessimistic, but accurate light. Hardy's ideas about the negatives of society and the harsh realities of the human condition are apparent throughout the novel. I liked the book only in that it made me think. Beyond that it was just too hard to read because you feel for Jude and want him to find happiness at some point in his life, but he never does. I also found it very dull when it wasn't making me cry. It is a book I would recommend reading once, but definitely not for amusement and only if you can handle 400 pages of gloom."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This book really affected me. First of all, I could really commiserate with the main character through the tribulations of the first half of the book as he fell into the most basic conundrums of the human condition. I was also right there with him as he ranted against the social norms and institutions of his day. Everything was going so great, and then fate reached out its phantasmagorical knife and cut Jude's artery open, bleeding his life out upon the pages like the Pig from the opening chapters. I could only read in horror as Sue talked with \\"little father time\\" premeditating his actions, and watch as, by perplexingly inexorable steps, that which you hope against hope to not happen becomes reality."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"This is one of the bleakest books you can ever read. When it came out in the late XIX Century, it was received with so much rejection and disapproval, that Hardy stopped writing novels and dedicated to poetry. Also, his wife thought the book was autobiographical, and since the portrait of the main character's wife was so unfavorable, she was mad at him. The novel raises some topics which were, and up to a point still are, socially controversial. Hardy seems to paint a negative portrait of all social conventions which undermine or irrationally restrict human freedom. Hard moral issues are faced by the characters, always with sad results.Jude is an orphan who grows up with a great-aunt in a backwards town in England. Early in his life he is inspired by his teacher Phillotson, who moves to Christminster (Oxford) to pursue an academic career. Jude wants to go there too and become an illustrated priest. He works hard in his aunt's bakery, and meanwhile gets books and starts learning the humanities all by himself. Later on, he moves to a nearby town and learns the craft of stone carver. One day, as he comes back, he meets a girl, Arabella, who will seduce and deceive him, telling him she's expecting a child. Thus Jude is forced to get married, but soon he discovers he has been cheated. The marriage, of course, is a disaster and Arabella leaves with her parents for Australia. Then Jude is finally free to pursue his dream, and he moves to Christminster. There he meets his cousin Sue, one of the strangest characters in literature, with whom he falls madly in love. But Sue is very weird: she is against all social conventions, while Jude abides by religion and traditional morality. Although he desperately wants Sue, he is convinced he has been married forever, as religion prescripts, and so he agonizes over his past mistake. Sue is also asexual, unstable, and erratic in her behavior, causing much sorrow to Jude. Years later she accepts to marry Phillotson (on the condition that no sexual intercourse is to be had), a further blow to Jude, who even dellivers the bride at church. But of course this marriage is also a failure, and Sue goes back to Jude, with whom she lives as a wife. But this is no happily ever after conclusion. Tragedy will still follow Jude.This is an important novel, both for its literary merit, since Hardy is a very talented writer, and for the difficult issues it touches. Should one remain forever with a person one doesn't love, just because there is an oath about it? Are those kind of mistakes not redeemable? We all make mistakes, don't we? Though finally together, in love, with children and behaving in a socially acceptable manner, Jude and Sue are permanently harrassed and rejected for not being properly married. To make things worse, Arabella reappears to make trouble.One thing that strikes the reader is the fact that, hard as you try, you can find no self-inflicted defeat in Jude. He is a decent fellow, hard-working and devoted to study, but his dream just never comes true, through no fault of his own. He's just maybe a little too uptight about morals, and emotionally weak. It's easy to say: \\"Well, dude, why don't you just dump the two crazy gals and go ahead\\", but if you read the book you'll see that was never an option for him.One other, and very important, literary merit of this book is the excellent character-development. Jude is a person you may know, a sad guy with bad luck. Sue would be today the delight of therapists, especially her problem with having sex. Arabella is a wonderful character, a cynical and outright wicked woman, resourceful in her multiple predicaments. She's nasty and irresponsible, a happy-go-lucky bird of destruction.So why then do I take a star off my review? Because the chain of tragedies and unlucky situations stretches to the point of hilarious preposterousness. Or maybe it's my sense of humor. But at many points I started to guess what would happen to Jude next, imagining unvelievable tragedies, and then Hardy came up with a worse one. Melodrama raises to the levels of black humor. Nevertheless, it's a good book if you can stomach all of Jude's bad luck."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I can hardly put into words how much I loved this book. Granted, if you're looking for a light-hearted read with a happy ending, then this is not for you, but if you love to be moved deeply and if you love books that can move you to tears and send chills down your spine with their final sentences, then this is the book for you. I repeat: this book is wonderful beyond belief."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"It's harder to see why such a fuss was kicked up over this novel. But its power is still intact, and the book I belive probably deserves another reading in order to truly appreciate all its greatness. Hardy was a writer ahead of his time. His outlook remains quite modern. His world is one where God either is indifferent or absent, and men are left at the mercy of society and nature, neither of which go out of their way to be kind. Both Jude and Sue are deep enough and have enough stature to be genuinely heroic characters. At the same time you feel they are so realistic in their personalities and aspirations that they probably existed in the thousands, and people like them are still around today--Jude with his longing for a decent education that is never fulfilled, Sue with her modern neuroticism. They are ahead of their time as well, and they end up at the mercy of the social constrictions and prejudices of it. There are no real villains or evil people in the novel--Hardy's vision is sharp enough to realize that the roots of the problems that make life miserable for people lie deeper than at an individual level: that is why this book was so hated, and still gets bad marks from some. What I felt in reading this book was a feeling that Hardy was describing life as it often really is--full of squashed hopes, undeserved suffering, and cruel twists of fate. His vision is certainly dark, but it is a needed corrective. Hardy as a writer manages to be eloquent and clumsy at the same time, and I wasn't moved by the book as much as I thought I would be.(Perhaps on second reading I will) But I greatly admire the inner strength and nerve it took to write this book and hold his convictions. Hardy was not afraid to throw up his hands at the more meaningless moments of existence and say &quot;That's how the world is! What can you do?&quot; At the same time, the love he had for his characters, and the tenacity he had and gave them, ensured that they would still strive, and try to live their lives on their own terms...because in the end that is all any of us can do. &quot;Ripeness is all.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"The thing with sadness is its so easy to write about. Jude the Obscure is no exception to this unyeilding rule of literature. This heartfelt tragic romance, which attacks many of the untouchable conventions and establishments of its day, is so painful to read that it can't be put down. Jude's endeavour's, destined from the beginning for doom, are the pathes of man searching for some sort of solace in two of his most prized passions, learning and love. Yet for some reason these two goals, which we are taught never to give up on, desert him. Hardy approaches the institutions of religion and scholarship with such a deep resentment by creating an ironic character who desires both, while Hardy himself seems to despise them. Hardy also manages to create an incredible woman in Sue. Sue's passion for her beliefs instill in Jude a passion for her. Her intelligence is something that should be rivaled today. Sue and Jude are the players in a wretched game of love. It questions the fact whether love in fact binds us all"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Not a great book. A required reading for a class and I could barely keep on reading it. Good luck."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Questioning marriage, independence, self reliance in the mid 1800 for women is thought provoking. Women have worked very hard to have choices in their lives even in todays world."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Perhaps this review is a tad unfair in that I haven't finished reading the book yet. That said, I am determined to do so. The character of Jude is a \\"weak\\" one. Sue is almost anachronistically a hippie. The school master is dull and insignificant. Sue is about to be married but to what end? To tease Jude or to wreck the teacher?"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is a saddening book that deals with the oppression that society can force onto people. Jude Fawley's many attempts to rise above his social class and to become something better than he was born to are crushed time and again through society or the forces of nature. The writing itself is very readable; in the beginning of the book, I was very amused by how naive Jude was and enjoyed the way that Thomas Hardy used the language. The quality of writing never suffered through the book, but the plot becomes more and more depressing. In the final scene of the book, where Jude is finally dying after his life of oppression and tragedy, you feel incredibly sorry for all that Jude had to go through. Throughout his entire life he had been mocked by Christminster and all that it represented for Jude. Jude did all that he could to get there and become a scholar, but he was told to stay in his class and be content with what he had. Oppression through marriage of all of the main characters (Jude, Sue, Phillotson, and Arabella) was also explored through the entire book. Arabella is the mistake that Jude made that he cannot escape from. His one wrong choice early in his life ruins his chance for having a normal relationship with Sue, and in his final days he has to live with that choice. The underlying themes here are explored well by Hardy and give the reader a chance to see life from a different angle and hopefully appreciate what they have.One thing I disliked about the book was the constant tragic events. I understand that Hardy was trying to explore certain themes by using such depressing events, but it was too much sometimes. When little Father Time and the children of Jude and Sue died, I was probably as crushed as Sue was. That is perhaps the saddest point of any book that I have read and it caught me by surprise. The tragedy of it was much more than I was expecting, and that is probably what Hardy was looking for. I didn't appreciate being bombarded by such emotional manipulators by Hardy.The characterizations in the book were wonderful. Jude's aspirations that continued to be subverted by his weaknesses made him the perfect tragic hero. Sue was realistic, but she was never strong enough to earn my sympathy. She was just too weak, despite being the \\"liberatedEwoman. I came to dislike Arabella right from the start, and my dislike grew with each appearance she made. Phillotson was perhaps the most pitiable character in the novel, especially when he is persecuted for letting Sue go. The minor characters in the story add to these main characters and help to reveal who that are and why they do what they do.Overall, Jude the Obscure is an excellent novel, but it does have its bad points. The thematic elements in the novel are explored in a thought-provoking way and the characters are portrayed in a realistic and poignant way that helps the reader to understand who they are and why they are being slammed by forces outside of their control. Those forces, though, are sometimes too strong and detract from what Hardy is trying to do with the novel. I would recommend this book, but be prepared to leave aside time to think about it afterwards. This book makes you sit down and think after you read it. If you don't do this afterwards, there will be so much that you miss."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"One of my favorites - even by today's standards, Hardy's novel is wildly forward-thinking and shockingly real. The character of Sue Bridehead is one of the most complex and intriguing characters in Victorian literature. Torn between tradition and modernity, she cannot reconcile the world she lives in with the one she envisions. She and Jude are alike in that way, and it binds them to each other in a way that is inevitably tragic.JUDE THE OBSCURE examines what few novels dare to explore, and none as eloquently: the undeniable link between superstition and religion; the absurdity of entering into a marital contract; and the cruely of a society that breaks those that do not fit within its mold. Heart-breaking and narratively unmatched, Hardy's novel is a cautionary tale that, more than 100 years later, shows us how much as a society we have yet to overcome."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"As with Tess of the d'Urbervilles, if you like tragic, historic romances, you'll love this book. For that matter, if you like soap operas, you'll probably like this book. Furthermore, it isn't nearly as overly wordy as Tess, or for that matter most 19th Century fiction. Its style is much more concise and direct than most of its contemporaries, although still a bit stilted by modern standards.But what's more, this book is worthwhile from another standpoint entirely: it is a scathing condemnation of traditional marriage(&quot;And so, standing before the aforesaid officiator, the two swore that at every other time of their lives until death took them, they would assuredly believe, feel, and desire precisely as they had believed, felt, and desired during the few preceding weeks. What was as remarkable as the undertaking itself was that nobody seemed at all surprised at what they swore.&quot;) and traditional religion, and of ruining one's life by living it to please society and its strictures; and while society has changed much since the days this book was written in (and about), there are those who would argue that those changes were not for the better; that liberalizing attitudes toward divorce, and toward living together without benefit of marriage, have been a seriously bad thing. This book is an excellent look at how it was not always such a good thing for people to be forced into marriages that were clearly not compatible, and forced to stay in them. And while, as I say, times have changed a great deal, there are still far too many people who marry just as precipitously as Jude did Arabella, or Sue did Phillotson, and with no better reasons. It says here that it is a distinct improvement in our society that when people make such a mistake, it can be rectified without totally destroying their lives forever after.Granted, if you're looking for a worthwhile or positive female character, this is not the book to read; of the two main female characters, one is conniving, mercenary, rude and vulgar, (reminding me a great deal of Moll Flanders, from the DeFoe title of the same name, but without her redeeming charm) while the other is neurotic, selfish, whiny, and inconsistent. If you're looking for a worthwhile female character, &quot;Tess of the d'Urbervilles&quot; is a much better choice. Or better yet, the aforementioned &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;. But in general, this book is much better written than &quot;Tess&quot;. For one thing, although it is just as much of a tragic romance, if not more so, the characters do not ALWAYS make the wrong choices. They occasionally make good choices, and get a little bit of happiness as a result. This makes for a much better balanced book, and a much more realistic one. But it is definitely not for everyone."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude is a brilliant, critical and creative glance at Christian marriage and sexual relationships in England's Victorian age. The reader is slowly drawn into a relationship with the book's tragic hero who fails to achieve his dreams of being a scholar and a lover. The story is truly one of the saddest that I have had the pleasure of reading. Much can be learned from this profound novel."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"I am a huge fan of Victorian literature, specifically Thomas Hardy, and I believe this is by far his most brilliant novel, although not as well known as Tess of the d'Urbervilles or the Mayor of Casterbridge. The story, though tragic, is beautifully told and skillfully developed without all of the useless hype of today's John Grisham and Tom Clancy novels. The thoughts, surroundings, and lives of the characters become the focus of the story rather than intense action or contrived suspense. You are drawn into the characters' lives; Hardy forces you to care for them, cry for them, and mourn for them. This novel is not for the empty-hearted or those looking for a light read. But for those interested in the emotions and lives of people, this book will be a fast favorite, despite its somber tone and tragic story."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"During a rather animated dinner conversation about the varied definition of &quot;family&quot; today, my English friend suggested that I must obviously love the works of Hardy, &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;, in particular. No, I was not familiar with his work. As I recalled later, he did brief me on the plot, but the wine must have diluted its message, for it in no way diluted my tragic mourning at the novel's end. Steadfast ambition, good intentions gone awry, true love overwhelming, and eventually destroying all.This work is so sweetly pure in perfection that I have no expectation to ever come that close to it again in a literary experience. I read somewhere that it would be pure joy to read Hardy's novels in the same sequence that he wrote them. Unfortunately for me, I read &quot;Jude&quot; first. And although all his novels are hauntingly, achingly beautiful (I have to pace myself and read them only every so often or I would surely die of heartache), they only come close to &quot;Jude&quot;'s power. After I read the last line of &quot;Jude&quot;, I closed the book, closed my eyes, and desired nothing stronger that to travel to England, sit at Hardy's graveside and ask &quot;What kind of man are you to have been able to do that with mere words?&quot; And to thank him for doing so"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Will Godwin (terrible_lizard@hotmail.com) from Wisbech, England writes several reviews below: &quot;I, like Mr. Myers, am substantially smarter than the average reviewer (or moronic AP student), and therefore must say that I am one of the few people who can truly appreciate the unique aestheticism of Hardy's transcendental, impressionistic, amorphous, and quasi-sublime genius.&quot;Then goes on, after a paragraph about the novel itself:&quot;After the completion of this novel, Hardy, as Mr. Myers told us, wrote poetry that suggested a great deal of Shelley's influence for the rest of his life. I am shocked, though, that no reviewer, not even Mr. Myers or a stupid AP student, mentioned that Hardy turned to poetry after the critics and public ridiculed and castigated him for writing JUDE. I seem to be the only reviewer knowledgeable and well-read enough to know that.&quot;PLEASE! The back cover of the Penguin classic edition of the book contains the information of which he speaks, which hardly makes one knowledgeable and well-read!Mr. Godwin would do well to be substantially more obscure himself!"},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"It is difficult to imagine a bleaker Thomas Hardy than the bleak author of his early and middle novels, but in his final novel, JUDE THE OBSCURE Hardy plummets into a depth of pessimism so entrenched into the very fabric of this book that he reaches what for him is the nadir of his tragic vision. Critical reaction was predictably negative. Hardy was so offended by what he saw as a universal misunderstanding of his philosophy that he refused to write further fiction. He spent the remainder of his life applying his personal ethos of tragedy to his poetry.It is quite true that JUDE THE OBSCURE is rife with the overwhelming sense of despair to which the critics so objected, but they had other problems with it as well. They did not care for what they saw as the ubiquitous immorality in the relation between Jude and Arabella and between him and Sue Bridehead. Living together in sin counted for more opprobrium back then than now. Further, they felt that Hardy had taken some cheap shots at his dismal portrayal of Christminster as a cesspool of false and elitist learning. Christminster was an amalgam of Oxford and Cambridge, the very alma mater of many of the offended critics.In order for Hardy to create such an unremitting world of gloom, he had to do some serious tinkering with a style of writing that was pretty gloomy in its own right. To make the reader \\"feel\\" the pain of Jude on a level that reached down to bone, he had to place Jude on a level much closer to the reader than Hardy had done in the past. He accomplished this by eliminating any trace of any element that did not somehow smack of existential pain. Hardy, in his earlier novels, occasionally leavened his level of tragedy by including characters who exhibited amusing quirks. No one on a quirky level is to be found here. Hardy, as in THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE, was able to portray a brute nature that might assume some of the blame as to why certain characters met a tragic fate. Here, Hardy places the blame squarely on man and his hidebound institutions as the source of tragedy. In the caste system that was typical of late Victorian society, Hardy saw more evil in that than in brute nature. What remained then was a social triangle with Jude at the apex, Jude's peers at the left end, and a ruthless society at the right end that was determined to squash interlopers more effectively than Egdon Heath ever could. If there ever was a stacked deck against those who wished to rise above their station, Thomas Hardy provided that as an equal opportunity pulverizer."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude The Obscure is a true literary masterpiece that examines multiple issues including class , marriage, hypocracy and Hardy does so by creating unforgettably tragic figures in the characters of Jude Fawley and his cousin/lover Sue Bridehead. These two are soulmates that are caught up in a tragic web that is partially forced upon them by the social conventions of their time. Equally tragic is the unrealized ambition and yearning for a formal education that Jude carries as a cross throughout his life as he ultimately becomes resigned to his station as a working class laborer who will never be accepted in the halls of higher learning which he so reveres.Hardy's writing typically is critical of late Victorian values and his characters frequently suffer tremendous burdens that result from being at odds with what were considered societal norms. None of his characters suffer more than the cousins in this book and the tragedy is one that will haunt the reader for years."},{"Title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"As a Hardy fan, I turned to &quot;Jude&quot; with high expectations--and was very disappointed. I saw in his work the same recylcing of elements in other works (particularly &quot;Tess&quot; and &quot;Return of the Native&quot;). If Hardy wanted to come out and condemn religion, he should have done so, instead of his little forays and hasty retreats. So read &quot;Jude&quot; if you must, but to see Hardy at his best I recommend &quot;Mayor of Castorbridge&quot; instead."},{"Title":"The Evil of Evils: The Exceeding Sinfulness of Sin (Puritan Writings)","review":"The Evil of Evils addresses a great need and exposes a great weakness of those who are followers of Christ in our day. The theme of the book is that there is infinitely more evil in the least sin than there is in the greatest affliction. The renowned Puritan preacher Jeremiah Burroughs shows in great detail the fact that there is no good in sin at all and that,though affliction is not desirable in itself,God uses it in the lives of His people to accomplish much good. Rarely do modern authors even begin to approach the depth and breadth that the Puritan's reached in exposing sin for the immense evil that it is. This is due in part to the strong opposition to such preaching and teaching that will often be encountered. On p.28 Burroughs makes this comment about how evil sin is &quot;Sin is so opposite to God that, if it were possible that the least drop of it could get into God's nature,God would instantly cease to be God.&quot; Sin is so opposed to the nature and the very existence of God that it would destroy Him if it had the power to do so. Mr. Burroughs then seeks to show how sin is opposite to man's good. The truth set forth in 'The Evil Of Evils' is so much needed in our day because it is to be feared that many in our day are much more fearful of the least aflliction and have very little fear of the greatest sin. If the believer is to bring every thought captive to the obedience of the Lord Jesus Christ then sin must be exposed for the great evil that it is,and affliction should be viewed as an instument that God uses to conform His people to the image of His Son. The Word of God exhorts the people of God to count it all joy in the midst of trials but never is this to be their attitude toward sin. This book will help the Christian reader to have and maintain a godly perspective with regard to sin and affliction."},{"Title":"The Evil of Evils: The Exceeding Sinfulness of Sin (Puritan Writings)","review":"Most people will do all they can to avoid affliction, but do very little to avoid sin. The one recurring theme of this book: it is better to choose affliction than sin. As Burroughs expounds godly wisdom from Scripture, he shows us why nothing is to be more feared than sin, nothing is to be more avoided than sin, and nothing is to be more hated than sin.He effectively shows that sin is the greatest \\"evil of evils\\" by exposing the nature of sin: how it is so opposite to God, wrongs and offends God, most opposite to man's good (and more opposite to man's good than affliction is), takes away excellencies in all things, of the same nature as the devil, a furtherance of the devil's work, fullfills the devil's will, makes man conformable to the devil, etc. Along with pungent analogies, Burroughs opens our eyes to see the ugly heinous nature of sin and exposes sin for what it truly is, so that we may once again have a dread of sin, a hatred for sin, and a love for holiness."},{"Title":"The Evil of Evils: The Exceeding Sinfulness of Sin (Puritan Writings)","review":"It is mind-boggling that Jeremiah Burroughs wrote and preached at least twenty interconnected sermons about sin, whose manuscripts were bundled into a 345-page book entitled \\"The Evil of Evils.\\" Puritan ministers have this habit, that is, to handle a particular passage of Scriptures with such a level of depth and meticulousness, and with such soul-piercing applications that few or none even come close.After briefly elaborating on the thesis of the book being \\"there is a greater evil in the least sin than in the greatest affliction\\" taken from Job 36:21, Burroughs gives nine excellent corollaries (p.18-23); nine intensely practical corollaries, specifically the last one. I wouldn't write them down here so I won't overwhelm the readers with excessive content of the book, but would invite them to read for themselves. The next interesting part is where an allusion that the reason there seems to be much evil in afflictions is precisely because there is much sin in them, while it is not strictly true that all afflictions are the result of sins as we consider two examples of Adam and Job in the Old Testament. This argument is covered in the third section under the heading of sin being opposite to all good (p.180-191), after an excellent treatment on the depth of the loathsomeness and the dreadfulness of sin in relation to God and to human beings. Here Burroughs argues sin as being the strength of all evils, the sting of affliction, the curse, the shame and the eternality of all evil, where though he uses the word \\"evil,\\" these statements are applicable as well when the word \\"evil\\" is replaced by \\"affliction.\\" This is worth mulling over. The reason why there is so much power in the intensity, so much sting, curse, shame and eternality in affliction is because there is sin in it.Another thought-provoking, conscience-awakening, and soul-stinging section is when he talks about one who \\"may be in a most miserable condition, though he is delivered from outward affliction\\" under which he proposes two cases; \\"if a man is prosperous by sin,\\" and \\"when one becomes more sinful by their prosperity\\" (p.257-271). These should properly fall under the application section though Burrough does not divide the treatise this way. Yet another section that I am most stunned and stung with is the last one where he examines six possible cases: (1) those who are more afraid of affliction than sin, (2) those who are careful to keep themselves from sin, but merely for fear of affliction, (3) those who will sin to avoid affliction, (4) those who, when they are under affliction, are more sensible of the strength of affliction than of sin, (5) those who get out of affliction by sinful courses, and yet think they are doing well, and (6) those, who after being delivered from affliction, can bless themselves in their sin (p.330-344).\\"The Evil of Evils\\" is a dangerous read but on the other hand, a most necessary read. It is not a comfortable read, though it's not all gloom and doom as Burroughs did not forget to offer the gospel and other compassionate pastoral counsels (see p.272-273, 302-306, 307-309). In closing, he charges the readers as follows in regard to all he has \\"said of the evil of sin,\\"\\"... know that every one of you here, at that great Audit Day (he was referring to the judgment day), must be brought to answer for what you have heard, and how you have heard, and for what effect it has had on you all. Consider what has been said, and the Lord give you understanding in all things\\" (p.345)."},{"Title":"The Evil of Evils: The Exceeding Sinfulness of Sin (Puritan Writings)","review":"Few books ever written are as penetrating as this book that deals with the evil of evils, sin.

The cover lead me to believe the book would not force me to think, so I grabbed it and ran to my gate. I have not stopped thinking about it since. Written in first person, the book details the life of Anna, an only child whose mother dies when she is a teenager (don't worry, her larger-than-life relative, Mamie, comes to live with her and teaches her the love of music) and who loves two things: Music and a boy named Will. Kitty Burns Florey bescribes the 60's in New England, and Anna's and Will's unique, funny and sad life experiences with such honesty and detail and, well, beauty, that I felt as though I had lived the story, not read it.

He makes frequent reference to literary works, including some by Saikaku, that the eager amateur student may have missed. He notes the wars, Western contacts, and other social upheavals that elicited and shaped these wonderful portrayals of sexuality. And, above all, he presents over 150 works of classic erotic art, ranging from the mythical (p.114) and literary, to the familiar (as in the cleanup tissues of p.135), exaggerated (p.61-63), multiple (p.111), or hilarious (p. 130). It should come as no surprise that they enjoyed every mood and practice of sexuality that any other population enjoyed at any other time.What's not: The commentary is all but disjoint from the many illustrations throughout the book. Only toward the end does Grosbois mention particular illustrations, and then in a strangely irregular order. Color, where present, is generally quite good. Many of the color and B&W; pictures, however, suffer from fuzzy focus and from inexplicable cropping. It's sometimes clear that the author has chosen a segment of a larger work for special emphasis. Other times, one gets the impression that the erotically most significant parts of an image have been sacrificed.What's just odd: This 1964 artifact of printing technology will look alien to today's reader. Text is generally printed on uncoated paper, but B&W; images are on a different, coated stock - the alternation of papers is quite apparent to both sight and touch. Even odder, the color illustrations are nearly all printed on separate stock, then pasted into blank areas amid the text! This goes beyond odd to outright strange in cases (e.g. pp.92-93) where the pasted-in pictures are creased by the fold at the book's binding, but helps a lot for one six-page mural (attached between pp.36-37).And, of course, there is much in a foreign culture that meets expectations other than the modern Western reader's. For example, women's breasts are rarely a focal point, and are often drawn in ways that seem perfunctory. Perhaps there's some genetic tendency towards slim busts among East Asian women. Whether or not that is real, it is de-emphasized in the artists' sense of fashionable styles of body - at least as much as recent fashion in the US has led to silicone implants as a major and contrasting look. In addition, artistic (and social) convention centers on lush clothing and surroundings, sometimes to the extent that nudity is displayed with surgical precision, just at the point of coital union.So, it's an interesting book and a distinctive artifact. It says as much about Europe of the early 1960s as it does about earlier eras of Japanese culture. It's certainly enjoyable. On the whole, though, a modern reader will get at least as much out of more recent books and more recent printing technology.//wiredweirdPS: The product listing, as I write this, does not mention that the book is in fact hardbound with a dustjacket."},{"Title":"Herbal Prescriptions for Better Health","review":"I am not into gardening of any kind (I've killed catuses, for pete's sake) and was having a heck of a time finding a book about herbal remedies that didn't spend most of its pages telling me how to pick, grow and pickle (so to speak) my own herbs. This is a marvelous book for someone who wants sound (not faddish) advice on herbal remedies. It has one section where each herb/plant is listed, with recommended use, side effects, safety issues, etc. The next section lists ailments, recommended &quot;herbal prescriptions&quot; (treatments that have been studied &quot;scientifically&quot;), &quot;other herbal considerations&quot; (treatments that haven't had a lot of scientific study, but have demonstrated traditional or anecdotal efficacy), nutritial supplement considerations, and lifestyle considerations. Where it makes a difference, Dr. Brown tells you what form of the herb is best. And great tidbits like how chamomile may be difficult (not dangerous) for someone allergic to ragweed (daisy family), because chamomile is in the same family. This is a very well written, well thought-out book. The only reason someone might not give it five stars is that it doesn't cover as many herbs as in other books.

I agree with J. W. Redding's well-articulated comments. Piper's theme in most of his books, \\"God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him,\\" just never resonated with me. But Piper's book, \\"Don't Waste Your Life,\\" has a slightly different emphasis that really does resonate with me: \\"Make much of Christ.\\""},{"Title":"When I Don't Desire God: How to Fight For Joy","review":"A long time ago I read The Dangerous Duty of Delight (which was a compressed repeat of Desiring God); then I read When I Don't Desire God, How to Fight for Joy. This too was pretty much a repeat of Desiring God, except that he has replaced the word \\"pleasure\\" with \\"joy.\\"There is somewhat less philosophy in this book than Desiring God had and a tad more relevant Bible references. And because the target word of this book is \\"joy\\" every aspect of life is measured by how much joy a Christian can grab.Still, in the places that he discusses relevant Bible references to joy, he does make some good points. It was also nice to see him acknowledge that joy is not something earned by the Christian but is given to him by God as a fruit of the Spirit.While repetitious, many parts of the book are calls to rejoice in God which is both the right of believers and their true duty. The premise that all life revolves around getting the most joy we can is, as usual for John Piper, over-the-top and is only flimsily supported by rather vague Bible passages.It is a thought provoking read and a bit better than Desiring God. Except for a few places where he plays fast and loose with the definition of words, it is far better written than Desiring God while largely preserving his original philosophy behind that book."},{"Title":"When I Don't Desire God: How to Fight For Joy","review":"This review has Dr. Piper's \\"Desiring God\\" book in mind, but I am spreading this post around for those who, like me, feel uneasy with Dr. Piper's main point. I am restricting my review to that because--from what I can tell--it has become central to his whole outlook on God and life. It appears to have metastasized into almost all his writings. He spoke at a plenary session of our denomination and if I remember correctly he said something like, \\"this is my theology.\\" Here it is:\\"What is the chief end of man? To glorify God BY enjoying Him forever.\\" And, \\"God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.\\"Dr. Piper teaches that this is the supreme testimony of Scripture regarding glorifying God. He would have us adopt it as the highest priority in our lives. He is saying, in effect, God being glorified in us ultimately rests on whether or not this is happening.I read this years ago and the more I have thought about it in the light of the life of Christ the more uneasy I have become. But it has taken me years to find words for my uneasiness. Here is my best attempt so far.My question has been, What does Jesus Himself have to say about glorifying God? Or, more specifically, did He say anything about HOW He personally glorified God? If Dr. Piper's theme is, in truth, at the heart of glorifying God on earth, then we can be sure Jesus certainly would have spoken to it. I cannot believe that He would have left the question open on a matter of such transcendent importance.What did Jesus say about how He brought glory to God on earth? One reference emerged in my study. He said, in His High Priestly prayer: \\"I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do.\\" John 17:4, niv. (If I missed a passage please point it out in the comments. I welcome correction.)Do you read anything in those statements to the effect that the Son of God glorified God primarily through enjoying Him or through being satisfied in God? I have no doubt that Jesus certainly did. But I don't see here or in any aspect of His life and teaching that He made that foundational.As I see it, my Master brought glory to God by completing His Father's assignment, and so with me as His disciple. I do not doubt that He will give me joy and satisfaction in Him throughout the journey. He has already--far more than I can possibly contain--but if that were the main point in glorifying God, I am convinced that Jesus would have told us explicitly that that is the main point.Why only a one star review? Because how we glorify God is immeasurable in terms of its significance and impact. We are talking about ultimate reasons that affect everything we do all day long. Like having the right motive in something--if we get that wrong, everything is wrong. Dr. Piper, in my estimation, has substituted in a secondary good for the primary one Jesus revealed in His prayer. And whereas in other matters in life that may not do much damage, with ultimate concerns it ends up being a colossal distraction.In stark contrast to \\"Christian Hedonism,\\" consider what Thomas Kelly wrote in his \\"Testament of Devotion:\\" \\"When you are obeying to the uttermost you even forget about yourself.\\""},{"Title":"When I Don't Desire God: How to Fight For Joy","review":"If I wanted a hack job commentary on Johnathan Edwards and CS Lewis, next time I will try to find someone who is a little more insightful than Mr Piper.

I'm already seeing benefit in my thinking, prayer, and Bible reading resulting in a more consistent joy in God.In most of Piper's books (especially Desiring God) he teaches how the Bible's view is that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him (Christian Hedonism). You may be completely convinced of this, but then find that you have a limited ability to be satisfied in Him and you find yourself constantly satisfied in lesser things. What are we to do? This is Piper's attempt at quickly summarizing his arguments from Desiring God followed by chapters on spiritual disciplines that you can use in your fight for this joy in God.I found this book extremely helpful, especially as a followup to Donald Whitney's \\"Spiritual Disciplines For the Christian Life.\\" You may find it to be slow going at times, but bear with it.I read this book in Logos4 ([...]) which I found to be extremely helpful as I could have a Bible open on my computer beside what I was reading. Reading the verses that Piper references as he references them really helps me to understand and own the content and to tie it to the Scripture instead of the Piper book. I highly recommend this book. If you have not read any books from John Piper, I would recommend you first read \\"The Dangerous Duty of Delight\\" and \\"Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ\\" first."},{"Title":"When I Don't Desire God: How to Fight For Joy","review":"John Piper's When I Don't Desire God is hands down one of the best, most well balanced, theologically on-point books I have ever read. It is my opinion that most Christians, especially in America, especially who deal day in-day out, with a stale spiritual life, should read this book.Although I am a subscriber to the Desiring God blog, on which Piper is a regular author, and besides having seen Piper speak on several occasion, this is only the second book from Piper that I've read all the way through. He has a somewhat peculiar writing style that takes a chapter or two to adjust to and I hadn't managed to do it in the past. But this time I did and it was well worth it.Piper sets out in the beginning of the book to relay some ground work for folks who aren't already in tune with the idea of Christian Hedonism. It's essentially the idea that a person should do absolutely whatever is necessary to make themselves happy. So, to be a Christian Hedonist would be to believe that knowing God and enjoying God is essentially the only real way to be happy. He relays the foundation of biblical truth spoken of extensively in other works that \\"God is most glorified in us, when we are most satisfied in him\\". The ideas are laced together to create a framework to teach the weary and the bored that we must \\"rejoice always in the Lord\\". (Philippians 4:4).Throughout his text, he stays strikingly well balanced. Teaching, from the scripture, many profound spiritual truths--however abstract they may be. But scarcely does he introduce a spiritual truth without pairing it with a practical implementation. The best example of Piper's skill here is during his discussion of the word of God and it's place in our lives. He spends one chapter discussing the spiritual truths and implications of the word of God, but then follows immediately with an entire chapter of helpful, time tested ideas of how to live out those truths.Finally the last chapter focuses on the occasion that a person seeks hard to enjoy God and be satisfied by Him, but is not. In that discussion I found great encouragement and strength for my own soul. That chapter alone perhaps was worth the entire book.When I Don't Desire God finishes out at 234 pages and spans across 12 chapters. In addition to that, each chapter is broken up into a dozen or so subsections that make picking it up and putting it down very easy. It effectively removes excuses for not reading by making sure that you don't necessarily have to read for more than just a few minutes, if that's all you've got available to you.All in all, I recommend this book to all believers. It's affordable and valuable and is likely to stir you in unexpected ways."},{"Title":"When I Don't Desire God: How to Fight For Joy","review":"I read this book at the recommendation of my pastor because I wasn't sure whether I truly &#34;Desired more of God&#34; or &#34;Desired to desire more of God&#34;. This book is apparently written to people who read Piper's book &#34;Desiring God&#34; and come away thinking they can't (or at least don't) desire Him.The title of this book couldn't describe its contents any more plainly than it does.It took several chapters before I was accustomed to Piper's writing style here. He makes a statement of fact about X (where X is &#34;The importance of the fight.&#34;, &#34;The nature of the fight&#34;, &#34;The value of prayer&#34;, etc.) and then goes into several paragraphs of explanation by way of repetition. I hesitate to say repetition because it sounds entirely negative, and because it sounds like I make the author out to be a parrot. However, he's not usually quoting himself, he's quoting scripture, or a puritan, or Jonathan Edwards, or a great mind of the past. Usually it's a combination of all of the above that he relies on as the basis for validity of his statement.Not having read his other books, I can't say whether this writing style is unique to this text or not. I can say that it seems pretty well-suited to the intended audience. I think Piper expects his audience to be more than a little jaded, and so they need something akin to Proof by Exhaustion. That is, by being given a plethora of examples of the different ways you can evaluate the truth he is positing, you'll come to a similar conclusion he does about the core of it. I don't know that I've read another book that tries to give so many examples to make so few points.On the points he's trying to make, I think they're very basic. That's not an insult, because after being &#34;religious&#34; for the better part of 20 years, I still didn't truly understand them. This book was a great help to me in defining and exploring the fundamental activities of a person who Desires God.The first several chapters seem devoted to explaining the importance of Desire. Around half-way through the book, he switches to explaining the practical mechanics of pursuing a relationship with God that is characterized by Desire.I knocked off a single star because I'm betting others like myself could probably understand his main points with a less exhaustive treatment of them, and it can make for some pretty dry and tedious reading at times. For others though, perhaps that's exactly what's needed. Even though I consider myself on the fringe of his intended audience, I was able to glean quite a few good truths about the general principles, and practical applications, of a life that Desires God."},{"Title":"When I Don't Desire God: How to Fight For Joy","review":"This is not light reading as the language can get quite complex, and the book is quite dense with lots of information.

John Piper tells it like it is and gets to the heart of the matter.I'm so glad I finally gave in and purchased this book. I have been blessed and I have been able to rediscovered the joy of the Lord that I had when I was first saved.If you can't handle the truth and are not wanting to actually put the time and struggle into what it takes to truly abide with God on a deeper level than this book is not for you.

He said it helped him and he would recommend it to others. I'm sure he will get more books."},{"Title":"When I Don't Desire God: How to Fight For Joy","review":"This is John Piper's best book of the last several years, which builds on (but doesn't repeat, contrary to one review) the foundations laid in Desiring God: The Meditations of a Christian Hedonist. Because the supreme duty of every follower of Jesus is to glorify God (1 Cor 10:31) and because praise on the lips divorced from delight in the heart is hypocrisy (Matthew 15:8), nothing is more important than having a heart that is so satisfied in Jesus that it can say, \\"Whom have I heaven but You? And there is nothing on earth that I desire beside You\\" (Psalm 73:25). And since sustaining that kind of desire for God is a fight, John Piper served us well by writing this helpful book.Chapter One is entitled, \\"Why I Wrote This Book.\\" From the outset Piper makes clear that \\"the fight for joy in Christ is not a fight to soften the cushion of Western comforts. It is a fight to live a life of self-sacrificing love.\\" (p. 20). This is no health/wealth/prosperity handbook to grabbing as much joy in this life as possible. It is a field-manual for the believer who is dead earnest about not wasting his life on trivialities.Chapter Two, \\"What is the Difference Between Desire and Delight,\\" far from playing fast and loose in defining words, is a helpful exploration of \\"affections.\\" Drawing on C. S. Lewis's \\"Surprised by Joy,\\" Piper demonstrates that desire and delight are different though related, with God the all-important object of both. His discussion is laden with Scripture and his use of language wise.Chapter Three, \\"The Call to Fight for Joy in God,\\" is a serious look at God's demand that we delight in Him. Delight in God is serious because the essence of evil is to choose broken cisterns over the Fountain of Living Water (Jer. 2:13). And joy in God is so central to saving faith that Piper rightly says, \\"Heaven hangs on having the taste of joy in God\\" (p. 34). Which is why fighting for it is so urgent. This, however, doesn't lead us into the cul-de-sac of legalism, because \\"Joy in God is a Gift of God\\" (Chapter Four). God graciously gives what He demands by creating delight in our hearts. Chapter Five further explores that gift in discussing how \\"The Fight for Joy is a Fight to See\\" - and seeing is the result of God's gracious work. \\"Without the work of our omnipotent internal Eye Surgeon we would remain blind and unable to see. Oh, how we need the gift of spiritual sight!\\" (p. 58) Chapter Six, \\"Fighting for Joy Like a Justified Sinner,\\" shows how the gospel is central to our fight for joy and urges us to feast on the gospel in the preached Word and the Lord's Table.Chapters Seven through Twelve take us deeper into application, as Piper teaches us how to \\"Wield the Word in the Fight for Joy\\" (Chapters Seven and Eight), discusses the focus and practice of prayer in the fight for joy (Chapters Nine and Ten), and explores \\"How to Wield the World in the Fight for Joy\\" (Chapter Eleven - a very useful chapter which shows how to use food and fasting, sex and suffering, art and literature, and rest and nature in the fight for joy). Chapter Twelve is a hopeful encouragement for \\"When the Darkness Does Not Lift.\\"I've read most of Piper's books and this one is near the top, along with the classics Desiring God, Future Grace, and The Pleasures of God. It is certainly his most practical book to date and will be my companion for many years as I continue to battle for a heart satisfied in God alone."},{"Title":"When I Don't Desire God: How to Fight For Joy","review":"This is a general comment on Piper's books and ministry. I deeply appreciate the work of John Piper--especially his emphasis on missions and on living God-centered, Christ-exalting lives of worship. And I am Augustinian, so I love Piper's theology and am thrilled that he has become so popular. But I do want to provide a warning. Piper's main emphasis is (and you'll read this over and over again) \\"God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied (or delighted) in Him.\\" This is a biblical and wonderful proposition that Piper became aware of through the writings of Jonathan Edwards. And to Edwards, this was one small part of his theology.But Piper has taken this idea, which he calls \\"Christian Hedonism,\\" and built his whole life and ministry around it. The problem is that if you read enough Piper, you will begin to focus on the FEELING of being delighted in Christ, rather than on Christ Himself. And when your feelings don't match what you want them to be, you will become disheartened. (And let's face it, few of us have the emotional intensity of John Piper.) At that point, your feelings (of being delighted in God) become the object of your desires and, thus, an idol. Yes, they are feelings TOWARD God--but those feelings are NOT GOD. And when the focus of your life has become your emotions, it has deceptively become an idol.I know Piper fights against this tendency. But I'm afraid he is often unsuccessful. The fact is, the Christian life is not going to be one of unending joy in God. Read the Psalms to see how often the psalmists cry out in agony and desperation and sadness to the Lord. Read Romans 7 to find out how tough and discouraging the Christian life can really be.According to Piper, our happiness in God should be the driving motivation in our life. But when Christians are inevitably not overflowing with delight in God, then under Piper's framework, the only solution is to seek that feeling of joy rather than just do our duty. There are times when duty and obligation (which Piper hates) are the only motivations for the Christian to be obedient and live a life of faith. I agree wholeheartedly with Piper that delight in God is a much better motivation for the Christian than duty. But when that delight is not there, we still must be faithful and obedient, and we can't always wait on our feelings to drive us on toward the prize.Read Piper's books. And enjoy his passionate and Christ-exalting preaching. But beware and repent when your emotions--rather than the Triune God Himself--become the focus of your life."},{"Title":"When I Don't Desire God: How to Fight For Joy","review":"If you've ever been frustrated by Piper's heralding statement \\"God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him\\" because of your dissatisfaction in God, then this book begins to answer your frustrations. Piper has taken the most common protests and frustrations with Christian Hedonism and systematically answered these concerns with Scriptural exhortation upon Scriptural exhortation. Here is a quote from the book that really impacted me: \\"Make and trust a blind idol, and you become blind (Psalm 135:15-18). Apply that principle to the modern world, and think of the idols of our own day. What do we make and what do we trust? Things. Toys. Technology. And so our hearts and our affections are formed by these things. They compress the void in our heart into shapes like toys. The result is that we are easily moved and excited by things-computers, cars, appliances, entertainment media. They seem to fit the shapes in our hearts. They feel good in the tiny spaces that have made. But in this readiness to receive pleasure from things, we are ill-shaped for Christ. He seems unreal, unattractive. The eyes of our hearts grow dull.\\""},{"Title":"When I Don't Desire God: How to Fight For Joy","review":"Piper is one of my favorite authors. I have also heard every sermon he has on available for audio on his website. I've heard and read a lot of his work. He says he really only has one message and that is \\"To seek and spread a passion for the glory of Christ to the joy of all peoples.\\" This book is a new view on that. I've owned this book for a while and prayed that God would let me read this when it would affect me most. He did just that. I pray that would be your prayer as well. When that happens, God will make His Name sweet in your heart and beautiful on your lips. If you are struggling with your desire for God, first go to Him in prayer. Than go to His Word. Then go to your pastor, your family, and friends. Then read this book. God will reach you in your time of struggle and in your time of blessing. In Job 1:21, right after hearing of all the troubles the LORD brought on him, Job proclaimed, \\"Naked I came into this world and naked I will return. The Lord gives and the Lord takes away, may the Name of the Lord be praised!\\" Praise God in both blessing and suffering. He is blessing you with both, so thank Him and praise Him in return. Let Him teach you this lesson through John Piper in this book!"},{"Title":"When I Don't Desire God: How to Fight For Joy","review":"One element of this book that I found to be very useful was the practical/direct instruction it offers on its various points. For example, Piper will spend a chapter showing how the Word of God is necessary in the fight for joy, and then the next chapter goes into strategies for actually reading and meditating on the Word of God. He then does the same process for prayer. Much of Piper's writing is of a deep, theological nature, chapter after chapter, and it was refreshing for there to be hands-on application sprinkled throughout the whole book."},{"Title":"When I Don't Desire God: How to Fight For Joy","review":"The Piper triology is considered to be his earlier books Desiring God, Future Grace, and The Pleasures of God. However, this is the hidden jewel in the Piper collection in my humble opinion. It is an excellent compliment to the John Piper's trilogy. He drums the recurring theme, \\"God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.\\" Yet the Christian walk is full of twists and turns, and occasionally a season of affliction. Our human frailty is at odds with Christian joy, yet we are to fight the good fight of faith. In the season of affliction, we have to fight for joy, and preach to ourselves the good news of the Gospel. We must present ourselves as a living sacrifice, and find satisfaction in the goodness of God.Some good chapters focus on our spiritual implements of fighting the good fight from prayer to Scripture memorization. Piper calls Christians to rise above the mediocrity of the age, leave behind the lukewarm spirituality and embrace a radical discipleship. We live in an age in which many Christians are lackadaisical in their efforts to grow spiritually. Many consider a piecemeal effort to attend church from time-to-time as the extent of their investment in working towards spiritual maturity. John Piper challenges Christians to wake up, and in the midst of discouragement rather than depart from full fellowship, he exhorts believers to fight for joy in their Christian walk, and savor the joy of their salvation.John Piper's book remains a clarion call to fight for joy as a justified sinner, and savor the riches of Jehovah's grace and glory. Where we have been faithless, our covenant God is faithful to do what He has promised. The Lord Jesus Christ is truly the author and finisher of our faith.One of the most reflective chapters introduces the concept of gutsy guilt, and offers a remarkably profound exposition on justification by faith alone in concurrence with Micah chapter seven. As far as the east is from the west, so far as the Lord removed our transgressions from us. Blessed is the name of the Lord, and blessed is the man to whom the Lord does not impute sin and whose lawless deeds are forgiven. We're more than conquererors through Christ Jesus."},{"Title":"When I Don't Desire God: How to Fight For Joy","review":"I regret to say that \\"mean dean\\" who has made statements below has not understood Piper as well as he thinks. Piper also agrees and even states in his messages and books that if the delight is not there, then obedience is still to be pursued nonetheless ... but that this \\"delight-less obedience of duty\\" is not the only pursuit which is necessary. In addition to still pursuing obedience even when the emotions of delight are not there Piper goes on to say that the reasons for \\"why the delight is missing\\" need to be looked into and not just swept aside. \\"Mean dean\\"'s critique of Piper is unfortunately not true to his own teaching.This book is excellent, and it is extremely practical, as it takes the teachings of Scripture and gives clear \\"handles\\" for how to apply the life-transforming truths which Piper has presented in his many books regarding the imperative role that desire/delight/passion/joy have in both our obedience to the Lord and our bringing glory to His name. This book is Piper's work at addressing the common challenges people have when applying these concepts, and it succeeds in doing so. I found this to be one of the most helpful of all of Piper's books, and one which gives the reader a clear path for living in both grace and joy under even the most challenging of circumstances. Don't miss this book, it is a gold mine."},{"Title":"When I Don't Desire God: How to Fight For Joy","review":"I'm in the middle of my third pass through this book.

In the mountain of Christian literature currently in print this book is diamond."},{"Title":"When I Don't Desire God: How to Fight For Joy","review":"I was originally introduced to this book when I was informed that a small group I had been put in would be studying it week to week. I should've been very familiar with John Piper. I've readDon't Waste Your Life; in my church back home, the pastor referenced and quoted him regularly; and now, I find myself going to Bethlehem College and Seminary, a school under John Piper's church in Minneapolis, MN.When I first began reading this book, I was skeptical. I thought that this would turn out to be another Christian-themed self-help book. However, reading Piper's foreword and prayer at the beginning of the book changed my perspective. From the very beginning, Piper seeks to let his heart for Jesus shine through the text on these pages, and he does so wonderfully. He often speaks of his personal experiences in his own quest to find joy in God, but he never lets his experiences validate Scripture. He always is sure to interpret events in light of what the Bible teaches.The very last chapter was the most impacting in my reading. Though the rest of the chapters in this book make a great case and outline for how a Christian ought to live and fight in this life, the last chapter is a guide of what to do if all else fails. Piper speaks very practically of how a person ought to help his depressed Christian neighbor and offers tips of how to live in a way that exercises Christian hedonism even when we aren't enjoying God. The last chapter is riddled with stories of influential pastors of old and their part in people's struggle for joy. Seeing that these giants of the faith dealt with these issues just as Christians do today was very encouraging and motivating.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who needs to find a new excitement in their faith. This book is both for people who are themselves depressed and without joy and for those who don't know how they ought to reach out to neighbors and friends who are going through this type of struggle."},{"Title":"Circulating Being: From Embodiment to Incorportation (Perspectives in Continental Philosophy)","review":"Thomas W. Busch's &quot;Circulating Being&quot; provides an insightful critical examination of late French existential writings by Camus, Marcel, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty. While early existentialists viewed traditional Western thought, rationalism and empiricism with disdain, Busch argues that the late existentialists recognized the limits of science and technology by shifting existentialism &quot;from embodiment to incorporation&quot;. Existentialism is a &quot;good faith&quot; attempt to make sense of and refigure the world based on individual lived experience and subjectivity. While the universe is indeed an uncertain, ambiguous place, we human beings can find certainty and &quot;deliverance&quot; by developing authentic, loving relationships with each other. No doubt, there are differences in perspectives, yet Bush shows how, for example, Sartre, the &quot;philosopher of psychological difference,&quot; (46) was greatly influenced by Decartes, Husserl, and even Freud to a certain extent. For Sartre, &quot;Human reality [is] a being which is what it is not and which is not what it is&quot; (47).Busch's work serves as a readable and invaluable referential keepsake for further study in French existentialism. A great read!"},{"Title":"Wah-to-yah and the Taos Trail or, Prairie travel and scalp dances, with a look at los rancheros from muleback and the Rocky Mountain campfire.","review":"Lewis H. Garrard was an exuberant 17 year old tourist in the Old West of 1846-1847.

When Governor Charles Bent of New Mexico and twenty others were killed in Taos in an Mexican/Indian uprising he joined an informal expedition of mountain men to take revenge.

Garrard, we imagine, probably shared buffalo robes with comely young Cheyenne women and thoroughly enjoyed the experience, as he did buffalo hunting, dog-meat feasts, and tall tale sessions with the mountain men.

I was not disappointed with this eye-witness account of life in the Rockies and would recommend it to anyone interested in living history. One can be critical of the book. Some of the flowery descriptive prose does not sound like it came from the mouth of a 17 year old, but even if a &quot;ghost writer&quot; did some of the work, the kid kept the notes and did live the story. Garrard's observations on Indian life, mountain men, Taos women compared to well-bred Eastern women, and his comments about Jim Beckwith, a black mountain man are priceless as were his views on the hanging of the Taos rebels. This story would make an excellent film."},{"Title":"Wah-to-yah and the Taos Trail or, Prairie travel and scalp dances, with a look at los rancheros from muleback and the Rocky Mountain campfire.","review":"Garrard's book, besides being of particular interest, ties in with others about the west that combine to inform the reader as no other way can. The language used by such a young author is remarkable, but we must recall that usage changes with time. It helps to keep a dictionary handy. The first person account puts the reader not only on the trail, but in Cheyenne teepees and Bent's Fort where so much of the history of the west, and of those who opened it, came together. Susan Magoffin's book (Down the Santa Fe Trail, and into Mexico) is of another trip along the same route six months apart, and lends a womanly and complimentary view to that of Way To Yah. For those who found Garrard's book less than five star value, I say, read the book again. Often when I do this, appreciation of the work is enhanced. The more one reads of Santa Fe and those who traveled it's trail, the greater will become their respect for Lewis who opens to us the eyes of a young man thrilled with his situation, and who expresses himself as honestly as anyone I have had the joy to read. We are fortunate that he lived to weave into the fabric of the west his wonderful tale. Susan Magoffin reveals another side of the &quot;trail&quot; in her book, both of which combine to inform the reader while revealing truths of a time unfortunately past. Fascinating reading and a must for anyone seriously interested in the Santa Fe trade. Susan died at home, age 26. Lewis and she each wrote just one book."},{"Title":"Wah-to-yah and the Taos Trail or, Prairie travel and scalp dances, with a look at los rancheros from muleback and the Rocky Mountain campfire.","review":"A good non-fiction book chronicling life and hardships in the Rocky Mountain West before it was really 'settled'. The author traveled and interacted with all manner of people (Mexicans, French Canadians, American Indians etc.) that were roaming/working in that area during the 1840's. This book makes you realize how pampered a life we now lead and that we really have no concept of being truly cold, without shelter, lost and hungry or being in danger of losing our lives due to the elements or through violence. There is also a lot of humor in this book. It is all the more remarkable in that the author has an excellent writing style and vocabulary. He also shows not a little horror at some western 'justice'... imagine my surprise when I learned that Lewis Garrard was only 17 when he embarked on this journey and the book was first published three years later. One portion of this book is apparently the only written eyewitness account of the trial and hanging of the 'revolutionaries' at Taos, NM.

What unfolds is a unique first hand narrative of overland travel along the Sante Fe Trail to Bent's Fort, Colorado and then on to Taos, New Mexico. This book is supposedly the only eye witness account of the trials and hangings of the revolutionaries who attempted to overthrow the newly acquired American occupancy in Taos by murdering Govenor Charles Bent and several others. Garrard's writing is commendable, being such that the reader feels they are right there with him. We read descriptions of how it was to live with, travel and meet trappers, frontiersmen, mountaineers, and Indians (both friendly and hostile), go on buffalo hunts, endure starvation, lack of water, the forces of nature, etc. while in the mountains and deserts of the southwest.

He was quick to make friends and learn the customs of the mountain men and teamsters on the trail. This book is one of the few first had accounts we have from that period and records his travels on the trail, his stay at Bent's Fort, his experiences in Taos, New Mexico just after the Pueblo / Mexican revolt and his return to the States to include a brief interlude as part of the garrison guarding Ft. Mann. It is a remarkably well written book.Garrard spent 6 months living the life of a Mountain Man. It appears he was good at it, well accepted by red and white man alike and enjoyed himself tremendously. He met and initially traveled with Ceran St. Vrain of Bent Vrain & Co., met Jim Beckwith, Kit Carson and befriended noted Englishman George Ruxton, who would go on to write several books on his many experiences in the Rocky Mountains, George Bent and many other notables in the history of the early American southwest. He was present at the trials and participated in the executions of the Taos rebels, lived for an extended time in a Cheyenne village and was engaged in two separate fights with Comanche Indians. Not bad for a six month vacation.You will enjoy these first hand observations but more importantly you will enjoy Louis himself. He was an excellent observer, reporting on every day frontier life while corroborating history in a way that was second to none. Life in the West was not easy yet he is never heard to complain or belittle those around him.Louis makes friends as easily today as he did during his amazing experience of 1846."},{"Title":"Wah-to-yah and the Taos Trail or, Prairie travel and scalp dances, with a look at los rancheros from muleback and the Rocky Mountain campfire.","review":"This is the eight Time Life Classics of the Old West series books I have bought, read and reviewed. All are 4 or 5 stars.Lewis H Gerrard 1829- 1887 writes about his excursion into the Old West. He was 17 and signed up for an expedition through Indian territory to land that was to be liberated from Mexico.It was a tiring and dangerous journey, freezing in the sun and snow, wading swift rivers and sleeping on the ground. It took a lot of courage and stamina. He was observant, curious, and cheerful and made lots of friends. He danced with squaws and saw a scalp dance. He fought Indians and hunted many kinds of animals including buffalo. He saw the landmark of the Taos Trail... The Spanish Peaks or Wah- To- Yah, that was the title of this book. The original book was published in 1850.Later he was a Minnesota settler, politician and banker. He died at 58 and wrote two other books. Some say not of the caliber of this book.Anyone interested in the true happenings in the Old West around 1846-1848 will like this book. Chocked full of interesting facts about the hard life of the prairie and mountain men and different Indian tribes. I would of rated this book 5 stars but some parts of the book had the Old West mountain language with contractions, misspellings and lots of the \\"n\\" word. Not putting the talk down as this was how the mountain men talked back then. However for reading purposes these talks slowed down my reading and would of been an easier, and slightly faster read if stated in plain English.

Using humor, easy language and insights into the Italian fascist regime, Silone tells the story of all humanity's search for truth. In the figure of Pietro Spina, a Socialist political activist, the reader is lead to ask questions about politics, relationships, and faith. The irony is that Spina has just returned from exile and must remain incognito -- as a priest, of course. Through his experiences, he asks many difficult questions about his Socialist party, his church, and himself. In the end, he is left to bring together who he is as the &quot;priest&quot; Don Paolo and who he was as the anti-political activist Pietra Spina. He must learn to &quot;let the inner and the outer man meet&quot; (Plato)."},{"Title":"Bread and Wine (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"The book is deceptively simple in its language and plot, all of which merely serve to veil deep meaning and thought. The story takes place before WWII, when Mussolini is at the height of his fascist power and the country is preparing for a war with Ethiopia. The protagonist Pietro Spina, after having been forced to flee and live abroad because of his contrary political views, returns to Italy to spread the message of Communism. He goes into hiding disguised as a priest, Don Paolo, in the small mountain village of Pietrasecca. His casual views win the heart of all the villagers, and everyone he meets opens up to him (they all want him to hear their confessions, but he refuses on grounds that he does not have permission from the pope). As the novel progresses and as he comes to better know the peasants and their needs, his doctrinaire Communist views slowly change to one that takes on the appearance of grass-roots Christian socialism, and he more and more assumes the role of a priest. But even when the novel opens, one sees that he is person driven more by a determination to seek moral justice than a political answer: one gets the idea that Communism was the option most appealing of all the options to an idealist like he, as it was for most conscientious intellectuals of that time period. The novel reminds me of Camus's The Plague in that it poses the moral dilemmas people face and their reactions when confronted with a powerful dehumanizing organization, which in this case is fascism, while in Camus's case the organization is embodied in a disease. Pietro, the martyr Murica, and the priest Don Benedetto are the moral resistors of oppression, albeit each resists in his own way. However, theirs is a dignified, almost passive resistance which contrasts with the Communists outright rebellion. There is Zabaglia, once a socialist orator, who has now turned fascist sympathizer. And there are the peasants who are resigned to the follies of all politics because they see it as a part of life--the present government is merely one is series of historical and natural afflictions. Their down-to-earth cynicism allows them to be wary of all political propaganda. There are many passages in the book which reveal the quiet, rustic, and often times harsh beauty of the bucolic life, which is also sometimes shown as being crude and vulgar, yet always natural and unpretentious. There are hilarious passages showing the peasants' unquestioning Christian piety which they combine without any qualms with indigenous superstition: &quot;One old woman was sliding along her knees toward the chapel of the sacrament, with her face on the floor, touching it with her tongue and leaving an irregular trail of saliva like that of a snail behind her. A young man in uniform was walking beside her, taking small steps, awkward and ashamed.&quot; The chapter before the last, when the villagers and Pietro come to pay their respects to the parents of Murica who had been humiliatingly tortured to death by the police, beautifully sums up the author's themes of common humanity and fraternalism by making a parallel with Christ's last supper. ' &quot;The bread is made from many ears of grain,&quot; said Pietro. &quot;Therefore it signifies unity. The wine is made from many grapes, and therefore it, too, signifies unity. A unity of similar things, equal and united. Therefore it means truth and brotherhood, too; these are things which go well together.&quot; &quot;The bread and wine of communion,&quot; said an old man. &quot;The grain and the grape which has been trampled on. The body and the blood.&quot; ' The novel ends inconclusively with dark foreboding when Cristina, Pietro's love, passionately tries to follow through dark and snow the illusory footsteps of Pietro, who has had to flee once again. A pack of wolfs comes upon her and she falls to her knees, closes her eyes, and crosses herself."},{"Title":"Bread and Wine (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Set in Italy, at the outbreak of the invasion of Africa, at the height of fascism, Silone's main character, the communist leader Pietro Spina, disguised as a priest, is confronted with a sad reality: the large distance that separates ideological communism and the daily reality of the &quot;cafoni,&quot; the Italian peasants who have to face the cruel struggle for survival, their indifference to political rhetoric, their acceptance of a future with no perspectives, and their reliance on blind faith. Spina is the intellectual mind who painfully learns that ideologies by themselves are not enough, the element of &quot;faith&quot; has to be present in life.

Perhaps I was too distracted or reading it too quicky or sporadically, but I kept waiting for something important to happen or somebody to say something worth underlining and quoting, and got impatient when nothing happened and nobody said anything. It has sat abandoned on my bookshelf for a couple of years.This time around, I had a little more time to read and a little more space to think. It made all the difference. I enjoyed the subtlety of Silone's characterization. He delights in small, subtle humor, in symbolism that doesn't scream itself aloud -- like the drunk peasant who falls off his donkey and then beats the donkey. It slips by you if you're not attuned to it.There are probably other valid interpretations, but to me, Pietro (or Don Paolo) really isn't the main character here. He is simply a placeholder for the reader, so that I can see and hear and experience rural Italy. Perhaps because I can so easily identify with him. (I, too, am an idealist, a revolutionary with romantic ideas about the poor and romantic hatred for Institution. I may not be an exile on the run, but I live in a more tolerant time and place. A demonstration in Italy in the 30's might have been viewed by the authorities as criminal activity; in 21st century America, it's considered entertainment. I don't know which is more frustrating.) I have experienced Pietro's (and Silone's) frustration with those he is trying to help -- that ironic feeling that you could do a lot of good for the poor, if the poor would just cooperate.The peasants of Italy, and the universal poor by extension, are the heroes of this book -- those people that most revolutionaries strive and die to empower and free from oppression, yet few revolutionaries actually take the time to understand and love. The gold in this book is Silone's gentle, compassionate, humorous rendering of these people -- what they care about, don't care about, how they make decisions, what they fear, what they think about and hope for. It is an exposition of a collective mind; a dangerous undertaking, bound to slip into stereotype at times, and one that Silone undertakes with great reverence.As I go among the poor in my own day and age, I remember Silone, and find that what he has to say rings true. Much too often, attempts to help, to organize, and to \\"empower\\" are ultimately patronizing and arrogant. It is much better simply to break bread with them, and learn to know and love them. After all, this is what Jesus did, the greatest and best riend of the poor, and the ultimate Saviour of all mankind. I would rather follow his model than Marx's."},{"Title":"Bread and Wine (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"I had to read this book for an Italian history class and it was excellent. The book deals with different concepts, but is primarily related to the role of religion in fascist Italy. We follow the path of Pietro Spina and his persona as a priest, and we see how those regard him act and feel.I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Bread and Wine (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"A really interesting work. I agree with the author of the introduction in that the work is a bit uneven, but a good read and worth the price of admission (I wish I could score it a 4.5). The plot is pretty simple--an ailing communist underground leader from Abruzzi returns from exile to Italy during the fascist regime of Mussolini in the 1930's. While in hiding, he reluctantly takes the garb of a priest and seeks to convalesce in a small town in his home region. Despite the simplistic plot, there is a number of layers of meaning in the text--Silone uses this as a vehicle to discuss everything from freedom in a dictatorship to the role of the Church in bad times. His is critical of dogmatic communism--in fact, the main character is at his least convincing when spouting the party line and never gets anyone to agree with him when doing so. It's only when he talks in broader terms of humanity--and here Silone heavily relies on a Christian allegory--that he gains supporters. These moments are when the book really shines. Silone challenges us to ask what would happen to Jesus if he returned to our world. The ending is a bit odd, but is allegorical--some might find it off-putting."},{"Title":"Bread and Wine (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"This is the definitive account of one God that failed. It describes a man's loss of faith during the 1930s in the international Communist movement. Wanted as a terrorist, he slips back into southern Italy where he hides as a Catholic priest recovering from tuberculosis. Fascism is rampant and war with Ethiopia has given national purpose to Italians suffering from economic stagnation. His priestly duties involve offering forgiveness to Catholics saddled with a primitive and uncompromising faith. His contacts in the Comintern underground demand his obedience to party dogma from Moscow that he now sees as meaningless. While Silone offers no grand solution to the dilemna that loss of faith presents, the book presents an uncompromising and wonderfully written portrait of the strength and weakness of humanity in the Godless world of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"Bread and Wine (Greatest Books of the 20th Century)","review":"Silone's communist message is outdated.More, he makes the cardinal error to believe that solidarity is a basic human characteristic: 'Bread is made of many grains of corn, wine is made of many grapes, so it means unity. Unity of similar, equal, useful things. Hence truth and fraternity are also things that go well together.'But, man shows only solidarity if there is a 'personal' gain. Pure altruism is absolutely no option in the struggle for survival.His picture of mankind is static, too rosy and naive. His belief in the proletariat is obsessive: 'the poor are uncontaminated by greed for property.' Hence, he proposes the abolishing of private ownership of land.'Evil is only everything that prevents millions of people from becoming human.' For Silone, evil is not a basic and intrinsic part of the human character.He doesn't understand that all proletarians want their children to become (not static) doctors, engineers, lawyers, economists ..., in other words 'bourgeois'.In Stalin's Soviet Union, he sees only a fraternity of peasants and workers.The political role of the Catholic Church nowadays is marginalized. In Italy, they even don't have a Christian Party anymore.Of course, the main character poses certain questions: had that (communist) community not itself become a synagogue? abandoned the critical spirit? the risks of conspirational struggles?His answer is no. He refutes that the communists aspire too to totalitarian power and orthodoxy and that a black inquisition will be followed by a red one. His return to his homeland 'had been basically an attempt to escape that professionalism', and he has the 'hope of one day playing a big role'.Like a fanatically convinced Christian missionary, he tries desperately to sell his communist gospel to the poor cafoni. Unfortunately, they are terribly conservative ('it has always been so') and his message falls on deaf ears.What is left in this book are the struggles against a totalitarian (here fascist) regime and against the butchery of war.It is partly very melodramatic (e.g. the confession at the end) and its main symbolism (a marxist apostle disguised as a priest) irrealistic.I prefer Silone's more direct and less apostolical 'Fontamara' and recommend highly his masterpiece 'Emergency Exit'."},{"Title":"School Violence (Reference Shelf)","review":"This book is an absolute gem for anyone who believes there must be a missing \\"educational\\" role for schools to help students avoid violence! I'm grateful for this probing collection of articles that focus on what isn't working as schools react with more repressive campus measures and stiffer youth punishment in trying to head off student violence against their peers. I've been searching for a more appropriate and effective preventive role for schools over the past six years. This powerful compilation of articles is a unique resource for educating school administrators, teachers, teens and their parents about the failure of our schools to help adolescents deal with emotional pain before it is transformed into anger or blind revenge. My book was published the same year as this splendid compilation of valuable perspectives gathered by Denise Bonilla. My only regret is that the definition of youth violence used in selecting articles did not include \\"self-destructive behavior,\\" which is a far more prevalent problem for perpetrators of school violence. (As several articles suggest, school shooters also want to end their pain, by ending their life. They choose to go out in a blaze of bullets and bombs.)As an emotional health educator currently helping schools to develop and utilize programs focusing on the underlying emotional causes of both harmful behavior toward others and one's self, I deeply appreciate this provocative collection of articles. In the context of 911, these inquiries into the issue of school violence today also help explain the tragic rise of indiscriminate violence by suicidal terrorists. Both perpetrators of school mass violence, and suicidal terrorists want to inflict as much pain on as many people as possible. Perhaps, after reading this book, we can begin to understand that only by helping our youth to deal safely with their unavoidable, everyday emotional wounds can they begin to heal the sores of rage that threaten to tear apart their lives, our country and the world.--Ronald Brill, author of \\"Emotional Honesty & Self-Acceptance: Education Strategies for Preventing Violence\\""},{"Title":"Social Identity: An Introduction - Context, Commitment, Content","review":"hello sir; I am student sociology in shiraz univercity (A.M) and I working about social and cultural identity . please help me. sencierly tahereh"},{"Title":"The Silver Sword","review":"It is a story of a Polish family being separated, and then being reunited.

People write about war, about suffering, about reunion and this book is nearly the same, except maybe the setting and characters. So, what do I think is unique in this book? For a start, we'll have to congratulate the author for being able to beat the competition into our Singapore schools and make the book one of the textbooks for literature. How he writes differently from other writers is because of his different angle of seeing and describing things that we often see or try to describe &quot;vividly&quot;, as our teachers emphasise. The characters are special in their own way. A mature young lady, having to take care of her brother and sister-and a thief. A boy who shoots with his rifle at the soldiers who drags their mother away. A girl only a few years old. A boy who is so good at stealing things he is never caught red handed unless some clumsy boy who shoots at soldiers disturb his plans. They find out that their father goes to Switzerland in search of their mother and they try to &quot;walk&quot; there. But of course there are always free lifts from people who drive lorries or even carts that can hide them quite well. Their journey is full of children, hungry, dirty, ugly, not one rich, handsome, clean child or man did you realise? Their journey is full of twist and turns, no straight paths did you notice? Their journey, is one of the most spectacular in &quot;history&quot;."},{"Title":"The Silver Sword","review":"I read this book several years ago, but still enjoy favorite reading it.

Their father, trapped in a prison, has finally escaped, yet to a Warsaw now reduced to little more than rubble. His home was bombed, and his children are missing. He meets Jan, a street urchin and orphan, who helps him &quot;jump&quot; a train.Ruth, Edek, and their younger sister, the three children, now live across Warsaw waiting for their Father's return. When Edek, the only one with a 'job' (smuggling food) is sent to a labor camp, Ruth and her younger sister suffer. Finding the street urchin, Jan, is the only reason they were able to survive. He helps them leave their home, the small cellar of a bombed building in search of their father.After finding Edek in his camp, and convincing the guards to let him go, they resume their dangerous journey. They find a kind farmer and his family, who lets them live on their farm. When a patrolman comes to the farm, the farmer sends the children in canoes down a river. Several Nazis, and trucks deporting 'border-jumpers' almost catch the canoeing children, and Jan's dog Ludwig.They reach Switzerland, where they planned on meeting their parents.

Writing was torture. He needed an escape mechanism, and he also needed money. This edition unites the 2 products of that double motive. The first is a collection of essays about the sea, the second a short autobiographic walkabout.I like A Personal Record a lot better than The Mirror of the Sea.With Conrad, fiction beats non-fiction.An amazon friend's review of a Gide essay collection recently was entitled \`non fiction beats fiction'. (Gide was Conrad's French friend in the literary world.)My opinion on Conrad is: while Gide's fiction may have sunk with time, and his essays may still be floating, with Conrad it is the other way round. His sea fiction has enormous buoyancy, while his essays have a certain leaden quality.During his struggle with Nostromo, in 1904/5, Conrad wrote, on the side, and by dictation at night (I am wondering about the opportunities involved in that), a series of sketches of autobiographical nature. They were all published separately in newspapers and magazines, and then collectively as The Mirror of the Sea.The book was a critical success, but it has been shown that it was unreliable as a biographical source. Conrad made things up and misrepresented facts. Which proves my point, he was a fiction writer.The book is a lament of the lost culture of the sailing ship, and at the same time of a closed chapter of his own life. He had quit the sea for the life of a writer on land, and it was a hard life, the writing.JC says in his own introduction: I have attempted here to lay bare ... the terms of my relation with the sea. ... for twenty years I have lived like a hermit with my passion! ...Within these pages I make a full confession not of my sins but of my emotions.So, he goes and writes, at times entertainingly, about landfalls and departures, anchors and wrong language (casting!), drinking captains and presumptuous mates, storms, pleasure sailing, the ethics of craftsmanship, ships in calamity (overdue, missing, stranded, lost), the near mystic relation between man and ship (a she!), between man and nature, about river estuaries, ports, docks, about Nelson and Trafalgar and about some stories from his youth... This is an easy process for Conrad, compared to the hard labor of his fiction. The writing did not require his usual meticulous composition; the voice is that of a TV documentary host. The texts are assembled without subtitles, and in a sequence which is different from the publishing chronology.Is it worth it? For me and for other members of the fan club, sure. For aficionados of the subject, i.e. ships and the sea, certainly. For others, hardly.Now the Personal Record is another matter entirely. JC wrote it for his soon to be former friend F.M.Ford, who wanted to start a new magazine and publish literary autobiographies. JC's text focuses mainly on two subjects: his escape from Poland for the sea, which meant moving to the West, and his escape from the sea for writing as a living. Interestingly, he denies explicitly that the question why he chose to write in English is a legitimate question at all. After all, what else could he have done?We follow different episodes involving the growth of Almayer's Folly, his first novel. We follow JC on a visit to Poland to his relatives and hear a lot about the family history back to Napoleon and about the uncle, who had adopted JC when his parents had died.Why did he \`run away' to the sea after all? He was a reader from childhood on. He likens his escape to the exodus of Don Qijote from his village in La Mancha: the romance of adventure.Now, honestly, does that amount to a \`Personal Record'? Critics at the time were annoyed. Not only was the text absolutely no record of anything, rather a rambling discourse which jumps through chronos like we love it from Conrad's fiction. Well, some of us do. I do.Conrad anticipated some opposition. He quotes Marcus Aurelius asking for heroic truth. He makes a categorical statement: JC's truth is more of the humble kind.And anyway, another quote, now from Novalis (not so beloved by me): I will believe myself as soon as I find somebody else who believes me. (Maybe that's less a quote than a free interpretation.)As I said, Conrad was great at fiction, his fiction beats his non-fiction hands down. Lucky for us, he was no fanatic of bare facts."},{"Title":"Cuzco Region of Peru - Machu Picchu Map by ITMB (Travel Reference Map)","review":"We bought this map thinking it would help us navigate around town (Cusco) and Machu Picchu, since it is pictured on the cover.

I rely on these maps constantly and they haven't let me down yet. Just enough detail without being cluttered, easy to read when on the road, not confusing and easy to stay on track and not get lost. From having used their Costa Rica map amongst others, I can confidently say all the driveable roads (and impassable ones) and signs to the various towns will be clearly indicated. I have a 2 week Machu Picchu trip planned for September and will be flying to Cuzco, renting a car and driving throughout the region (I know you can't drive to Machu Picchu). I'll get a town map at the rental counter, that will work fine, and with a good book on the area, I'll find everything without any problems.This map covers all the area I will be visiting perfectly. I bought the Peru map and realized it wouldn't be much use unless I was going to try to navigate a road trip to Lima (maps 2 go took it back no questions asked). Also, do yourself a favor, don't rely on a GPS, you'll look like a jackass if you can't get a signal, the unit dies for some reason, or you get false and/or no directions and you're in the middle of nowhere.

In other words, there is no great revelation that &quot;If the GOP/Dem party hadn't done _____, then Bush/Gore would have won the election!&quot;To the contrary, the book quite effectively and disturbingly demonstrates how the election system--particularly the technology--was a fiasco just WAITING to happen and, alas, with an election as close as that one was, it most certainly did.The system itself was a taped-together jalopy that's managed to survive all these years because lopsided victories made the exorbinant tossed votes (undervotes/overvotes) seem irrelevant. In 2000--when EVERY vote became relevant--the flaws in the cracked and decaying system became painfully obvious.You'll be surprised at the outcome of the recounts; the more liberal standards favored Bush, while the most stringent favored Gore--in diametric opposition of what each campaign was fighting for! Irony with a capital &quot;I&quot;!This book does NOT get into the behind-the-scenes machinations of either campaign during November--with all the drama--but rather sticks directly to the Florida employees within the election office.There's a few unsettling tidbits: Katherine Harris' barely disguised partisanship and the stream of emails from her office cheering on a Bush victory, for instance--but for the most part this is a pretty dry telling of the election drama. No accusations of theft, of skulduggery, of conspiracy (except what you may read between the lines)--rather, a conclusion that the system was so screwed to begin with it was just begging to be manipulated... before, during and after.What you will ask yourself after reading this book is: &quot;What now&quot;? How fervently each party pursues election reform ought to clue you in as to their real agenda.Definitely worth reading if you want to impress friends/co-workers with the actual facts/findings, rather than partisan assertions and accusations. This is the not-glamorous-but-true &quot;real&quot; story of the election from the ELECTION standpoint, and not the candidates.

This is the true tragedy of Florida, not butterfly ballots and chads. Until Jeb &amp; Karl are in Jail, and W removed from his ill-gotten office, there is no democracy.In Latin America they might have called them votantes desaparecidos, &quot;disappeared voters.&quot; On November 7 tens of thousands of eligible Florida voters were wrongly prevented from casting their ballots--some purged from the voter registries and others blocked from registering in the first instance. Nearly all were Democrats, nearly half of them African-American. The systematic program that disfranchised these legal voters, directed by the offices of Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Secretary of State Katherine Harris, was so quiet, subtle and intricate that if not for George W. Bush's 500-vote eyelash margin of victory, certified by Harris, the chance of the purge's discovery would have been vanishingly small. The group prevented from voting has few defenders in either party: felons. It has been well reported that Florida denies its nearly half a million former convicts the right to vote. However, the media have completely missed the fact that Florida's own courts have repeatedly told the Governor he may not take away the civil rights of Florida citizens who committed crimes in other states, served their time and had their rights restored by those states. People from other states who have arrived in Florida with a felony conviction in their past number &quot;clearly over 50,000 and likely over 100,000,&quot; says criminal demographics expert Jeffrey Manza of Northwestern University. Manza estimates that 80 percent arrive with voting rights intact, which they do not forfeit by relocating to Florida. Nevertheless, agencies controlled by Harris and Bush ordered county officials to reject attempts by these eligible voters to register, while, publicly, the governor's office states that it adheres to court rulings not to obstruct these ex-offenders in the exercise of their civil rights. Further, with the aid of a Republican-tied database firm, Harris's office used sophisticated computer programs to hunt those felons eligible to vote and ordered them thrown off the voter registries. After reviewing The Nation's findings, voter demographics authority David Bositis concluded that the purge-and-block program was &quot;a patently obvious technique to discriminate against black voters.&quot; Bositis, senior research associate at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, DC, notes that based on nationwide conviction rates, African-Americans would account for 46 percent of the ex-felon group wrongly disfranchised. Corroborating Bositis's estimate, the Hillsborough County elections supervisor found that 54 percent of the voters targeted by the &quot;scrub&quot; are African-American, in a county where blacks make up 11 percent of the voting population. Bositis suggests that the block-and-purge program &quot;must have had a partisan motivation. Why else spend $4 million if they expected no difference in the ultimate vote count?&quot; Florida's black voters gave Al Gore nine out of ten of their votes; white and Hispanic felons, mostly poor, vote almost as solidly Democratic. A recently released University of Minnesota study estimates that, for example, 93 percent of felons of all races favored Bill Clinton in 1996. Whatever Florida's motive for keeping these qualified voters out of the polling booths on November 7, the fact is that they represented several times George W. Bush's margin of victory in the state. Key officials in Bush's and Harris's agencies declined our requests for comment. The NAACP, tipped off to the racially suspect voter purge by early reports of this investigation, added the tainted felon-hunt to its lawsuit, filed January 10, against Harris, her elections unit chief Clay Roberts and their private database contractor. The suit accuses them of violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Constitution's equal protection amendment. The NAACP demands an immediate injunction to halt the felon purge. The disfranchisement operation began in 1998 under Katherine Harris's predecessor as secretary of state, Sandra Mortham. Mortham was a Republican star, designated by Jeb Bush as his lieutenant governor running mate for his second run for governor. Six months prior to the gubernatorial contest, the Florida legislature passed a &quot;reform&quot; law to eliminate registration of ineligible voters: those who had moved, those who had died and felons without voting rights. The legislation was promoted as a good-government response to the fraud-tainted Miami mayoral race of 1997. But from the beginning, the law and its implementation emitted a partisan fragrance. Passed by the Republican legislature's majority, the new code included an extraordinary provision to turn over the initial creation of &quot;scrub&quot; lists to a private firm. No other state, either before or since, has privatized this key step in the elimination of citizens' civil rights. In November 1998 the Republican-controlled office of the secretary of state handed the task to the single bidder, Database Technologies, now the DBT Online unit of ChoicePoint Inc. of Atlanta, into which it merged last year. The elections unit within the secretary of state's office immediately launched a felon manhunt with a zeal and carelessness that worried local elections professionals. The Nation has obtained an internal Florida State Association of Supervisors of Elections memo, dated August 1998, which warns Mortham's office that it had wrongly removed eligible voters in a botched rush &quot;to capriciously take names off the rolls.&quot; However, to avoid a public row, the supervisors agreed to keep their misgivings within the confines of the bureaucracies in the belief that &quot;entering a public fight with [state officials] would be counterproductive.&quot; That November Jeb Bush had an unexpectedly easy walk to the governor's mansion, an election victory attributed, ironically, to his endorsement by black Democratic politicians feuding with their party. Over the past two years, with Republicans in charge of both the governorship and the secretary of state's office, now under Harris, the felon purge has accelerated. In May 2000, using a list provided by DBT, Harris's office ordered counties to purge 8,000 Florida voters who had committed felonies in Texas. In fact, none of the group were charged with anything more than misdemeanors, a mistake caught but never fully reversed. ChoicePoint DBT and Harris then sent out &quot;corrected&quot; lists, including the names of 437 voters who indeed had committed felonies in Texas. But this list too was in error, since a Texas law enacted in 1997 permits felons to vote after doing their time. In this case there was no attempt at all to correct the error. The wrongful purge of the Texas convicts was no one-of-a-kind mishap. The secretary of state's office acknowledges that it also ordered the removal of 714 names of Illinois felons and 990 from Ohio--states that permit the vote even to those on probation or parole. According to Florida's own laws, not a single person arriving in the state from Ohio or Illinois should have been removed. Altogether DBT tagged for the scrub nearly 3,000 felons who came from at least eight states that automatically restore voting rights and who therefore arrived in Florida with full citizenship. A ChoicePoint DBT spokesman said, and the Florida Department of Elections confirms, that Harris's office approved the selection of states from which to obtain records for the felon scrub. As to why the department included states that restore voting rights, Janet Modrow, Florida's liaison to ChoicePoint DBT, bounced the question to Harris's legal staff. That office has not returned repeated calls. Pastor Thomas Johnson of Gainesville is minister to House of Hope, a faith-based charity that guides ex-convicts from jail into working life, a program that has won high praise from the pastor's friend Governor Jeb Bush. Ten years ago, Johnson sold crack cocaine in the streets of New York, got caught, served his time, then discovered God and Florida--where, early last year, he attempted to register to vote. But local elections officials refused to accept his registration after he admitted to the decade-old felony conviction from New York. &quot;It knocked me for a loop. It was horrendous,&quot; said Johnson of his rejection. Beverly Hill, the elections supervisor of Alachua County, where Johnson attempted to register, said that she used to allow ex-felons like Johnson to vote. Under Governor Bush, that changed. &quot;Recently, the [Governor's Office of Executive] Clemency people told us something different,&quot; she said. &quot;They told us that they essentially can't vote.&quot; Both Alachua's refusal to allow Johnson to vote and the governor's direct"},{"Title":"The Miami Herald Report: Democracy Held Hostage","review":"What garbage!

Don't but it if you don't have to."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"I'm serious. I'm a student of Japanese at University, for 2 years I used the Genki system and then when I came to Japan to study they make us use Japanese for Everyone. This book is awful in comparison. The grammer is scattered all over the place, they've crammed so much onto the pages that they are hard to navigate when you want to go back and review something, the workbook & kanji workbook are only loosely related: some kanji you learn in the workbook is repeatedly put into hiragana in the textbook for chapters afterwards, and other kanji you haven't learned yet is put in kanji form much earlier than the chapter you learn it. They also jump right into grammer with no explanation for the beginner as to the hiragana & katakana writing systems.This book is supposed to be comprehensive, everything you need to speak and write functional japanese. But not everything you need is in there, nor is it presented in a user friendly fashion.

So every Saturday for two years, I went to Japanese school. That was almost twenty years ago, and I hardly remember a thing.Now that I'm older and appreciate the value of learning about my heritage (including the language), I was driven to purchase this book. Partly: a) as a refresher course and b) partly as new instruction.After purchasing other books in the past, and some of those, \\"speak Japanese\\" CD's. This is the only book I've found that includes romaji, hiragana, katakana and some kanji. It's clearly laid-out, has a fantastic dictionary and reference charts in the front and back of the book. I think that persons interested in learning Japanese that have no prior instruction would find it a great resource.There is a MAJOR problem with this book being sold on ... though: throughout the book, they make mention of \\"listening to the tapes\\". Being that ... doesn't sell the tapes (in fact, no one does. I had to special order them from the publisher directly in Japan), I've been finding it very difficult to make it through the lessons.I think that ... should somehow acquire the tapes to sell in conjunction with the book, or you should hire someone who's fluent in Japanese to help you!All in all, it's a great book, and I'm looking forward to getting my tapes from the publisher in about a month.Shame on ... for not catching this problem!"},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"First, to sum it up... &quot;Japanese for Everyone&quot; is the best Japanese tutorial book that I have encountered so far. Yes, I do feel strongly about this, which is the reason I am writing this review, partly to express my many thanks to Nagara-san for his effort and also to let others interested in learning the language find the perfect study companion. That being said, let me elaborate... The book starts with the basics but it wastes no time. It immediately introduces the writing system, which I feel is an integral part of learning Japanese. Each chapter is part of a related set of stories which follow the life of a couple (their hobbies, social interactions, work, etc...) from the moment they arrive in Japan. There are 27 chapters and they are clearly laid out in a very readable format. Each has one or more dialogue/story sections followed a vocabulary section and separate &quot;Function&quot; sections discussing the idiosyncransies of the grammar used in the dialog passages with lots of examples. Later the dialogue is also presented in English, but you are encouraged to comprehend it without referring to it. The chapters then contain more &quot;Function&quot; sections with separate &quot;Grammar notes&quot; and exercises with smaller vocabulary sections as needed, plus a separate reading comprehension and a listening comprehension section at the end. The stories and the related material radiates a very warm and friendly atmosphere which makes learning a lot of fun. There are a lot of pictures related to the stories and the exercises but they are by no means fluffing up the book but rather they are very useful and are an integral part of the chapters as study aid. The material related to grammar is organized in an amazingly well thought out fashion and it is perfect for future reference as well. Along with the grammar some of the more common kanji are also introduced at first with furigana showing the proper way to pronounce each and later without it if it is used in the same passage, to help reinforce the learning process. The vocabulary sections will also show these frequent kanji next to their hiragana version. Here I have to make a note that the earlier chapters also have romaji (Japanese text using English characters) under the dialogue lines and next to the hiragana in the vocabulary section to help with learning hiragana and katakana. Amongst other things the end of the book contains the solution to the exercises in the chapters and a handy Japanese-English summary vocabulary section for the words used in the book with a reference to the first page where the word was introduced. The inside front cover has a nice hiragana/katakana chart and the inside of the back cover has a list of the most common &quot;particles and other grammatical markers&quot; In conclusion the only thing I can add to what I have already stated above, that if I could have a single book to help me learn Japanese then this book would be it. In addition to the book I would highly recommend listening to Japanese music and also recording Japanese movies you watched onto tape or MD and then listening to them before falling asleep or while you are doing other things. I found this highly effective in getting used to the way the language sounds, and I think it is the best way to immerse yourself in Japanese short of moving to Japan... ^_^ Well, enjoy the book and I hope you'll find it as useful as I have."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"Ok, first of all, you *must* learn hiragana &amp; katakana to use this book. I recommend getting James Heisig's book on learning both.That said, this book jumps right into Japanese, and assumes you will *work* to learn the language. Each chapter, assuming you do the exercises will take several days. But they are well worth it.One great thing this book does is use realistic Japanese conversational structures. Most books use convoluted (to the japanese ear) but educational (to the learner) sentences. This book always presents a &quot;typical&quot; japanese construct (as well as the more educational styles).One disappointing thing with this book is that I have not been able to locate the tapes that go with it. Other than that, this is a great book to learn japanese with (tho you have to be willing to work hard!)"},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"Well...I had to learn japanese all by myself, and after going through other books (teach yourself japanese, japanese for busy people...) without success, I was amazed that this book expanded my command of japanese with little effort!I can't explain it but it makes japanese an easier languaje, not because it leaves you midway like other books, but because it's a joy to learn with it"},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"I bought this book years ago, prior to a trip to Japan. I read most of it before I went, and it was great. The lessons are great, and applied very well to my experience in Japan. I carried this book everywhere I went in Japan to use as a reference. It contains useful information on life in Japan as well as the Japanese lessons. The first words spoken to me in Japan were &quot;Pasupoto o misete kudasai.&quot; (show me your passport), which happens to be the first sentence in the book. I don't think this is coincidence, other chapters followed suit, applying directly to my stay in Japan. I hope Susumusan writes more books, so I can continue my studies."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"I have been studying Japanese for about two years now, give or take, and have read many books on the subject in an attempt to figure out which were the best for learning. It is impossible to find one single book that will singlehandedly help you master Japanese, but this is a great starting place.The book begins with a brief explanation of pronounciation and so on, just like every book, but for there on out it is fairly unique. It dumps you into kana (the syllabic Japanese writing systems) right off the bat, and romaji (romanizations of the kana text) are displayed only for the first three lessons or so.This book eases you into kanji as well, displaying pronounciations for each as they are introduced. I think their method of slowly integrating the more complex characters into your reading is absolutely brilliant, and pulled off extremely well.The story revolves around a young businessman and his wife travelling to Japan to live and work, and this, in a way, makes the lesson dialogues easier to relate to. Unlike some books, this text does not demand rote memorization of the dialogues and lesson vocabulary; rather, you simple start to remember them as you do exercises regarding the use of new words and terms from the lesson. That is not to say you will never need to just resolve to memorize something--this is the only real way to build your vocabulary skills. But the exercises are &quot;user-friendly&quot; and help a great deal.In addition, the back of this book contains the audio tape scripts for the listening exercises for those of us who don't have the tapes, a rare treat indeed. Certainly, no listening comprehension is helped then, but it is better than nothing.While I do sing the praises of this text, I would recommend having a basic familiarity with the kana systems (hiragana and katakana) before beginning this book, as without this it is too easy to get roped into simply reading the romaji--of which there is very little in Japan.I return to this book to aid my learning time and time again, and I can assure you who want to learn Japanese that this purchase is well worth the money.~Kevin"},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"A recent review claims that you must know how to read japanese in order to use this book. This is NOT true.What is true, and what apparently scared this particular reviewer away from the book is the need to learn the katakana and hiragana before beginning work on this book. The katakana and hiragana character sets are phonetic units (similer to the english alphabet), and are fairly simple to learn (a friend of mine learned them over a weekend and started using this book on that monday). Any of the small katakana/hiragana books availiable on amazon will do to learn these, and usually run around $10 US. In some ways though, it really is a pity they didn't tack a chapter on the hiragana/katakana onto the beginning of the book.This is a very good basic japanese book, but it does suffer from some limitations. It's a bit hard to transition to a more advanced book after you're finished with it, and the book iteslf is necessarily limited in scope and vocabulary."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"I have been interested in learning the Japanese language for several years, but it hasn't been until more recently that I've gotten serious about it. This review requires a bit of background, first: When I started learning, I began with the very basic \\"Japanese in 10 Minutes a Day.\\" This book, though effective in teaching key phrases (question words, colors, numbers, asking for directions, etc.) does everything that's essentially wrong with language-learning books. It doesn't explain the \\"how\\" and \\"why\\" of Japanese grammar and says almost nothing about particle words. Then, I moved on to the Living Language coursebook/dictionary/CD set. The audio CDs were the best feature of this package, but the lessons moved much too fast for me. It's a great reference work for how to construct Japanese sentences and finding essential phrases...however, it is entirely in romaji with almost no information about hiragana, katakana, and kanji. Around this time, I lost interest in Japanese somewhat and it was a few years before I even attempted it again.After this hiatus, I then decided to approach the hiragana and katakana. I realized that this was what had been missing from my study of Japanese all along. It only took me about a month or so to memorize both of them, with some help from websites and making flashcards. This is really the first step in learning Japanese...I think it might even be the most important step, in the long run. Then you'll be able to write the phrases that you're learning! Hiragana are for all native Japanese words (konnichiwa, sushi, etc.) and katakana are for words borrowed from languages other than Japanese (like \\"Amerika\\" for America, for example). Japanese For Everyone anticipates that you will have learned these (or are at least in the process of learning them), since romaji is kept to a minimum in the first three lessons. If you plan on learning Japanese without learning the writing system, than you had better look for another book. I'm not saying that it's impossible to get a handle on the language conversationally without dealing with the writing. However, if you know how to read and write Japanese you will probably find that it's easier to visualize the sentences and understand how words are formed. Once you've learned the hiragana and katakana, Japanese For Everyone is the next step!Onto the review: prior to the lessons in Japanese For Everyone, there is a clear outline of the structure of the Japanese language. It explains pronunciation, sounds, syllables, and accent. Another section explains hiragana and katakana (and a good explanation of kanji comes later, on pages 94 and 95). Also prior to the lessons, a very good description of Japanese grammar is given; the sentence order is different! English is a SUBJECT-VERB-OBJECT language (SVO) whereas Japanese is a SUBJECT-OBJECT-VERB language (SOV). An example of English in a sentence would be \\"Fred eats chocolate\\". The same sentence in Japanese would be \\"Fureddo wa chokoretto o tabemasu.\\" (the English translation would be, approximately: Fred chocolate eats). This SOV and SVO distinction is an extremely important part of understanding the core difference between English and Japanese. Of course, there will be some sentences with which this rule doesn't apply, but it is generally valid across the board. The beginning section also discusses particle words, which serve grammatical functions within the sentence (for example, the particle \\"wa\\" points out the topic of the sentence). Verbs and varying styles of speech (polite, plain, and respectful) are also discussed. Each lesson opens up with a dialogue in Japanese. These are intended to utilize sentence styles and vocabulary later introduced in the lesson, as well as provide a fairly authentic conversation in Japanese. Afterwards, a list of vocabulary used in the dialogue (braking it down into nouns, verbs, expressions, etc.) is given, as well as an English translation. The lesson is then broken down into specific \\"functions\\" to be learned. The first lesson's Function I is \\"Identifying Things: A is B: A wa B desu\\". Other functions include \\"What is this?/Kore wa nan desu ka\\", \\"Identifying things by pointing them out\\", \\"Asking someone to do something\\". Each function is accompanied by one or more written exercises that help to facilitate what you've just learned. This book provides very good practice for reading and writing Japanese. I'm not exactly sure how to obtain the tapes...I've heard that they are quite expensive separatetly, since they are not available with the book anymore. However, one could just as easily record themselves practicing the dialogues or ask a friend to help them converse. This might even be better than listening to the tapes, because it would provide you with additional practice on top of listening to them later on.As the lessons move on, basic kanji is introduced (such as \\"hon\\" for book). In total, the book states that around 450 of the most frequently used kanji appear in the book. For those who are hoping to avoid kanji for a while, especially if you've just learned hiragana and katakana, don't be alarmed! The introduction of kanji in the lessons progresses very slowly; you'll probably barely notice them being there. It is best to think of them as \\"replacements\\" for what you would've written in hiragana before. Some of them are so simple that you'd be better off knowing how to read and write them anyway, instead of thinking you can get away with knowing the hiragana alone. Though different style of text, Japanese for Busy People I: Kana Version, does not do this at all! The entire book is in kana, except for some scant kanji references and pictures of signs containing kanji. For additional information on how to write kanji (with pronunciations, meanings, and word examples), hiragana, and katakana with the correct stroke order, Kenneth Henshall's \\"Guide to Reading and Writing Japanese: Third Edition\\" is the book to get.Japanese For Everyone helps you get accustomed to the actual sort of Japanese you'll encounter in books, magazines, websites, etc. I think it would be just as useful for someone wanting to know \\"business Japanese\\" as for someone who was simply very interested in learning how to read and write Japanese for their own purposes. The only thing that I hope they do in future editions is to provide dialogue CDs. Then, it would be perfect!"},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"As an English teacher living in Japan, the majority of other English teachers I know prefer this book. Either that or, we're just incapable of finding a superior text lving out here in the Japanese sticks. (We don't have a lot of bookstores for foreigners out here.) It is a beginner\`s book, but not a beginner\`s beginner\`s book. Meaning, you do need to learn Hiragana and Katakana to use it. Also, you might find a very basic vocabulary necessary before you can truly utilize this text. However, once you possess these skills, this book will undoubtedly give you a solid foundation of Japanese from which to expand on. But honestly, some days I'm not sure which is more amazing: how much I've learned, or how much I still don't know."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"I think this book is the best!!!If you want to find the audio tapes, try going to Sasuga Japanese book store.[...]But be aware, these tapes are EXPENSIVE!! $106 for four tapes.I bought my tapes through Kinokuniya bookstore and paid only$55. But that was about twelve years ago. And I'm not sure ifKinokuniya still sells them."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"I bought \\"Japanese for Everyone,\\" along with several other learning Japanese titles a few years ago. I found that I wound up extensively using all the other books over the years, with the sole exception of this one (which I found intimidating as a beginner).However, recently, I began using this book and now that I have some Japanese under my belt, I have found it quite useful. In fact, I would say this is the best title for intermediate learners that I've seen thus far. It's very complete and comprehensive.I have a few small gripes, though. The book refers to tapes a number of times, and it's frustrating to use this book if you don't have the tapes (which apparently are only available in Japan).Another gripe is that the text is too small. It'd be nice if it were more readable.Lastly, I found the book's cultural references to America to be quite bizarre and inaccurate. In one section, we are informed that Americans get one month of vacation time annually. Huh? The vast majority of Americans are lucky to get 2 weeks, if that, these days. (In fact, these days, Americans work more hours yearly than the Japanese do, as Juliet B. Schor noted in her excellent book, \\"The Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure.\\")"},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"I recently bought this to prepare for a trip to Tokyo, and I love the results I'm getting. Although some of the vocabulary is just conversation filler, the explanations, exercises, pictures and dialogues have been very helpful. I feel like I will be pretty fluent when I finish with it, and as a language major in college, I whole-heartedly approve of the use of hiragana, katakana and kanji fron the outset. It causes less interference later. All round a great find."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"This book is full of easy to learn information, that is very well organized. It includes just the right amount of information to get a beginner on his or her feet. I would highly suggest purchasing the tapes along with the book, for without them you only recieve half the experience. I am going to purchase them myself once the holiday season is over.The only real complaint I have about the book is that after only a few weeks of use, the inside cover is starting to peel. It apparently is not made out of the best materials. Otherwise, I highly reccommened this book. One other thing that you may also want to consider is buying a book on Hiragana/Katakana along with Japanese for Everyone. The kana reference in is skimpy at best, and not at all sufficient for someone who does not know kana."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"I highly recommend Japanese for Everyone. It is designed in a user-friendly manner and teaches vocabulary which will really help you whento communicating in Japanese. The fact that it introduces kanji gradually is also a big plus, being as you become more familiar with reading in Japanese."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"I read great reviews about this book and thought it would be wonderful, but I was disappointed. It does not teach the language in a way that I find to work well for me. For some people maybe it's great, but not me. I don't feel it explains the structure of the language well enough, or starts simply enough. I just don't like the approach it takes, and there definitely isn't enough explanation of how and why sentences and words are structured the way they are. I appreciate that it focuses mostly on the kana (instead of using only romaji) but that isn't enough to make the book useful to me. Some people may be able to learn episodically from examples that come from the story the book tells, but I want to learn from the ground up, starting with structure and theory so that the applications then make sense. The way this book is put together does not suit my learning style, so I have found that it added more frustration to the already challenging task of learning a new language. I do not recommend it to anyone who has a systematic learning style like me."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"I won't repeat other reviewers.Overall, it's a good textbook. Apart from missing audio, I am not too happy about many Japanese textbooks about being too slow on introducing Kanji. Why not write in Kanji all the words that are NORMALLY written in Kanji and provide Hiragana like for the Kanji that are used? A full-fledged Japanese text has much more Kanji that in textbooks, the authors seem to \\"spare\\" learners. The kanji should be used both in the main text and the vocabulary list, in my opinion.Another good feature (I think most people missed that in the review), the text describes the pitch tone very well and uses accents to show the standard pitch accent throughout the book. Most textbooks ignore the Japanese pitch accent, as if it's unimportant. It would be, of course, ideal to hear these accents in action."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"I highly recommend Japanese for Everyone.

The fact that it introduces kanji gradually is also a big plus, being as you become more familiar with reading in Japanese."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"The most comprehensive book available. It teaches you to read Japanese script, a cruial step no other book incorporates well. Two drawbacks: the occasional inclusion of new vocabulary without explanation, and the unavailability of the accompanying tapes. Fair warning, though -- it is a rigorous course, and one best done with a tutor -- and a classmate."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"The book came in very good condition and I am very satisfied with it. I highly recommend this seller."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"This is definitely not Japanese for everyone. If you are very serious about learning Japanese and have lots of time and dedication, then this may be the book for you. Each lesson is crammed with new concepts and exercises and could take a week or more to work through. The book uses Romanji (English alphabet) only in the first three lessons and expects you to learn the Japanese phonetic scripts (hirogana and katakana) on your own. While this is possible, it takes real effort. Moreover, it slows down considerably the understanding of the structure of the language. Unless you are dedicated to learning written Japanese, it would be better to use a text that uses at least a mixture of English and Japanese script."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"This book is excellent. I have used it for years. I just recently bought another one as the old one was getting old. It is straightforward and well-written. It is simple and easy to use. It moves the reader/language learner from the basics to the more advanced stages. It is also very communicative. It is also very non-threatening. I have used so many other books, and found that this is probably the best Japanese textbook I have ever used. Even textbooks used at most colleges are not this good as they often do not take a communicative approach. Japanese should be seen as a language which any person at any age can learn. I have the tapes and I would recommend that you too buy them (if you can find them... not on amazon...OOP). I would recommend that you also watch Japanese television or movies with subtitles to help you also get used to the sounds and conversations. This book may go out of print one day, so I do recommend you pick one up yourself."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"This book uses almost no romaji. It's there in the first couple of chapters, but after Lesson 3 it's gone. That's a huge plus; anybody who's serious about learning Japanese is going to have to learn the kana and kanji sooner or later and might as well start learning it right from the start - and you'll be surprised at how quickly you pick up the kana, just from reading the exercises.Then again, I find romaji irksome and decidedly not-Japanese, so I may be a bit biased. :DAnyway, the only problem I have with this book is that, as several others have mentioned, it does not include the tapes with the dialogues on them. You'll need to find Japanese speakers to work with you on pronunciation or track down a good computer program or CD set (I'm using Living Language).Absence of tapes aside, this is the book to buy if you're serious about learning Japanese. It's the most user-friendly language text I've seen, and as this is the third foreign language I've studied, I've seen several. ^_~"},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"Learning japanese is one of my life ambitions, and using this work is really the way to go. I have been trying many other methods over the years and this one really comes easy.The totally lack of romanji is the first thing that caught my eye. By chapter 6 all romanji is eliminated, even of the vocab. It is really super important that people wanting to learn japanese get over this crutch.The pace is a bit fast, but not overwhelming. If you don't catch the word the first time that are plenty of opportunities later in other chapters to get it again.The \\"story\\" is really nice to have as a sort of tie-in theme for the book. You follow Micheal and Babara Webb as they transfer to a company in Japan. The graphics are cute and really take the edge off the complex material.I do have some problems with the text, as amazing as it is. The main one is not the lack of tapes, but the use of words in sentences that haven't been introduced yet. I will be reading along and there will be a word in kanji that doesn't have furigana and isn't anywhere in the bottom (although this mainly happens when reading the scripts). I have been using the dictionary in the back more times than I can count.One other beef on the book is the sometimes they are have answers in the back that they don't explain why a certain word is used over another.In conclusion, this is defientely one of the best ways to learn reading/writing Japanese. The amount of excerises is amazing, really making each chapter about 10-15 hours long, no kinding aside. If you can actually complete the book then reading young adult fiction/manga is probably not a out of reach."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"Having formally studied Spanish, French, and German before undertaking a self-study of Japanese, I know what I like in a language text, and this is it. The author presents concepts in a logical manner with good explanations. He also transitions the student from romaji to the kana (and kanji) at a reasonable pace.I've been cramming this book at the somewhat harried rate of one chapter per week in preparation for a trip to Japan. Each chapter requires about 10-12 hours of study. I'd recommend ten days to two weeks per chapter to allow time for side-study of conversation (eg. with CDs such as Pimsleur) and writing (kana and kanji). At this pace, you could complete the book in about a year.My only complaint (other than the oft-mentioned lack of audio tapes) is that the author introduces vocabulary in a questionalbe order. Many words of limited use are introduced before more common words. Additionally, the author often will use a word in an example before or without introducing it, but thankfully it's always in the short dictionary at the end of the book. Hopefully, as I form a better foundation of vocabulary, these issues will cease to matter."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"I'm currently an exchange student to Japan, and this book did wonders for my Japanese ability.

I use Japanese in my everyday life as an exchange student, so I know first hand- this book is a blessing."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"I found the approach of this text to be most helpful. Each section demonstrates the way a certain sentence or verb functions in communicating to the other person. It then provides multiple examples of this type of function, using conversations, drawings and exercises. It then summarizes the grammar behind it, including the principles of different levels of formality and respect. This book has untangled most of the questions I ever had about Japanese. In fact, as someone once said, Japanese is not a difficult language, only difficult to learn (especially for a Westerner.)Personally, I enjoyed the fact that the majority of the Japanese in this book is written in the Japanese script, hiragana and katakana, with a sprinkling of the more common kanji (Chinese symbols) thrown in. It is written at an elementary level at which someone with no experience can realistically expect to learn to read basic phonetic Japanese, leaving learning of the 2,000+ kanji for the more advanced students. Although initially difficult, the script eventually becomes familiar and easier to read. This in turns is excellent preparation for the onslaught of signs and characters one encounters when one visits Japan.A set of tapes, or a native speaking teacher is a necessary addition to the book, to become familiar with the sound of spoken Japanese."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"A superb book.

The clear, straightforward explanations, useful example sentences for each grammatical structure, and varied excercises (with answer keys in the back so individuals studying on their own can check their work) make this an enjoyable and effective text.

Nobody in Japan can read romanized Japanese and most of the English in Japan is what J-popists refer to as \\"Engrish.\\" But there were not enough written exercises, for me, anyways. There are often relatively complex grammar points which are followed by a minimal number of exercises.The tapes are available through several web sites (do a search for \\"Japanese for Everyone, tapes\\" and it'll pop up on the first page). But the tapes are WAAAAAAY over priced (the best price I could find was $120) and are often only available from Japanese resources, so you get reamed on shipping.I'd suggest Rosetta Stone or Pimsluer (price-wise, Pimsluer is the biggest ripoff known to man, just FYI), along with speaking as much Japanese with native speakers as possible, via language exchange or spending a lot of time in spots with a lot of Japanese folks (an international district if you live in a larger city like Seattle) or, if you have the opportunity to be there, Japan."},{"Title":"Japanese for Everyone: A Functional Approach to Daily Communication","review":"Very different from other textbooks I've used. It's brilliant in how it's complete and extensive. It has bad reviews because it's so hard to get through. The first lesson has a full page of vocabulary to it, and you have to memorize every vocabulary word before you have finished a lesson. The book is very cramped as well. Ever seen Japanese books or textbooks? It's like those. The only complaint which everybody has is \\"where are the tapes?\\" (Which are awesome and very helpful). If you look hard enough, you can actually find these online, but it would be illegal to say where.All that being said, if you know zero about Japanese, you'll probably be very confused by everything and it will be twice as hard. If you know hiragana and katakana, with a simple understanding of sentence structure (Subject Object Verb), then this book is for you. I personally began after a highschool class of Japanese."},{"Title":"Abandon (Sonnet Books)","review":"Once again Jillian Hunter has woven her own special blend of magic with her latest book, Abandon. Ms. Hunter is one of the few writers today that can weave a tale around romance, mystery, intrigue while lacing it with her own style of humor. When you read her books, you can't help but enjoy them!As is her usual style, Hunter pits the lead male and female characters against each other. Sparks, both romantic and other, fly. Morweena Halliwell has lived on the Island of Abandon for most of her life while her father researched the ties the island had to King Arthur. Anthony Hartstone recently inherited the island from his brother and uses it as a bargaining tool in getting a child labor bill passed through parliament.Since the new owner, the Marquess of Camelbourne, requires several major renovations before he takes possession of the island, Anthony is stuck on Abandon until all work is completed. In the meantime, Morweena is determined to change his mind about selling her homeland and uses all of the powers at her disposal.With the right combination of humor and romance the story flows along carrying the reader on a peaceful and relaxing journey. You can always count on Hunter's support characters to be interesting and colorful. I haven't read a book by Jillian Hunter in which I didn't laugh out loud at some point during the story. Abandon also holds true to this, with humor entwined throughout. The sight of Morweena being chased down a hill by the local warlock, who casts spells on villagers for a price, is so hilarious that the reader can't help but chuckle. Maybe I should tell you that the evil sorcerer is chasing Morweena because she threw rocks at him. She threw them trying to save he released a puppy that he was planning to use in a spell. A large rock hit him, allowing the puppy to escape his grasp. Having the puppy running around growling and nipping at the heels of the warlock only added comedic fodder to the entire scene. It was pure Jillian Hunter and a mental image that will remain with readers for a long time.Although I enjoyed Abandon and found it to be a quick read, I was more fond of Indiscretion the book published prior to this one. If you're in the mood for a few giggles, a heart-warming romance, and a mystery aspect that most people can figure out, then this is definitely the book for you to read, as are any of her previous novels.Rumor has it that Jillian Hunter's next book is due out in August.

Anthony was in the middle of selling the island to the Marquess of Camelbourne, who would move in at the end of the month. Once done, the Marquess would become a powerful political ally for Anthony and would ensure Anthony's child labor reform measures would be passed.Morwenna Halliwell was a descendant of Morgan le Fay, the Enchantress. Abandon was enshrouded in legends that all who lived there believed. The people looked to Morwenna to change Anthony's mind about selling Abandon. The plans of the Marquess would scare off all the fish and the villagers would starve.At first, all believed Anthony to be cold. None knew he could not stop the sell without killing hundreds or thousands of children. Not even when he fell under Morwenna's innocent spell; or was it a spell from another source? There was a raven that warned of danger and considered to be King Arthur. Lilies were pulled up by their roots only to grow back within minutes. Fairies and Wee People seemed to be everywhere. A strange book with messages and an even stranger white cat kept appearing and disappearing with odd timing. There was a self proclaimed dark sorcerer to cause trouble, strange sounds and sightings, and dark mists that were so thick you could not see your hand in front of your face! Between all the odd things going on and his attraction to Morwenna, Anthony never stood a chance!***** I do believe that Jillian Hunter could be an Enchantress herself! Here she has taken the legends surrounding King Arthur and created a magical masterpiece that could convert any non-believer! Awesome tale!"},{"Title":"Abandon (Sonnet Books)","review":"Anthony Hartstone, the Earl of Pentargon is closing out the estate of his recently deceased brother Arthur by selling his beloved island ABANDON to the Marquess of Camelbourne. In exchange for ridding himself of a worthless piece of granite, Anthony expects to gain the Marquess' support on a child labor reform bill.The islanders turn to Morwenna Halliwell as the only hope to change Anthony's mind because they fear the changes that Camelbourne will do to their beloved home. When she fails to persuade the noble to change his mind even while casting a spell on him, everyone feels forlorn that Anthony will desert them. However, he knows that without the Marquess' support, his bill to make things safe for children will fail. There is also a dark sorcerer causing trouble and animals and mythical people doing strange things that make no sense to the practical minded Anthony. Only love for Morwenna seems right in this upside down ABANDON.ABANDON is a wonderful tale that satirizes the Arthurian legend with a powerful historical romance that never slows down on the action or the magic. The story line is filled with weird characters that make for an enchanting tale that proves Jillian Hunter is clearly a descendent of Merlin by magically transporting readers to a world of enchantment.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Abandon (Sonnet Books)","review":"I've read several books by Jillian Hunter; most of which were either mediocre or only moderately memorable. This, however, startled me. Although the story itself is very simple (except for a surprise at the end), the way it's written is phenomenal. It reads like a fairytale or a legend from Arthurian lore. It flows beautifully, and the characters are very vivid. In terms of character-development, this is not a book that focuses heavily in that department. And usually, I would not recommend a book like that. But, again, I was taken away. The characters, arguably, (especially Morweena) were so enchanting already that further development would be superfluous. I HIGHLY recommend this novel. It's definitely become a personal favorite."},{"Title":"Abandon (Sonnet Books)","review":"ABANDON is a wonderful romance tale filled with enchanting fairies, potions and folklore on a captivating island! The hero is everything gallant, handsome and valiant while the heroine is everything beautiful, gentle and compassionate.

I also read \\"The Seduction of an English Scoundrel\\" (excellent!) and have already bought a few others as I know she will continue to be interesting to me. I like this author and how descriptive she can be and her characters always seem to come alive off the page which is refreshing. They are not flat characters with little dimension. Her plot lines are always complete without becoming over whelming.This book had the charm of being set on an island called \\"Abandon\\" and it seemed to have touches of the supernatural - both in what people did and what happened to the land itself. Fortunately, any hokey pokey was for the good of man and not evil (except for the creepy little man called Pasco). The lead heroine Morwenna was beloved by the island people for all the good that she did for everyone and they were also a little mystified of the \\"magic\\" she could perform. Morwenna's magic was more what occurred around her versus what she could conjure up herself - that was the charming part of her mischief.Our hero Anthony Pentargon took over the island when his brother died. Anthony came to clean up his brother's estate and planned to sell the island and land to a high ranking English lord in parliament for the exchange of help in passing laws to help out the poor and indigent children of London. Morwenna and her fellow countryman would loose out if the land was sold off so, she attempted to intervene and stop the transaction. Needless to say, the hero and heroine become charmed with one another during their interactions of the sale and their relationship developed.The love scenes were few but detailed. I was a little disappointed that they fell so quickly for one another and their early intimate scenes were a bit \\"advanced\\" for the average virgin girl but, that's love story writing for you. The story was a bit short compared to most romance novels I have read so, it seemed things might have taken a quicker pace due to this. Regardless, the scenes were tasteful and pleasing to read.There are twists and turns in the book for the reader to find out who is sabotaging things, who is trying to hurt Morwenna and if the sale does occur. Although this book is not super heavy in terms of deep romance, lusty sex or advanced plot lines it is still interesting and fun to read. I liked all the illusions to Anthony getting to hear musical harp music, seeing white cats, talking to spirit ghosts that no one else seems to hear or see and flowers growing from stones in only hours! This look into the other world is only for him as he develops into a better man and falls for the magical siren called Morwenna. It's fun to watch a man so set I his modern ways fall prey to the magical side of life.This was a charming book and likeable in every way. It was smart, witty and fun to read. I got the book read in only a few hours - easy to follow. I say buy this and others from this author as I'm sure you'll be pleased. Judging by other feedback, I'm not alone in this praise! Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Abandon (Sonnet Books)","review":"Anthony is seen as a villain by the people of Abandon Island.

Living with a village Orthodox priest and his loving wife, Theo, the boy, takes part in the day to day life of the village during World War II, a village constantly under threat by the Nazis. Though he assists the priest in many brave acts (including smuggling out a rabbi and his son, David), Theo's major act of resistance is to create a clever puppet show which depicts both Hitler and Mussolini as buffoons. In the end, he does summon the \\"courage\\" to kill a Nazi who torments the priest's wife while trying to extract information from her about an illegal printing press.Theo is a graceful,informative, and sensitive book; however, it is not one that I think most children would enjoy. As others have noted, the book really does require some background knowledge of World War II history, and there are numerous political references. Theo, though essentially a believable character, is rather idealized, and I doubt most modern children could relate to him or his fascination with puppets. In the end, then, though \\"educational\\", the book is not one I would recommend, in spite of the Horn Book's high praises."},{"Title":"Theo","review":"Theo is a well written, sensitive and appropriately painful historical fiction. Harrison conveys the terrible impact on Greek Life during WWII Nazi occupation,written from a Christian orphan's (Theo} perspective. Theo demonstes the fact that to survive, one must possess bravery and fear simulataneously. Harrison uses the Karageosis, the historically correct puppet to express Theo's strong will, bravery, sadness and humor throughout the story. Theo also is protected my a Priest and his saintly wife, who dedicate their lives to saving Greek Jews from deportation and extinction. This book is an important work since it accurately conveys the war's impact on all Greeks-Gypsys, Chrisitans, Jews, city dwellers and countryfolk alike. The young reader, to fully understand, must have general knowledge of the holocaust, Nazi Germany, and WWII. The story is sad, but worth the pain. The adult reader will be reminded of the many humans dedicated to help eachother despite their religious/cultural differnces during WWII. This provides inspiration and comfort."},{"Title":"Theo","review":"Theo, a ten-year-old boy, is an orphan who lives with his brother.

So Theo finds a puppet that his dad made before he dided, called Karageosis. Theo uses Karageosis to share his feelings with--almost as if he's real.The book is exciting because of the resistance acts the brothers perform. It can aslo be a little sad at times, though, you can really get into it.This book would be good for a reader that can be patient and wait for the excitment. They must also have some knowledge on the whole Occupation to understand where Theo's feelings are coming from."},{"Title":"Hippocrene Polish Children's Picture Dictionary: English-Polish/Polish-English","review":"Nice idea that utilizes visualization as a tool to learn Polish words.

(If the 500 words were available as deck of cards, I would buy the deck instead of the book for sure.) If you present the vocabulary to your young child in terms of few words at a time, you will build not only Polish but also English vocabulary.My child just turned 3 years old. He reads English and now I am using this source, among others, as a way to reinforce English and to teach the basic Polish vocabulary.I paid $14.95 for the book, not the strange pricing presented above $500.I also recommend Usborne Everyday Words Polish Flashcards (50 words), which I got on E-bay for around $12 from UK.

The simplistic, politial tract of Ann Coulter, for instance, is to this seriously written HISTORY as a supermarket tabloid is to a play by Maxwell Anderson.

I find the ending, where the family is provided with a home, particularly fine. Their new home is only a cellar apartment, but you know it is going to be a great, safe, environment for the children to grow up in, where their mother has suitable employment and they have a grandpa as well.I was amused by the readers' comments that this book was strange because the mother leaves the kids to fend for themselves in the city while she goes to work, and because they never reminisce about their dead father. Well, this is not a story about suburban America! In Europe, kids were not traditionally coddled as they are here. Adults routinely let them fend for themselves. (See the great French short film \\"The Red Balloon,\\" for example.) Kids in Europe even nowadays take public transit alone at quite young ages, and they don't necessarily have babysitters when the parents go out, either. And as far as cozily reminiscing about the father ... maybe that would be the recommendation of a modern American psychologist, but it isn't necessarily the way things are in the real world! I find the bitter, proud, overwhelmed mother to be a masterful characterization, and her silence about the father is consistent with her personality.This book's picture of homelessness is far from the one-sided image \\"homeless people are lazy\\" that some readers found. There are lots of reasons (psychological, cultural, and economic) provided for homelessness in these pages. There are no deinstitutionalized mentally ill people or substance abusers, though, so it's not a picture of homelessness in modern America."},{"Title":"The family under the bridge","review":"This is a true classic for me that struck such a chord with me when I was younger. I just had to have the hardcopy for my \\"keeper\\" bookshelf.

While this book does have many good points, this isn't a book I would recommend. The story would be very entertaining to a fifth grader but the vocabulary skills and difficulty understanding Paris or gypsies would frustrate a reader in this age group. A sixth grader, however, would more easily comprehend the vocabulary (I admit that I didn't know many of the words and had to guess at their meaning in context--and I don't consider my vocabulary skills poor by any means) and cultural situations but they would be bored by the simplistic story.

He begs and does odd jobs for money to take care of himself and buy food. One day he finds a mother and her three children in his &quot;home&quot;, under the bridge. At first he is gruff and unhappy about sharing the bridge, but in time he begins to like and help care for this poor homeless family. As Christmas nears, the children ask for nothing except a home of their own and Armand comes up with a plan to make their wish come true. Natalie Savage Carlson has written a beautiful, sensitive story full of humor, insight and wisdom.

Perfect for children aged 9-12, this is also a great read-aloud book the entire family can enjoy and discuss. The Family Under the Bridge is a thoughtful, heartwarming story and Ms Carlson deserved all the awards this book won."},{"Title":"The family under the bridge","review":"Natalie Savage Carlson perfectly illustrates what it means to be a family in this heartwarming book. The book is set in Paris in the early 1900's. It explores the world of hoboes and homeless people, a topic which children usually have little experience with. Armand is a homeless man who lives a solitary life under a bridge over the Seine River. He faithfully avoids children, calling them starlings, and saying they will steal your heart if you aren't careful. One day he arrives back home under the bridge, only to find a group of starlings sleeping in his spot. He tries his best to keep them out of his heart, but they work their way in and call Armand their grandpa. The importance of family is the main theme of this book. Armand finds a family and in the end couldn't be happier about it.Children will love this book. Homelessness isn't something that most children are very familiar with. This unique book will help children understand that even children their age can be homeless. Most homeless people are looked at as being lazy and worthless. This book will show children that some homeless people are just like them, but they are just down in their luck. This is a heartwarming book and deserves attention in the classroom."},{"Title":"The family under the bridge","review":"The Family Under the Bridge is about an old crabby hobo named Armand who had nothing but the raged clothes on his back and a little baby buggy with his belongings. He lived in crowded corners and alleys and then in the winter he would live under a bridge. One winter, he was surprised to find three children living under his bridge, and to make matters worse, Armand absolutely hated children. He decided to find another bridge since there were many bridges in Paris, but the children begged him to stay. He softened his heart and decided to stay with the three children and their mother. Armand took the children along with him while he traveled around the streets. It was not long before Armand realized he had gotten himself a family- one he loved with all his heart. They stayed together and Armand soon found a job and got a house for the five of them to live in.I enjoyed The Family Under the Bridge but it wasn't one of my all-time favorites. It was fairly entertaining. Many parts of the book were exciting and I wanted to keep reading to find out what happened next, but there were also some slow parts. Overall I thought it was a pretty good book."},{"Title":"The family under the bridge","review":"What ever happened to the good old days when children and tramps could live under the bridges of Paris, France in peaceful harmony? Well now we can return once again those halcyon days with Natalie Savage Carlson's Newbery Honor winning little book, \\"The Family Under the Bridge\\". A simple remarkably upbeat little tale, it defines what it means to be a family while telling the tale of an adorable homeless man and his unwilling adoption by three fatherless children. As storybooks go, this one has aged a bit poorly in light of its child abandonment and transient issues. But it has a good heart and a fine little story. I'm not going to put it on a pedestal or say that in 200 years it should be remembered as one of the top 100 children's books of the 20th century. But it's cute and probably has legions of fans who remember it from their own youth.Hobos may come and hobos may go, but Armand of Paris isn't going anywhere. He loves his beautiful French city with its history and ample bridges to sleep under. With winter fast approaching, Armand's just on his way to put his ever moving home under his favorite bridge when he receives a nasty shock. There, camped out under a thin blanket, are three red-haired children. Armand doesn't trust children as a rule. His greatest fear is that he'll grow to love them and then no longer be the freewheeling king of the road that he currently is. These fears prove to be well founded when the kids adopt Armand as an unofficial grandfatherly figure and go with him all around and about the city. Their dream is to someday have a home of their own, and with Armand's help and a little gumption, that dream starts to look a little more possible every day.The story's cute enough, with Armand as a roly-poly harmless figure leading the kids hither and thither throughout Paris. There are some wonderful sequences with a traveling band of gypsies (who, remarkably, are exempt from that stereotypical magic-creature label they've acquired in hundreds of other children's books). The gypsies are presented as regular folks, which I appreciated hugely. Also, the book has a satisfying ending that all children hearing it will appreciate. Carlson's narrative voice is affecting and Garth Williams's illustrations (you may best remember him as the illustrator of the \\"Little House\\" books as well as \\"The Cricket In Times Square\\") are striking.But then there are the problems that a book written in 1958 must face. Now in this story, the mother character regularly abandons her children, without food, under a bridge in busy Paris. She does this, rather than put them in a home where they could get (oh, I dunno) warm clothes and food, because of a fanatical instinct to keep the family together. I can understand this on some level. No one likes to be separated from their relations. However, even after the mother makes the acquaintance of Armand (who she does not trust for a number of reasons), she still leaves her children with him all day. She does not give them any food (they have to eat Armand's), or toys, or really anything to do but follow a fellow they don't even know around and about. When he feeds them during the day by urging them to sing and then collecting money from strangers, she's incensed. Better that her kids go hungry than (gasp, shudder) SING! If the bad parenting going on in this story weren't enough, the idea that people are homeless simply because they are lazy is a bit worn as well. Pretty much every tramp in this book is homeless because he or she wants to be. Plenty get work at a drop of a hat, and at the end of the tale Armand goes from a fellow with zero job experience to the superintendent of a building. And all because he's finally decided to get a job. So when your kids walk down the street and see homeless people asking for food or money, you can bet they'll rest assured that those people are there because they're just too lazy to get hired somewhere. What a lovely lesson to learn from a book.Ugh. So there's that. It's a nice tale, don't get me wrong. But since I didn't grow up with it myself, I haven't a nostalgia for it that so many others do. I can see its charms and I can see its flaws. I prefer its charms, but I can't help but point out where it goes awry. All in all, it's a fine little story and I don't mean to imply that by reading it your kids will suddenly become callous towards those in need. Just bear in mind what the book is saying."},{"Title":"The family under the bridge","review":"I thought this book was great. Right from the start A gypsy tells Armand that he would have an adventure that day. That day he meet the Calcet family and his life was not the same. Even though he tried to guard his heart, the kids got through to him. It is a great book to read with your family because it offers hope and takes you though on an adventure through Paris, including Notre Dame Cathedral, and The Court of Miracles. Armand said \\"you should never give up hope,\\" when the fisherman wound up the fishing pole and found the missing pair of his shoe. It it a great book for families that are homeless or having a hard time in life and for all ages."},{"Title":"The family under the bridge","review":"This is the wonderfully illustrated story of a mother and three children that are homeless and find a spot underneath a bridge in Paris. Alas, the bridge belongs to a hobo, who seems grouchy at first. It doesn't take long for the hobo to take to the starlings, though, and this tale goes on with a series of adventures that finally leads to a home for all involved. It's a lovely tale with the moral of the story being man's humanity to man. I loved this book as a child, and it hasn't lost any of it's flavor with age."},{"Title":"The family under the bridge","review":"by Freya JamisonHave you ever wondered about homeless people? If you have, then you should read The Family Under the Bridge! In the story, a hobo named Armand goes back to his winter home (under a bridge in Paris, France) and finds three small children there. Armand never liked kids so he tried to get them out but they wouldn't budge and after a while he came to love them. During the next few days he took them wherever he went during the day and he bought them food. About a week after that, two ladies came and threatened to take the children to a boarding school so Armand brought them to the gypsies. So if you like books about love, friendship and caring you should read The Family Under the Bridge!"},{"Title":"The family under the bridge","review":"I picked this book up at the library thinking that it might help me in my own writing process and found it to be a good story with a wholesome underlying message.Armand is a friendly hobo in Paris who is entering the holiday season. At these coldest of times, he makes his way to his usual dwelling under a bridge. This year he finds three young children and their mangy dog occupying his normal spot.What Armand comes to find out is that these children and their mother are homeless because they can't afford rent. Armand is firm about moving on because he doesn't want the \\"starlings\\" to steal his heart. Yet, the children eventually soften his heart enough that he feels compelled to stay and help.This story helped me realize why we actually go to work. Most people would probably not go to work if they didn't have bills or a family that needed their care. Honestly, it would be very intriguing to pack a small bag and travel around the country. Oh, you might have to humble yourself and ask for a few things on the way, but it sounds fun. I probably wouldn't mind sleeping outside on occasion. You figure, everyone needs a breath of fresh air and the outdoor sounds could become peaceful. Yet, I suppose there would come a time that you would have to move on.Armand put it best about begging when he said, \\"It takes away a man's self-respect.\\" There comes a time in a man's life where he has to decide whether he's a bum or whether he is willing to work. We all know work is not fun. That's why it's called work. You do your job not because you like it (even though that might be the case), but because you must for your family's sake. It is for the love of your family that you move on and face a job full of hardship.I pray that more people change their ways like Armand and decide to love and care for other people besides themselves."},{"Title":"The family under the bridge","review":"I volunteer in a reading program in a local elementary school and in the media center. This will be the fourth year we will be reading this book aloud in the fourth grade. I made a word list for each student. We locate all place named in the book on a posted map in the classroom. I also consult other sources and copy to show the students that there are suce things as the Louvre, the market place, the bridges. The children make friends with the children in the book and feel as they feel living wthout a home or father. They watch the transformation of Armand and their mother realizing that one can accept help from another gracefully. They also like Jojo and how he turns white after his bath, to say nothing of Armand's improved appearance! We'll keep this book in our collection.

And in the beginning the hobo is mean and lives by himself under a bridge in Paris. And one day 3 red headed children come by and they stay under the bridge with the hobo until their mom comes back but the hobo doesn't like the homeless children nor their mother and he says leave this is my bridge and their mom says no it's not the bridge doesn't belong to anyone and he says \\"this woman has pride and pride and life under the bridge don't mix\\". Then when their mom went to work he gave them some of his food and when their mom came back she said \\" don't take his food we are not beggars I have a descent job at the laundry mat. And they said to the hobo \\"why are you letting us stay under you bridge\\" and he said \\" because I am a soft hearted tramp and then they asked why he let them eat his food and he said because he is a stupid soft-hearted tramp. Then he let them go with him to Halles one day and they sang for money and they used it for pancakes.Then one day 2 women came by and said they would put the children in a home and their mom in jail. So the hobo took them to his friend said they could stay with them she was a gypsy and Suzy met Tinka and taught her letters and Paul played with the boys.

The End..."},{"Title":"The family under the bridge","review":"The rapid dialogue, jo-jo (the dog) and christmas time plot keeps the interest of even very young children. My 4 and 6 year old could easily understand how three homeless children would want a home more than toys at christmas time. Many moral themes are explored such as lying, stealing, pride, slothfulness, generousity, and love, but all are merely brushed over with suggestion and no deep topics are probed within the character's dialogue or heart. Probably the most profound statement is the definition of a home found on the last page. All characters were interesting but not fully developed. Motives to why the hobo chose to be a hobo to begin with are never explained. How the father died is never explained either and the children never speak of him (such as missing him or recalling him or his words). The characters are quite shallow.But the story moves quickly and has a lot of life and interesting scenes in it. The detailed descriptions of the scenery make you feel like you are there seeing it!Overall, it is a good one time read but not likely one that we read again and again!"},{"Title":"The family under the bridge","review":"I use this title with sixth graders at Christmastime.

Armand, an elderly homeless man, was perfectly contented with his life. All his belongings fit into a baby stroller, and his home under a bridge was protected from the wind and weather. So he was not at all pleased to come home one day and find three small children huddled in the corner that he called home. He wanted to ignore them, but soon he found himself worrying about them. When a grouchy old man finds himself caring about others at Christmas time, who knows what miracles could happen?This gentle story has the tone and tenderness of the Christmas movie classic Miracle on 34th Street. Would make a lovely family read-aloud at Christmas time. Ages 7-12."},{"Title":"The family under the bridge","review":"The Family Under The Bridge is a great book.

They wanted him to say sorry to their mom. He didn't want to do that but they were still a family.To get money, Armand told the kids to sing. The people of Paris started to come and watch the homeless, moneyless kids sing for money. Pople started to drop money into Armand's hat. When the first crowd left, another crowd came and started to drop more money into Armand's hat. After a while, they had a lot of money.At the end, Armand finally said sorry to his wife and his she helped him get a job. They made him wash himself, get new clothes and to trim his hair so he would look like a new person again. He went to apply for the job and was accepted.

Not good quality paper for the text block at all, not sure it's worth it buying the hardcover if the inside pages will yellow and turn brittle over time like paperbacks do."},{"Title":"The family under the bridge","review":"I recently read this to my Kindergarten-aged children as part of their homeschool English/Reading/Language Arts curriculum. We all loved it! What a wonderful short story of love and devotion -- a compelling tale of how an old man who is firmly set in his ways can change virtually overnight, as the direct result of the love of children as well as being wanted, needed and included in a family. Set in France, The Family Under the Bridge provides valuable life lessons through the inclusion of various subcultural vignettes -- homeless people, gypsies, layabouts, blue collar workers, even proud widowed mothers who are determined to keep their families together at ALL cost. It held my interest as an adult right up to the last page. Both of my children enjoyed it and my six-year old son was actually upset that the story ended; that we didn't get to \\"go on\\" with Armaund and the Calcets and the dog that looked like it was supposed to be white. He simply didn't want the story to ever end! Just now, my husband, the engineer, took it to bed to read he was so intrigued by our ravings. Due to vocabulary and cultural context, I would guess this to be most appropriate as a reader for the 9-12 year old range. But definitely a good book for the entire family to enjoy together at any age or stage."},{"Title":"The family under the bridge","review":"Like a cheery cup of cocoa, this little book will warm you during the holidays. A Paris hobo, Armand, is content in his life alone, and refuses any sort of commitment, never letting anything affect his freedom or his heart. This all changes when he finds his favorite winter shelter is occupied by a homeless family of three children. Cold, tired and hungry, he sets out to cheer them up by taking them to see Santa Claus, getting them fed along the way by taking up change for their singing. When the mother finds out, she is furious, and refuses all charity. Armand packs his meager belongings and walks away, only too happy to leave the little \\"starlings\\" on their own, lest he loose his heart and experience any more ingratitude. As he says, \\"The street has a way of taking your pride.\\"The next day, however, he finds a pair of do-gooding women on their way to the authorities. Armand knows their do-gooding will surely result in breaking up the family while the unsuspecting mother is at work. What to do? And what to do about the children's insistence that Santa is going to bring them a house for Christmas? How can he keep them together, without their loosing faith in Santa and all of the good things of this world?This is a cheery, well-written story that will take you no time to read--it's not much bigger than a short story. However, the author throws in some clever twists that lead you to a different ending than you would normally expect. Uplifting and simple, it's the kind of book to get your children at Christmas to make them aware of not only other people's needs, but other people's kindness."},{"Title":"The family under the bridge","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Unfortunately they select a spot which 'belongs' to a hobo who hates children, has no heart, and has forgotten his own name. Winter descends and the cold children try to keep warm and get food while their mama works during the day. The hobo reluctantly helps them a little and the story continues to draw you in as Christmas nears. A happy ending for all, very Parisian, finishes the tale.I read this to my classes when we studied Europe or at Christmas-time. I feel it is better to read it TO children as the French names of places may deter them, but it is certainly not a difficult story to understand and love. And in today's difficult times it brings empathy for others and loving values to discuss. If a child ever gets to Paris he will certainly see the bridges in a different light."},{"Title":"The family under the bridge","review":"Santa would not like this book as it makes it sound like he's not real and that he travels by donkey when he's in France and then ends up really just being a paid homeless man who can't grant wishes. It might even make some children think he isn't real. Not for kids under 11. If only the author didn't take that road, this is actually a good book, that part didn't need to be in it at all. As a mother, I enjoyed it, and am thankful I read it as I can now put it away for a few years and my child can remain a child for awhile. Sadly, this is a good chapter book for 7 to 10 year olds, the exact age that should NOT read it."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Have you ever moved from a place that you loved dearly?

When I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything life entails, I tell myself that I need a little Fr. Tim. I pick up a Mitford novel and feel better. Because of my love for this series, I pre-ordered \\"Light From Heaven\\" in the summer. When it arrived, I sat down to devour it. A week later, I was still trying to get through this preachy, hymn and scripture laden tome. I started to skim through the novel, bypassing all the seeming attempts to convert the non-christian. I also found I really did not care about the multitude of new and uninteresting characters Karon introduced. If the series had to end, I wanted to visit with my \\"Mitford family\\" one last time.

JK has interspersed uplifting spiritual passages and hymns with meaningful new relationships and challenges. Father Timothy Kavanaugh is at his best when he assumes the position of vicar of a very small, abandoned church in the mountains. This is an amusing story with great characterizations. Father Tim continues to \\"meddle\\" in the lives of his old and new flock - with surprising and satisfying outcomes. I too would like to have seen a slightly longer book, but most of the issues were resolved and it had a comfortable ending."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I've read all of this author's books and was a little worried that this one, being the last in the series, might be a little \\"ho-hum.\\" Far from it! As usual, Jan Karon has dug deep and produced another set of memorable characters (and animals) that will long live in my memory. She never ceases to inspire and after I finished this novel, I was left with the same sense of satisfaction and warm heart that I had after reading all of her other books. I don't know what kind of writing adventure Jan Karon is taking her readers on next, but, whatever it is, I'm there!"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Like many of the reviewers here, I was sorely disappointed by this final visit to Mitford, first and foremost because it didn't feel like a visit to Mitford at all! We hardly see any of our beloved characters, although they are mentioned in passing quite frequently. It seems to me that Karon got a little overexcited about her new Father Tim series and wrote the first book for that, instead of truly concluding the Mitford series. For those of us who have come to feel like residents of Mitford ourselves, there was very little closure provided for several of the major storylines that have been carried throughout the series, most notably those dealing with Dooley and his siblings. What you do get is something that feels like a marketing ploy to get us hooked on new characters and storylines with the hopes that we will hear more about them in the Father Tim novels. There are so many of us who have been devoted readers; this wasn't necessary and is, in fact, somewhat of a deterrant. A very disappointing book, overall."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"This book met all my expectations for closure--to find out how Father Tim's Mitford adventures would end without feeling that something was \\"left out.\\" It wasn't. All my questions about on-hold characters and situations were answered. Ms. Karon's characters never shine more brightly as they do in this book, probably my favorite of the series. Her well-written prose again paints warm and charming portraits of life with Fa. Tim, Cynthia, Dooley, Barnabas and Violet. Readers who enjoy the faith element of the stories will be encouraged in their own spiritual journeys as Fa. Tim affirms again and again the goodness of God and life. I smiled from page to page. If you want to feel good, travel to Mitford--read this book. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Having been a fan of Midford (except for the smaller \\"novellas\\" that were an obvious marketing ploy) I have to say that I loved this book.For the reviewers who have complained that this does not tie together any loose ends, I would just like to say that they were tied together fine for me and while there may be some who wanted the \\"happily ever after\\" ending where things just all fall into place and nothing is left to the readers imagination, I must say that I prefer it this way. I prefer knowing that life does go on for Father Tim and that he will always meet new and exciting people and no matter how much we love the old friends, we are always ready for new.I was slightly disappointed with the treatment of the deaf individual. It did seem as if while he was very talented, that was not what was important for those around him...he was still deaf and that is what they all focused on rather than his woodworking.All in all, it was a great book and a great series!"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Jan Karon's other Mitford books, but I liked this one even better.

I really enjoyed, however, the memorial service - what a hoot!"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Jan Karon is a wonderful writer, and the Midford series is especially well written. You feel like you're right there in the town with the characters of the book."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"It's the final encore for the characters of Mitford, \\"the little town with the big heart,\\" as the curtain rings down on the long-running series. Fans who have devotedly read each of the Mitford Years novels will be delighted that this long-awaited conclusion is everything that might be hoped for, and a little bit more.Father Tim Kavanaugh and his wife Cynthia are farm-sitting for their friends, just 20 minutes from Mitford. It's the setting for a number of developments. Dooley is a college student studying to be a veterinarian, and about to find out he has a huge inheritance that will smooth his future career path. He's also about to make his relationship as \\"son\\" to Father Tim and Cynthia official. Those who remember the abused little boy Dooley, showing up on the then-bachelor Father Tim's doorstep in the inaugural novel AT HOME IN MITFORD, may shed a tear or two, as readers see what the love of a good man can mean to a boy starved for attention, affection and discipline. It's unabashedly poignant. Not that Father Tim's parenting work is done --- Dooley's little brother Sammy is now part of the Kavanaugh family, rough around the edges and harboring a penchant for shooting pool and planting gardens. And Kenny, Dooley's missing sibling, still must be found and returned to the fold.Cynthia, who had planned to tackle nothing more difficult than learning how to make good home fries, read, and learn needlepoint while on the farm, ends up hard at work on a series of watercolors for a calendar featuring Violet, the cat, in the country. With Cynthia so busy, Father Tim finds that he wants something concrete to do. He's delighted when he's asked to be the vicar of a small church, Holy Trinity, that has been empty for almost 40 years. But Father Tim discovers that while the church has been empty, it's not been neglected, and a new beginning awaits him. Kudos to Jan Karon, who shows beautifully through both Father Tim and Cynthia that getting older does not mean \\"retiring\\" from life. Some of the best work we do might come after 60!Karon issues an altar call for all the characters readers have grown to love. The irascible Emma, Father Tim's former assistant, shoots him hilarious emails full of her fears about her upcoming trip to England. Puny has given birth to a second set of twins, this time boys, and the unlikable Edith Mallory, who suffered a serious head injury seven months before the story opens, speaks a single word: \\"God.\\" Many others are woven throughout the story. Some of the beloved Mitford characters are dead or dying: Russell Jacks (who made \\"livermush\\" famous for Karon's readers), Absalom Greer, Miss Sadie, and Uncle Billy. Dying is on Father Tim's mind more these days as he nears the ripe age of 70: \\"He wasn't however, afraid of dying; he knew where he was going, what he feared, instead, was leaving some crucial work undone...\\"The plot turns easily on simple things: the restoring of the abandoned Holy Trinity church and recovery of its congregation, a search for Miss Sadie's cache of money hidden in an old Plymouth automobile, the dilemmas of Cynthia's work as an artist in the midst of farm life, and the challenges of taking neglected children in hand.More surprisingly, perhaps (and a hint of the promised Father Tim Novels series to come?), a new cast of characters parades across the pages: Agnes Merton, one of the last faithful members of Holy Trinity and a newfound friend to Father Tim; Robert, who served time for murder in prison; Rooter, whose antics will make you smile; and Clarence, a deaf and talented carpenter. There's also the cranky, reclusive Jubal Adderholt whose cabin walls are furred with squirrel tails, and the McKinney sisters, Mary and Martha (one fat, one thin). Father Tim takes on another attention-starved child \\"project\\" in precocious five-year-old Sissie, the daughter of Dovey Gleason, who is chronically bed-ridden with a mysterious illness.As you'd expect, there's some ruminations about the past, some wrapping up of old plotlines, and a few surprises. This is a tender tale, spiced with plenty of prayers, old hymns, homilies, good food, and country jokes that would make Uncle Billy Watson proud. Mitford lovers will turn the final pages of LIGHT FROM HEAVEN with the feeling that comes after finishing a big, delicious meal: full, satisfied, and content.[...]"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Having read all of the books in this series, I must say that the entire epic was a wonderful one. I wonder if Karon could surprise us all and come somehow continue this story.

She does such a wonderful job of placing you in the scene. If you haven't read her others, I would start at the beginning and read them all. If you enjoy some good clean fiction, the series is a must read. Also, I have read the book that I see selling together with Jan's book (Passengers Side). This is an absolutely wonderful book.

Even those stubborn characters have such intering personalities I couldn't wait to visit them again. I realize this is the end of the series but I feel as if we'll meet again...... I think it also shows that senior citizens have a valuable space to fill and that there's always a new adventure around the corner if one is open to it!

It was quite disappointing. I had hoped with this last book, all the \\"ends tied up\\" would be with the characters we have known for the whole series. I couldn't keep all the new people straight. I was hoping for more of Dooley as a young man. Nope. Puny has a new set of twins, and it was barely mentioned. Edith Mallory found God? Why? We don't know. BIG SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!!! And after searching all over for Kenny, he just happens to show up at Fr Tim's door!?! I just shook my head at that. It seems Ms. Karon wanted to get this book out of the way, so she could get on with the new Father Tim novels. I hope they will be like the first 5 books of the Mitford series."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Nine may be an unlucky number for Jan Karon. The first eight Mitford novels were delightful. Somehow in writing the ninth, she forgot to put in a plot. The book jumps from vignette to vignette, some only a few sentences long. The repetition of pet words and phrases, from \\"buddyroe\\" to \\"consider it done,\\" are wearing in this book. She should have stopped at book number eight."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I've read all of the Midford series and enjoyed all of them. However, I suppose my expectations were too great for this last book of the series. To me, this book was the least enjoyable. Too many new characters and too much mountain talk. Just got boring after a while. I would still buy this book though and I'm so sorry to see this series come to an end. I feel that I am losing some old and cherished friends. Jan Karon is a great writer and in my mind she is Cynthia Kavanaugh!"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Last week I ordered both Light from Heaven and the The Purpose driven Life. I thoroughly enjoyed Light From heaven. It was my first Jan Karon read. I decided I will go back to the start of the series, and read them all. (I wish I would have done that first). Karon does a great job of placing you right there in the scene. The other book I will say was surprisingly wonderful, especially considering that I never heard of Rick Warren before his book. Warren's book was very insightful - I can easily see why it's a best seller.I think you would love both.It is nice to read some fiction for a change, and Jan Karon is an author that I'm glad I checked out."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Jan Karon hits all the right notes as she writes this, the last book of the Mitford Series. Father Tim and Cynthia are still living at their friends' farm while they are away. Father Tim is growing somewhat restless when he hears that he has a new assignment--to re-open Holy Trinity Church which has been closed for 40 years. It sounds like a daunting task, but Timothy has an unknown ally who has been tending to the church in the hope that a new rector would arrive some day. The new church gives the series a whole new group of characters, charming mountain folk who bless Timothy and challenge him at the same time. He deals with a cantankerous man who refuses to come to church, a woman with a mysterious illness, and a man who spent time in jail for murder. He does not forget about his old parishioners, but sees a miraculous change in a previously unrepentant woman, looks for money that another one has hidden, and mourns the death of two others. Throughout the book he receives humorous e-mails from his former secretary, Emma, who is vacationing in England, and receives new blessings from the Barlowe family's children. This book is as heartwarming as any in the series and is a wonderful ending to a fictional world that is always a pleasure to visit."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"It is a truth generally acknowledged that good characters (fictional or biographical) are more difficult to render attractive and interesting than bad characters, for whatever reason. Jan Karon has found a literary career in making this difficult accomplishment look easy. Her Father Tim, Cynthia Coppersmith, Miss Sadie Baxter, et al, manage to be not only good but attractive and interesting, various in their goodness, not merely conforming to some saintly stereotype. Light from Heaven extends Karon's examination of the many different ways it is possible to be good, introducing us to the shy but brave Rooter, the persevering Agnes, the pugnacious but vulnerable Jubal, etc., in a new setting: Father Tim's one-year interim pastorate in the freshly-reopened mountain church of Holy Trinity. Unlike some other reviewers on this site, I find the new characters appealing for the most part, and if sisters Mary and Martha (for instance) are a bit unbelievable, so is Barnabas, and has been from chapter one of book one (a dog obeying the sound and not the sense of Scripture? You'll never ever ever find one in real life).But gracious, isn't that plot flimsy?Light from Heaven isn't a cohesive book at all, as it turns out. I base this opinion not on the bulk of the book, which my wife and I enjoyed on CD thanks in part to John McDonough's always excellent narration, but on the end, which has almost nothing to do with the rest of the book. Although one of my friends somewhat justifiably complains that nothing ever happens in the Mitford series, something usually does; Karon does usually provide some kind of tension that makes a story out of a year or two hanging out in Mitford. Usually the end of the book is the end of something. Somebody gets saved, rescued, found, etc. Listening through Light from Heaven, I kept searching for a kind of overarching tension. Was it the halting progress of Holy Trinity church under Father Tim's benevolent leadership? The chicken thief? The final fate of the Barlowes? Agnes's retrospective rehearsal of her past? None of these, by itself or in tandem with other plot lines, appears capable in Karon's mind of sustaining a book. Each of these common threads is more or less as finished as it's going to be by the time Father Tim begins his grand finale sermon at Holy Trinity, and a good chunk of the book is still to go. If I were you (and this is the first book of thousands in my life that I'd suggest this of), I'd just stop right there when Father Tim begins to preach. All the good stuff has already happened: the exposure of the chicken thief, the exhilaratingly awkward humorous funeral, the mysteriously tended empty church, the three-headed housekeeper, the news at which Dooley retches. You don't need the ending. Endings are exactly what this book isn't good at: answers to any questions. Apparently Karon decided to jump the main narrative track of her book (Holy Trinity), wrapping it up with a flush not a bang, and celebrate the Mitford series with a reunion of its characters at Father Tim's Christmas gathering. A pretty good idea, time to catch up, an epilogue, where-and-who-are-they-now?, except that we meet practically none of them in any other way than a list of guest names. The final fate of the Barlowes gets \\"resolved,\\" but in a way that is utterly unprepared for by the body of the book and deserves its own seventy-five pages of explanation which it does not get. Even the future of Holy Trinity gets ignored, as if it had existence only in relation to Father Tim's sojourn there. As a wrap-up to the Mitford series and to itself, this book is a waste.Does this mismatched book and ending show Karon's own difficulty in assimilating a story not about Mitford to a series called \\"the Mitford Years\\"? Does Karon's own flight from Mitford in books seven and nine of the series show that Mitford itself has become imaginatively salted ground, unable to sustain stories of any more weight than a minor plot line (nine thousand dollars) about somebody already dead? Now that Karon has thought up all these good characters, does she find it difficult to use them in a second story or a third, to imagine not only goodness but growth? Has Karon converted to a different, avant-garde model of storytelling which resists closure? Until now, I wouldn't have thought it. The strength of the first five books of the series were stories grounded in Mitford, and chronicling how Tim and those around him mature from a solid basis in goodness already. But this last book really has me scratching my head. Such a (to me) disastrous narrative miscalculation from an author who is so good at what she does, and who operates at peak form during certain central portions of the book, leaves me at the end of her great series with more questions than resolution."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"While I can understand how many of the previous reviewers feel about the many new characters in this book, I don't see how it could have been written any other way. One of the things I love about Jan Karon's books is how true they are to the Episcopal Church...her characters are so real, I could almost name some of them from the church of which I am a member!Father Tim is retired from The Lord's Chapel, so what was he to do in a new book in \\"the Mitford series\\" and still be close to his former parishoners in Mitford? Any priest who had been as involved in the lives of his parish as Fr. Tim would not stick around to make the new priest have to live in his constant shadow...and a priest with the energy and calling of Fr. Tim wouldn't want to just hang around the Turkey Club all day and be a vegetable, either. I think the readers would get bored with his retirement. There wouldn't be enough story line to make the final book.Becoming a vicar in a nearby church was the perfect solution. And in a new church there would be a whole new congregation of characters. A priest's life isn't lived in the past, it is lived in the present and looks to the future...there were plenty of encounters with the favorite characters in the Mitford series, and I believe from interviews I've read with Jan Karon that we haven't seen the last of them.The Father Tim novels, according to Karon in an interview with USA Today, will continue to follow Fr. Tim and Cynthia as they travel back to his hometown of Holly Springs, Miss. after the year at Holy Trinity, then to Ireland, then to England. The Mitford characters aren't gone...just the name \\"the Mitford series\\". At least that is the way I have interpreted it. See the article on USA Today's website, and see if you agree: &lt;a href=\\"http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2005-11-09-bchat-karon_x.htm\\">http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2005-11-09-bchat-karon_x.htm&lt;/a>I loved the new characters, cherished the time with the old characters, and look forward to spending more time with all of them (and some new ones) in the Father Tim Novels!!"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"This is the best one she has written in the Mitford series.

Might not be the one you are looking for, but that is God's answer. I can't go into everything that happens in this book, but Ms. Karon has created a place that this grateful reader will never forget.In my book club, we recently had the topic come up of if you were stranded on an island, what three books would you take with you? This book would be one, and I think maybe the first and third book from this series too!I hope some that read this book, reread it and come to know God during their readings.

In the first part, the bookshop owner announces her engagement but there is no clue as to who.

He enthusiastically shakes hands with this vicar assignment in what would be considered a backwards community in them there hills while caretaking at Meadowbrook farm...which certainly holds its perils as well.He also is not secluded from Mitford incidentals in which he graciously entangles himself. However, the town's continual upgrades and alterations batter his heart-\\"Why can't things always stay the same\\" as Tim would say. He perfectly performs the balancing act between Meadowbrook Farm, Holy Trinity Church and Mitford.The tears come and go, continually intermixed with hearty laughter to soul's delight as the various tales spiral forward.Timothy's unconditional love for everyone shines forth as customary, serving honey to my palate. May we all obtain such a rescuing heart of thoughtful outreach!Jan Karon leaves no room for boredom. She is certainly the most brilliant writer of our time. She faithfully weaves apical-captivating intriguing webs of heartwarming myrrh. Methodically, she places all the right scriptures in all the right places. There is no other author I prefer to pick up! I was enamored to read another in her series of homespun charming people and some certainly have their pasts that are untangled at a tortoise's pace-this is not a complaint as she does it marvelously. She is thoroughly educated in numerous fields and you would think she has a train of doctorate degrees.As a Bible-believing Christian, I kindly take issue with the Episcopalian ritualism that is nowhere to be located in God's holy Word and the references to pastors as fathers. Christ instructed we are never to refer to a religious leader as \\"father\\" as we only have one true Father in heaven, Matthew 23:1-9."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I have loved the Mitford series and read all the books over and over. It's really sad to see the series end with such a whimper. The book is so boring, I had to force myself to keep reading. The only reason to keep reading is to see how long running story lines are resolved. Disappointingly, they really aren't.The most annoying thing about this book is the introduction of at least twenty new characters with many and varied problems. Since we know this is the last book, it's really difficult to make yourself care about these people. Puny, Percy, Lace, Harley, Emma and other old favorites barely appear in this book.As the series has evolved, Ms. Karon has increasingly used prayers to fill the pages. She's outdone herself in that regard in this book. You can hardly read a page without getting a prayer. It really slows down the story telling. Not appreciated by this reader who read the series for the stories and not the religion.I'll always love Mitford but can't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"As always, I was charmed with this book.

I have been an avid fan of the Mitford Years from the beginning, and LIGHT FROM HEAVEN, Karon's swan song to a beloved series, piqued my interest from the start. However, my worries stem from all the people who are too confined and comfortable in their own world and are afraid of change. Karon introduces her readers to a circle of new characters, most of whom are an unique bunch. This in no way changes the dynamics of the story; it only adds color and personality to an already amazing piece of literature. My advice when you curl up with this book: Enjoy it for what it is. A fun and wonderful read."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I just finished another great read from one of my favorite authors, Jan Karon - her latest in the Mitford series, and probably the last. She says that in 2007 she will start a new series called \\"The Father Tim Novels.\\" I have enjoyed each and every one of the books in this series, beginning with \\"At Home in Mitford\\" where you are introduced to Father Tim, an overweight Episcopal priest who is in his 50's and has never been married. Father Tim eventually does marry his lovely next-door neighbor Cynthia Kavenaugh, and this newest book takes Father Tim, now retired from active ministry, to new ground.This book titled \\"Light From Heaven\\" has Father Tim and his bride, Cynthia, \\"farm sitting\\" for their friends. He is asked by the bishop to become the interim vicar of a tiny Carolina mountain church called Holy Trinity that had been closed for 40 years. The way Jan Karon describes the beautiful sunrises and sunsets, the beauty of the valleys from the mountain tops certainly brings a lot of pleasure to me, and I hope to all who take the time to read this book. It points out that all of us can be as busy as Father Tim in going about our tasks, but still take the time to sit back and enjoy God's bounty and beauty.The characters that Jan weaves into her books are so very real. Just like the 82-year-old mountain man who still is a crack shot against squirrels for his stew pot, yet states proudly, \\"I hain't never put out m'eyes with readin' like some do. Nossir, I cain't read a lick, an' never wanted to.\\" When I read this, I just couldn't believe that there might be somebody who might take this attitude about reading because I've been a book-lover all my life. But in order to understand others, you need to have someone point out a different perspective for you.Over the course of the Mitford series, there are several children that have been scattered as a result of a dysfunctional family life. In this book, Sammy comes to live with Father Tim and Cynthia, and becomes their gardener using his natural gift for growing things. At one point, Father Tim takes Sammy aside and reiterates some of the \\"rules for living\\" in their home. At the end of the discussion, Sammy states, \\"I hate this p-place!\\" Following this statement, Father Tim says to himself, \\"It was painful to do what was right\\" in teaching Sammy how to live properly. So many of us parents want to take the \\"easy\\" way in raising children and having them as your friends for life, yet sometimes we have to try to help them see what their actions are doing. And, yes, Father Tim, it definitely isn't easy!There is a beautiful cat called Violet who is Cynthia's inspiration for the children's books that she writes and illustrates, and for you dog lovers, all of the Mitford books have Father Tim's giant of a dog named Barnabas, who promptly stops whatever he might be doing if you quote scripture to him. As the book closes, Father Tim lies down in the far corner of the sheep paddock studying the clouds overhead, listening to a bee buzzing close by. He closes his eyes, feeling a peace such as he had never felt in the rest of his life, and lays a hand on Barnabas, remembering a quote from his journal, \\"Dogs are our link to paradise. To sit with a dog on a hillside on a glorious afternoon is to be back in Eden where doing nothing was not boring, it was peace.\\""},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I very rarely buy hardback editions because of the cost but couldn't wait for a paperback version. I was not dissapointed! This finally episode of The Mitford Years wraps up every loose end up beautifully and gives the reader even more insight into the lives of a group that now feels like my own family. Have kleenex handy; I started sniffling on page nine and and didn't stop for the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I tend to agree with many of the readers' comments and was myself a bit disappointed in the last book of the beloved Mitford series; however, I am justing putting it down to the \\"all good things must end\\" therory. It's hard for me to be too critical because the whole series in itself provided us all with such a wonderful reading experience. It's hard to say goodbye to the Mitford characters; they are like old friends. So, athough, not a spectacular ending to a great and wonderful series, I'm just grateful to have had the whole Mitford experience to begin with. Whenever I feel the need to have a \\"Mitford moment,\\" I will open the first book when Father Tim meets Barnabus, eat a bite with the gang at Percy's grill, or enjoy a few moments reading the friendly banter between Father Tim and Emma ~~~~ now, there's the rub.....it doesn't get any better than that :-) !

Thank you Ms. Karon."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"For someone who is reading the whole series at one time, this book might be great. But when I read this book, it had been over two years since I'd read the one before it, and I could not even finish it. I tried to stick with it, but I eventually put it down and could not pick it up again. Is this not the conclusion to the MITFORD series? So why can't a poor reader read about MITFORD instead about a bunch of characters we know nothing about, who we won't get to know very well seeing as this is the last book. I am a big fan of the whole series, but this book was simply painful."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I was very disappointed in this final book in the Mitford series and believe that the author owes us another one that truly does what it says this one will do -- answer the questions readers have and tie up the loose ends. Jan Karon's readers have been loyal and made her famous. I feel cheated that she wrote such a hurried ending to her series. Some others are upset that she peopled this book with new characters. I think her writing of the new characters was up to her usual outstanding ability. I liked her new characters. But as for Mitford characters -- she seemed bored and tired of Mitford and just wanted to get it over with. In the process, she left us wondering about many in Mitford, has Gene Bolick dying throughout without ever having Fr. Tim speak with Gene or Esther, gives us little glimpses of Sammy and leaves us longing to know more about Kenny. This is the first time I've ever written a review, but I felt compelled to do so because both my daughter and I were so deeply disappointed. I think Jan Karon misjudged the keen interest her readers had in knowing what happened to their \\"extended family\\"."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I skipped thru a friend's edition and can't wait to get my own. I'm not Christian (in fact, Jewish) but I have loved and treasured every one of Karon's books: for her writing style, carefully drawn characters and heart-felt stories. These are people you get to know and love-- like neighbors, friends and family. I truly believe her books are for everyone, all faiths, across the board. I guess Mitford can't go on forever and like all things, must come to a logical end, but.......just one more piece of that orange cake, please!!"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I read this final book in the Mitford series for two reasons: (1) I already owned it, having acquired the entire lot at once; (2) I had read the previous eight volumes in the series.Jan Karon has the remarkable ability to create an idyllic place and time with words and then take the reader there. It isn't necessarily a realistic place, but neither was Oz. In this series, children are born and grow up. People marry and do not divorce. Older characters get sick and die. People do dumb things and tell jokes, just as in real life.What is lacking in this book, however, as well as in the previous Mitford books, is a unified plot. Threads of plot appear and then fade. For the most part there are simply episodes, minor difficulties for the most part, and they are too often solved by prayer, rather than by logic and effort on the part of humans. I'm just not fond of deus ex machina solutions.I was much more taken by the first four books of the series. Then Father Tim went off to the coastal island. There was a flashback book to recount how Tim got married. Etc. I found my interest waning with those. In this last book we return to Mitford and environs, and except for the prayed solutions, I was a happier reader.As an aside: apparently the author is not much good at arithmetic and the editors at the publishing house aren't either. In Chapter Nine, Father Tim expresses his pleasure over the fact that his new congregation has expanded from seven to fourteen, \\"a whopping 50 percent...in the space of a single week, mind you.\\" Now, if you double the number of parishioners, that would be a 100 percent increase, not 50. There's a term for this sort of flaw: innumeracy, the failure to learn math.As a further aside, there are confusing errors in grammar and syntax. For example, on the same page as the above is the line: \\"When Lloyd had gone home to the ridge, he sat with Cynthia in the library and totted up the numbers.\\" The pronoun \\"he\\" should refer to the closest antecedent, in this case, Lloyd. But only by going back over this and reading on do we realize that the he is in fact Father Tim and not Lloyd at all. This is not pedantic nonsense; this is a plea for clarity. Apparently book editors don't pay much attention or don't know any better.I'd rate this four stars, the book and the series, for the atmosphere and characters alone."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I, too, have read all the books in the series, and this one was a big disappointment. I decided to come here to read the other reviews to see if I was missing something. I still don't get it. Don't care about the new characters. Do enjoy Tim and his wife - especially finding each other so \\"late\\" in life. But generally, the book was a disappointment. I don't think I \\"got\\" the last chapter.One more thing - does it bug anyone else that Jan Karon's favorite word seems to be \\"thumped\\" as in, he \\"thumped\\" onto the chair. I found myself cringing each time I read that. She also used it constantly in previous books.If you have the whole series, buy it, but otherwise, don't bother. Doesn't live up to expectations."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"In this final book of the Mitford series, which I thoroughly enjoyed all the way through, Father Tim and his devoted wife Cynthia have retired to the country where they are minding animals and just having a respite from church work. But Father Tim is antsy for another church to minister too, and when Stuart, his bishop has a new assignment for him-to get Holy Trinity up and running again.So Father Tim takes immediately sets out to work to get this church going and makes instant friends with Agnes, a lady who was a member of the church years ago has her own stories to tell about her family secrets. But she is of an instant help to Father Tim.There is Louella, a previous character from Mitford who is having a big problem. Miss Sadie, her sister who passed on hid away 9,000 dollars in her old car which has been taken into a garage. She wants Father Tim to retrieve the money for her since she is in a nursing home.Dovey is a mom who seems to be struggling with a crippling depression and has a little daughter Sissie, who is bright and precocious. But as time goes along, it is discovered that Dovey's real problem is a medical one, so Father Tim seeks Hoppy, the old town doctor to give her the help she needs.Dooley, Father Tim's grown son is getting closer to graduation from veterinary school. Miss Sadie has left him over 2 million dollars in an inheritance, and Father Tim is just waiting for the moment to let him know that he will have an instant practice to go into. He is waiting until the time is right.And Sammy, Dooley's brother is in great need of some strong parental guidance. Father Tim and Cynthia take him under their wing, but this proves to be a difficult task. Sammy doesn't like to follow the house rules very well.This sums up the main events of the story. I am sad to see the series end, but look forward to the Father Tim Mysteries that Jan Karon will be writing soon!"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Like others, I had to force myself to read this book to the end as it was about characters I didn't really care about. The constant use of hymns, prayers and poetry was boring and perhaps a way to stretch the book to fufill a publishing contract. It would have been far better to address readers' questions about Dooley, Kenny and Lace in the previous book and ended the series at that point. This was a hugely disappointing book as the characters loved in Mitford made essentially brief and shallow appearances. Jan Karon herself appears to have been bored with Mitford and this lazy effort cheats the loyal reader of a satisfying end to the series. I will not be reading the Father Tim novels and believe Jan Karon's reputation is lessened by her milking the series this way. Don't waste your money. Check this one out of the library."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"The author herself describes this book's characters far better than I could, on p. 39: \\"... every soul [is] upside down and backward not to mention beside themselves and altogether witless.\\" This was advertised as the \\"last Mitford series\\" novel, which had long-suffering readers hoping that the priestly main character, Father Tim, would at long last find himself in Hell, being mercilessly tortured for eternity by Jesus himself for having innocently neglected some obscure point of Presbypalian dogma whilst ministering tenderly to some dying parishioner. But we'll have to wait, because, guess what, Father Tim at age 70 has been given a new assignment by the Bishop or whoever he is. Tim has to reopen a tiny church way back in the hills, closed for two decades, and get some local yokels in on the pews. This allows the introduction of what seem like dozens upon dozens of quaint hill folk, don't you know, and while the author may be able to tell them apart, the reader is unlikely to be able to do so.Karon was clearly getting very tired of this series and anxious to start another. If you open this 384-page book anywhere, at least half of one of the two facing pages will be occupied by a prayer, a long quoted poem, a hymn, or some other blatant padding. I would guess that scarcely 100 pages of the book in any way serve to propel the characters forward in time, and from the fact that the characters are witlessly anticipating Spring Break or Easter at some point, and almost immediately seem to be witlessly anticipating Christmas, it's plain that Karon couldn't get this thing out of her word-processor fast enough. It's obviously first-draft, no editing, and so three favorite phrases, \\"hammered down,\\" \\"schlepped,\\" and \\"fried,\\" occur over and over and over, about every other page or so. Karon doesn't seem to know what the phrases mean, because Father Tim is \\"hammered\\" and \\"fried\\" so frequently that new readers will be forgiven for assuming he's a hopeless alcoholic!There's of course no plot and no suspense. Will Dooley ever be told he's a millionaire? Will his long-lost brother whatsisname ever show up? Is Sam or whatever his name is agonna foolishly take to gamblin' and drinkin'? Are Tim and whatsername really going to spend a year on vacation in some alien foreign country where there may be some demonic, non-Presbypalian foreigners livin'? [Not a chance, what would become of Barnabas and Violet?]My copy of the book was picked up for about $1 in a bin of discards at a local used paperback store. The lady who was its previous reader marked her place by dogearing the pages. I was thus able to discover the exact spot where she gave up reading, and sought to recover some portion of her lost investment by selling the book. Page 58. For a while I didn't think I would make it much further, but I did soldier on bravely to the very end. I do think as a result my already white hair has turned an even purer shade of white as permanent evidence of my acute suffering."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I was so disappointed. Too many characters, big print, no resolution, just...disappointing. Good thing she is on to another series, but this one deserved better."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I have been a fan of the Mitford series a long time, but this \\"ending\\" to it was most disappointing. Although her story line was good, she kept popping from character to character, from scenario to scenario with such rapidity, I had trouble keeping situations and characters straight. I think Ms. Karon didn't wrap up the ending on a lot of the situations and leaves her readers hanging on a number of them."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"If this book was all the author had to offer faithful readers as a finale for the Mitford stories, she should have left us wondering. Poorly written, with confusing and unfinished storylines, this book was a great disappointment. After all the build up about telling Dooley about his inheritance, one page with nothing to offer ended the suspense. If you have enjoyed this series, I suggest you imagine your own endings and take a pass on the book."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I've read most of this series & feel that thankfully, it's over ! I never got into the characters & the final book awaits my attention....have given it as a gift to persons who truly enjoyed....for myself, give me a mystery like Joanna Brady & J P Beaumont from J.A. Jance and Murder, She Wrote from Donald Bain & don't forget Stephanie Plum from Janet Evanovitch.I think what I'm saying is that this series was definitely for the persons to whom I gifted.

On their behalf, thank you for an excellent series."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"This book purchased as a gift, and since I heard no complaints about its condition, it must be all right.

Karon did a decent job of tying up all the loose ends, but as another reviewer wrote, the character development was there. It will satisfy most Mitford \\"addicts,\\" but for me, was a bit anticlimatic."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Again, I enjoyed Jan's gift to her readers of an extended family as she applaudes the extraordinary beauty of ordinary people. Thank you Jan for enriching our lives with your wit and charm.Charlene Mikkelsen, author of Wild Flowers Are Forever."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I agree with all of the reviewers who were disappointed in this book. What I had hoped for was a final visit to Mitford with stories about all my favorite characters and a nice tying up of loose ends. Instead we are introduced to a myriad of new characters who aren't very interesting especially as this is the final book in the series and their stories will go no further. What was Ms. Karon thinking? I wanted so much for the final book in the Mitford series to be about Mitford! Definitely wait and get this book from the library - its not worth adding to your Mitford collection."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Last in a series. Each book wonderful! Jan Karon's writing is down to earth, develops characters well, describes places of events. I am happy to have read & given as gifts."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I have read all of this series except #9 which was missing. I am having withdrawal and feel sad about the series ending. I want more from Mitford, because I have enjoyed them immensly!! I've never read a series from which I got this much pleasure. I highly recommend these books to everyone. I give them 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"It appears that this series is ending. I've read all of them and liked them. Recently I found an English author whose books have a similar but not same tone, and there are a BUNCH of books by this woman, Susan Sallis. You might give them a try."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"...too much of a good thing. As much as I loved each of the Mitford books, and as much as I wanted to love this one, I just couldn't. I think maybe Jan Karon overreached. Instead of sticking to Mitford as one might expect in the series closer, Father Tim and Cynthia go off to a new/old church that happens to be just close enough to Mitford for the old characters we've grown so familiar with to pop up regularly. She introduced a score of new characters to go with the new church, and it all became too much to keep straight and, quite frankly, too much to swallow. Too many country-isms, too many perfect endings, too many...you name it. It was just overstuffed. And for all that, there were too many things left unfinished! What happened to Miss Rose, for instance? Did Father Tim and Cynthia make it to Ireland? Did Dooley and Lace marry?I would much rather have ended in Mitford."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I am delighted with this final issue of the Mitford Series. The writer is superb in making the reader feel as though you actually know the characters in the book. I wish there would be more to come."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"This last book was just as delightful as the first one I read. I am just so sorry to see the series coming to an end. As usual we meet up with some odd but loveable characters. And you can just picture the settings in your mind because Jan describes them so well without going into boring details and too much information. Again, I had a hard time putting the book down, and then was mad at myself because I came to the end. You just want the story to go on and on. I am so glad I accidentally came upon this author and cannot recommend her enough to other people."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I have the Mitford Years Series. Thank you for bringing back memories that I experienced as a child. Childhood is often difficult but tha series reminds me of the good times when ignorance was bliss."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Well-written, well-bound, and overflowing with dynamic gists; this long-awaited final volume of \\"Light from Heaven\\" took almost eternity to be published. But the good news is that its contents truly justified the long wait. Expectedly, the book imbibed some new characters in addition to all the old ones with whom previous readers are familiar.And whatever your opinion on Father Timothy Kavanagh's intriguing life, one thing is guaranteed: this latest volume did bring out the best from Jan Karon's narratives. This sequel is so captivating that even after devouring its close-to-400 pages, one will be left wondering why the author chose to 'summarize' such an exciting story. Without question, this book's 380 pages could have yielded a dynamic 580 pages with a little effort. Anyone who reads it would testify to this fact.Meanwhile, in the course of tracing their steps across the domestic minefield they called home, the priesthood of Father Timothy was consummately tested: just as the mystery and the muscle of Cynthia's house-sitting were laid bare.Despite its late arrival to the market, this book is a well-laid-out sequel, which will earn the interest of any story-lover. Another fine piece from Jan Karon!"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Thanks to Jan Karon, Mitford has become a literary heart's home for many. And, thanks to John McDonough, Father Timothy Kavanaugh has become very real, a voice both rugged and kind, only slightly accented, appropriately rich and mature. One can imagine him delivering a homily to a rapt congregation.In this, the final installment in the highly popular series, we find Father Tim and his wife, Cynthia, doing a favor for friends. They're house sitting on a farm where, as the beloved cleric says, There's naught to do but \\"read, rest, and walk four dogs.\\" Cynthia asks him to go into town to pick up supplies for their son's visit. While he's happy to do so, he also ruefully acknowledges that he might wish to be called upon to do something a bit more interesting.His wish is granted when the Bishop assigns him to Holy Trinity, a small church in the mountains that hasn't had a viable congregation in four decades. Father Tim and Cynthia arrive with little hope of finding very much in the way of a structure, but are delighted to find that Holy Trinity has been well maintained by loving congregants.Light From Heaven is the story of how Father Tim and Cynthia become acquainted with the people who live in the mountains and try to build a congregation. Throughout, listeners are treated to visits from characters met in previous installments, and enchanted by the Kavanaugh's new friends.Once again, Jan Karon has penned an entertaining, heartwarming story carrying a message of hope.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Saliently Ms. Karon summarizes the series and this final installment in the Mitford series: the Father gathers the family; then moves on.Weaving with her demonstrated skill at keeping multiple storylines going and keeping the reader's interest perked (or not all it seems from some of the reviewers with this finale) she marvelously weaves her magic through tales of ordinary folks on a mountain wrapped with Mitford folks we've come to know and love over the series.From runaway kids of dysfunctional homes to lead poisoning to hidden money to a chicken thief. Notably, however, this offering has more Scripture, more witness to the faith than the others. Thus, easily this reviewer's esteem and enjoyment following the reopened spiritual outpost. The interspersing of hymns and prayers and emails show that faith of old still functioning even in age of technology. What marvelous seaming together of the wonder of it all!Especially touching is ASL signing with Clarence and small congregation's learning to communicate with this neglected language group.What begins in the spring seems so encouraging to a book introduced as chill of fall turns to winter approaches, renewing one's longing for it. Ending as it does with a June scene and paths yet untrod ahead for our Father Timothy and Cynthia, seems the perfect jumpoff for what is to come from our beloved wordsmith Karon.Can't wait for Fr.T series, but now relishing this wonderful finale read!"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I have been a reader and re-reader of the Mitford Books. But I am very disappointed in this book. The first four books were outstanding, the fifth one (Whitecap) pretty entertaining, but In This Mountain began a slide and Light From Heaven sinks hard to the bottom.The \\"resolved\\" story lines are done only minimally. (I can't say too much lest I spoil this for someone.)There are hints of what's to come for past characters -- Hope's sister apparently taking a shine to George Gaynor -- but we will never know what happens since the series is ending. This was probably not the book in which to introduce new plots.Only very minimal attention is paid to Mitford characters who made the past books so much fun -- Esther and Ray, Andrew Gregory, and others -- and the Turkey Club visits are no longer very satisfying (read the book to find out what happened to lunchtime). Minister Tipton was introduced late and significantly in the book immediately prior, but has no part in this one. There is very little about Buck and Pauline. Edith Mallory's return to Mitford is just silly, given how much everyone hated her. There is one great scene with Tony Nocelli, one of the few times we ever really see what he's like, but it does not lead anywhere.Particularly annoying, given the scant attention paid to already-loved and developed characters, is the introduction of so many new ones in this book. Karon could have told her story without a lot of those. Even in Whitecap there were not so many new people to keep track of.I will read the Father Tim Novels (assume they are about his pre-Mitford life?) but I really wanted more as a closer to this series."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"We waited a long time for Light From Heaven, but now that it's here, we know it was worth the wait. A fun and feel-good novel, Karon has given us just what we asked for.As we reaquaint ourselves with the residents of the North Carolina town of Mitford, we find that Father Tim is called away to bring life to a tiny in size (but big in spirit) mountain church. Even though this is the end of a series, we are introduced to just a few more interesting and entertaining folks--the parishioners of Holy Trinity church. Like every Mitford novel, Light From Heaven is not overbearingly religious, but it does always pay respect and paint a beautiful picture of the special feeling that is Faith. By ministering this new group of churh-goers--unlike any the pastor has seen before--Father Tim inevitably finds himself closer to nature (and heaven) because of the people he meets, and the events that occur at this small and simply vibrant vocation. It should also be mentioned that, like the rest of the series, scrumptuous southern cooking plays a big role in the interaction of the characters. (I was interested to learn that Karon also recently published a cookbook.)So, as we say goodbye, we are pleased to find that Light From Heaven does an excellent job at answering many of the questions we had after reading the previous eight books. It also acts as a transition book for Father Tim and his wife, as \\"The Father Tim Novels\\" are set to be published in 2007. Newcomers to the series should consider picking up the Mitford Series boxset, as it wouldn't be fair to start at the ending, and the whole series really is exceptional. Fans might also enjoy the Left Behind Series by Lehaye and Jenkins. It has many similar morality themes and religious references. A book titled Calling in the Night by Michele Geraldi fits right into this style, too, as it is eloquent and respectful to faith and beauty. (I believe it is the first in a series, so it is fun to be at the beginning of something new.) Goodbye, Mitford. It's been wonderful."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Father Timothy is rapidly approaching his 70th birthday, and time hangs heavy for him in retirement. But then his bishop, also about to retire, gives him the perfect assignment--reviving an old mountain church that has been abandoned for forty years. Of course, it's right up Father Timothy's alley, and he is soon busy making his rounds, visiting, cajoling, philosophizing and praying with his new parish. And his old parish. And his family. That's the plot.The Mitford novels were never really novels in the usual sense, more like extended stays in a wonderful, utopian community. They were filled with quirky characters, dogs, reprobates and unknown saints, jokers and complainers, and wonderful mountain accents. Unfortunately, this book, last of the series, doesn't live up to the standard of the previous books. There are too many new characters, too many old characters, too much wise philosophy, too much preaching, and too much all around goodness to make an interesting read. There is very little conflict, no problem that cannot be solved by Father Tim and Cynthia, no incorrigible sinner who cannot be turned around by a well said prayer from Father Tim--well, you get the picture.Author Jan Karon is brilliant with characterization, with dialogue, and with mountain dialect, but in this book her writing has slipped considerably. The dialogue often sounds too much like preaching. Sometimes she gets careless. At times her point of view shifts within a single sentence, as though she was just pressed for time. If you loved the other Mitford books you will probably like this one, but you may be a little disappointed. The series should have ended sooner. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I just completed both Light from Heaven, and the one selling with it. If you like Christian-fiction, Karon's books are must reads. Once again, Jan took me away from my world, to a place full of adventures, love, laughter, and tears. If you have not read anything from her before, I would suggest you start from the beginning of the series, and read them all. I don't think you'll be disappointed. In another realm (non-fiction), Passenger's Side was just wonderful. This is the kind of book that will surely be changing lives. It has given me help in some areas of my life where I needed it, and some renewed hope. I would also call it a must read."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Like everyone else, I am very disappointed with the last book...Way too many characters, poorly developed plot lines, what happens to Ms. Rose? What happens to Esther Bolick? Kenny just shows up on the doorstep miraculously??? What a cop out of a novel, I'm sorry! Fthr. Tim and Cynthia could not be any more nauseating, I loved them so much more when they had a fight or two! One thing I need to say, is that Karon did write a very fabulous series with very lovable characters. I wonder if she was on a deadline and was forced to send it in to the publishers? I just can't understand what happened."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I'm afraid I must join the chorus of disappointed reviewers who found the \\"Miford Series\\" final book a less-than hoped for ending to this charming series. It left me wishing that Ms. Karon had chosen to wrap up the loose ends of this highly entertaining and spiritual life of Father Tim in a more effective way. There were just too many new characters introduced, and I found myself skipping through those pages hoping to get to a part where updates on other beloved characters such as Esther, Miss Rose, Hope, and Dooley were rendered in greater detail. Alas....Ms. Karon really never provides such details. I found myself finishing this book feeling \\"hungry\\" for deeper relevations about the many characters who had been part of the Mitford Series since the beginning. I feel a bit \\"cheated\\" that I will not be able to continue to follow the lives of these rich characters, but I suppose that all good things must come to an end....I just wish this ending had been a bit more satisfying."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I've been a fan of the Mitford series for a long time, and like others who have posted reviews, I read them for the wonderful characters, not for the religious aspects.I agree that the addition of the new characters from Holy Trinity did take some space away from the old, established characters (I really missed Emma, whom we only hear from via e-mail.)On the other hand, the new characters were very well drawn and I enjoyed \\"meeting\\" them. I think it's just part of Father Tim's character that he is constantly gathering new people around him and becoming involved in the lives of everyone he meets.My main complaint is that I did feel that some of the major plotlines were given short shrift, due to the focus on Father Tim's work at Holy Trinity. I especially wanted to read more about the Barlowes--although quite a bit of space is given to Sammy, I wanted more about Dooley (and Lace), and Kenny. It felt to me as if Karon were rushing at the end of the book to try to tie up every single thread.I also feel that the emphasis on religion was more pronounced in this book. I know that Karon feels strongly about her faith and she has every right to make it a part of the book (after all, Father Tim is a priest!), but to me much of it felt like filler and not an integral part of the narration.Still, there were many things about the book that I really enjoyed, and I'm glad that Karon plans to continue the story of Father Tim, even if he won't be in Mitford."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I loved this book about Father Tim and his wife Cynthia.

It was not really a Mitford book - although some of the people from the earlier books were mentioned but not really part of the story.Just too many neat coincidences. I agree with some of the earlier reviewers that it seemed like the author just strung together some episodes and then just gave up.

This is the kind of writing that makes one happy to stay home on a cold winters night, and just read. I would say: buy it - read it."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I've been a big fan of this series all along, although admittedly less so after the first few. I was looking forward to this one because my mom told me there would be a deaf character (I'm an interpreter). There was, but...even that didn't hold my interest. Clarence lived a solitary life in the woods with his mother, never marrying or having any interaction with anyone outside his family who could speak more than a few words of his language, and none of this is ever addressed. I guess we were meant to feel all teary-eyed because the congregation was learning one sign per week. Yeah, that'll make for some satisfying conversation.I don't know if all the books have been this way and I didn't notice or if the device has been overused, but the way the story jumped around, never fully allowing me to feel that I'd experienced the full impact of a scene before racing off to something else, left me perplexed. Early on, this technique made the pages turn and kept me interested in the story but by the time I reached this book, it all just seemed lazy and haphazard.I have a religious background but have never cared for Christian literature. I was surprised that I liked the earlier Mitford books as much as I did, but it was probably because they weren't all that preachy and yet they were very sweet and brought home points without making the reader feel that an anvil was being dropped on her head. This book was plain insufferable. Every character either had to become a Christian or, if that was not to be, at the very least, provide an opportunity for Father Tim to preach a mini sermon for them (so we know they'll become a Christian later). I wasn't a fan of the constant praying. It irked me more than anything else--and I'm a Christian! The only reason I finished the book (and yes, it was extremely dull) was because 1) my mom gave it to me and 2) I wanted to find out what Dooley was going to do with his fortune. Well, I'll be able to tell Mom I finished it, but what happened with Dooley? This book fell flat on almost every level.I can sum up the plot: Father Tim runs lots of errands (written in excruciating detail) and prays ALL THE TIME. The end."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"This is certainly a must read. Last of the series but the best yet (if it's possible) of many excellent books.

I certainly don't want to wait."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"This book was a real disappointment. It just quits and does not tie up the story. The reader is left hanging. I was reading it on the airplane and thought that I had misplaced my bookmark and missed the completion of the story, but no I hadn't - it isn't completed. I felt the author just became tired of writing the book and quit. The previous book was also not as well written as the others and I won't buy another by this author."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"As have many of the reviewers here, I've read all of Jan Karon's books. I find them to be comforting, soothing, safe cozy books to read. Sometimes, when life is truly stressful and anxious, that is exactly what I want. I draw a hot bath and read about a kind gentle world where nothing bad ever happens without a solution. People die when they're old, people give up their addictions, people love each other.So I am pretty mystified by readers who gave these books one star and commented that it was a relief to put these last books down. No one is forcing anyone to read these books! There won't be a test in the morning.I am not episcopalian, I am in fact an atheist. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy the comfort of these books. If you are so narrow that you buy these books and expect them to be something completely contrary to what they claim to be, what they are designed to be, then whose fault is that? Certainly not Jan Karon's, who it seems to me has been extraordinarily creative and successful at creating this little fantasy world for quiet comforting retreats.I can't even believe that reviewers here complain for a lack of realism! You are reading these books for realism? You are upset that a book about an episcopal priest has too much prayer in it? You believe that solutions to these problems are too facile? Come on! That is what these books are supposed to be! When I read a Jan karon book, I am hoping for the same kind of escapism that I get from reading a PG Wodehouse book. It has nothing to do with reality. It has everything to do with jsut enjoying the read.I'd recommend this one highly. I didn't think this last installment was disappointing. I also don't think it will be the last Mitford book. It will probably be the last Father Tim Mitford book, but I suspect that Hope Winchester and her new husband will take the reins. It would allow Jan Karon to write as a woman, and as a woman who spends alot of time in bookstores!I personally am looking forward to it!"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Father Tim is still the glue that holds the town together. This series of books are heart warming and inspirational. As you read the series you will become part of this loving and funny town. The characters seem so real you will feel you have known them all your life. I am sad to know this series had ended, but enlightened to know I can pick up and reread all the books again."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I love the Mitford Series. I put off reading the last in the series because I didn't want it to end. I finally did read it and it was the best of all. So enlightening. If you want to be inspired, sit back and enjoy every single page."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I found Light From Heaven to be a very inspiring book. Mostimportantly, it teaches that with God's help, it is never tolate to pick up something you had to drop 20, 30, 40, or evenmore years ago (i.e. Holy Trinity Church). As a matter of fact,over the years, the dormant project or hobby may actually mature in you, if you will, as you continue to live, learn, and grow in other areas.The only thing I felt that was needed was another chapter todescribe Kenny's, Dooley's long lost brother's, homecoming. Thelast several brief paragraphs of the last chapter before theAfterword include Kenny's knocking at the door and graspingFather's Tim hand, but then that's it. Nothing to quench the reader's thirst about his life since his mother traded him for some whiskey, how he managed to make it back home (albeit with God's loving help, of course!!), the joyous reunion, and thedirection of his life afterwards. I felt let down a bit,especially since Light From Heaven is the last book in theMitford series, and that Kenny was the sibling to whom Dooleyhad been closest. Nevertheless, Jan Karon is one of my all-time favorite writers and that makes me hope that Kenny will be one of the focuses of her next series, The Father Tim Novels."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"This book came from the heart and soul of the divine. How can an author write with such intensity that it totally transports the reader into the town of Mitford, into the lives of the characters to such a degree that when you finish and look up you are so disappointed in your own surroundings that you want to plunge back into Mitford and reside there? Jan Karon is a treasure and this series of books is the motherlode of reading pleasure. Please begin with the first and read to the last word of the last book. This is a set of books to treasure."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"The book arrived in excellent condition.

I have read the series three times and still get more out of it each time"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Thank you for the prompt delivery and the book arrived in the described condition. The book was great and I really love the whole series."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Father Tim was the perfect person to go into the mountain to Holy Trinity and get it started again after 40 years being closed. This book covered many new people and many of the people we feel we know in the town of Mitford. It covered Dooley finding out about his the money Miss Sadie left him and now he can plan to be a vet and also have his own business.I was disappointed in the end when all those years they have been looking for Kenney - On last page he shows up and Father Tim said &#34; We were looking for you&#34; without even mentioning his name and taking him into the house to show the joy of all the others there for the Christmas program.Can Jan Karon write Book 10 and finish what she left off?"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I've enjoyed the entire Mitford series by Jan Karon. Only a gifted author would be able to write books that show clearly how much people can love and adore each other without any offending language or behavior. I would (and have) recommended her books to many friends and family."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Light from heaven continues my journey into Mitford and the lives of the citizens of this peaceful town in the mountains. Thank you, Jan Karon, for your wonderful books. Keep writing!"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Jan Karon is an extremely warm and wonderful writer.

I can find anything on this site."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I just finished reading this book. I Loved It!! Warm inviting and keeps you interested, Father Tim is so funny and so caring, but also very human. A true man of faith, and so much can be learned from his example. This whole series has been wonderful and I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"If this was going to be the final Mitford series story there should not have been so many new characters introduced. I enjoyed meeting new characters and envisioning Holy Trinity, but not for a final book. Perhaps this should have been a new series. The Mitford characters were practically forgotten. Without going in to detail I will just say a lot of characters I had grown to care about were simply never heard from again, or were simply offered a cameo in this novel. Agreeing with others, . . . . \\"What about Miss Rose?!\\"Plot lines were introduced then suddenly resolved and I couldn't even remember reading how it all came about. There was no in between. Spent a lot of time thumbing back through pages I'd already read trying to figure things out. Sorry, but except for a few moments, this one never grabbed at my emotions as most of the other books did. Everything seemed too rushed. Disappointed."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I am just enamored with Jan Karon---her stories, her writing style, her characters. So heartwarming to my soul and spirit! Father Tim, the Episcopal priest we first met in earlier novels(about nine ago), is spending the year on a farm just outside of Mitford with his wife, Cynthia. His test for the year is to breathe some fresh power into Holy Trinity, a small country church that appears to have been deserted years ago. Father Tim, the good man that he is, takes to the challenge without reservation.Even faced with challenges and trials, Father Tim makes time to get back to Mitford, eating lunch with his usual buddies, and spending time with his housekeeper and surrogate daughter Puny after she gives birth to another set of twins. Many of the themes Jan Karon has been known for nine novels, find resolution, --- but be prepared (and patient) for the fact a great portion of the novel is spent introducing new characters for Jan Karon's future works. As always, Jan Karon shamelessly ministers the good news with some of the most unlikely characters coming to know Christ!While this is the last \\"Mitford\\" novel, don't be sad. As always Jan Karon keeps us glued to our seat and awaiting her next great work of fiction!Happy Reading!Reviewed by Marina Woods for goodgirlbookclubonline"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I waited until the book came out in paperback to finish my collection for my bookshelf and purchased the Bedside Companion at the same time. I have been a Mitford Missionary since I read the first book. Clean, charming, engrossing, enlightening, encouraging, blessing were the adjectives I used. I was grossly disappointed in the last book, like so many others. It seemed as though the characters we all knew and loved were an afterthought. Having read the Bedside Companion, it seems that Ms. Karon felt the need to defend this sad finale by telling us that without it, we never would have met Agnes, Clarence, blah, blah, blah. Did anyone really CARE to meet these people? Did anyone even care about them much AFTER you'd met them? I certainly didn't, based on how many of their names I actually remembered. It all seemed so aimless and rambling. How many pages can it possibly take to tell Father Tim you'd had a child out of wedlock? The language even seemed either stilted or so over-the-top colloquial that it was difficult to digest at times. All the other books were something to look forward to in the evening. This one was a relief to put down."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I had read that this would be the last book in the series. As a great fan of Father Tim and the series, I was not looking forward to the end. Well, I just finished the book and loved it. After a couple of disappointing entries in the series, this one returned to the style of the earlier books - very rich in characters and plot. If you have read all the books, there are certain plot points that you have been waiting to read about for years. They are in here.To the reviewer who was upset that things were not tied up at the end: I recently read that the author is not done writing about Father Tin - she is done writing about Mitford. There will be further father Tim adventures in Ireland and Holly Springs."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I bought this book in hardcover as soon as it was out. I enjoyed reading it, but I have to say that I was a little let down at the end, not just because it is the last in the series. As some of the other reviewers have said, I would have preferred to see more of my favorite familiar characters instead of so many new ones.This is a pleasant read if you are a die-hard Jan Karon fan. The book I'm recommending to friends and will be giving as gifts this Christmas, though, is the one I read right before Light from Heaven, The Christmas Quilt by Jennifer Chiaverini. I'm not a quilter but I loved it."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"This Jan Karon Mitford series is one of those you want never to end. I want to go to Mitford and meet all the friends of Father Tim. (Some of them are alive here in Belton, Texas.) \\"Light from Heaven\\" is just the beginning, in a way, because, I'll read this series again and again."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I have finished the so called \\"last Mitford\\" novel and was extremely disappointed. Yes, I have read all the earlier Mitford novels; several times actually. I didn't expect this last novel to be high literature; the Mitford series aren't literature. They are just fun, feel good stories. I enjoyed them for that reason. I was looking forward to having things wrapped up in Mitford, because that's the way LFH had been promoted. I was very disappointed. Hardly anything was wrapped up or even answered. At this point, I've lost the interest to know where Kenny has been; or will Lace and Dooley marry; or who ran over Barnabus; just to name some loose ends.When I want to read a good mystery, I enjoy reading James Patterson or Nelson DeMille. Whenever I want to read literature that my grandchildren will be studying in school, I read Pat Conroy; in my opinion the best contemporary author alive.Jan Karon has found a wonderful gift of creating true life characters that live a Christian life and cause her readers to care about the characters. This time, for whatever reason, I feel she let her fans down. I know that I'm only speaking first hand for myself... but I don't think I'm the only reader who has been greatly disappointed by this last novel. When the next one is published, I think I'll wait to read mine from the library. This time I bought it the first day it was published. Never again.Maybe I'll go back and reread the earlier Mitford novels; they are worth a reread... this one isn't.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"I am torn about my review of this book.My cynical, flippant side wants to say the following: \\"Here's Father Tim to save the day yet again, to somehow immediately connect in his folksy, simple way with yet another group of quirky, eccentric stock characters in predetermined roles. (The sisters Mary and Martha are absolutely NOT to be believed; Jubal was REALLY too much; the Flower Girls were just plain silly; and NO ONE was smart enough to figure out what Dovey's problem was?! And learning ONE sign a week is enough to get people COMMUNICATING with a deaf man? I really don't think so! Not to mention why didn't anyone ELSE think of having them learn sign language until Father Tim came?!). Here's his faithful Cynthia yet again, to take charge of yet more lost children, to know exactly how to handle everything and to say and do exactly the right thing at the right time. Here are the requisite Mitfordians yet again to make just enough appearances to keep up our interest, not to mention a couple of deaths to jerk the tears. Here are Dooley and Lace yet again, who are turning out just about perfect despite horribly abused childhoods. And since Dooley turned out OK, here's Sammy to step into his shoes as the teenager-to-be-tamed. Here is Karon's writing yet again, with quotes and prayers and beautiful phrases and too much cornpone dialect and characterization to swallow except in small doses.\\"Yet despite everything, I simply can't help loving Father Tim, Mitford, and his new temporary congregation in his tiny mountain church. He always makes me think somehow about what it means to live one's Christianity out in everyday life-to make one's life a blessing and a prayer every moment of every day. The love he and Cynthia have for people (and for each other) is inspiring. I also enjoyed some of the new characters, particularly Agnes and Clarence. I somehow even enjoyed the writing style, even if it is sometimes a bit much.I always end up feeling good after reading a Mitford story, and it always uplifts me and challenges my faith. So in the end, despite the cornpone and the flaws, they always end up being worth a read, and \\"Light from Heaven\\" is worth reading if you can set aside your cynicism and read with your heart."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"So disappointing! Karon ends a wonderful series with a book introducing about a hundreds new characters and spends little or no time on the characters I have come to love. The resolution of many story lines that spanned several (if not all) the books were flat and felt like an after thought - like the obligitory endings were only included so that readers couldn't claim we were let down. Well it didn't work. I feel very let down by this conclusion to what was an amazing series."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"We waited a long time for Light From Heaven, but now that it's here, we know it was worth the wait. A fun and feel-good novel, Karon has given us just what we asked for.As we reaquaint ourselves with the residents of the North Carolina town of Mitford, we find that Father Tim is called away to bring life to a tiny in size (but big in spirit) mountain church. Even though this is the end of a series, we are introduced to just a few more interesting and entertaining folks--the parishioners of Holy Trinity church. Like every Mitford novel, Light From Heaven is not overbearingly religious, but it does always pay respect and paint a beautiful picture of the special feeling that is Faith. By ministering this new group of churh-goers--unlike any the pastor has seen before--Father Tim inevitably finds himself closer to nature (and heaven) because of the people he meets, and the events that occur at this small and simply vibrant vocation. It should also be mentioned that, like the rest of the series, scrumptuous southern cooking plays a big role in the interaction of the characters. (I was interested to learn that Karon also recently published a cookbook.)So, as we say goodbye, we are pleased to find that Light From Heaven does an excellent job at answering many of the questions we had after reading the previous eight books. It also acts as a transition book for Father Tim and his wife, as \\"The Father Tim Novels\\" are set to be published in 2007. Newcomers to the series should consider picking up the Mitford Series boxset, as it wouldn't be fair to start at the ending, and the whole series really is exceptional. Fans might also enjoy the Left Behind Series by Lehaye and Jenkins. It has many similar morality themes and religious references. Calling in the Night by Michele Geraldi fits right into this style, too, as it is eloquent and respectful to faith and beauty. (I believe it is the first in a series, so it is fun to be at the beginning of something new.) Goodbye, Mitford. It's been wonderful."},{"Title":"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years #9)","review":"Wonderful continuation of the Mitford series, too bad this is her last installment, but hey, Father Tim is 70 now...

I'd rate it only below THE STORY OF ROLF AND THE VIKING BOW. I do wish a publisher would bring the book back into print. It's the story of Sir Marrock, a knight who returns home only to be ensorcelled into the body of a wolf by a faithless wife. The question is whether he can ever return to his own form, and how, even as a wolf, he is able to protect his people from those who would rule them. It's an excellent piece of work. I was referring to the original edition. I didn't mind that this copy was photocopied or scanned from a well-used library book but I was vexed to find the last two or three pages missing."},{"Title":"Poltergeist: The Legacy 03: The Shadows Between","review":"I've read all three Poltergeist books and have to say, unfortunately, that this was the weakest story of the three. I think one of the main problems is that the entire story takes place in the Legacy house and sort of gives the book a claustrophobic feel. Also, the ending is VERY anti-climatic (if you read the book you'll see what i mean). On the plus side, i think the author did a pretty good job of describing the main characters (they did remind me of the tv show)...although he did make a few mistakes (early on he describes Kat as Rachel's 20 year old daughter..he also says that Derek is French Canadian). All in all it's an OK book but not the best (i still think Maelstorm was the best so far). Hopefully another installment will be coming out soon."},{"Title":"Poltergeist: The Legacy 03: The Shadows Between","review":"The poltergiest: The Legacy book The Shadows Between left me in the dark. Even through the story was interesting to read I had to real follow the plot carefully. The story start with the appearance of a man, David Carson arriving at The Legacy House. Who he is and where he came from is discovered as the story moves on in the book. I am a fan of the series and the books except for this one. It was slow going and for one to understand what is happenning in the story you have to read very carefully or read it a second time. I did enjoy reading the other books in the series but &quot;The Shadows Between&quot; left me confused about what was going on. Sorry."},{"Title":"Poltergeist: The Legacy 03: The Shadows Between","review":"Fans of the series may like it. Although there are minor mistakes about the characters, it evolves decently.The plot: A mysterious stranger arrives at the Legacy House and Hell rides behind him.

Here's my take. The introductory pages from the author are nice, but moving beyond that to the daily journal....1/3 of the page is for date and weight entry followed by two sections that include little check off boxes to check off servings of (vegi's, fruit, vitamins, etc.) sort of like if you were following a food pyramid diet (or maybe an old Weight Watcher's plan) You can check off how many starches you had, how many servings of fat, etc. You choose between one of two sections (left side is for those doing a 1200 calorie diet and to the right for a 1500 calorie diet). The middle section of the page has titles \\"Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Snack\\" with corresponding areas to mark the Protein, Fat, Carbs, Fiber, Calories, Points, content. My gripe? Not enough room. I eat mini-meals throughout the day 6+ so a standard, Bfast, lunch, dinner, snack doesn't apply. Each day, I cross out the sections and squeeze in my info so everything is messy, squished and scribbled in.Okay, on to the exercise charting.Aerobic Exercise: ______________ How Long: ________that's the only room you get. For me, this doesn't cut it. The bulk of my exercise program is aerobic although I do weight training as well, I'm a home exerciser so I frequently combine video workouts or different sections from exercise DVDs. I like to enter what I did and add some comments (i.e. treadmill, level 5, felt good 1st 30 mins, ran out of steam....) The Strength Training section is good ______x_____Reps______ but is more geared to those logging gym-style workouts or free weights. Even still all you can write is the bodypart and how many reps, I like to include the amount of weight so I can track my progress. I do a lot of Yoga and Pilates and there's not additional room so I squeeze that info in wherever I can (usually under the strength training area) but with a layout like this below with tiny space in between, there's just no room_____________X________Reps_________X_____Reps_____________X________Reps_________X_____Reps_____________X________Reps_________X_____Reps...You also get one lined page for journal entry that begins with \\"Today was:\\" and this I like because I summarize and then go into detail if something bothered me, or enlightened me, etc.There are also little inspirational quotes at the top of each page and I like these too. Another feature is the ribbon that's attached to keep your place. Very handy. I forgot that there is also a beginning section to the journal to outline your goals and your potential obstacles.So, after using this journal daily for the last 3+ weeks, it's a keeper but not something I would have spent ...[money] on if I had seen it before buying it.The bottom line is that if I was able to peruse this at a store before buying, I would not have bought it. However, I do use it and have been using it for a few weeks now and have gotten used to it. After all, it all depends on the person and their personal preference, you might love it!"},{"Title":"The Phoenix's Guide To Self Renewal, A Daily Food Diary and Exercise Journal To Guide, Motivate and Inspire You On Your Weight Loss Journey","review":"This journal is the best I've ever used. I'd always had a problem with my journals in the past because I never had enough room to write. That's not the case here! With this book I have my food and exercise journal on one side and my writing journal page to put my thoughts about the day on the other. I mark it with the bookmark ribbon and am ready to go. The journal entry pages are enough for 6 months - which is great! More than enough time to get to my goal!!!I have to say, I carry this journal with me everywhere. Even though it's over 400 pages it's small and fits in my purse. All my friends love it too. I even jot down some of my appointments on my journal page for the day. This book is very complete and you can document all the things that are important to keep track of when you're trying to lose weight.One last thing that I wanted to say about this book is about the chapters. I was truly surprised to read those chapters. Talk about HONEST!!! You can tell this author originally wrote these chapters for herself because they are so eye-opening and to the point. I'm glad that she decided to share them though. Reading what she is going through as she loses weight and how she is keeping herself motivated really motivated me as well. She makes you think about things that you might not have thought about before. I'd never really thought about reinventing my way of thinking about myself BEFORE I started trying to lose weight and that one concept and the way she puts it to you and herself so bluntly made me think it was worth a try. It works. Since I'm feeling like I'm writing a book myself here I just want to say that using her suggestions I've been able to lose 9 lbs in the last two weeks. I'm going to keep at it so I can play with my two boys without breathing heavily and I know this book is going to help me stay on track!"},{"Title":"The Phoenix's Guide To Self Renewal, A Daily Food Diary and Exercise Journal To Guide, Motivate and Inspire You On Your Weight Loss Journey","review":"Ok - I actually threw this book away after 3 weeks - I just did not like it! It was set up to track her caloric guidelines and her eating program - which may I add - SHE DID FOR 3 WEEKS BEFORE WRITING THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This book was not written by someone who lost weight using this system and kept it off for ages - she used this system for 3 WEEKS before writing this book!Not that I bought it to follow her program - I use Weight Watchers, and I wanted to use it to track my food and exercise... Well - I found the room to write under the food layout to be very small - then there was no space to log your cardio work or weight for stregnth workouts... Now - there is a blank page opposite every daily page - but the lines are so small that you have to use a few for each real sentence! AND - It has 6 months worth of pages - when I ordered it to begin with, I thought, Oh - this is great! (my last one only lasted 3 months) Little did I realize that this thing would be HUGE! It weighs almost 5 pounds - which is fine if you are going to keep it at home the whole time, but I like to take my journal to and from work with me...Overall, I consider this journal to be a complete waste of [price]."},{"Title":"The Phoenix's Guide To Self Renewal, A Daily Food Diary and Exercise Journal To Guide, Motivate and Inspire You On Your Weight Loss Journey","review":"I have owned my copy of The Phoenix's Guide To Self Renewal for four weeks now and find it very useful, motivational and it helps me stay on track with my weight loss efforts. I wasn't going to reveiw this book until a friend told me about the most recent reviews that state the book doesn't have enough space in which to write which caused her some concern about purchasing the book for herself. I know everyone has their own opinions and that is why I decided to voice mine. I think this book has more writing space than any other diet journal on the market. I looked at many diet and exercise journals prior to purchasing this book and they had very little space in which to write. I know that no one book is going to fit the needs of every person but I do believe that this book is the best available and has plenty of writing space both on the food and exercise side and the journal side for each day. I love this book and it's motivational chapters and think the author did an excellent job and provided a well needed book for the dieting and exercise community. I know I will purchase another one if I am not at goal after the 6 months that this book covers. I have even personally written to the author and thanked her for such a great diet journal - that's how much I like this book."},{"Title":"The Phoenix's Guide To Self Renewal, A Daily Food Diary and Exercise Journal To Guide, Motivate and Inspire You On Your Weight Loss Journey","review":"This book is so much more than just a dieting and workout journal. It's about the same size as my old dayplanning book and I have now converted everything to this book because it is so much more convenient since I'm trying to lose weight and there is also a blank page for each day. I just write short phrases about what I eat and my workouts and use the remainder of the page for my daily appointments. This way I am able to stay on track because as I look at my appointments I'm constantly reminded that I'm writing down what I eat and that I have to exercise sometime during the day. That's because it's on the opposite page staring me in the face each time I check my appointments.Although the book may be a little large for someone who carries around a small purse, it's perfect for those of us who use medium to large sized purses, briefcases and backpacks. If it had been made smaller though the page provided for writing wouldn't have been as large and I personally think that is the one thing that makes this book unique and enables it to stand out from other similar books on the market. Plus the cover is very eyecatching and vibrant, just like the chapters make you feel.To the author - great job and fantastic idea! Thank you for sharing with all of us who are struggling with losing weight and for designing such a great book! The Phoenix's Guide is my constant companion each day as I realize the Phoenix within me! I am a POWVIP! I'm referring to page 9 but then you know that don't you!I'd recommend this book to EVERYONE!"},{"Title":"The Phoenix's Guide To Self Renewal, A Daily Food Diary and Exercise Journal To Guide, Motivate and Inspire You On Your Weight Loss Journey","review":"I'm so hyped!!

I bought my before it went out of print and couldn't see paying 99.00 for one of the used copies but I'll definately pay $3.99 to be able to print it out myself!"},{"Title":"The Phoenix's Guide To Self Renewal, A Daily Food Diary and Exercise Journal To Guide, Motivate and Inspire You On Your Weight Loss Journey","review":"This is absolutely the best diet and exercise journal that I've ever used. It has a LOT of space. There is room for me to log my daily food intake either by listing or checking it off plus areas for my aerobic and strenth training exercises. My favorite part is the entire page for journaling. I can vent or praise myself and get it out of my system. I love the ribbon too! I have my day right there in front of me and never have to search for my place. I'm really glad someone thought of providing dieters with enough room to keep track of EVERYTHING in a book that is able to fit in my purse and backpack.The chapters Ms. Alvarez has written are so motivational. Any time I feel like I'm stuck and want to give up on losing weight I just go back and read those chapters. Her words make me think about myself and look at what I'm doing from a different point of view. Ms. Alvarez doesn't hold anything back. She is very blunt about her own struggle with weight and it really helps me to know she is experiencing the same kinds of things that I am at the same time. Her suggestions are very good too and I have lost 15 lbs in the last 5 weeks by following her advice.I just want to thank you Ms. Alvarez for bearing your soul the way you did in your book. I know that was a hard thing for you to do. I don't think I could have ever been so honest with myself if you hadn't done it first in your book. I will recommend this book to anyone I know who needs to lose weight."},{"Title":"The Phoenix's Guide To Self Renewal, A Daily Food Diary and Exercise Journal To Guide, Motivate and Inspire You On Your Weight Loss Journey","review":"I have been in the exercise and weight loss industry for more than 20 years and this is a very refreshing book. It doesn't promote any specific weight loss program, and is not just another boring weight loss book, but gives you all the tools you need to keep track of your daily statistics. I have never seen a food and exercise diary that gives you such a large amount of writing room and is as well laid out and organized as this book. In fact I can surely say there is nothing else like it on today's market. This is a book that you can actually use on a daily basis as a food diary, exercise log, and writing journal. It's good for weight loss, body builders, people with medical problems, actually anyone who needs to track such statistics. The writing journal is so large that you could actually keep up with your appointments on a daily basis too. Who could ask for more?Although the chapters are from the viewpoint of a work at home mom who is still trying to lose weight, they convey how the authors feelings about her weight affected all areas of her life. She enables the reader to connect with her because she writes in such a honest, in your face approach. I find it interesting that she wrote these chapters to motivate herself and decided to share it with others. She hits on some very valid points and points out to the reader that you really have to change the way you approach weight loss and that this is something that you have to do for yourself. She also promotes a positive, motivating outlook on life and yourself which will help to keep you on track. She doesn't promise it will be easy, in fact she tells you that you have to move, eat right, stay positive and work for your goals. These chapters are a very easy read that you can truly relate to if you have ever had negative feelings about your body.But the chapters are not the main reason for this book. They are helpful and nice reading but this book is about Chapter 10 - The Daily Journal. This is what is so unique about the book. The way it's laid out and the space that you are given to write about your progress regardless if you are trying to lose weight or add muscle mass. It doesn't matter if you write down each food and count the carbs etc. There's room and a line for those things for each meal and snack or if you like to check off that you ate your servings for the day - room for that too. Check marks for water, vitamins and you even get to circle a smile, frown or neutral face based on the results of the day. You record both aerobic and strength training exercises and the writing journal is an entire page. The book is nicely accessorized with a bookmark ribbon.I hope this reveiw has been informative and I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Phoenix's Guide To Self Renewal, A Daily Food Diary and Exercise Journal To Guide, Motivate and Inspire You On Your Weight Loss Journey","review":"Space, space, space and more space!!!! I had been searching for a book with more writing space where I could also track my diet and exercise. One of my friends sent this book to me and then I saw it on here. I had to write and tell everyone what a great tool this book is when it comes to losing weight. You get a whole page for journaling PLUS your diet log, PLUS your exercise log - and this is all daily. The book has a lot of other cool tools too - a monthly progress chart, sections for goals, obstacles, and motivations! This has to be the most complete diet and exercise journal that I've ever used and I would recommend this book to EVERYONE who wants to track their weight loss efforts. Oh - and if you every start to stray from your plan, just read those 10 short chapters again and you will get MOTIVATED!!!!! I just love this book and am so glad my friend sent it to me.

THANK YOU..."},{"Title":"The Phoenix's Guide To Self Renewal, A Daily Food Diary and Exercise Journal To Guide, Motivate and Inspire You On Your Weight Loss Journey","review":"When I purchased this book it was because I was looking for something with more writing space. Not only does it provide a whole page for writing - which I found extremely useful - it offers different ways to log your food intake - which I liked. This book is well worth every penny and I will certainly purchase another one if I haven't reached my goal by the time the book is full with my daily stats, which is 6 months. I liked the chapters for personal reasons. This author makes you look at your thoughts and feelings by looking at her own thoughts and feeling and she sure can hit home on some points. I know, from these chapters, that the author wrote them to motivate herself if she strayed from her plan. I can't help but wonder if she knew how much her straightforward approach would enable the reader to look deep down inside of themselves and change their way of thinking. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Phoenix's Guide To Self Renewal, A Daily Food Diary and Exercise Journal To Guide, Motivate and Inspire You On Your Weight Loss Journey","review":"This book is very usable. It has all you need for weight loss. From the section to check off your servings to the one to write in your individual foods and calculate protein, fat, fiber and much more, to the exercise sections and the journal page - this book is absolutely wonderful. There is nothing else like it in the bookstores. I have yet to find a dieting journal that is so complete until now. If you compare this book to other similar books you'll find that this one only costs a few dollars more but it gives you twice as many pages as any that I've found AND it gives you so much room to write. I never found any that have met my needs in the writing areas but with this book you get an entire page. I feel this book fills a need that a lot of women may have in regards to dieting and weight loss and suggest it to everyone because when you compare it to other diet journals it's the winner - no question about it."},{"Title":"The Phoenix's Guide To Self Renewal, A Daily Food Diary and Exercise Journal To Guide, Motivate and Inspire You On Your Weight Loss Journey","review":"I just wanted to write a quick review and explain how the title - The Phoenix's Guide To Self Renewal- relates to this book. The author cites a story from ancient mythology - the legend of the Phoenix Bird - and applies it to her own life. This is not any kind of religious story but a myth that says the Phoenix was a bird who lived for a thousand years and then burned itself in its nest and died. The Phoenix then recreated itself from its ashes and became a new young bird full of energy and life. The author explains how we too can be like the Phoenix by changing the way we think about weight loss prior to beginning a diet. She says that we can recreate ourselves just as the Phoenix does by looking deep inside and finding the things that are keeping us from reaching our goals and letting them die within us while we create new thoughts about our approach and self image. I really like the comparison and the way that this woman is able to motivate with her straight on approach and helpful suggestions. This book is great for people like me who tend to lose motivation a couple of weeks into a weight loss program. Once I read the chapters again I was right back on track."},{"Title":"The Phoenix's Guide To Self Renewal, A Daily Food Diary and Exercise Journal To Guide, Motivate and Inspire You On Your Weight Loss Journey","review":"I must say that when I decided to purchase this book I was concerned about spending $19.99 on a journal. My caution was completely unfounded. This book is worth every penny. I didn't realize at first that it contains 6 months of daily journaling, I thought it was only three. It is very complete and meets all my requirements in a food diary, exercise log and writing journal. Prior to this book i was using three different books to record my progress. I'm very happy to have found this journal. It's great and I'd recommend it to anyone who logs this type of information."},{"Title":"The Phoenix's Guide To Self Renewal, A Daily Food Diary and Exercise Journal To Guide, Motivate and Inspire You On Your Weight Loss Journey","review":"I think this journal is laid out very nicely and for me it covers all the areas that I use daily. I'm a stay at home mom and I work out at home on a universal machine. I find that the format of the journal not only provides sections for all of my meals but for my exercise as well. I feel this is a wonderful book and during the past 6 weeks that I've been using it I have noticed factors that were keeping me from losing weight. After changing these factors I have been able to shed 20 pounds. If I had not have been using this book and writing my feelings and what I was doing on the blank page (I love that blank page!) I probably wouldn't have noticed what was keeping me from losing weight. I love this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who really wants to lose weight. This is also the only book that I have ever seen where the author gives you motivational chapters by sharing her experience in an honest, friend to friend, kind of way. The chapters are a very easy read and the author justs draws you to her somehow and makes you see things a little differently.

It's nice to know that we aren't alone in the battle of losing weight and that the author is going through the same thing - right now. This author shows us how to be successful but doesn't sugar coat it. She lets us know that it is a struggle for her too and that even though we (author included) may hit plateaus, gain a few pounds back, or not lose a pound for a couple of weeks that this is a process, a change in our mindsets about how we approach the problem of excess weight and that we can succeed if we use the power of our passion to obtain our goals.

Actually it was closer than that - it was like I was reading my own journal because some of the feeling she talked about I've felt but would never tell anyone, not even my best friend. She hits on feelings that I thought only I was feeling about my weight. With the help of this book I've realized that I'm NOT the only one who feels this way. And she doesn't just talk about her feelings about her weight but she tells you what she did to overcome these feeling, in the hopes that her story will help others. Her words make so much sense to me and her story did help me look at my self differently. I also liked the fact that she's a work at home mom who's dealing with her weight and not a doctor. She's someone like me.The author is so easy to relate to and get this - she even give's you both her postal and email addresses in the book so that you can write to her to let her know what you think about her book and she even offers in another section that if you feel like you're going to laspe from your program to write her a letter or email to get your mind off of heading to the kitchen. I think that is wonderful of her and I for one am going to take her up on it. This is a great book!The chapters are short but so packed full of feelings and information.

And she's right, it's not just a how &quot;overweight&quot; we are, it's about how we feel about ourselves. We feed ourselves to replace whatever it is we're missing, when we should be feeding ourselves from the inside. By giving readers a place to write down daily thoughts, achievements AND disappointments, this book enables us to pick up on exactly why we go on binges...which we all do.I like the weight lifting routine! Spoken from someone who knows what its like to be a real person in a real world. Written in such a way that a person feels like they can identify with the author and share in her joy of self-renewal and want to experience it as well.

It was her first adult novel to be set in the 19th Century, where an intrepid female reporter runs away to Europe to find her missing half-brother and his naive wife. She finds that the children were abandoned, and that she must care for them until her wayward brother is found. Part of it is a relief from the pressures of an engagement to a scion of a high society family, but it also burdens her. The trio find their way up to an ancient, decaying castle in Scotland, where secrets are unraveled, lies are exposed, and lives are lost, both innocent and wicked. The ending was a bit off, and certain things just didn't seem to work. Not bad though."},{"Title":"Castle Barebane : A Novel Of Suspense","review":"Joan Aiken, daughter of poet Conrad Aiken, was a prolific writer in the last half of the twentieth century. She is best remembered for her alternate history juveniles The Wolves of Willoughby Chase series. She also wrote books for adults, usually gothics of some variety.Castle Barebane is a historical gothic, but Aiken often seems to have her tongue in her cheek in the most delightful way. Val is a writer engaged to the proper son of a wealthy family. She is getting intimations that married life in this family may not be quite to her liking, but is ignoring them as best she can. Returning home after her engagement party she finds her hal-brother Nils waiting on her doorstep. Nils is obviously in trouble, but Val ignores the signs of this as well because Nils offers escape in the form of a favor. Will Val travel to England and take care of Nils' wife and children while Nils is away. As this suits several purposes of Val's she agrees. Upon arriving in England she finds Nils and his wife missing and the children in terrible circumstances. She undertakes transporting the children to the home of Kirstie's relations - more disapproving wealthy relations. Once there the truth about Kirstie, Nils and a Jack the Ripper type killer unfold in a deadly climax.I'm not certain I can be completely reliable about this book as it has the magic of childhood stamped on every page for me. It was one of the books I read when I was first making the transition to adult books in early adolescence and nostalgia colors every re-read for me. However, it is a fun read and Aiken's humor keeps gothic traditions from getting stale. Recommended for Aiken fans and gothic fans. Probably falls into the good but not great category but a favorite nevertheless."},{"Title":"Scientific Examination of Documents (Ellis Horwood series in forensic science)","review":"This first edition is a must have for the professional Questioned Document Examner. Excellent details in pen, ink, paper, indented writing Forensice Document Examination. Some methods of ink and pen identification qre not even covered in most Forensic Questioned Document Books, Not in the detail covered here. How do you know if an envelope has been steamed opened and reglued? What methods of page substitution are not covered in other tests? How can you quickly identify, beyond watermarks, if a page may not be consistent with others in a corporate agreement? Mr Ellen is truly a master Forensic Document Examiner. In my opinion he is the modern day version of Albert Osborn. My Osborn's Questioned Documents was the first complete book on Questioned Document Examination. It is dated now but Mr. Ellen's book covers it all. A great book. A must have for the 21st century.The 1st and 2nd editon should not be confused with the 3rd edition. The 1st and 2nd edition give great technical detail as to methodology in use of Forensic Equipment, VSC-1, ESDA, IR/UV, ink and paper analysis. The 3rd edition answers methodology in visual examination as to methods of construction,disquised writing, simulations,significance of similarities and differences. The 3rd edition is more general than the previous editions but an excellent resource for the Forensic Questioned Document Examiner in training and as a refresher for the seasoned Forensic Questioned Document Examiner.

In many senses, it is a perfect followup to &quot;The Perfect Storm,&quot; even involving the same unit and one of the same men who was involved in that tragic attempt to rescue sailboaters caught in the same storm as the doomed swordfishermnen. The Air Rescue service's motto is &quot;That others may live' and never has it been on display more than in this undertaking. With helicopters pushed well beyond design limits, with amazing air to air refuelings in raging storms, with drama and conflict between elements of the unit, this is a tale demanding to be made into a movie. A true story, no one would believe it if it hadn't actually happened. A freighter has sunk, and 26 sailors are in the sea in a storm with hurricane strength winds some 900 miles from the 106th Rescue Wing's home base. Without hesitation, the pilots and pararescuemen of the unit are ready to make the risky rescue. Soon command reluctance to risk a dangerous mission--remember the unit lost a chopper and a parajumper in &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; mission--postpones the flight. Will they make it on time? How can the sailors, some in deteriorating lifeboats, some alone in the water, survive? Michael Hirsch has had unlimited access to the crewmen who made the mission, plus a rescued sailor, who's own survival is amazing in its own right. Hirsch keeps the book moving at breakneck speed, but with a technical accuracy and attention to the human detail rarely seen in such action adventures. &quot;Pararescue&quot; has it all. Tension, storms, heroic pilots and parajumpers, moments of humor under enormous stress, shark attacks, and amazing flying and mission coordination. Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pararescue: The Skill and Courage of the Elite 106th Rescue Wing--The True Story of an Incredible Rescue at Sea and the Heroes Who Pulled It Off","review":"The book really gave me an idea of the training and gratification that goes along with military rescue forces.

As a former journalist myself, I marveled at the author's attention to detail in exposing the gritty work of a group of men who dedicate themselves to saving lives through airborne rescue missions. The description of their elite training is worth the price of admission alone. But the tale of the rescue that is the focus of this book takes it over the top; it rivals the best adventure fiction you'll ever experience.Another reviewer said Clint Eastwood will have a starring role in the movie they make from this book. My bet is that Harrison Ford will buy the rights to this All-American five-star thriller. Anyhow, read it now. Hollywood can't make the story any better."},{"Title":"Pararescue: The Skill and Courage of the Elite 106th Rescue Wing--The True Story of an Incredible Rescue at Sea and the Heroes Who Pulled It Off","review":"Great Read!Pararescue, by Michael Hirsh, is one of the most thoroughly researched contemporary military history novels I have read. As a Marine officer, I am critical of books, movies, and articles about the military when they don't &quot;get it right.&quot; I couldn't find one obvious inaccuracy in this book, which tells me Mr. Hirsh was very careful in his examination of the Air Force Pararescue community, and of the little-known USMC KC-130 aerial refueling tanker community.Most interesting to me was the comparison of the philosophies of the helicopter crews of the 102nd Rescue Squadron, and that of the Marines of Yanky 03 - the Marine tanker crew from VMGR-452. Their attitudes and beliefs seemed to be identical - &quot;Whatever it takes to get the job done.&quot; By contrast, the mind-set of the Air Force C-130 tanker crews seemed to be &quot;Whatever excuse we can find to get out of this dangerous mission&quot; and &quot;What about our crew rest?&quot; Strange that the &quot;factions&quot; mentioned in this story would be Air Force Helicopter crews and Marine on one side, and Air Force C-130 crews on the other.Air Force LtCol Fleming, the Flight-lead of the 102 Rescue Squadron's H-60 Blackhawk rescue team, and the true hero of the book, should have been a Marine. Coming from a Marine, that is the ultimate compliment. Clint Eastwood should play his part in the movie version of this book."},{"Title":"Pararescue: The Skill and Courage of the Elite 106th Rescue Wing--The True Story of an Incredible Rescue at Sea and the Heroes Who Pulled It Off","review":"Pararescue is a powerful, intense, nail-biting thriller that takes the reader along on one of the most daring rescues ever attempted.

Markushevich is on my desk. I bought this book half-a-century ago, in Moscow, USSR. The title of the book, in the word for word (literal) translation, is \\"Theory of Analytic Functions.\\" It is one-volume book, with pages of the size approximately 256mm x 167mm, and there are 703 pages in the book. This book is published in Moscow-Leningrad, by the State Publishing House of Technico-Theoretical Literature, in 1950, in Russian Language. Again, this is the very first edition of this masterpiece. There are eight chapters in the book. There are no problems (for the reader to solve them). That, however, was typical of many books published in the USSR: there were, usually, separate Problems Books. This was one of the books by which I myself studied Complex Variables. The English Editions of this book I do not have, although one of the Universities in the city where I live does have two such editions: one published by the Prentice Hall in 1965, and another one published by Chelsea in 1977. If I were doing translation of this book into English, I would try to stay as close as possible to the original, because the original is written with care of the reader. By the way, this was edition of 15000 copies. By the time I bought this book, all 15000 copies were sold, and the bookstores (of new books) did not have this book. In the USSR, there was no Books in Print system. Books were printed in specified number of copies, and if these copies were sold, the only way to find a book was in a second-hand bookstore. And that is where I bought this book. The price of this book, new, was 29 roubles. In the second-hand bookstore, I paid 23 roubles 20 copecks. I used this book, as needed, all my life. Even today, I used it, and I expect to use it in the near future, too. I bought many books in my life, mostly before I was fourty-something. This purchase was one of the best book purchases for me.

I will surely read other Higgings books."},{"Title":"DRINK WITH THE DEVIL","review":"It is true that Jack Higgins write adventures and that Sean Dillon is one of the contradicting heroes ever created. In a book series with the same hero, Higgins falls into a trap he should not have to. But let's start in the opposite way. The book is good, but not as good as Higgins himself. It is an adventure of the Bond likes, with agen- cies, conspiracies, international terrorism and very much updated (the IRA peace thing), that flows well enough, speeding at times, with a straightforward plot that is not striving for complexity, nor to great mysteries. Yes, the rhythm is good, but the story passes as the expected and the action or pre action justifications are too simple, while the heroes pass through it in an easy or non-sweat manner. Enough super hero like- ness is attributed and the psychology behind any action is of non-existence or minimal. The chara- cters themselves are fairly focused, even if they are recurring or firstly introduced. What is left though is an almost picturous like speech, that is straightforward and to the point, narrating bigger pictures in fewer words and being very good to that. With three interesting twists and a sweat and sour taste at the end, the attention of the reader is kept and the book has the ability to be read fast although the reader is not so much keen to explore the next chapter for seeing &quot;what's going to happen&quot;. Knowing the potentials of Hig- gins, I wouldn't mind he wrote less books, but I mind that he writes a lot that are fair or medium. Even if he wants to present a Bond like hero, or if he had met us with him (or them) previously, he should have bothered for more psychology (like Kellerman does), more originality in story (like Flemming, or Ludlum, or Savarin - same hero trilo- gies) and more real adventure (like Morell, Clancy, Wilbur Smith, a.o). That's the trap he fells into: little to say on a much exploited genre."},{"Title":"DRINK WITH THE DEVIL","review":"Equals everything else this writer has written! A master at the top of his game!"},{"Title":"DRINK WITH THE DEVIL","review":"Drink With the Devil makes for an absolutely fantastic read. Sean Dillon, arguably the (or one of) most loved characters ever created by Higgins, returns again in this thriller. Yes, the story may be a tad slow at times, but it never promised to be a high adrenaline-pumped book in the first place. And that was why it was such a pleasant read. The mood of the book changes from time to time, scene to scene, and appropriately so. Higgins' writing may not be the most fanciful, but boy, was it a great ride. Not to be missed, especially if you're a great fan of Jack Higgins, and of Sean Dillon as well."},{"Title":"DRINK WITH THE DEVIL","review":"In 1985, IRA terrorist Sean Dillon is assigned to infiltrate a renegade Loyalist terrorist group led by Michael Ryan. Posing as a Protestant named Martin Keogh, Dillon saves Ryan's niece Kathleen from rape (and probably worse) at the hands of a group of Catholic thugs. Dillon joins Ryan in his plan to hijack a British armored car carrying 50 million pounds to fund Ryan's campaigns. The heist goes off successfully, but the captain of the boat ferrying them across the Irish Sea tries a double cross, and pays with his life. Dillon and the Ryans survive, with Michael maintaining an electronic device which will lead the user to the wreck and the money. Dillon has an opportunity to kill the Ryans and take the device, but (perhaps in his first pangs of conscience) chooses not to, and they go on their separate ways.Ten years later, Michael and Kathleen Ryan have immigrated to the U.S., where Michael is imprisoned for shooting a police officer in a botched robbery. Michael's health is failing, so he is often transported from the prison to a nearby hospital for treatment. One of the henchmen of Mafia Don Antonio Russo gets wind that Ryan knows the location of (now) 100 million pounds sitting at the bottom of the Irish Sea. Russo confers with IRA chieftain Jack Barry (the man who assigned Dillon to infiltrate Ryan's group) and offers to split the booty. Russo will break Ryan out of prison in exchange for the location of the wreck. The Ryan's are thus forced into assisting the IRA and the mob.Stalwart British Intelligence guru Brigadier Charles Ferguson gets wind of Ryan's resurfacing and sends Detective Chief-Inspector Hannah Bernstein and Dillon, who's now working for British Intelligence (read &quot;Thunder Point&quot; if you want to know why,) after the gold, to stop it from falling into the hands of either the IRA, the mob, or the Ryans.Another Dillon classic, with the added bonus of shedding some light on what Dillon did when he was with the IRA. Kathleen Ryan is easily the most compelling character in the book. At the end of the book, when you find out what has happened to her in her short life, it makes her actions that much more tragic and also much more understandable. I defy you not to feel for her when her trauma is finally revealed. One wonders how many real Kathleen Ryans there are in Northern Ireland today, both Protestant and Catholic, and if they'll ever manage to find peace.If you like Higgins, and especially Dillon, buy this book. But it's a lot deeper, and raises a lot more questions, than most people are willing to admit."},{"Title":"DRINK WITH THE DEVIL","review":"Higgins has been around for so long and has developed an endearing style for spinning tales that can only hook the reader. The types of adventure stories he tells had gone out of style long ago. I lament the passing of those times. For that reason, I often find myself reading material from the 60's and 70's, transporting myself back to a time when geopolitics and detailed knowledge of technical hardware didn't gum down the pace of a good novel. It was a less informed time, but fun, non the less.Drink with the Devil is a rare novel that transports me back but yet remains refreshingly contemporary! I think that's why I like it so much. Sean Dillon, Higgins's weathered hero, does all the time travelling for me. The novel opens with a gold heist gone awry a decade ago. Fast forward to today and a treasure hunt ensues throughout the rest of the novel.Mafia, Ulstermen, angry IRA types, and many others find their way into the novel. Like most Higgins fare, the pace is very quick. All subplots, there aren't many, are attended to; Dillon sews up all loose ends, as he usually does.A fine read. Or, a fine listen. Patrick McNee does the audio version. He relies on his cockney accent to bring realism to the text. Very enjoyable"},{"Title":"DRINK WITH THE DEVIL","review":"Introduction : in 1985, Ulster Loyalist Ryan successfully robbed 50 million pounds of gold, only to lose it in transit when the Irish Rose, a vessel carrying the truck which carried the gold, sank somewhere off the coast of Ireland after sailing off from England.Ten years later, a New York mafia don discovered Ryan and his connection to the lost gold. He arranged for Ryan to escape and forced Ryan's niece along to salvage the gold, working together with Jack Barry, retired IRA chief. It appeared that Ryan's gang of robbers had included an IRA mole, whose identity is easily guessed by readers familiar with Higgins' work.Through a stroke of luck, the British authorities learned of the planned salvage and Group 4, aka PM's private army, was put to work to prevent the refunding of either militant factions in Northern Ireland. The rule, as usual, is &quot;no publicity&quot;, which is somehow important amidst the US-mediated Irish peace process. Higgins' work, as usual, is action packed. There are less twists and turns, with the prologue taking almost half the book. His heroes, and heroines, seemed incredibly lucky and outskilled the opponents all the time, and trip only the sheerest bad luck. As usual, they know exactly where to inquire for their quarry, rendering zilch the laborious detective work.This book would have served well enough if not for some incredible plot holes.First, it was in the papers that the gold was on the Irish Rose which sank between England and Ireland. Though the British may find it hard to locate the wreck, the IRA had strong clues to narrow the location, and 50 million pounds of gold would have been worth the effort, regardless of whether one is driven by idealism or greed.Second, Ryan could have retrieved his gold without too much difficulty, but instead he took chances to rob a bank in American and landed in jail. Why he did nothing, even after finding himself in prison, is a major plot hole. He could even have contacted his comrades to work something out instead of growing old in prison."},{"Title":"DRINK WITH THE DEVIL","review":"If Jack Higgins wrote it, it's worth reading. Love the \\"Sean Dillon\\" series. Book arrived within alloted time frame and was well packaged."},{"Title":"DRINK WITH THE DEVIL","review":"Higgins in his prime was a master of plot, character and dialogue. Drink With the Devil is a perfect example of formula rubbish, typical of his later books. Actually, the book might indeed be the work of a writing team, ala Jack London: Higgins provides the plot; a writing staff supplies the rest. Every character sounds exactly alike, whether they're English, Irish, Italian or American. Nearly everyone says \\"Good God\\" at some point in the story. Other numerous cliches are stuff like \\"his eyes turned cold\\" to indicate something serious is about to happen. His \\"Irish\\" characters, again typically, mouth vaudeville Irish cliches like \\"sure and\\" and \\"girl dear.\\" One keeps expecting \\"Faith and begorrah\\" to erupt from Dillon and Devlin. As usual with all of Higgins' post WWII works, his understanding of political realities remains in the White Hat/Black Hat perspective: all the good guys working for the Anglo-American governments, all the bad guys outside that nexus. He also follows the propaganda line of the English by defining the Irish struggles as a Catholic/Protestant affair rather than the historical national movement it was and is. He writes of \\"Provos,\\" as if he's never heard of the left leaning hunger striker Bobby Sands and the movement in general without any awareness of Protestant figures like Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone or Marxists like James Connolly. The final senility is his continued use of WWII weapons a half century after that war ended. Everyone carries Walthers, Brownings and Smith and Wessons; apparently Higgins is not aware that by the 1990's most operatives replaced those antiques with Sigs, Glocks, Makarovs and CZ75s."},{"Title":"DRINK WITH THE DEVIL","review":"Jack Higgins' DRINK WITH THE DEVIL receives a fine performance by veteran Michael Pqage, who has recorded over 50 tiles for Brilliance and is a Professor of Theatre and an actor.

Together they manage the robbery of an armored truck containing millions in gold, but their endeavour is botched when thru circumstances beyond their control the ferry boat sinks and takes the armored truck and its contents to the bottom of the Irish Sea.Years later we come across Ryan and his sister living in the U.S.A., However, thru bad luck and a botched robbery Ryan in in jail where he is confined to the sick ward due to an illness. Now the parts start to come together. The Mafia know that Ryan is transported to a local hospital periodically for treatment, and they plan to kidnap him and force him to reveal the location of the sunken ferry boat and the armored truck.
