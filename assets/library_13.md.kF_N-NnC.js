Scarlett's character is brilliant. Her transformation from a butterfly to a tough woman who loves her land, her struggles against poverty and her determination to rise above it, her passionate nature are just some of the remarkable features of this book. Its almost as if in the character of Scarlett, the author has put in all the dreams, hopes and aspiration of America of the mid 1800's.

It IS in a class by itself! Thank you very much, WilesWales"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This has been my favorite book since I was a child. The book is so much better than the movie. I encourage anyone who has only seen the movie to make sure they read the book.The story starts out with a young Scarlett. She is a spoiled young woman who has never had to work for a thing in her life. She is different than many girls her age, because she thinks for herself. The setting is one where women were still property and a womans role in life was to be a wife and mother. Women didn't need any more ambition than that.Throughout the story, we watch as war changes Scarlett's life forever. Never does one scene happen in a battle, but you can feel the impact of the war in the various characters during the story. The author, Margaret Mitchell, gives us insight into the personal history of other characters in the book. This helps us to understand their motivations.The Scarlett in the book shows her human side more than the one in the movie. In the book it becomes obvious that Scarlett was doing the best she could to survive a terriable situation the world thrust upon her. In the movie, she seems like just a selfish b****. More than one scene in the book brings tears to my eye when I visualize what Scarlett was going through."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"My favorite book of all times.

I have received little support in reading this novel. In fact, when I tell people I am reading GWTW each person has replied, \\"Oh wow. I've never read it but I saw the movie. Such a great love story.\\"To be honest I find myself annoyed! I could never imagine a movie that could substitute this book. And, yes, a love story, but just as well a historical narrative of the grueling life during the civil war through the mind of Scarlet. This leaves me to wonder how could a movie encompass the pages and pages of her thoughts? I am almost too afraid to see the movie for fear it will not live up to my expectations.Anywho... Amazing novel thus far. I highly recommend to those age 12+. In fact, my 16 year old, second cousin recommended it! I'm so proud of her!Best,Kim"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I wasn't quite sure whether I would enjoy Gone With the Wind. It's a large, forbidding book. But I loved it. Most of you are probably familiar with the basic story: the main character is Scarlett O'Hara, a spoiled southern belle in the time of the Civil War, and her desire to get everything she wants, through any means possible. A huge book, there are many characters in Gone With the Wind. Scarlett manipulates many men, but the ones she really cares about (Ashley, and later, Rhett), she can't. When she gets something she wants, she doesn't want it anymore. Scarlett is always frustrated, and is always making plans for the future. In some ways, this wasn't what interested me most about the book. I loved the setting. I just read A Soldier's Secret (admittedly, in a whole different class of literature), but anyway, that was from the Union perspective of things. In Gone With the Wind, none of the Southern ladies think that there's going to be a war. And when war does break out, they think that they're going to \\"lick\\" the Yankees in one battle. But the \\"Yankees\\" thought the same thing: that the Confederacy would be beaten immediately. Instead, we have a long, drawn-out, brutal, four year conflict.The Southern culture described in the book was interesting too. Among rich Georgia plantation-owners, there is a code of conduct, a certain way of behaving. The ladies can't say what they really think, a widow must wear black mourning clothes for years and never have any fun (Scarlett is in this predicament when she's only seventeen), etc. etc. Rhett Butler challenges all these things. He openly admits that he'd work for the North if he got paid more, he doesn't believe that the South will win, and he mocks the patriotic \\"brave\\" men of Georgia who fight. But at other times, he can be really cruel to Ashley. It was interesting to see how different life was among wealthy people back then.As for the characters, Scarlett is spoiled and used to getting her way, and she's from a slave-owning family, and yet...sometimes you sympathize with her. She genuinely cares about Ashley, she does have feelings, even though she's not very intelligent (though good at flirting with men.) Most of the deeper ideas expressed by some of the other characters go right over her head, and I was really frustrated by that. But my favorite character was probably Rhett. He's not afraid to challenge the system and say what he thinks, and he always seems to pop in the most convenient situations (for him, at least.) Rhett, when he meets Scarlett, makes her begin to challenge the way of life a bit. When he meets her, she's in mourning for a husband she was married to for two months and who she didn't care about. Only seventeen, she is desperate to be able to go to parties again, and he helps her do that. But he's complicated too. Underneath that mask, he's not as smooth. I think the white characters in the book were very well portrayed. Melanie, the wife of Ashley, is also a very sweet and kind woman, though she always misconstrues what Scarlett is thinking. Melanie always believes the best of people (which perhaps is not always wise), but that makes her a lovable character.However, you have to remember that the book was written in the 1920s and 30s, and set in the 1860s. There are plenty of stereotypes about blacks, and some derogatory words for blacks (darkies, the n-word). I find it very hard to believe that some of the slaves turned servants never wanted freedom, independence, or money. You just have to be aware that Mitchell is obviously very biased, and not believe everything she tells you.Gone With the Wind is a timeless classic and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. You can read Becky's excellent review of it here. Gone With the Wind does take some commitment as it is almost 1000 pages long, but it's a rewarding read.You can read all of my reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Perhaps you've heard of Gone With the Wind. In movie form, this work is quite stunning and fun. In print, it's breathtaking and provides bone-jarring visuals as well as a rich and well-developed story not often encountered.Mitchell's portrait of pre-during-and post Civil War South gives depth and intelligence to the people of the land, while simultaneously giving voice to their faults and well-intentioned geniality of that day and age.Characters like Scarlett, Rhett and Melanie gain personality that the movie does no justice. Although you know Melanie is going to die, when it finally hits, there's a true sadness that this rich personality we've traveled with is now leaving us. And in the end, Rhett still does leave Scarlett, but it's about more than not \\"giving a damn\\" and we feel sorry more for Rhett in this scene than for Scarlett (although we are glad that she finally gets it!)The characters almost disappoint as well, as they do everything we wish they wouldn't and do not behave as we want our characters to, thwarting their happy ending every step of the way. But Scarlett's real and honest love for Tara surrounds the novel and holds every element of the story together.In the end, there's only sadness upon finishing this novel in that there will never be a sequel by the late Margaret Mitchell, and perhaps even if there were there'd be no duplicating the magic that she created in this true and poignant work."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I bought an original book 1936.

Never thought that would be the case, as I assumed it was just a book about romance and that's not mt preferred genre.

It is a wonderful tale that keeps you truly enchanted by the life of Scarlett O'Hara. Gone With the Wind takes place before, during, and after the Civil War in Georgia. It starts out at the beloved Tara, but soon finds itself in Atlanta. When Scarlett speaks of everything going on you can't help but feel the emotion she feels.At the beginning of the story, Scarlett wants Ashley as her husband. However, Ashley is to be married to Melanie, his musical and intelligently inclined cousin. Scarlett ends up marrying Melanie's brother, Charles, even though she still loves Ashley. He soon dies in the war and leaves her with a baby boy. After the war, Scarlett marries her sister's fianc&eacute;e to keep the Yankees from getting Tara.

While life in the \\"big house\\" was opulent for some, it was bought and paid for by the inhumane life of countless slaves. As a southerner who family never owned slaves - we were too poor!, I enjoy the fantasy that is GWTW, but always have a sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach knowing that the life Scarlett lived was nothing like the life of the average farmer's daughter. Just as the \\"robber barons\\" of the north enjoyed oppulent living from New York to Newport, society can not afford all for some and nothing for the many. By the way, the book is still VERY LONG!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"What can you say about a classic except for simply wonderful. The storyline, the characters, the descriptions of the old south. The civil war and it's horrors, the price you pay for decisions you make. Above all an amazing love story. A classic that will play forever."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"\\"Burdens are for shoulders strong enough to carry them\\"Tara Plantation, near Jonesborough, near Atlanta, GeorgiaKatie \\"Scarlett\\" O'Hara is the most charming Southern belle, gathering the attention of beaux all over the surrounding areas. But when she learns the man she had been psuedo-courting, Ashley Wilkes, is marrying Melanie Hamilton from Atlanta, his cousin, she schemes to win him back. When he refuses, she immediately marries Charles Hamilton in spite. But Civil War has come to the South, and Scarlett quickly finds herself a widow, stuck in Atlanta, with a child, unable to be the pretty belle she had been a few months prior. Will Scarlett ever get Ashley? What about the strange Rhett Butler character, who is constantly tweaking her? Will Scarlett and her family survive the war?Let me preface my review with this: I don't read a lot of historical fiction or chick lit or romance or anything. My speciality is science fiction, fantasy, and urban fantasy. However, this book absolutely, positively blew me away!At first, I found the novel a bit slow. There were so many characters, and at first, it seemed like nothing happened. But that wasn't to last. Quickly, I became interested in Scarlett's schemes to snatch Ashley away from Melanie, all the while hating her for her bad behavior. By the end of the book, there were points were I was in near tears.Scarlett wasn't my favorite character. She was a rude, bitter, selfish woman. But I completely understood her predicament. To the reader, she was completely honest, despising her first husband's death (and life!), her dislike of children (don't see that much in romance do we!), her dislike of women's poor station (always having to act \\"silly\\" in front of the menfolk), and taking the reigns of business to make a life of her own. So while I didn't like her, I also didn't hate her. I understood what she was trying to do and found myself rooting for her against the odds. She is a brilliantly written character, so dynamic, multifaceted and full.Melanie Hamilton was probably my favorite character. This might seem odd as she does come off as a Mary Sue--perfect and sweet to everyone, always right, yada, yada--and I hate Mary Sues. But I really never found Melanie a Mary Sue. Scarlett repeatedly downplays Melanie's beauty. Melanie is strong-willed and works diligently, but tires easily (such as when she works at Tara in the cotton fields). Like Scarlett, Melanie was definitely not a 1-D character. She appeared weak on the outside, while maintaining strenght in the face of danger, in the face of childbirth, in the face of hard times. She was a true inspiration to me.Rhett Butler made me so furious, sometimes I wanted to slap him like Scarlett! But other times, he was so charming and debonair, that I wanted to melt in his arms like butter. I loved how forthright he was, how practical and realistic he was, and yet how at times, his passionate nature came through (joining the Confederate army at the end, for example).Side characters, such as Miss Pittypat, Mammy, Dilcey, Pork, Uncle Peter, Mrs. Meade, Belle Watling, and more, jumped out at me. They felt like real people, people influenced by dreams, desires, and feelings. Probably one of the sweetest moments was when Dr. and Mrs. Meade were talking and she mentioned she would rather him be at Belle's than dead. Given what Mrs. Meade had been through, what she held dear, it was particularly poignant.I could go on endlessly about the amazing life lessons and themes and symbols in the book. Quotes about the status of women at the time, about changing with the changing times, about strength of character, about being who you are, and about what is really important in life abound in this book. Most of the ones that really touched me may be found on my profile page, though the whole book is brimming with it.As this deals with the South during the Civil War, there is much talk of slavery; one of the reasons, I believe, it has been so frequently placed on the Banned Books list. Some people believe that it shows slavery in a favorable light, that blacks were/are children that need to be tended by whites. My opinion is this: it shows how many white Southern plantation owners viewed slaves. Not all slave owners were Mr. Simon Legree of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Conversely, not all slave owners are like the O'Hara's. Yes, there are a lot of black stereotypes (Mammy, Prissy, etc.), but this is a snapshot into the past. You can't take this book and try to force modern views of civil rights and racism into it. However, I do believe it makes a brilliant discussion piece: comparing Scarlett and other Southern whites' views of blacks with other accounts (such as Uncle Tom's Cabin or the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn).All in all, this is a brilliant book, made more excellent by the narrator, who deftly interprets the Southern dialect and accents for the listener. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was heart-broken, but inspired, when it ended. I highly recommend, even to those, like me, who aren't big into historical fiction.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"If you think this is chick lit, think again. Its thousand pages are so insightful a portrait, almost an expos&eacute;, of Cavalier society that I wonder at the book's popularity in the old Confederacy. It also sustains the lovely device of delivering the author's commentary through a pair of reverse-image channels, Ashley Wilkes and Rhett Butler, twins in their perceptions of the South but opposites in appearance and manner. The amazingly shallow Scarlett O'Hara carries on without quite noticing Ashley's and Rhett's joint narrative, flattering the reader's ability to see what she doesn't.Mitchell's portrayal of the races is as offensive as reality, which is saying a lot. Since we would rather that things had not been so and as we try to make them better it's useful having a baseline document like this, even though it can't properly imagine black slavery from the inside.About the last third of this long book changes tone as the author seems unable to maintain the same novelistic approach to Reconstruction as she did to the war. Mitchell's outrage boils over and the prose becomes somewhat expository.One cannot help being impressed by the continuation of that outrage for so many decades past the 1860s and 1870s. It prompts curiosity to learn more. Remember that Abraham Lincoln broke with the Republican Party late in his first term over post-war policy toward the South. As the GOP became the party of the Army (which it remains) it adopted a hard line that Lincoln rejected. Instead, Lincoln chose a southern (but anti-secessionist) Democrat as his running mate in 1864 under a \\"National Union Party\\" banner.What would it have meant, to blacks and whites, if Lincoln had been able to impose his own post-war policy? (And has any American ever faced decisions as awesome and consequential as did Abraham Lincoln?)Yet for all the book's historical and social interest in the end you can't around its marvelous sequence of set-pieces. Consider: Scarlett the pampered 19-year-old driving a dying mule and buckboard through the night and the following day amid the terrors of war with the lives of Melanie and her new-born constantly in the balance, only to emerge into her childhood world made desolate, her neighbors burnt out of their homes, her mother dead and her father helpless, her sisters ghostly from disease, broken soldiers roaming the land, and nothing to eat anywhere. How many of us can even grasp the idea of famine in an isolated rural area? Goodness gracious!Gone with the Wind leaves many images that will endure."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"If you loved the movie, you'll love the book.

Every time it is read, I find something missed previously. And every time I read it, it means something different to me. It has motivated me to read other books about that era of time and so I have learned a lot about the Civil War era and how important and significant it was for our country's history. I don't feel that the main thrust of the book was romance, but as in most lives, romance occurs some time, and the people of this novel also find some romance. Scarlett moves from one phase of life to the next with a realists mind except when it comes to Ashley Wilkes.All in all, it is a long book, but one that you won't forget."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is a classic. One that I believe all southern women should read and pass down to their daughters. It is a story of love, loss, and an age in which we could never fully understand. That being said, this version's printing is not the best. On nearly every page, there are words or letters that are not fully printed. The hardcover, binding, and dust cover are in wonderful shape. The packaging and delivery, too, were outstanding. The only drawback I see is the printing not being 100% clear on each page.

I didn't know enough to be offended by Mitchell's whitewash of slavery. I hated Melanie and Ashley, and I loved Scarlett and Rhett, even though I thought Scarlett was some kind of a moron to have the hots for Ashley. When I became a novelist, I realized that my love/hate experience with the characters demonstrated just how crafty Mitchell had been in creating her characters because by then I'd met a bunch of readers who loved Melanie/Ashley and hated Scarlett/Rhett. Something for everyone? You betcha. And her \\"I'll think about that tomorrow\\" ending was also a brilliant move, equally satisfying to readers who want Scarlett to get Rhett back and those who don't."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I have read GWTW many times and have always longed for an adequate recording of this book. So, when I saw this book on CD at the library I checked it out. What a disappointment!I was so sure that a company with the stature of Recorded Books would select only the best narrator. This should have been given to Flo Gibson--someone with the vocal and acting chops to really do justice to both the narative and character portrayal.Just because someone can act well, it doesn't necessarily follow that she will be a great reader. This actor does, in all justice a fairly good job with Scarlett. However, her pacing and phrasing during the narrative portions was mediocre at best and GWTW has a lot of narrative. Secondary characters are not treated with much differentiation of vocal dynamics, expression or seemingly thought about character. The phrasing was particularly poor and down right irritating at times. It sounded as if this reader gave no preparation to some passages and sat down with the book to read aloud passages that she was seeing for the first time. I am really suprised that the editiors let this pass into publication.The only reason I gave it two stars is because the reader does an adequate job with Scarlett and seems to get the accent dead on. \\"Reading\\" this performance was so tedious that I did not finish the book. I certainly would not buy this performance.

It was showing at the Las Vegas Cinerama next to the old Bonanza Hotel. It took me a couple weeks to read this book, but I really enjoyed it. Mitchell's depiction of the South after Civil War was very accurate as some of my family was from Arkansas and Mississippi so I have some idea of what that mindset was. This is a book that I will probably read i again sometime. I also found that ordering a used book through other dealers via Amazon was very effective and very easy. I will certainly use this service again."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"My sister recommended this book to me, saying that \\"it was the best book she has ever read\\". I knew that this book was amazing, judging from what my family has told me for so long, but I didn't want to read it for one reason that reason being, \\"the book is over 1000 pages!!!\\" So it's been lying on my shelf for more than a few years until I finally decided to read it. It took me 2 weeks to read (whereas it took my sister 5 days) it and boy, did I have an amazing time reading about Scarlett, her family, Tara, Captain Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes, and every body. I especially enjoyed the Southerners points of view about slavery. After readin historical books, all from the Union's point of view, I realized that I've been missing out on a lot of info on the Civil War. I've always thought that Southerners treated their slaves with cruelty, based on what I've read from other histocial fiction books, but after reading this one, I found out that slavery wasn't all about whippings, beatings, and any other kind is mismanagement.Scarlett has to be my favorite character. She is headstrong and stubborn, yes, but she fights for what she believes in and does everything to save Tara, even if it meant hurting family members. This books was dramatic, however, such as whatever someone gained, someone else loses something that is very dear to them but I guess that adds more \\"zest\\" to the whole story.This is, \\"the best book I have ever read in my life\\". Well at least in my 14 years of living. If you have the slightest interest in reading this wonderful, enchanting classic, go ahead. I did and I don't regret it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Wonderful story!!

Crisp pages, tight binding, and that \\"old musty book\\" smell well all love. Couldn't be more happy with the service and speed of delivery. Love it!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I remember going to the old Orpheum Theater with my mother and my best friend to see \\"Gone With the Wind\\" 'in the summer of 1969. I was so excited to see my first grown up film. I can see the maroon curtains unveiling the movie screen as the lights dimmed. Not a sound could be heard, but the opening strains of music and there was Tara! I was smitten. Laura and I sat through the second showing too. Exhausted, but roiled up was I when I got home. On my lonely supper plate laid my very first copy of Margaret Mitchell's GONE WITH THE WIND! Needless to say, I wolfed down supper and went to my room and began reading the book that I've had a love affair with since that summer day.With each reading I notice something I've missed in prior readings. I still find Slavery to be the abomination as it has always been. And it must have been harder to read about a mere 75 years after the end of the Civil War in 1936 when GONE WITH THE WIND was first published. I'm not surprised that this epic historical novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. Mitchell has created a multitude cast of characters, giving each their own distinct voice. The reader can tell the difference between Pork, Mammy, Prissy, and Uncle Peter and that is credit to Mitchell. But even minor characters sound different. Tara, Twelve Oaks, and Atlanta also become fascinating characters too. As Tara represents the ability to change as the new South rises in defeat of its old genteel feudal life style where every man, women, and child are free to live as they want. Twelve Oaks reflects the Old South that is forever torn asunder. It is Ashley's South. He doesn't fit in with the change. He and Melanie are perfect for each other. She understands him and the dream that was the Old South.Rhett Butler hates that Old South because it tossed him out and turned its back on him. His bitterness fuels his pleasure as he sees its demise as Atlanta burns and his pockets are full of Gold. He is the most transformed character in GONE WITH THE WIND. I'd never observed his transformation as I did in this reading. No wonder the 35 year old fell for the fiery self willed 16 year old Scarlett O'Hara. Not only is she spirited, she possess a dogged determination of those who seem to get their way most of the time. It is Scarlett whom Aunt Pitty and Melanie feel safe in the absence of a man in their Atlanta household. It is Scarlett who makes sure her kith and kin are safe, housed, and fed. She tells us that she'll never be hungry again no matter if she has to cheat, steal, or commit murder. So it's no surprise that she marries for convenience after she had married to make Ashley miserable and silence wagging tongues at Twelve Oaks. I felt sorry for her boys; she really was a mother only to her precious Bonnie. And how on Earth could she have loved a wuss like Ashley Wilkes when she had a grown man who loved her? I'd like to think that Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler got her man back after she returns to Tara. The land always gives her strength and regenerates her spirits. But I wonder if she realized too late that she loved Rhett and really belonged with him? Well after all, tomorrow is another day."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I bought it for my kindle, because its summer and there will probably never be a better beach read or a better book ever anyway. Scarlett still steals your breath with her personality and Rhett still makes you swoon and this is still the best book I ever read."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"When I began this book, I began something that I didn't know how to end. I began a journey, and as this journey came to a close, I nearly came unravelled at the seams. I'm serious. This book is ruining my life a little bit right now, and I'm just not sure what my refractory period is after finishing a truly, devastatingly good novel that also breaks my heart.I will say this as a foreward to a very long and very emotional review- this book is quite problematic for me and I'm sure for many others as well. I am a girl born and raised in the North and there are some things, even fictional things, that I am uncomfortable with. That's just who I am. I absolutely applaud Mitchell on this masterpiece, but I also raise an eyebrow at her. There are offensive things in this book, mind you, and it takes awhile to get past them.We all know the basics of this 1,000 page Bildungsroman. Scarlett O'Hara, sixteen years old, the charming Southern Belle on her plantation Tara, blissfully ignorant and delightfully simple, devoted to her one true love, Ashley Wilkes, while courting several other \\"beaux\\" and enjoying her sweet life. Then the war comes, and then Ashley marries, then Rhett Butler appears, and suddenly, the novel begins, and I was swept away by its tide so fast I didn't know what hit me.My first reaction to Scarlett was overwhelmingly negative, which I'm sure is the common reaction. She is just so overwhelmingly simple. She cannot grasp scarcasm or irony or metaphor, she hates books, and she detests any talk of politics. And she prefers the chaste and simpering affection of men to any kind of female companionship, save for the love of her precious and doting mother Ellen. And for some unfathomable reason, she is absolutely devoted to Ashley Wilkes, a sappy pretty boy who is already engaged to be married. Scarlett is the protagonist I usually shut the book for. I don't identify with her, nor did I originally want to. She was cute, sure, and I was swept away by her first dance with Rhett, but I still didn't like her. Then, about 200 pages in, she becomes a heroine.I will always consider Scarlett O'Hara one of the bravest women I've ever read. She is strong, she is willful, and she does what needs to be done, no matter how unsuited she is for the job. When she had to help Melanie Wilkes give birth, sweet little Melanie whom Scarlett hated with fire, amidst burning Atlanta, I was on the edge of my seat. When she was abandoned by Rhett and had to fend for herself, Melanie, the baby, and her child, she just fought, and she survived. And I felt like there was hope for the rest of the story.Not only was Scarlett a heroine, she was a clever one. She married her second husband for money and used that money to make more money for herself, while presenting herself in \\"unladylike\\" ways, such as -gasp- leaving the house while pregnant! Quelle horreur! I loved this part because it wasn't just cheesy romance or adventure, it was relevant and interesting and very smart. Scarlett was blossoming, maybe not to others as much as she as to me. She was beginning to grow so multi-faceted. Now I have this strong, brave, brilliant woman, and what does she do? She breaks my little heart. All because of Rhett Butler.Rhett Butler was a conflicting character for me. To most women, he's a god. He's manly, rough, and a little dirty, but he also tries to know what women want and he loves hard and deep. But he's kind of a jerk and I go back and forth between loving and hating him. He doesn't take Scarlett seriously and he seems to think too highly of her reasoning skills, and I don't think those two ever really knew each other at all. Not to mention the fact that he probably raped her. He does redeem himself at the end, at least he mostly does, and then my heart ached so bad and I wanted things to be different so badly. I felt like I was the one who'd lost my chance. I was the one who didn't get my love, not Scarlett or Rhett. I hurt for them, for the evils they saw, for the harshness they lived, for the children and friends and family they lost. I was brought close to them and then I was torn apart. Mitchell made me love what could have been, and then when it wasn't, it was a loss that I am still recovering from.There are so many characters you fall in love with in this novel. Scarlett is probably one of the most multi-faceted characters I've ever read, and I think I love her. She is cold, powerful, manipulative, spiteful, delusional, childish, and shameless, but she is also hardworking, stubborn, idealistic, charming, hopeful, sensical, practical, and intensely brave. She grows in some ways and stays the same in others. She knows how to get what she wants and she knows how to stand up for herself, but when she learns a lesson, she learns it too late, and I just want to shake her. She is infuriating, but she is also infuriatingly real, and I will never forget her.Melanie is another character I will never forget. Her sheer devotion and faith and loyalty to Scarlett is achingly bittersweet, since she is used like Scarlett's puppet, but the scene of her death killed me. That is the only time Scarlett states her outward affection for Melanie and it was perfect. The bond they had was really interesting. I loved Will Benteen and Aunt Pitty and little Bonnie Butler.Now let me discuss why I am hesitant to discuss this novel with everyone. \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is unfathomably racist. I don't care if it was set in a time period. I don't care if it was the environment or the social commentary or even if Margaret Mitchell was racist or not, the language and characterization of the black slaves in Georgia is REALLY offensive. Like Alice Walker has said, white people use the altered way of writing a black person's speech to highlight that they truly know better and that it only makes the black characters look silly and uneducated. In novels with British characters, we don't use different spellings or exaggerated syntax. I HATE when white writers do that. It is embarrassing. I don't like it when people say that this novel was telling the story of the \\"real south\\", because it doesn't matter if it is real or not, it doesn't need to be glamorized. I'm glad Mammy is such a devoted person. I'm glad Pork is so proud of himself. But I hate that it is somehow attached to their status as slaves.Also, I'm pretty sure Rhett raped Scarlett. She ended up melting into him and enjoying his attention, but he would've done it whether she melted or not. I know that and I think Mitchell knew that. It makes it hard to love Rhett, but then again, there isn't an unconflicted character in this novel.Is this book problematic? Oh, yes. I completely understand the criticism and I won't hesitate to criticize it myself. But sometimes, problematic literature is also beautiful, and well-written, and emotional, and touching. This is one of those books. I will never forget this story. I am changed by it. I was reading it last night and when I read the part after Scarlett fell down the stairs and she calls for Melly but Melly can't come because Rhett is crying in her lap, I started crying. I really was crying because it was too much, and this is what the book does to your life when you set out on the journey to read it. Take the journey but pack a lot of provisions, and keep your mind open but sharpened, and let yourself enjoy it while still taking the time to think and reflect.Now, because I just have to- The girl I was before I read \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is truly gone with the wind."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I read Gone with the Wind many years ago, so it was a pleasure to read it again. I only gave it 4 stars because I almost always wanted to have a \\"talk\\" with Scarlett. I am so glad she \\"grew up\\" finally at the end... a little too late, but better late than never. I loved the history that Mitchell sprinkles through the book. I also enjoyed seeing how some things never change.

Hard to believe because I'm not used to being bombarded with great detail and historical happenings. Not into it really. But this book was hard to put down. It was slow reading because the detail had me visualizing so much that I had to re-read a lot of passages but when I finally got through it, it was well worth the journey. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I first read this book when I was in 8th grade. It was for a reading program. I don't remember how long it took me to read it, but I remember thinking it was the greatest book I ever read. I have often tried to convince my friends to read it, but because of its length, they refuse. Let me tell you, the story of Scarlett and Rhett is one of the best out there. It was beautifully written by Mitchell, her descriptions of the characters are extremely vivid as if you are right there in the book with them. I recommend this book for everyone, whether or not this is your type of book. Every page will draw you closer to it and the life it shows. But ever since I have read this book, I've read it at least 3 more times since then. And it always takes me by surprise and pulls me along with it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"As an author with my first novel in its initial release, I am amazed at my recent rereading of GONE WITH THE WIND. I find it hard to believe (though I've known it forever) that GONE WITH THE WIND was Margaret Mitchell's first novel. She pulled it all together here with strong characters, a remarkable plot, and fabulous writing centered around the crucial event in American history. This novel, we all know the story, has become a foundation of American culture. It deserves to be. Read this novel, or read it again, if you haven't for awhile."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"When I read Margaret Mitchell's classic &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; I was in the eighth grade and as impressionable as a young teen can be. It was my favorite for a long time, and I can still pick it up and reread it without getting bored. A cousin really loves it too, or I thought she did till I learned she loves the movie and had never read the novel. Well! She's read it now, and discovered that not only did Scarlett have other children, she also has ways and feelings you'd never know from the film alone.One example is the maid in the O'Hara household named Mammy. Though she is indeed in the movie, she is a much rounder character in the novel. On her deathbed, Scarlett stays by her side unselfishly, nursing her to the end. Other slave characters are more prominent in the novel also, such as some that move and marry. Vivian Leigh did justice to her role, as did all the others, but still, all pale in comparison to the depths they possess in the book.Screenplays are so different to read than novels that they don't seem to compare either. Sometimes a novel reads so visually that you believe the author had a film version in mind when writing it. One that struck me as such recently was &quot;The Horse Whisperer.&quot;The opening scenes with the girls on horseback, the slow-motion effect of the wreck, all of it, was like watching a movie instead of reading a book. The ability to write this way may be a great talent that most don't possess.What are you thoughts on novels to film? I'd like to know. And, if you've never read your &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; try it today and see what you missed in that favorite of yours."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I love books, and I love history. It seems that this book was a godsend for me! Wars have never interested me, the civil war, of course seemed like a no brainer: Yankees=good, Confederates=bad. But this book has made me realize that both sides suffered. It wasn't a no-brainer...it was difficult for everyone. Girls and boys, Women, Men, everyone! So many people suffered, and were hurt.

This is one of the best books I'v read, along with Little Women. I love reading books about the past. The caracters were very different from most books. They wern't perfect. I also loved how Scarlett could get any man she wanted ,and did, with the exception of Rhett. It had every thing a good book should have."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I have never had the concentration to sit through the movie all in one go - but I found the book, all 1000+ pages of it, compelling. Other reviewers have commented on the amount of detail put into this book, which makes it all the more real. And we are forced to sympathise and feel for characters that behave in what those of us living in the year 2000 would regard as most sexist and racist behaviour. It really gives you some understanding of how people lived and regarded each other at that time, and the different class and race structures which existed, with interesting insights into the interactions between the people who owned plantations and the slaves who worked on them. And of course, we have the character of Scarlett to contend with - one of the most spoiled and most motivated heroines ever described. I wished so much for her to open her eyes and see what a waste of time Ashley was, and how much Rhett loved her, but she is too immature to realise all this. I am debating whether I should read 'Scarlett', the recently written sequel, or just imagine her living her life out with Suellen and Will, her children and her money. A sign of a great book is the way it stays with you long after you've read it, and I often find myself rethinking passages from this book. I would recommend it for anyone."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I'm a 12 year old and a little while ago finished reading GWTW.

Well, after reading this book, now I know: those ornery white people down there are descendents of Scarlett O'Hara and Melanie Wilkes (and all those tough old white ladies, the &quot;old cats,&quot; as Scarlett calls them) and by God they just ain't never gonna FORGET! Every American (especially all you Yankees) should read this book for a better understanding of the point of view of rich white Southerners during and after the Civil War. (You still won't think they were RIGHT, by the way, but you'll understand them.) Plus, Scarlett O'Hara is a total piece of work. You've gotta get a load of all the stuff she's up to! This is a chick who could rule the freakin' world!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Selfish, sought after, sixteen-year-old Katie \\"Scarlett\\" O'Hara has everything a Southern Belle could want as the story begins in April of 1861: a loving family; a plethora of attentive suitors, and a lovely home on a plantation situated 25 miles from Atlanta, Georgia, maintained by the family's (p 279) hundred slaves. She soon learns that the primary object of her affections, Ashley Wilkes, is to about to announce his engagement. And before you know it, she has professed her love to one man, encountered another (Rhett Butler) for the first time, become engaged, married, pregnant and widowed. Meanwhile, most of the local males have become Confederate soldiers, battling on the side of the South in the Civil War. As the locals mourn their dead and the battles rage on, Scarlett chooses to return to Tara. After surviving a harrowing journey, she learns the fate of her family and home, and takes on roles of caregiver, operations manager, and manual laborer for the plantation along with its remaining inhabitants. She marries, again with ulterior motives, and moves to Atlanta, where her behavior as sole businesswoman starts tongues wagging. One wonders, will she ever find love?When the story ends, twelve years later, the war is over and many of her loved ones have passed. While she learns a few things about friendship, family, love, and loss, some things never change, like her feelings (contempt and disdain) about slaves and beliefs about slavery (better for them than their freedom). With its racist rhetoric, negative stereotypes, and inflammatory words for blacks (the \\"n\\" word alone appears ninety times), it is a lesson on the incomprehensible capacity of humans to justify their infliction of suffering on others and will likely cause many readers to squirm. But it is also a masterful epic on life and love in the South during the Civil War, with great character development and spectacular writing (including some neat old, odd words) which make it a worthy read from start to 700-plus page finish."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Some of the reviews are long but I will keep this short.

I bought my mother and sister-in-law a copy because I thought they should read it too (just once). Read it and see for yourself."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I first read this novel the summer I was seventeen. It is a novel that has been handed down in my family for three generations -- and now I know why.Scarlett O'Hara is a spoilt flirtacious southern belle on her father's rich plantation. All the other girls in the county hate and depise her because she has a way of getting her charming claws into their men -- ALL of the men, that is, except \\"the long suffering Mr. Wilkes.\\"Ashley Wilkes is young, blonde, handsome -- and taken. He is destined to marry Melony Hamilton -- the only woman in the county besides Scarlett's mother who doesn't depise her (ironically enough).Scarlett convinces herself she is in love with Ashley Wilkes, but the truth is she only wants him for the simple reason that she can not have him. Her want becomes an obsession that spans over the next four years of the Civil War and even after. Ashley turns her down in more than one entertaining love scene, one of which is over heard by none other than the the famous Rhett Butler.Rhett Butler is smitten by Scarlett the moment he first sees her because he recognizes in her the same qualities he values in himself: he is a social outcast without clean spot on his reputation. According to the South's unwritten social laws, he is not a gentleman but a scallywag and a cad because he refused to marry a girl he'd taken out without a chaperon. But Rhett is fearless and defiant when it comes to social rules and lives a comfortable life safely outside of \\"good\\" Southern society which means he openly associates with prostitues and therefore, knows about women's undergarments (something a man is supposed to pretend not to know about).But Rhett's sudden and adrent spark of love for Scarlett is doused somewhat when he learns of Scarlett's apparent love for Ashley Wilkes. He then spends the greater part of the novel fruitlessly pursuing Scarlett and trying to make her forget about Ashley. He married her, saying with a laugh that he \\"can't wait all his life to catch her between husbands.\\" But Rhett soon finds after the birth of their first child that married life with Scarlett is hell. He can't make love to Scarlett knowing that she's sighing for Ashley Wilkes, and he can't bear to sit across from her at supper anymore knowing that she wants Ashley there. And when Scarlett turns Rhett from her bed it hurts him so that he's driven to mad drinking.And though Scarlett moons after Ashley and fantasizes about him, she slowly but surely falls in love with Rhett. But here's the twist: once Scarlett realizes her love for Rhett and runs to him to proclaim it, she finds that Rhett's deathless love has, well, died, and that he just doesn't \\"give a damn\\" anymore.This is probably my favorite part of the movie version. I love when Scarlett runs through the mist to find Rhett at home, sitting listlessly before the window with an open suit case on the bed. I must've watched the ending more times than the rest of the movie put together. But nothing moves me more than Scarlett and Rhett's last parting words:\\"Rhett! If you go, where shall I go, what shall I do?\\"\\"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\\""},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"THIS IS MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE NOVEL!! I don't care if I sound obsessed; I AM! Sure, I could offer the same criticism that others give (Mitchell was racist, Scarlett was a brat, the ending stunk), but regardless. I'm looking at the bigger picture here. WHAT A SAGA.Scarlett--though I admit, she was a witch sometimes---is truly admirable. She personifies the concepts of tenacity and perseverence, refusing to give up. I look up to her for being fierce, strong, opinionated, and a feminist. She was brave and ardent, and I love her.I forgive Mitchell for being racist in her writings, because she was most accurately portraying that time period. Honestly, I forgive any fault of the book, it was just so good!The conclusion...eh. I would have ended it at the end of the second-to-last chapter. But I'm not the author, I have no room to talk. She did a brilliant job illustrating the lives of members of the Confederacy, so lets give her proper credit and not denounce her.What else is there to say? These online reviews couldn't encompass it all, BY FAR. The novel was just delicious. I ate it all in less than two months' time (and it's a hearty meal, believe me). It surpasses the movie in my opinion, but both are exquisite masterpieces.

Those immortal words are etched into the brains of generations. With those words come the acclaim and popularity it earned. To me, it was nothing more than a book. The swriting style of Margaret Mitchell is wonderful and I think that she brings authenticity to her work. That and only that is why i gave it four stars. Many of my female peers fell in love with the book. Maybe it was meant to be a feminine novel, not written for the eyes of a young man such as myself. It took me longer than most books to read and when I had finished it it left me with no sense of awe or despair at not having a decent sequel(which I am told is terrible). No, it left my with only one thought &quot;I wonder if I wasted my time.&quot;The story follows the majority of the life of Scarlett O' Hara, a ruthless southern belle, whose dellusions of love lead her to keep her foothold in the world. During her travels (or should I say misadventures?), she comes across a man named Rhett Butler. Rhett is a smart, dark, and deceptive character who flaunts his wealth and charm. He would have to be my favourite character because, as is so uncommon tday in literature, his character was believable and dark. His openness with his shortcomings and his lifestyle give him a sense of nonchalance that is a credit to Mitchell's style. However this is where my enjoyment stopped. The story seemed to drag unnecessarily and I did not speed through it as I thought I would when i heard how &quot;wonderful&quot; it was. The storyline was relatively simple and easy to understand, but it just does not gain my utmost appreciation as a classic in literature."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is the most absolutely wonderful book that was ever written!

Yeah for the Confederacy!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With The Wind gives whoever reads it a very good story but it also teaches you a lot about the Civil War. The story starts at the beginning of the Civil War and it follows the life of Scarlett O'Hara for around 12 years. She is 16 at the beginning of the book.For about ten years of her life she thinks she loves Ashley Wilkes, only to realize that she had never loved Ashely and had tricked herself into thinking she did. At the beginning she tries to get Ashley to marry her instead of his fiance, when he doesn't, she marries Charles Hamilton.Throughout the story she and everyone around her loses everything that was dear to them. Almost everyone lost immediate family members in the war and Scarlett's mother , Ellen died from a fever and her father died after being crazy following Ellen's death. Scarlett struggled for a long time trying to keep her plantation, Tara, together. Scarlett and her family nearly starve for a long time until a man named Will helped them with the farming.Then, Scarlett married her sister's fiance for his money. He died a short while after. The night after his death, Rhett Butler, a man that the town hates because he was a scalawag, asked Scarlett to marry him. After a while she said yes. Within a few years, Scarlett gives birth to a baby girl and Rhett Butler loves her more than anything else. Scarlett loves her, but she never shows it, so Rhett raised Bonnie one his own. Everything is fine until it takes a turn for the worse. Bonnie dies and Melanie Wilkes, Ashley's wife dies. It was then that Scarlett realized how much she loved Melanie and it was then that she finally got her life straightened out.Overall, I think that Gone With The Wind is and excellent book.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With The Wind the American classic is a story of love and war in the 1860's. The main character Scarlett O'Hara was a bold women who fought the hardships of the war and also putting up with the man who infuriated her the most Rhett Butler. Rhett Butler was a rich man from Charleston who fell in love with Scarlett during the war. He also had a opinion about everything which Scarlett hated because she was very hot tempered. An incident in the book that made Scarlett my favorite character and also why I like the book so much was when Rhett Butler left her, Mammy and Melanie in the middle of the road when they were going back to Tara from Atlanta.The reason I liked this part so much was she didn't give up and she told Rhett how she felt and how she hated him for doing that. In those days girls really couldn't say their opinions but she did it any ways and showed she was strong . She was very determind to get what she wanted and she did. I really liked this book for many reasons. It gave you a description of how the war really was and it made you realize what they went through when they fought the war. Another reason I liked the book was the characters. Scarlett was a good example because she was a very lively character.Also Rhett Butler he was very good because he was very mysterious and you never knew what he would do next. I would recommend this book to people of all ages. The reason i think this is because it is a great love story and it gives you a understanding of how the war was really . I would defitnetly read this book again."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is truly a part of my soul...it's my favorite & I absolutely love it!

The characters are compelling and believable, the plot and setting are exciting, and the language is just flowery enough to set off the book nicely. Scarlett is a vivacious character, and although I don't really respect or admire her I think she has a monolithic personality. I am so different from her that I find her reactions to the various situations she encounters highly entertaining. My favorite character is Melanie, because she is so like me. I can believe what she says and does and understand her because I would do the same thing usually. Rhett Butler gets on my nerves, though I think he's supposed to. He switches between acting gentlemanly and being a scoundrel. He doesn't know how to treat a lady-- or rather, a woman who isn't exactly a lady. The other characters I don't pay as much attention to, but I enjoy reading about every one of them. One of my first reactions to this book was that it really is perfect for a movie. Some of the descriptions paint a detailed and beautiful picture in my mind, and I read parts of them over and over.

I really felt like I was there, no, not even- I felt like I was her. I could understand what she thought, and would say, even if i thought she was a horribly selfish, blind little fool. The only real merits she had was being able to stick to something and get it, and to survive awful things. I was embarrassed for her,I could see the love that Rhett had held out to her, and wished I could tell her before she ruined the lives of everyone around her, not only herself. I felt the love that Melly had for her, and I wished I could be like Melly. The first 5 times I read it,in 7th grade, I cried really hard. Now, in 9th grade, I'm still it's biggest fan. My friends all think I'm obsessed, and maybe I am, but I love this book!!. Alexandra Ripley never should have tried to write a sequel, because it didn't match the facts, or what we knew of the characters. Scarlett may have chased after Rhett, without a doubt that's what she'd do, but she wouldn't go and have affairs with people, and Rhett wouldn't have married Anne. Anyway, what I'm trying to say, is that this is the best book, anyone who hasn't read it is missing out, and anyone who didn't like it is crazy!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is the best , I live in the south and I get very upset when I hear people say ,oh that book just show's what slavery was all about .

A few days later, I closed the book on the last page, and all I felt was letdown. This is perhaps the greatest danger to succumbing to hype.Gone with the Wind is interesting and certainly very readable (I've read it several times since). Scarlett O'Hara is like Becky Sharp, mostly unlikeable, but still admirable for her gutsiness.While reading the book, it began to dawn on me that most of the gush over Gone with the Wind that I'd heard was about the movie rather than the book itself. I went to see the movie. I was appalled; the casting of the four main characters just didn't seem to fit. I already had a fixed notion in my mind of what the characters were like so probably no actors could meet my expectations.

The character development and descriptions are very good, and Mitchell does a good job of describing the motives that drive the characters. I also appreciated the fact that Mitchell did not write a typical &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending. However, I find it disturbing that very few reviewers noticed or commented on the extreme racism in the book. If you believe Mitchell's description of the KKK, you would never know that this was a racist, terrorist organization (and still is). Also, according to Mitchell, only &quot;trashy&quot; black people wanted freedom; the &quot;quality&quot; black people wanted to remain slaves!! These are obviously Mitchell's views of black people, and not just the characters' views. Mitchell took pains to write that not all Yankees were bad and that many were ashamed of the corrupt reconstructionist government they had to uphold. In a biography of Mitchell's life, she is described as refusing to attend a class with a black student who has been admitted to her college. I only hope that most readers noted her obviously racist views and realize that slavery was not as she described it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"It takes you through the story of a girl that has everything and wants just what she can't have, and through the story of how her world fell around her. About Scarlett and her men, but never having her one love"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone with the Wind's anti-hero is captivating and complex. Scarlett is complex in her own mind, tormented about what she wants vs what's right to do, while she fights to survive during and after the Civil War. She is selfish and aware of it. Adding to the complexity of Scarlett, is her kindness that she affords others despite her selfish desire. While she is the daughter of a slave holder, she remains loyal to caring for her former slaves after the war and has a developed relationship with Mammy. Unfortunately, the social thread of America, and much of the world from Bible days going forward, thought nothing wrong of owning slaves. However, that social paradigm shifts as the story continues. Scarlett might be from a wealthy family, but she is still a female that bucks societal trends and owns and operates business. On occasion she is outright ruthless with men. In the end of the book she is \\"punished\\" for her misdeeds. However, her husband is not.It surprises me that many people compare GWTW to Birth of a Nation. The problem is we are viewing GWTW as if it can be held to today's value system. It does not. It cannot. It's not a book about human unity or human dignity. It's a book about surviving crisis and how some American's got through a war that killed 12% of the US population. In the 1920s and 30s the KKK was very strong in the South and perpetuated stories about black attacks on whites and many political groups argued that blacks were not fit for society. Using genteel approaches GWTW presents strong women who helped the south survive the war, it also showed blacks as \\"southerners\\" and caring people (Scarlett's life is saved at least twice by a black character in the book), it also suggests that war is not a wise solution. Scarlett gets away with voicing unpopular opinions \\"war is a waste of time\\", \\"the south should just free the slaves\\", \\"why should women always stay quiet around men?\\" because she's portrayed as an anti-hero. If she were a do-gooder she might come off differently. Pretend she had Melanie's \\"kind nature\\" combined with her practical and self serving criticism of \\"states rights, sexism, & war\\", she would be seen by many readers in the 1930s as almost being an abolitionist sympathizer. The book would have failed at that point in delivering it's message about survival. The message would be lost. Furthermore, it wouldn't express what many southerners already felt, a kinship and love of the land. When you read the last paragraph of the book you get a picture of what prevails in the south, the love of the earth, southern life, quiet country evenings and the simple relationship of Scarlett and Mammy (the only person she has left: her father and mother died, her friend Melanie died, daughter died and her husband left). Scarlett also realizes too late that she is in love with Rhett and losses him, just as the South realized too late that \\"states rights\\" cost them what they loved the most."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"GWTW, the great American epic, certainly earns its reputation by being a big sweeping novel of the collapse and rebuilding of the American south. Mitchell's research about the many battles in and around Atlanta is evident, as is her knowledge of Southern plantation and urban life. But despite all of her research, her personal bias is evident and clouds her recounting of history. Mitchell is a product of her times, Southern born and bred 70 years after the civil war. She believes that slavery was not so bad, and the slaves were treated like family and were protected and cared for. Her descriptions of free slaves in Atlanta makes one cringe, and she devotes half of chapter 37 to this narrative with quotes like, \\"There they conducted themselves as creatures of small intelligence might naturally do. Like monkeys or small children turned loose among treasured objects...\\" Another of her characters, Big Sam, a former slave on Tara has tried freedom and doesn't like it and is trying to make his way back to Tara where he knows he will be cared for again. Nowhere in the book does Mitchell make reference to the hard and inhumane lives slaves lived, and the fact that they were property with no rights or lives they could call their own. She even tries to justify the existence of the KKK, saying that the free blacks were running so amuck over of the whites that the Southern men, who had been stripped of their rights by the Yankees, had to do something to avenge these wrongs.Putting aside all of Mitchell's personal bias about slavery, I did enjoy this book and ultimately felt it was a many layered love story between Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, and Ashley, all intertwined in matters of the heart. Scarlett, the central character and most interesting by far, is a modern woman ahead of her time. She is outspoken, strong-willed and a shrewd business woman. She does whatever it takes to get what she wants in affairs of business and the heart. She is a fully developed character with a range of emotions from pride and pettiness to compassion and understanding (although she tends to lean more toward the former emotions). At times we thoroughly dislike her, others we can relate to her, sometimes we pity her and occasionally we even cheer for her. Mitchell also spends time developing her other major characters, Rhett, Melanie and Ashley, and by the end we feel as if we really know all of them.Despite its 1,000 pages or 41 hours on audio cd, which I listened to, I never got bored, and in fact didn't want to end. The story always moved right along. Someone was always dying, getting married, having a baby, going to or planning a party, plotting, scheming, or getting into or out of trouble. It is melodrama at its best and I am so glad I actually read it instead of just seeing the abridged story in the form of the movie."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"wow. loved it. i will definitley be reading this book again and again. i always loved the movie but the book is simply amazing. such complex and interesting characters. its hard to believe the age of the book the style of writing seems ahead of its time. sorry for typos, on my kindle."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I read this book the first time at the age of 13 and 10 years later I love it as much now as i did then. This story is an emotional rollercoaster that will make you hang onto every word. The characters are vibrant, the settings rich, and the tale a timeless one. The ultimate love-hate relationship story."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"he falls for a bad woman and thinks that she will turn good for him. But she does not. The latent goodness that he imagines never comes out. He does not mind her bad qualities and in fact admires them. But he does not want them applied to him, at least not all the time. He thinks she can separate them out and give him her good qualities, and just enough badness to make the relationship exciting. It does not work. It works only in romance novels, where the heroine falls for a rotter who is nice to her only while still remaining \\"difficult\\" but not too much. In this case, where the woman is the bad one (unusual), the author resisted the temptation to give us the happy ending.Rhett likes Scarlett both in spite of and because she is selfish, thoughtless, greedy, a bad mother, shallow, narrowminded, often ignorant and not wanting to learn anything, and lacking in self knowledge. She is also hypocritical, which is actually one of her good qualities. At least she acknowledges that there is something there in the world that is better than her, values superior to hers, characters better than hers, that she should at least pay lip service to. And it's not just lip service. She feels guilt and remorse. She wishes she was better. Let's not be too hard on hypocrisy. It keeps people from worse sins and it protects the innocent.What are her other good qualities? Determination, persistence, courage, shrewdness, resourcefulness, and loyalty to her family, and some notion of decency that keeps her from more seriously bad conduct.Rhett likes her. He finds her fascinating. He sees where she is vulnerable and loves her for that, too. He just wants that she would love him. But for her to do that she has to be a different person. Rhett falls into a classic trap, that the bad person will become good for the one that loves him. Scarlett is too foolish to realize what Rhett offers her, how valuable it is. One problem she has is not wanting to submit. He is willing to submit himself to the loved one, but she is not. She does not want to become dependent on anyone, seeing it as weakness. She is afraid of losing power. He will risk it but she won't.With Ashley, she will be the strong one. So she is not scared of Ashley. With Rhett, he is strong too. And he knows her and can see through her. That scares her. She can't put on airs with him. But Rhett although he teases her does not want to degrade her or change her, except to the extent she will love him. He is willing for her to go her own way. He just wants some honesty from her, so they can be comfortable together and have consensus, so they can get along day to day. He seeks it from the wrong person, however, because Scarlett is not honest about him, herself, or Ashley or Melanie. Rhett fails to see that a person like that cannot be honest with him either.Even at the end when she realizes it has been Rhett all along she still does not get it. She makes a contemptuous remark about Ashley. Rhett corrects her right away. No, he says, Ashley is not contemptible. Rhett is intelligent. He can respect things he does not share in or agree with. He can see the value of Ashley, though they are totally different characters. Scarlett, once she no longer is in love with Ashley, which she never really was, now despises him. She goes in the total opposite direction. That is typical of her and shows a small mind. It also shows that she never knew anything about Ashley. Rhett has a code of honor. Scarlett has no honor.Yet, we like her.If she was just a little more open minded she and Rhett would make a fine pair. If she could see Rhett for what he is, a ruthless harsh man with a code of honor and much kindness in him that he would lavish on her if given a chance. But she does not until it is too late and he has had it with her, with trying to give her love that she never would accept.It's one of the great love stories and the main reason, I believe, the book is still read.The other reason is the description of the old south and the reconstruction era. While I don't agree with all of the author's values, her writing is masterly. She makes you feel what those characters felt. She makes you sympathetic to people with totally different values from your own, which is no mean feat. The reader sees that the characters are wrong about slavery and race and the southern lifestyle, yet feels pity for them. The reader does not root for them to win, yet hopes that things will turn out well for them. When Rhett takes pains to ensure that his child will be accepted by the \\"right\\" kind of people, the old guard, you feel the same as he does, although you know that it is nonsensical. The old guard will die and it is well that it is so. But you admire Rhett for what he is doing. The book is a testament to the power of good writing, the power of art, the power of a good story. The book is compulsively readable. It is a good example of why we think art is dangerous.The author poured her passion into the book, the passion of the defeated south, and it all comes through on the page. Some parts of the book that go on and on about the south's wounds during reconstruction are tedious as well as historically not factual. For instance, it is not true that the freed slaves had all that power. But when she turns to what the characters feel, she makes you view them with sympathy, even love. The feelings in the book are genuine."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"My husband recently bought this copy for me when I showed him the copy I had one my book shelf...

It had been read so many times that the spine was missing, pages were loose, some missing, pages stuck together, but I still kept reading it over and over."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"what I liked about gone with the wind:Lively description of pre- and post-civil war Southerners, mainly former plantation owners, who were left with no slaves and no money but still not surrendering.Scarlett O'Hara's bold way of overcoming the practical difficulties, even though it was sometimes unpleasant. But overall, to me, it was persuasive.Description of Scarlett's personality was really good and consistent. Thoroughly shallow and thorougly immature. (If there is any doctor or medical student in your family, please go and read about chapter of personality disorders in psychology book. I think Scarlett falls under the category of histrionic personality, as far as I can remember.)Other characters are also well pictured and attractive.Using Belle Watling as contrast to Scarlett, and also Melanie as contrast. Maybe Melanie would have made a better heroine.The end. I guess Scarlett cannot deserve an innocent happy end, but it was good to see that she recognized the truth about Ashley and Rhett at last, ironically via Melanie's death.what I hated about it:Justifying racism, especially KKK. Mitchell's point of view was really disturbing, even after making allowances for her as a pre-war Southerner from heart. OK, Scarlett was the heroine and she might have felt and thought that way pretty much. So Mitchell sticked to it.I agree that the significance of Civil War cannot be reduced to only one point, slavery issue, but Mitchell advocated for plantation owners too much.Rhett made peace with Southerners too easily, while with Bonnie. Also too romantically.Overall, it was good reading, but a little too romantic and inaccurate after all. Good mix of history and romance. If it were for only one of them, it would not have made such a hit. Plus, the force of characters. Mitchell did the best job about characters."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Overall Rating: B+Like all books for which I see a movie adaptation first, I feel as though I was somewhat tainted by the movie. The book is similar though there are some discrepancies in the plot. These details (Scarlett O'Hara's other children by Charles Hamilton and Frank Kennedy, Will Benteen's involvement in Tara, etc) were good deletions from the book for the purposes of the movie production but, like all book to movie transformations, the extra details add an enormous amount of depth to the story.The prose is descriptive but, in parts, not as grand as I expected. Again, perhaps this is the taint from the movie but because the film was so beautifully produced, I expected the same feeling of grandeur from the text.Scarlett O'Hara is an incredibly interesting character; she comes off as a heartless and greedy but also shows an immense amount of passion. She isn't a likable character in most aspects but she does inspire a good amount of admiration for overcoming circumstances well beyond her control. Men play only a passing role for the most part; Rhett Butler is probably the most well developed male character but even he is predictable. Melanie Wilkes is the most pleasant surprise, showing more strength of will than was even broached by the movie. This is most certainly a character driven novel as there are long stretches of time in which very little action happens; on the other hand, there is so much to digest in the last few chapters I felt as though I was always a little behind.There are a few sequels/alternate story lines but, honestly, I'm not interested in the least. I enjoyed the story but it didn't inspire the obsession for me that it has for others.I always try to appreciate the context of language and story when I'm reading story set in another time. That being said, I couldn't help but cringe at the blatant racism displayed in a matter-of-fact way in the story. Racial epithets are frequent throughout the book and the ignorance and idiocy of the slaves/former slaves is taken at a given. This isn't to say it isn't an important part of the book as it was the sentiment of the times but, still, a little hard to listen to at times.I would recommend this to anyone who has a great love of the movie or for those who enjoy long, sweeping epics. In audiobook form, its an enjoyable listen but it is quite a slog.Audiobook Details:The reader, Linda Stephens, had a good balance of accents (she even sings the songs included in the book) and voice depth for the male characters. As much as I enjoyed her reading, the length of the book was so long it would have been refreshing to hear a few other voices. The number of characters in the book is small enough that this would have been an excellent cast production.I didn't recognize any of her other work but I would recommend her as a reader if you enjoy obvious voice acting.Run time was 49 hours, 7 minutes.Published By Recorded Books"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is wonderful! In history classes we always heard the Civil War from the North's perspective but this book gives us a glimpse into the South's feelings and the changes undergone there. But my favorite part about this book is the descriptions, the plot, the well-developed characters, the language of the times, and especially Scarlett herself. You won't be sorry you read it!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With the Wind is a classic novel of love and loss. Taking place in a time and place which is, quite literally, &quot;gone with the wind,&quot; it is interesting in both a historical sense and a romantic one. This novel is often called &quot;the greatest love story of all time,&quot; and truthfully at that. There is nothing quite as stirring as the interactions between Rhett and Scarlett. Margaret Mitchell's classic writing and understanding of times gone by makes this one of my (and the world's) ultimate favorites. At this point, this novel has reached so much fame that it is hardly necessary to discuss the plot, but for those uninformed out there, here it is:Scarlett O'Hara is the beautiful and headstrong eldest daughter of rich, high class plantation owners living just south of Atlanta during the antebellum period. Scarlett is the belle of the county - she has the smallest waist, the prettiest face, and the flirtiest personality. She could have any man, except the one she wants - Ashley Wilkes, who is already engaged to the frail but very sweet Melanie. When the Civil War breaks out everything changes. Scarlett marries, but is immediatly made a widow, and she moves to Atlanta to stay with Melanie. All the while Rhett Butler is lurking around. He's handsome, suave, and has a horrible reputation - hardly the kind of gentleman Scarlett was raised to like. But Scarlett, with her stubborn, headstrong attitude, brains, and independence is hardly a typical southern lady. As the war rages on, Scarlett's world is shattered and challenged. Wealth turns to poverty, pride to despair, admiration to dislike, and hate to love.Once started, this is a novel that cannot be put down. Many people read the whole thing (over 1,000 pages) in one very long sitting! That's what I did."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I may just may be a 12-year-old girl, but when I read this book, I fell completely in love with it. I have the movie, an anthology and a paperback version that needs to be replaced after I find a hardcover version in stores. In a way it was better than the movie. It gave you a different idea about what Scarlett O'Hara was like and what she went through. It was and is just an excelent example of American history."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I recieved Gone With the Wind as a Christmas gift and was not very excited about it. I had seen the movie and did not care for it, so I thought the book would problably be even worse--dragging on and on. I was so wrong. While not a quick read by any means, Gone With the Wind is completely fasinating. Everything about this book is perfect, from the characters to the events of the Civil War. Every character, especially the main characters, but even the minor characters, were wonderfully developed and real. I fell in love with each one. Scarlett and Rhett were written so honestly that, even in their wicked times, I could not help but love them. Melanie and Ashely as well were beautifully crafted. The story line is full of intimate, captivating details. Every scene is vital to the feel of the story and the final outcome. It has been several weeks since I finshed Gone With the Wind and I still find myself thinking about it and reliving it in my mind. There is a warning, however: When reading this book, do not read it from the the perspective of a person living in the 21st century. You must remember that our values have changed and, while definately for the better, the culture of Gone With the Wind should be judged on the basis of their own culture and morality, not our own. With that in mind, settle down for one of the most beautifully written and imaginatively creative books of our time."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is just amazing. It is mind blowing. I loved it, I never wanted it to end. When I finally pulled myself away to eat or something I was dazed. I felt as though I were wearing glorious, beautiful dresses and corsets. The ending left me heartbroken. As fantastic and brilliant as this novel is, I both loved and hated the ending. It wasn't right as Scarlett and Rhett were made for eachother. So I read the sequal and although it could never match Maragret Mitchell, I was delighted to see Rhett and Scarlett together. It was though it had finally ended as I was far to curious and left hanging to leave it at the ending in Gone With The Wind. It is truly a masterpiece and I wish that Margaret had written the sequal, not alexandra and Margaret Mitchell was the only one who could really make the characters come alive as she did. I am only 15 but this novel makes the gentle, romantic days on the old South so appealing that I wish I knew what it was like to be there! For those who didn't like the sequal I find it hard to think that you didn't like the ending. It was just so hard to leave it with Rhett and Scarlett apart - him not loving her. Read Gone With the Wind than read the sequal Scarlett. Although Scarlett isn't great, it leaves you feeling pleased that they are together!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I've read this book over and over again, and every time I finish I'm convinced that I'm never going to get tired of it. The story, although goes on forever (which think is okay, since I like to read, but many people I know complain abouth the lenght of the book) is so engrossing, so minutely descriptive and fascinating, even people who don't care for this kind of work will have at least to recognize the painstaking job of researching and piecing together the facts about American Southern life in the years of the Civil War. And the characters are something else. My absolute favorite literary heroine is Scarlett O'Hara, even if she was so stupid sometimes she made me desperate, and Rhett... well, sometimes I almost felt sorry for him, for all his macho-man behavior. Almost. You can't really feel sorry for a guy like this. And I loved the ending too, it was just right for the story. Anyway, I highly recommend this book to anyone, it deserves its reputation as a great classic, and by the way, so does the movie, even if it's not quite like the book, but that's to be expected, I guess."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I have read Gone with the Wind in Chinese two times. I think that it is one of the best novels in the world. I was not only enjoying the beautiful language, but also learned the Civil War history. Magaret's characters showed me vivid and alive image. Especially Scarlett O'hara. Maybe, at the beginning of the book is not very interesting. But please continue you will find that you can not give it up. I love to talk about my feelings each time when I read it now. The first time I read it was in 1984. That time, I was a high school student, and reading famous novels was a popular thing to do. When my classmate and I met after summer vacation, they often asked me if I had read something interesting. I picked up Gone with the Wind. It is a huge novel, and there are too many foreigners. I couldn't remember all of the characters names. I couldn't figure out what happened. The only thing I could tell was that Scarlett was a very young girl and she loved to get the boys' attention. I just read one third of it because I was not interested in the love story. The second time that I read it was in 1991. I worked in a bank. My job was to count money. It was so boring when we had no money to count. So, I picked up the novel again. This time I could not give it up. Scarlett absorbed me. She was a spoiled, ruthless girl. She did everything she wanted to do and never thought about the consequences. I could see this from her first marriage. She didn't know if she really loved her husband. She already became Charles' widow and a boy's mother. During the civil war, Scarlett grew up. She had a very strong head. She was a brave lady. She saved her home from Sherman and the carpetbaggers. I think Scarlett was still too young to understand true love. Captain Butler said, &quot;I loved you but I couldn't let you know it. You're so brutal to those who love you, Scarlet. You take their love and hold it over their heads like a whip.&quot; When she recognized that she loved him so much too, it was already too late. Butler didn't trust her any more and didn't want to save his love with her. He left home. I cried for Scarlett. It was painful because their love story does not have a good end. But just because this end, Magaret moved thousands and thousands reader's hearts. I felt sadder than Scarlett did. I wouldn't know how to live without Butler's love. &quot;I'll think of it all tomorrow. After all, tomorrow is another day.&quot; Said Scarlett. That was Scarlett's way. I have learned a lot from her. I become brave and have a strong head after I read it. I can say Gone with the Wind is one of the best novels. It helps me have an excellent marriage. I think that young girls should read it and to learn be a brave and independent person. Finding true love and treating it as treasure is the effective method to have happy marriage."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Scarlett is a complex woman...full of so many emotions that there is some of all of us in her. This book sets the plight of the Old South in an interesting fictional story...educating you without the feel of a textbook. You understand why the South tried like mad to hold onto its clearly outdated values and traditions. The struggle of the South becomes Scarlett's struggle with herself and the changing world around her. Then when you add Rhett Butler into the mix, off go the fireworks! This is truly a book that you have to read to appreciate. I don't enjoy romance novels or fiction that is too fluffy and this book has sometimes had those reputations. Not so...this book will grab you and never let you go."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"My mother is a huge fan of Gone With The Wind and for years she tried to get me to read it but I wouldn't because it's not the kind of thing I usually read. However, I finally read it when I was about 15 and I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on! Since then I have read it about a million times! The thing that makes Gone With the Wind so much better than your average romance is the wonderfully realistic characters. Considering she is the heroine Scarlett is not the nicest person in the world but that is what makes her so likeable! The same applies to Rhett Butler, who you can't help falling in love with even though he's not real! The book is sad, exciting and informative all at once and I can honestly say it is the best book I have ever read!!! The sequel &quot;Scarlett&quot; is almost as good in my opinion, though once you have read it, the ending to Gone With The Wind is spoiled. Anyway, if you haven't read either of these books yet, I recommend you read them now or you'll regret it like I did!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I started to read this book as a challenge - to see if I could actually finish it. I did, finally, (after about a month) and was really impressed. Actually, I was quite sad at the end of the last paragraph. It was definetly a classic book, but I don't intend on reading it again anytime in the near future.Scarlett O'Hara is a great character. Though bull-headed, nasty, and insensitive, she comes off as a believeable southern woman post-Civil War. She apparantly has no feelings whatsoever for those who care for her most, that is, she doesn't find out how much people mean to her until the very last chapter of the book. Still, she is strong, stubborn, can be sweet, and can get whatever she wants. And yes, she is a believeable character. I simply can not stand people who use the excuse that the character was unbelieveable. How is that? By saying that, you're saying that there could'nt be anyone in the world with the same qualities as that person? I don't think so.The only thing that bothered me about this was the fact that Scarlett didn't give a rat's a** about her children. Much to the point where they were afraid of her. That fact just might make some people hate her.But, all other matters aside, I don't think I can express enough how much I loved this book. It was beautifully written, with the right word choice (they would talk in big words all the time, so I was thankful that I could actually understand them!) and such. I know some people hated this book, but that's their opinion. I don't know why there is even such a thing as reviews. You just have to read the book for yourself and don't trust what anyone else says. And don't spend all your time going into such detail about the plot. That thing with Rhett's mentioned but not explained son really has no relevance to the plot. If you spend all your time looking at the downsides of the story, you'll never enjoy it. But, I do hope that you enjoy this book, because I think it it really great."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"GWTW was the very best. I always thought that there was no way that a book could really touch me, emotionally I mean. This was the only book that could accomplish that. Magaret Mitchell did a superb job writing this book, and I think that there never should have been a sequel written, for no continuation of the story could match the excellency of GWTW. I felt that the book ended well, and that if it had ended as a 'happily ever after' sort of thing, it wouldn't have been believable at all. Although I was crying at the end, I do believe it turned out correctly. I could not put it down! GWTW is timeless, and applies to everyone, so I recommend this book to every single person out there. Everyone can relate to the charecters in this book. A true classic, you've gotta read Gone With the Wind. I doubt I will ever find a book that can compare with the quality of it! Read it. PLEASE! We can all learn a lesson from the charecters in the book, especially Scarlett O'hara. A must read!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I was 13 when I first read Gone with the Wind. It was a Chinese version. I couldn't remember who translated the book. All I could remember was that it was one of the most touching story I've ever read. I was encouraged by the Scarlett's passion and courage for life and touched by Rhett's patience and love.A few days ago, I picked up an English version of Gone of the Wind. It seems so much better than before. Maybe it's because that I'm now older and I can understand people's feelings in another dimension. Or maybe it's becuase I've moved to America and I had a better understanding of the western culture. I cried after reading it. I wish there was a different ending!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"What can I say about GWTW that hasn't already been said? The story is so captivating, and you can envision every scene because Margaret Mitchell describes every detail with such beautiful language. You really feel drawn back in time to the Old South and the Civil War. However, the characters are what really make the story so compelling, and the way they interact with each other is quite interesting because they are all so different. Scarlett O'Hara is probably one of the best literary characters ever created. She is very spoiled and self-centered, but I can't help but admire her strength and courage. There's also Rhett Butler, the handsome yet terribly scandalous man who loves Scarlett. Their relationship is definitely one of the greatest love stories ever written. You just have to read it! Don't be intimidated by the fact that it is over 1000 pages, the language is wonderful but not that complicated. If you haven't read this book, you're really missing out on a fantastic reading experience. Read it, and you will see why nearly seventy years after its initial publication, Gone With the Wind has not been forgotten."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Just what the world needs. One more review of \\"Gone With the Wind.\\" I approached reading this book with a sense of trepidation. I looked at its 1,000+-page length, and doubted it was worth my time. I was afraid that it would be nothing more than an overblown historical romance novel. \\"I'll think about it tomorrow\\" summarizes the artistic merit of the book, I thought. Without the famous movie to sustain its reputation, who in their right mind would bother reading the book? Well, I was wrong. Looking beyond the soap opera of Scarlett, Rhett, and Ashley, I found things that really make this novel worthwhile. It's a richly detailed and historically accurate story of the Civil War and Reconstruction period, seen by those who bore the deprivations of daily life, not to mention the loss of loved ones. Although formatted as fiction, here we have living history. Margaret Mitchell draws deeply on her Georgia roots and gives the reader a uniquely Southern perspective of State Rights, slavery, Yankees, Carpetbaggers, Lincoln Republicans, and even the infamous Ku Klux Klan. Through the tribulations of Scarlett O'Hara, Mitchell argues that the Southern Cause appeared noble, but was ultimately foolish and futile. Above all, both Scarlett and Rhett Butler are practical people who doubt the sagacity of stifling social mores, and blind political affiliation. One can view Scarlett as the image of the South as she matures from a frivolous girl full of romantic notions into a strong, independent woman. Her pragmatism and steely resolve, forged on an anvil of personal suffering and survival, is another theme of the novel. It's easy to find the romantic melodrama of the surface plot distracting because it is fine entertainment. To enhance your reading pleasure, however, notice the rich historical detail and heed Scarlett's determination. As God is my witness, this is good reading. ;-)"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Going into this book, I was skeptical that I would enjoy it, as I am more into the Fantasy/Medievil genre. However, I don't know how anyone could not love this book. The characters are so real, the scenes so vividly described, and the feelings so profound that even I, someone not into the genre, couldn't get enough of it! Even though Scarlett was hostile towards loving Melanie, you couldn't help loving her! And I can actually see from the point of view of the Confederacy during the Civil War. It almost seems like their actions are justifiable, and we never learn this way of thinking in school! Over all, I have to say that Gone With the Wind lives up to it's reputation as one of the best novels of the 20th century!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I first read this novel set during the Civil War when I was 12 years old. Shortly after that I was able to see the film version in an old downtown theater during one of its periodic rereleases. I was enthralled by both the novel and film. Is there anyone out there who doesn't know the plot? For the 10 people in the world who don't know, it features Scarlet O'Hara, a Southern belle, living that role to the hilt on her family's Southern, slave-worked plantation, when all hell breaks loose with the Civil War. Admirable for her survivor qualities, Scarlet is also manipulative and ruthless but meets her match in Rhett Butler, a Southerner who manages to move profitably among both sides of the War while most of the South is starving. I reread this novel as an adult, expecting that with my many more years of reading since that first read, that I would find the book over the top and soap opera like. It didn't happen. I couldn't put it down and had every bit as fascinating a time reading it again as I did the first time. If you haven't given it a reread in many a year, try it yourself and you'll be very pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I have been reading &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; every couple of years since I was first &quot;allowed&quot; to read it at the age of 14! (In those days our mothers had higher hurdles for &quot;appropriate&quot; reading). When I was younger, I read this book once every year. I actually learned to read French without a dictionary by reading the French translation. (It's long enough to have that kind of linguistic influence! )The story of Scarlett O'Hara, a feisty and courageous southern &quot;belle&quot; whose beauty and sharpness was complicated by a lack of insight into human nature that ultimately left her unable to understand the hearts of those she most loved and by whom she was loved, until it was too late. It is also the story of the the South just before, during and after the Civil War.A more sympathetic portrait of the South than many other Civil war histories, it has aged fairly well, despite a slightly more patronistic view of African-Americans than one might be comfortable with today. Given its authorship dating back to the 1930s, I believe one needs to look at the book in the context of its historical period, and not to demean its historical or entertainment value simply because we are more aware and more sophisticated after the Era of Civil Rights in the United States. I also believe a sympathetic and well-educated person such as the author Margaret Mitchell seems to be, would have been the first to agree had she lived long enough to undergo that period of transformation in our country.Despite this limitation, few books of historical fiction are so well-plotted, and few characters in literature are so well-developed as that of Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, or Ashley and Melanie Wilkes--people I continue to feel like I &quot;knew&quot; in another time.The story is also that of Atlanta, a city which was relatively young and &quot;brash&quot; as a Confederate economic and cultural center, relative to Charleston and Richmond, the more sedate Confederate capitals.The book is valuable both as a historical text for those of us with little insight into the viewpoint of the South beyond that given in grade school textbooks, and as one of the most romantic dramas in American literature.I enjoyed reading this book as much at the age of 48 as I did almost 35 years ago (and many times in-between). I can't imagine a better summer read for a teenage girl, or a better way to relax at the beach for her mother, or a better way to pass a cold snowy vacation in front of a fire. Definetely a book for the romantically inclined.One should also note, that &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is one of the few books (until perhaps &quot;Cider House Rules&quot;) portrayed almost as well on film as the book is written. However the pleasures remain different and self-contained, and no enjoyment of either is lost by viewing or reading the other."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is the best thing I've ever read in my life! The details are fantastic and the characters are well portrayed. The storyline is classic! This book immediately sucks you into the story and makes you really care about the characters in it.

I think this is the finest book ever written."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Within the one thousand and twenty-four pages of this book, a reader is allowed to experience hardships, heartbreaks, shocking revalations, and most of all, an overwhelming emotionally-charged, intense book. This is one great book! Characters come alive, colors form before the eye of your imagination, shapes and sounds seem to ring in your ears, and undeniable passion sets fire to your heart. If you haven't read this experience of a lifetime, you are missing out on one of America's most treasured, true, and honest classics. (Those nights you will spend reading late into the hour and the tiredness of the next day are definatly worth it:)"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Reading Gone With The Wind is indeed an experience. It is able to change the opinion on romance stories for someone who does not like to read romance, it made me unable to put down the book even though I was busy.The story basically tells how the beautiful Southern belle Scarlett O Hara hardened during the American Civil War and her ruthless ways of making money even it means to marry someone whom she did not love as well as engaging the convicts to run the mills. The story also talks about the unusual love between Scarlett and Rhett Butler whom Scarlett hated intially and also the patriotism of the American Southerners. One could feel the different emotions of Human when reading the story such as jealousy, anger, honour between people and the country, love and so on. It is one unforgettable reading experience and Margaret Mitchell is indeed a talented writer whom I should say that it was regrettable that she was not the one who was writing the sequel to this story. Gone With The Wind is a highly recommended story."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"When I look back on my sophomore year of high school, I will remember it as the year I read Gone With the Wind, and became hooked. I have thought about it everyday since I started it. I adore this story. The descriptions in this book will take your breath away. Once when she was back at Tara, in the dead of winter, I looked up and was shocked that the sun was shining, and there was food downstairs in the refrigerator. It will literally sweep you in. I read it in September, in a little less than a week. I didn't read it as a challenge or anything. It was actually a &quot;rebelling&quot; act. My mom hates the story line because she doesn't like how Southerners &quot;won't let the war die.&quot; Her saying how much she hated it totally backfired because it only made me want to read it more so I could see what was so bad about it. Then I fell in love with it. When I re-read some of the dialogue, especially that at the end of the book, between Scarlett and Rhett, my heart positively aches. The language is so beautiful. I cried for an hour after I finished it. The ending is absolutely tragic, but there's no other way it could've ended and been as good. I don't understand how anyone can not like it. The Southern backdrop during the Civil War was a necessity to the essence of the story. I know slavery was one of America's greatest atrocities, but that's not what this book is about. It is the story of a woman trying to save herself and her home, and in the process, ruining the love of one of the most dashing, white knights of all fiction because of her only-human downfalls-greed, fear and lust.I loved Scarlett's character. She was exactly as Rhett described-a brave, frightened, insensitive, bull-headed child. She did try to be good, and then something would happen to scare her, so she'd get mean again. I loved Melanie, too. I want to be a friend like she was. She was good, but not goody-goody. She loved people fiercely, as Scarlett wanted things fiercely. She stood by her beloved friend to the bitter end, even though she knew Scarlett had betrayed her. Rhett was such an absolutely wonderful person. He only couldn't show it to the everyday Scarlett-hardened and greedy-because she would think him weak. He was only tender and loving when she was in fear. I want to meet someone like him-I just hope I don't act like Scarlett! The characters were so human, I loved them all. Everyone should read this book. It is such a beautifully-written masterpiece. It's my favorite."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I first watched the movie when I'm 14.

I saw the book as more than a love story. It shows the many emotions people go through as they mature and change with the world they are presented with. Gone With the Wind should be a required book for anyone who enjoys this genre. The movie is also good, but it doesn't include everything the book has to offer.

I am now 16 and my love for Gone With the Wind is still exceedingly strong. Alexandra Ripley's so-called sequel was good but her Scarlett and Rhett did not suit the originals. Margaret Mitchell was a superb author with a genious for portraying saucy, touch-me-not characters like Scarlett and smooth,arrogant ones like Rhett. Throughout the book Scarlett's insistance that she would always love Ashley and Rhett would never have that privilege perfectly led up to the ending where she finally realizes that she only wanted Ashley because she could not have him.

I was enthralled with the strength and courage that Scarlett had. This book was way better than I thought it would be. But the ending, which made me cry, dissapointed me. And I threw a fit because I read such a long story with such a horrible ending. But I now realize that I was just too young to read this book in 7th grade.

Many of my friends thought I was crazy reading it, and frankly so did I. Well I started to read it and really got into it. It was so exciting and thrilling I never wanted to put it down. The story of Scarlett O'Hara really touched me and made me realize everthing that we take for granted in life. Also how if you want to be noticed in life and be remembered than be different. Scarlett did many bold things during the war, and even though she had trouble keeping husbands she finally fund a true love one whom she thought she hated. This book was full of surprises and throughly heart warming. It will make any reader make his or her outlook on life so much better, and give them more hope in a &quot;wacky&quot; and strange world like ours."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Last Christmas, I received Gone With The Wind, and before I even went back to school, I had finished it. I read it all day for a week, and when I finished, I felt like my heart had been squeezed. It was so amazing. I have persuaded friends to read it, have posters of it hanging in my room, and simply love it!!! This is one of my favorite books!!!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Just finished reading all the reviews people posted on GWTW and I'm overwhelmed by the love people have for this book. I'll admit it's not my all time favorite (that honor belongs to By Love Possessed, by James Gould Cozzens), but GWTW is still one of the greatest literary experiences a person can have. It's the type of book one simply disappears into, you have no concept of the outside world--your world is Tara, Twelve Oaks, Atlanta, and your friends are Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, et al. You forgive them their indescretions and love them for their humanity. Oh, and I hated the Alexandra Ripley sequel."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I love this book. It is so heartbreaking, tragic, and romantic- it just kind of draws me to it. One of my best friends took three years to convince me to check it out of the library. Finally I did and I wish now that I hadn't waited so long. I'm 13, and I think this book is awesome, and I don't even like romances, and I haven't even finished it yet!!!! This is a must-read for anyone with a flair for the dramatic, and anyone who doesn't like it can just shut their mouths!!!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"The thing that stands out the most in my mind is how different it was from the movie. All the little extra things that happen in the book that don't happen in the movie (i.e. Scarlett has more than 1 child) Anyone who loves the movie owes it to themselves to read the book. Don't be put off by the number of pages. You'll come away thinking, Gee I only knew 1/2 the story!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"WOW. Possibly THE BEST book I have ever read. My mother took me to see th rerelease just recently at a theater in Dallas, and when it was over I didn't want to leave. I mean, the movie was 6+ hours long and I still wanted more!! So I went and bought the book. My favorite part has to be(besides the fall of Atlanta)the ball in which Rhett auctions Scarlett. It is a perfect example of their feelings for each other. I love all the characters. Timid Melly, Rash Scarlett, Careless Rhett. A must read!!!!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This novel has it all! Where else can you read about love, honor, tradition and free enterprise? Given that she is a woman with charm, beauty and brain's, it's no wonder that the men in her life naturally &quot;flocked&quot; to her. I have read GWTW several times, and I still find myself more enthralled each time. I admire Scarlett's survival instinct, and her raw ambition. GWTW will forever be a timeless american classic!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is a timeless movie, people of all ages love it. I love the ending, it makes you use your own imagination on what happens after Rhett leaves. The so-called sequel was the biggest mistake the Maragret Mitchell estate could of ever made. As far as I am concerned, that book was no sequel, but a seperate book altogether. They can say whatever they want about Titanic, but let's see if it can last half as long as GWTW."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is just such an enjoyable read. Scarlett is appropriately evil, and in the end redeemable.Wonderful novel. I intend to read this again very soon. I had not realized how much better the book is than the movie!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"One of my library students finally finished \\"Gone With the Wind.\\" She's my voracious reader, whom I allow to check out four, six books at a time. If anyone asks why she gets to check out that many books, she is to say: \\"Because I'm special.\\" It took her two years to read GWTW: she began it in the sixth grade, let it languish, then this year, as an 8th grader, she started over and read it through. Oh! Yes, she loved it!I first read the 1,037-page novel in the 8th grade as well. That was my first reading. I was severely disappointed with the ending. So I read it again and again, fully expecting each time that Rhett WOULD \\"give a damn\\" and return to Scarlet. This was not to be, at least, not in the annals of concluded fiction. Who hasn't read GWTW that didn't imagine Rhett returning?Just as in real life, fictional characters also behave according to their dictates (granted, their god is different from those of humans) and their circumstances. Would any self-respecting Rhett return to such a cold-hearted, well, you know how she acts and what she is. Even red-petticoat wearing Mammy scoffed at the idea of Scarlet actually winning either man: book-loving, milquetoast Ashley or hot-blooded, fiercely protective Rhett. One is too tame, the other too untameable.So, what is GWTW really: an historical novel of the South and its Lost Cause or a microscopic look at one woman and how she is both damaged and strenghtned by the War Between the States, which meant nothing more to her than an inconvenience. Is it both?Gone With the Wind, is, of course, both historical and character-driven. Two protagonists, Scarlet and Rhett, are pitted against each other, although both are attracted to each other, whether one knows it or not. Ashley is an unattainable dream, a wish fulfillment; Rhett is a hot rod used to prod Scarlet's sensibilities (which are not so sensible).Of course, the real heroine of the novel is Melanie, sweet, sweet Melanie, symbolic steel magnolia, who can kill an enemy in cold blood, yet defend her most erring sister-in-law. Loyal, devout, faithful, responsible, just keep on naming those lovely positive character attributes and you have Melanie. Does such a woman exist? Of course, she does. You and I both know women like Melanie. They run the churches--behind the scenes unless they're needed up front. Always there, always dependable, yet just a little sicky sweet.Scarlet. To the end, defiant. To the end, hoping for that rescue. To the end, just Scarlett. Oh well, we'll think about it tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"A true American classic, Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is a must read for anyone who likes a good story about survival, betrayal, love, and historical fiction. Set in the Old South before, during, and after the Civil War, Scarlett O'Hara must grow up, leave her comfort zone and survive numerous hardships. Although the movie has caught the essence of the book, actually reading this novel is a must for every independent woman in America."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I first read Gone with the Wind when I was in high school. I was 16 and didn't care much about anything, but this book grabbed my attention and held it. I had grown up in an old and established family from the South and had heard all the tales of the horrors of the 'time of our most recent unpleasantness', but Margret Michell's book brought those times to life. Yes, I know what people say about Mitchell and this book, but what was is. You can't change history just because you don't like it. I didn't and don't like a lot of my ancestor's choices, either, but it's there just the same.Anyhow, from the journals I've read (and I've now read lots of them) and my own personal history passed down from word of mouth, I think Ms. Mitchell did a good job of capturing a bygone era. In a word, I'm as captivated by this book in my older years as I was at 16. The book lives."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"There are good reasons why Gone With The Wind, published 73 years ago, is a classic among classics, a Pulitzer Prize winner, and has sold over 28 million copies in more than 37 countries. The reasons are that it is an unparalleled monumental epic of the American South that is very rich in historical facts, it has superbly developed unforgettable characters, a narrarative that is so captivating that the reader will feel he/she is right there experiencing all that was going on, and it truly stands the test of time. I enjoyed reading it at least as much now (and possibly more) than when I first read it over 45 years ago. While Gone With The Wind is often marketed as \\"the greatest love story of our time,\\" it is so much more than that. If you haven't read Gone With The Wind or haven't done so in many years, do yourself a tremendous favor and read it/read it again as soon as possible. It's an experience you'll savor for years to come."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I can understand why Gone with the wind has been considered as a classic. This is Margaret Mitchelle's unforgettable tale of love and hate, gain and lost, life and death, of a nation divided, of the American people being torn apart by the civil war. This is the story of honourable but weak Ashley Wilkes, who lives in his own world, of Melanie Wilkes, who is no less than an angel, of the Fontaines, the Tarletons, the O'Haras and many other Geogians. This is the story of the black and white Southerners before, during, and after the war. Above all, it is the story of Captain Rhett Butler and the beautiful, determined, strong-willed but ignorant and ruthless Scarlett O'Hara.Gone with the wind is an outstanding read!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Five stars is not enough to rate this timeless, flawless epic novel of the South. Miss Mitchell's talent has never been underrated or under-appreciated, but having read it as a teen - then, again recently, after having read \\"Rhett Butler's People,\\" the authorized sequel to GWTW commissioned by the Mitchell estate, I am newly appreciative of Miss Mitchell's prodigious talent.For those who have only seen the equally terrific, but different, movie, please read Mitchell's original.The movie does stand on its own. I am a fan of novels-turned-books and have seen many. I never denigrate a movie if it differed from the original novel in any way. The two are different media.But Mitchell's only novel earned her a place forever in American literature and is desrving to be read in its entirety.Though long, it is a quick read for the engaged reader.I have not read the much-ballyhooed but often best-seller, unauthorized sequels, but I will do so, mostly out of curiosity.The authorized sequel, Rhett Butler's People, is also interesting, but can never live up to Mitchell's GWTW."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I read this book as a teenager and have absolutely loved it ever since.

Excellent!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone with the Wind is one of the rare stories that delivers exactly what you wouldn't expect. Nothing about it is predictable, nothing is cliche. The heroine is infintely less of a heroine than ever before - she's Scarlett, the spoiled, selfish Southern daughter of a plantation owner, used to having everything handed to her on a silver platter. During the period of the Civil War, she is forced to grow up and become a woman, but she never loses childish inclinations to selfishness and pettiness.Enter Rhett Butler, the conceited, vulgar 'Yankee' whom Scarlett despises and yet, is fascinated by. Though he is not quite a hero as Scarlett is not a heroine, he has become one of America's most beloved leading men.Gone with the Wind is startling in its storyline and realism, and does not gloss over the brutality and harsh outcomings of the Civil War - on both sides.I purchased my copy of Gone with the Wind at a library. The book had not been used by the library, but donated and then put for sale. I paid $3 for it - in very good condition. It was a 40th Anniversary Edition complete with slipcase. It is positively beautiful, and I could not have gotten a better bargain. Aside from some mild use and wear, and a name written in pencil on the first page, its in perfect condition.

Moreover, Gone With the Wind tells the tale of the strong-willed, crafty and determined, Katie \\"Scarlett\\" O'Hara; one of the most famous female characters in literature (and film - due to the 1939 movie of the same name).The book is a significant read, it was originally published at 1037 pages and now finishes at 1024. But it is well-worth the effort to pour your heart and time into this romantic, courageous and historical novel. If in doubt, consider the fact that it sold $176,000 copies within the first few weeks (at an unprecedented $3 apiece), and has gone on to sell over 30 million copies. Scarlett is considered by many to be the most intriguing female character ever written, and the novel typically tops the \\"Most Romantic\\" books lists. It took author, Margaret Mitchell, over seven years to write the story and it is the only book she ever published.The story is set in Atlanta, Georgia. Scarlett, the daughter of a wealthy Irish plantation owner, has made up her mind that she is in love with the charming and chivalrous Ashley Wilkes. However, Ashley has committed to marrying his gracious and even-tempered cousin, Melanie Hamilton. Their marriage puts high-minded Scarlett into a lifelong tailspin of ill-fated marriages and emotional conflict. In the meantime, she has the roguish, handsome and financially secure Rhett Butler in the wings for most of the story and eventually marries him but this proves equally tumultuous and ruinous for both of them.This is not a straight-forward love story; rather it is a assortment box of every type of human love imaginable. There is love for one's heritage (the Old South), land (the great Tara Plantation), children (she has four pregnancies), parents (who die), spouses (she has three) lovers, friends, and foes. This is also the story of strength, struggle, and self-realization. It is only at the end of the novel that Scarlett is finally able to distinguish and reconcile the difference between real love and starry-eyed infatuation.The spirited and intrepid Scarlett gives this epic novel wings to soar for over a thousand pages. She is a plucky character who approaches life with the resilience of a determined adventurer. Her intelligent, hard-working, go-getter attitude gives the story backbone, but it is her loves, longings and grievous losses that give it substance. Ultimately, it is her uncompromising ability to fight for herself, and for those she loves, that makes her the heroine of the novel and of the hearts of those who read it.Beth Walz[...]"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I loved all the nfo from the book that the movie couldn't give, it was a goo, but long read."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This classic story is classified as a Historical Fiction, but is a good review of the Civil War and about the early southern people of that century.

There is everything you could hope and dream of in this book. Scarlett is so complicated, yet real. My all time favorite book."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"The first time I read this Pulitzer winner was when I was in high school. The movie had just been re-released and my best friend and I saw it about 8 times. She still had the best plot description I've ever heard: \\"This is the story of Rhett Butler who loves Scarlett O'Hara, who loves Ashley Wilkes, who loves Melanie Hamilton, who loves everyone, including the town tart Belle Watling, who loves Rhett Butler, who loves Scarlett...\\"I've since read the book a second and now a third time and recognize more depth than our first summary. Yes, it is still a love story. But it is also a quintessential Southern book, a quintessential great American novel, a quintessential exploration of war and its aftermath, and a quintessential character study of Scarlett O'Hara's evolution from spoiled girl to unstoppable woman.Mitchell has crafted a 1000-page book that reads like a short novel. The characters who people her book present the full spectrum of human traits, from best to worst. These are the qualities that make the book such an enduring favorite, and really a classic work of literature.Is the book without flaws? Of course not. I cringe at the romantic version of the Ku Klux Klan. I am appalled at how often she compares the \\"darkies\\" to children or, worse yet, apes. But I am still caught up in the story, and that is the reason most people read novels - for a good story. And it was the story that first captured my attention and my heart, and it is the story that still earns it 5 stars.Linda Stephens does a fine job of narrating the audio version, though I thought her Scarlett sounded too mature at the beginning of the book - Scarlett is only 16 when we first meet her, and I thought her voice should have a higher pitch."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"When I saw this book on my mom's bookshelf two years ago, I wanted to read it because I thought that that would make me a &quot;grown up&quot;. But reading it was better than that. I was fascinated by the Southern way of life, as I had only heard bad things about the Confederacy in my history class (it was soooo one-sided). It seemed so beautiful, what with the chivalrous gentlemen and their demure ladies. It was a world where Melanie completely belonged, but Scarlett was in the wrong age. I was so frusterated to see how Scarlett had to forfeit friends and society to keep herself alive. It's hard to like her, but it's impossible not to! She's cold, dismissive to her friends, and uses her looks to get her way- but you like her anyway, no matter how much you admire the other characters for their sweetness and chivalry. You like that she's willing to do everything for Ashley, for Gerald, for Tara. And you're upset when Rhett leaves her even though she completely deserved it. She can get things done, and she will, and we like her. For me, the face of the Confederacy will always be the face of Scarlett O'Hara- con artist, tart, hypocrite, and so much more. And yet still, a part of me wishes that I had been a part of that face."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"...This great book.... I read it when I was 16 and since then I read it countless times. Every character and all the dialounge I love. Charles declaration of love to Scarlett is sooo cute. GranMa's Fontaine's remincing of the massacre of her family was perfectly done. Mammy's telling of Rhett going out of his mind after Bonnie's death. Scarlett promise to never going hungry again is a complete classic that every Southerner should learn and know by heart. Melanie's giving birth to Beau is so real. NO women that small and narrow should give birth and if she does she should thank God she lived after the birth. Scarlett's telling Melanie to scream and not to be brave sounded like my mother when Mother told my sister to yell all she wanted. My nephew weighed eleven pounds. There is so much I want to say here. I really will never understand the non-reading public. The stories here in this book are so beatiful. Even if the Story is old and long how can persn resist after the first page. Scarlett to me is a real person. So what if she is spoiled brat. At least she knows what she wants. But...her being in love with Ashley is beyond me. He is pathetic. Rhett. Wow!! What a man. Now that is a Man I would love to have for myself. Again I will never under Scarlett here. What was she thinking in letting a fine man like Rhett to get away mooning over a man like Ashley, then realizing too late that she never \\"really\\" loved him? WELL, I least I hope I know she had to have gotten him back. And, I'm not talking at all about that horrid book \\"SCARLETT\\" either. I don't need that book to continue the story for me. I like to think I can continue the story in my mind. After all tomorrow is another day."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Margaret Mitchell's requiem of the South succeeds to embrace both the reader and her topic because of the tremendous blend of themes which resound throughout this masterful novel.First, she introduces us to the concept of peace versus war: \\"All wars are sacred, to those who have to fight them. If the people who started them did not make wars sacred, who would be foolish enough to fight?\\" And, of course business pragmatist Rhett Butler concludes, \\"All wars are in realty money squabbles. But so few people ever realize it. Their ears are too full of bugles and drums . . . \\" This dialogue of sanctity of war versus business pragmatism constantly resounds in the book.Secondly, is how men treat other men. And, within this theme are numerous subtopics. The most obvious is the North versus the South. \\"Arrogance and callousness for the conquerors, bitter endurance and hatred for the conquered.\\" When you start a war - know that at the end you still have an enemy, and that enemy's feelings toward you may be stronger and more bitter! The other obvious theme is white versus black. Slavery versus freedom for the \\"darkies.\\" And, although that serfdom appears to symbiotically exist in the Camelot of the Georgian south, Ashley Wilkes tells Scarlett O'Hara at one time that had there been no war and had his father died with slavery still intact, he would have freed his slaves as his methodically conceived logical conclusion was to do the right thing : free men.Ashley Wilkes, who displays another great theme of old antebellum South's gentlemen in the new world of the Reconstruction South, is both hero and goat. Rhett Butler always tells Scarlett that Ashley's days of importance ended when his environs were burnt to ashes at the war's end. She never agrees, at least until the end. And, while she disagrees with Rhett about Ashley, they gang up on her on yet another masterful man versus man theme: employment of convict labor. Treated worse than slaves, convicts are the backbone to cheap labor after the war. But, for their hard work they are beaten and fed little and paid less. Ashley, in her post-starvation period, will do almost everything to avoid experiencing hunger again - including hiring white northerners to be her conscripted laborers.Thirdly, we learn about truth versus appearance. Rhett and most of the old South depict the wonderment of southern civility - never say a bad thing about anyone, and always show respect and manners to those about you. This applies to many slaves as well. Ashley and his wife, Melanie (Melly), are embodiments of such gentile mannerisms. Scarlett's mother Ellen was another. Scarlett's father, Gerald O'Hara, and Scarlett are not. But, Scarlett and her father were truthful. The Irish in father and daughter refused to fub, they refused to be concerned about the foderol scurried about by gossip - holding such lack of care when the idle gossip festered to outright defamatory lies. Rhett, who loves the lack of deception in Scarlett's character, often criticizes his peers for their hypocrisy. Rhett admits to engaging in the same for purposes of business; but, as a man he refuses to be known as another who says what he does not mean. But, Rhett, as time progresses in the book, succumbs to the gossip and engages in the very hypocrisy he despises.Fourthly, the issue of uneven playing field resounds. Rich versus poor. Slave owner versus slave. Business owner versus convict labor. South versus North. And, hidden within these themes is Mitchell's greatest announcement: feminism. Scarlett who owns businesses after the war, is criticized by all men and societal women for engaging in a man's world. Even with her success, she is snubbed by the hob nob crowd. But, perhaps greatest in this theme is the concept of men having rights which women cannot. Rhett gallivants with the local prostitute Belle without concern, while one emotional hug held by life-long friends and neighbors Scarlett and Ashley is identified as \\"adultery.\\" When Rhett confronts her about this, Scarlett retaliates, \\"You are nothing but a drunken beast who's been with bad women so long that you can't understand anything else but badness. You've lived in dirt too long to know anything else. You are jealous of something you can't understand. Good night.\\"Other themes also exist: building versus destroying; growing up versus growing old; Catholics versus Christians; love for family versus love for spouses; raising children versus burying children . . .As these themes ebb and flow and occasionally eddy in this ocean-sized novel, the characters' personalities grow and become embodiments of many stereotypical Southern mainstays. And, to add to the characters, Mitchell uses incredibly detailed phonetic spellings for the crackers' and slaves' dialogues. Her detailed description of people's clothing and household interiors (and exteriors) brand indelible images into the readers' minds. This is writing!Mitchell, whose own life is a mixture of angelic Melly and defiant Scarlett, had three marriages and worked (as a journalist) in a man's world. She knew that her publication would be much more difficult than a man's work - especially one of such largess. But, like Scarlett, she persevered and triumphed. Mitchell's name remains among the most known in the American literary world - not bad for a small girl from Atlanta.So many passages of this book flow with delicate prose that make it an incredibly easy 960-page read. In Pat Conroy's preface, that great southern writer states, \\"This is The Illiad with a Southern accent, burning with the humiliation of Reconstruction. . . Gone with the Wind was not just a book, it was an answer, a clenched fist raised to the North, an anthem of defiance. If you could not defeat the Yankees on the battlefield, then by God, one of your women could rise from the ashes of humiliation to write more powerfully than the enemy and all the historians and novelists who sang the praises of the Union.\\""},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone with the Wind is the story of Scarlett O'Hara (and so much more). When the reader meets Scarlett, it is pre-civil war in the South. The reader gets to see plantation life on Tara and in the Country as it really was. Mitchell takes the reader through the Civil War, how life changed for those that didn't go of to war, how life changed for everyone after it, the mentality of those who survived it and how they lived afterwards. The reader gets to watch these character develop and change with the times.Mitchell's character description is amazing! As a reader, you feel transported into this world, as if these characters are your friends, and as if you are a part of this town - just another neighbor. You will feel for each and everyone in some way at some time. You'll not want to put the book down, nor will you want it to end....What can one really say about this book other than it is a great read and one that everyone should pick up!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Many people only know Gone With The Wind through the beautiful 1939 David O. Selznick film. That is a disappointment, as the novel is so much richer and complex than the film could realize.Written in the mid 1930s by a novice writer, it nonethe less manages to evoke the spirit of the Civil War and the passion that is Scarlett O'Hara.While commonly viewed as a war novel, it is actually much more: both a brilliant comedy of manners and the first frankly feminist novel written. Ms. Mitchell manages to make us care about Scarlett, while allowing us also to laugh at her occasionally.Do not be put off by the book's length. While an enormous undertaking, it moves along at a breakneck pace, and is absorbing from the very first page.Some have criticized the book for its racist portrayal of the black characters. While it does seem so from a 21st Century perspective, that can perhaps be forgiven when remembering that it was written by a Southerner in the early 20th Century. In any event, some of the most noble, sympathetic characters of the book are black and slaves.This is a book to enjoy and savor more than once. The 60th Anniversary Edition is especially nice, coming in a slipcover and containing analysis of the book by other authors and literary critics."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"If you read the other customer reviews, you will definitely guess that people love this book. They really, really love it.I read this book primarily because it is such a major piece of 20th century American Literature and film and I'm glad I read it. Several friends saw the book on my table and assumed my wife was reading it. I took some teasing over it.I liked it more than I expected to but I couldn't quite get past some of the views expressed or supported. I do think Mitchell goes further than just showing how southerners thought of blacks and actually has sympathy for some of the attitudes.Mitchell writes a lot of good scenes and social situations. Scarlett is quite a character. She is selfish, egotistical, forceful and mean. She's also loyal, smart and has incredible inner strength. To Margaret Mitchell's credit, she wrote an incredibly strong female character who is consistently interesting.For a 1000ish page book, it moves quickly but I really did find it to be way, way too long. A lot of the book simply reinforces the Scarlett character and, for me, she could have left out quite a bit of it without losing much. When you love a book, it can't be too long so I expect your view of the book's length will depend on how much you're enjoying it.If I could have forgotten the attitudes expressed towards slavery then I would have given this a higher rating. I couldn't manage to do it though. There are many books with accurate depictions of slavery and the attitude of whites towards slaves and they are very powerful. I think the character that bothers me the most is Rhett Butler. He is a smart, dashing scoundrel who loves Scarlett and is the only one who really knows her nature. He is also a character who admittedly shot a n----r for getting uppity with a white. I realize it was written in the 1930s and described a violent time but I still had some difficulty with it.The book is loaded with memorable quotes and it is a classic with larger than life characters that people love.So, I expect many readers will continue to love this book and I don't begrudge them that but I just couldn't get past certain things. The 3 star rating is almost an abstention regarding whether I recommend it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"As powerful today as when it came out more than 70 years ago. Criticisms that it glorifies the Confederacy are misguided. While still honoring those who survived incredible hardship and loss, Margaret Mitchell skewers the pretensions of those who blindly believed in \\"The Cause.\\" Her portrayal of how blacks were treated manages to convey her obvious belief that in many respects some slaves were better people than their masters. A great love story set in the midst of a war that is fought mostly offstage. Her prose is magnificent, creating characters and a world that are unique in American literature. An aside: Hollywood did a magnificent job making a classic movie from such a huge book."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With The Wind is timeless. Though the movie gives an overview of the book, there is so much more that is revealed in the book. It reveals much more about each character; it gives a background about Tara and its acquistion; it gives more insight into the relationships between the characters. The historical era is described so that the reader can understand the southern culture of that time. I have read the book at least 5 times, and each time I get something new from the book."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"The book was so much better than the movie. One of my new favorite books, will read over and over."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"\\"And she heard for the first time, without knowing it, the Rebel yell.\\"I read Gone With the Wind years ago but was so happy to revisit it as a book club choice. I was surprised by how many people struck up a conversation about it as I carried it with me when I travelled. Imagine writing something that still instigates conversations and connections among strangers who have only this book in common? Love it or hate it, you can't deny the impact it's had.The first time I read this I was in my early 20's. I fell completely in love with every moment. Over 10 years later I was surprised by how my reactions to the characters changed. I had less tolerance for Scarlett and increased respect for Melanie. I was more affected by the soldiers and less swept up in the romance. I still thought Ashley needed a backbone...Despite those differences, my love for the characters did not change. My favorite characters are those with flaws. I cannot become completely encompassed by perfection but prefer some characteristics I can love and some I can hate. In that, Gone With the Wind is spot on. I hope I find this book in my hand a third time, another 10 years from now."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is unlike any other that I have encountered thus far. It is a dinamic story of a firey young southern girl forced to come to grips with the realities of the war-torn south. Once you start reading you will not be able to put this book down. The details that Mitchell includes are breathtaking and make you feel as if you are back in the days of the old south. The character of Scarlett O'Hara is inspiring. This book is many stories in one; it is a coming-of-age piece, a love story, a war story, and a historical novel. All of these genres come together to create a captivating work of art."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone with the wind is one of those storys that wraps you up into the story waiting to find out what is going to happen next to Scarlett. Yet it is the most to deal on real life issues back in the 1860's and post civil war. Even if it is fictional."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"A wonderful fascinating historical novel, an intriguing character study, and yes, of course, a tragic love story - this is one of 20th century masterpieces and a must-read for anyone.And this doesn't mean that the characters of the book are perfect or their actions right - instead the imperfections of Scarlett, Rhett and others are what make the story work. Mitchel makes them so that anyone really can identify with them at some point, making the story very realistic and believable. No they are not perfect and their bad traits are not extolled or forgiven, as some reviewers here might think. Indeed, the events in the story reflect this point. (Why do u think Scarlett is left all alone in the end?) If anyone thinks that giving your daughter Gone with the Wind to read would make her think or behave like Scarlett at her worst they are very, very wrong and they just don't get the main idea of the novel.Its so sad, frustrating, bittersweet and great and i love it. I very much recommend this book."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With the Wind, by Margaret Mitchell, is an amazing book based rural Georgia from the Civil War antebellum to Reconstruction. Scarlett O'Hara begins as a sixteen-year-old belle of the county, but ends up facing perils the kind of which she could never imagine. In the book, love holds Scarlett together, but in the end fails her. Mitchell's style is unique and distinguishable. The moral value of this book is unusually displayed by the contradictions to it made by Scarlett. I loved reading about Scarlett's relationships with her friends and, more interestingly, her enemies. Though it is sometimes difficult to like Scarlett, it is impossible to ever hate Mitchell's messages throughout this amazing epic novel."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I agree with the woman from the UK. This is ridiculous. Slavery was horrible but guess what ? It happened, so I guess what we should conclude from what you are saying is that we should just forget about Hitler and the concentration camps and pretend like it never happened. The world can be a horrible place so while we're here why don't we face the facts and try to learn from history. Besides, history repeats itself. So, back to the book. WOW! This is the best book I've ever read. Reading this book you realize how horrible slavery was but also what hell Southerner's went through during this period. After all nearly one-fourth of the population of the U.S. was wiped out because of the Civil war and it tells about the people who really changed the South, the carpetbaggers! I saw the movie and after having read the book I can't believe some of the powerful scenes they left out. Like when the Union soldiers were going through Tara and almost took Charles' sword. Or when the Calvert girl came to tell everyone she was going to marry. It just goes on and on. Did you know that MM wrote GWTW for her own pleasure and never thought of herself as a good writer. One day a publisher friend from NY dropped by and saw hundreds of sheets of papers in dissaray and asked if he could look at them. MM had refused to let anybody read what she had been writing but said yes to this guy for some reason then felt self-consious almost immediatley after he left and asked for them back the next day. He said he would never give them back and published them."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With The Wind (GWTW abbreviated for those who are hardcore fans) was a tremendously successful novel, earning its well-deserved title as an American literary masterpiece. Spun from the imagination and supposedly blurry, slightly realistic accounts of Margaret Mitchell and her friends (Mitchell said the characters were based on some of her acquiantances, as she grew up listening to Civil War accounts in the South), the novel took America by storm in the 30's. It was the Great Depression, a time that severely hurt the nation's economy. We were then a nation on the brink of war (sounds like our present time, does'nt it ?), World War II being just around the corner. Mitchell had written short novels that are unfortunately unknown to most readers and sold rarely in bookstores, but GWTW was her only great novel, her magnum opus, her legacy. She took it upon herself to write the great American novel, and she managed quite well. The novel deals with the life-altering Civil War, its effects principally on the main characters, a coquettish, strong-willed, male-manipulating survivor Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara, an equally strong and slick man of ill-gotten means, Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes, of whom Scarlett is enamored and who is a reserved, elegant aristocrat and his wife Melanie Hamilton. The barrage of characters, from the Tarleton twins, to the comedic, gossipy Aunt Pittypat, to the slaves, including Mammy. The novel is very long, and of course, in order to truly enjoy the epic scope of the narrative, one must take time to read. A first read this novel in junior high, devouring every page, immersed in the tragedy and the triumphs that Scarlett faced during what must have been the hardest time for Americans in the nineteenth century. Similarily, the movie, in my opinion, related to the Americans of the 30's, having gone through the Depression, looking forward for resurrection and triumph despite all odds. As Scarlett's motto and unforgettable creed went, &quot;Tomorrow is another day.&quot; Themes of hope, nostalgia and unrequited love abound in this masterful story. I hope you read the novel if you have not and then view the film, rather than other way around. I saw the film first, then read the novel. You will find how DIFFERENT the book is from the movie, and how much more grandeur there is in the novel and how much more developed the characters are (i.e. Scarlett is supposed to have had children with her two husbands before her marriage to Butler). It was not difficul to imagine the characters in the novel looking and speaking as the actors did in the film - Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, etc. But if you read closely, the characters are definately Southern, bourgeois, prudish, scandalous and quite Victorian in manners. Five stars for the great American novel, five stars for Margaret Mitchell. Gone With The Wind has stood the test of time."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Okay. Raise your hands. How many have seen the movie but not read the book? Come on raise em! I thought so. I'm not taking anything away from the film. I love it, one of my favorites, watched it a gazillion times, but I just read the book for the 2nd time, the first time was, well long time ago. Even though I thought I knew the whole story, I realized there was so much more to the characters and the story.This tale of the South begins on the eve of the Civil War, and centers around a Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara. Scarlett is a young Belle, with many beau. The young men are buzzing around her. She is the daughter of a wealthy plantation owner, she is spoiled,concieted, and shallow. Her sole purpose in life is to look good and catch a worthy husband.She has hope only for one though,Ashley Wilkes, who is bethrothed to Melanie Hamilton. Her whole life changes, as war breaks out, the Yankees are winning, many of her beau are dieing in the war. She is forced to do things,never in her life would she have thought she must. She must nurse the wounded, work her father's plantation, (as most of the slaves have been set free by the Yankees, or have just run off),she must care for her family, and save the faimly home from the Yankees. Even as the war ends, she still must continue to keep \\"Tara\\" (the family plantation) out of the hands of Carpetbaggers, and Scalliwags.Scarlett at her young and tender age will do whatever it takes to keep from going hungry and tattered like the rest of the southerners. This includes taking up with the likes of one Rhett Butler. Although the rest of Atlanta see's him as a low life friend to the Yankees, Scarlett see him as a means to end.He is rich, and like Scarlett doesnt really care what anyone else thinks. Rhett comes in and out of her life over the next several years always seeming to come to her resue, and they eventually marry, but not, according to Scarlett for love.Throughout the story we see Scarlett getting stronger with every tradgedy that besets her, and there are many. The loss of her parents, 2 husbands, a child, and of course the war. But what we also see is the loss of her youth and and the way of life she was born to have. In their place we see courage and tenacity,a woman who could run her own business (unheard of in those days), a woman who could shoulder anything that might come her way.It takes the death of Melanie for Scarlett to realize, what she already has in her life that is good. But is it too late?As I mentioned in the beginning, there is so much more in the book then you will see in the movie. There is a depth in some of the characters, like Melanie and Gerald O'hara(Scarlett's father), and more light is shed upon the relationship between the planatation owners and the slaves, we understand Scarlett,and her love for the land a little more, and see more to Rhett. There are other characters too, important to the lives of the main characters, Scarlett has two children besides Bonnie, there is a convict that has entered the lives of all, and the realtionship with Mammy is touched on more so than in the movie. Mrs. Mitchell never forgets to give us descriptions of the land,the war, and the people that will stick with you. We also get more of the history of the war and it's ravages on the South, the aftermath, the formation of \\"The Klan\\", and much more.Although we might disagree with the politics of the story, like how women were thought of, or the treatment of African American as slaves, Mrs. Mitchell paints us a clear vision of how things were. It was an era in American History that is, well, \\"Gone With The Wind\\"If you have never read this book or seen the movie, I tried only to give a taste of the story. I hope it has wet your appetite, read the book first, you won't be able to put it down.You will get lost in another time and place.If you have only seen the movie, this will fill in the blanks for you, and you can picture the faces and voices of the characters you know.Happy reading........Laurie P.S. There is also a wonderful sequel to the story calledScarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's \\"Gone With the Wind\\", by Alexandra Ripley(see my review for book details)"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is, beyond all doubt, the greatest novel of all time. It has everything: characters that leap off the pages, a thrillling plot, a powerful philosophy, and a universality that extends beyond the events it catalogues. This is an epic of mammoth proportions that tells not only one story but explores a whole way of living. I wept, cried, and laughed reading this book. This is more than a novel, it is a manual for living. This is not because the characters are perfect or even wholly admirable but because through their experiences we have the opportunity of seeing the world through a completely new lens. Add to this the fact that Scarlett and Rhett have one of the most exciting romances of all time and through this novel we literally have the opportunity to relive the passionate struggles of the Civil War. More than being a story about North and South, it is a story about rising out of the ashes of your own destruction and fighting on when all hope is gone. This is truly a novel that everyone should read. It made me a stronger person and taught me that no matter how bad things get, &quot;Tomorrow is another day.&quot;"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I still love it! and it is still remains my favorite novel. I read this as a teenager, and now again 30 years later. To me, it is one of those books that makes me sad for people who don't read, who miss out on the profound life altering and enjoyable experience that books can bring.After reading it again, later in life, I see that it was a book that could have been a huge influence to my early thinking. When I was in High School, early 70's, I was the only one of my friends and family who spoke out against racism... and in a time of racial riots, high emotion and tensions. Racism has always been a passionate issue for me...also woman's issues. The unfairness and stupidities, some blatantly obvious to me, and some not so obvious. Some discrimination I was unaware of for years, even though I looked for them, and was super sensitized to them. But we were all so brain washed, right from the cradle. It is still an evolving process of enlightenment, and will be for a long time to come. These issues have been such passionate issues for me... I now believe, after reading it again, that Gone With the Wind, has been one of those books, that did help inspire my thinking in those formative years. Margaret Mitchell was a great and courageous thinker....before her time. Her insights and knowledge on the Civil War in particular, were impressive for a woman of her times. Her thoughts of the motivations and impetuous behind wars, and the tearing down and building up of civilizations, is inspiring and thought provoking.In the character of Scarlet O'Hara, the rebellious, courageous, strong, engaging, not so sweet Southern bell, she wonderfully sheds light on the foolish traditions and conventions of society, particularly for the women in that unique disintegrating society of Southern Gentility. I think, the brilliance in the creation of that character and the story line allows her to get away with a very feminist and enlightened attitude, that I am sure was still very unpopular, but struggling to get free, in the 1920s and 30's.Also the ambiguities of racism, that existed in the North and the South, she subtly weaves in and about her story. All of it led me to wonder what the attitudes were in Margaret Mitchell's day, and what reading materials had shaped her thinking, during her life.To think that it was her first novel is mind boggling to me. Her thoughts and ideas are still timely today and indeed are timeless. I feel we missed out on some great works when she lost confidence in herself and refused to write again, then was killed so young. Maybe she just lost her heart and spirit, fighting to be herself in a hostile world toward women, and became a burnt out blazing star. I think she was someone I could've related to (not saying that I am a burnt out star LOL, maybe a burnt out light bulb LOL) I would have liked to have known her. She was an independent, rebellious spirit, intolerant of stupid ideas, conventions and traditions imposed by society, which only serves to keep certain segments of the population in control, of men and the wealthy.For a Southern Bell to have had such spirit, passion and intelligence, must have been very hard and lonely for Margaret Mitchell, during her lifetime. She was obviously a very thoughtful and well read person. She must have put up a good fight, I am sure, for her day and circumstances, she must have come up against a lot, and must've certainly been a very special person as well as gifted and talented.Through her skillfull and inspired writing, it was like she was actually there, a witness of the times.... maybe when she conceived the idea for the novel, or maybe, as a young child, civil war veterans could still have been alive and telling stories to her personally ... just think ... wow ... A great book, thought provoking, exciting, informative, and just plain good story telling. I could really imagine the feel and taste of the gritty dusty roads, smell the mud from the rain and the horse dung on the streets, I could imagine hunger, what hominy tastes like, what tight stays feel like, what an unwashed man smells like, I could imagine what the countryside, farms and cityscapes were like, the sounds, sights and smells. The whole experience inflamed my imagination and absorbed my mind.My only criticism of the book is that it could have been edited a little better, some areas were repetitive, but really it only adds to the charm of the book. If it was too perfect it would have been too sterile and may have missed some of the innocence of emotion that carried through. I am glad I read it again....Kathy Struewing"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is very good, and a page turner. Although many people say that the book is racist, and the author must be too, hardly anyone knows the truth about Margaret Mitchell. She started a program to help get African Americans into college, and that before her time, when there was still lots of prejudice going on.

It is a long book, but I read it quickly. Everytime the story started to slow down, something big happened which brought the momentum back.I would like to warn potential readers however that this not a book to read if you want to sit back and have a relaxing read. The book has a story that is very tumultuous and at times sad. This book is one of the most dramatic books I have read.The book follows the life of a 16 year-old girl in Confederate Georgia called Scarlett O'hara. She is attractive both physically and in the manner in which she acts. I had a huge crush on her when I was reading the book. She wants desperately to marry a young man called Ashley Wilkes who is engaged to a nice girl called Melanie.The book has a number of characters that appear in it also. The most noteworthy is Rhett Butler. Rhett Butler is a speculator who becomes a hero in Georgia for bringing supplies and goods to it through the Union blockade. Although people are grateful to him for bringing in supplies and goods, some have issues with his lack of moral convictions. His character is so macho, he is too macho. To me he seemed like a monster. At the beginning of the book Scarlett has a low opinion of him and I thought that was understandable. I'm a guy, so I don't know what exactly women would think of him, but I suspect that some women might be turned on by his predatory nature viewing him as extremely masculine.Although Scarlett is more physically attractive than Melanie, the girl Ashley Wilkes is engaged to, I actually thought that Melanie was more romantic than the mean-spirited Scarlett O'hara. At times I really felt bad for Melanie who wasn't loved enough by Ashley.\\"Gone with the Wind\\" takes place during the Civil War and fortunately it doesn't romanticize it. The book makes it clear that many soldiers were coming home maimed or crippled. The book shows that the Civil War was a gruesome conflict.From reading about Scarlett O'hara in \\"Gone with the Wind\\" I feel that I got a real insight into how women like her think. I now know that such women are not entirely noble although they may claim to be."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I purchased Gone with the Wind (paperback) for my wife's 58th birthday because she had finally worn out the copy she has read repeatedly over the years since high school.

BUY YOUR COPY ALREADY."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Epic about the Civil War and Reconstruction and a southern belle named Scarlett O'Hara. She goes through three marriages, children, murder and incredible hardships but pulls through. A lot of people don't know this but it won a Pulitzer Pize for fiction in 1937. Everybody knows about the movie that came out in 1939 and is now a classic.I'm not a fan of romance novels OR historical fiction but I LOVE this book. It shows truthfully (I heard) what the South was like before and after the war. It explains the rites and passages of that era...but never in a boring or leaden manner. Author Margaret Mitchell does it in a matter of fact manner that makes it easily accessible. She makes the characters seem like real people (even though Melanie is a little bit TOO saint-like) and draws you into their troubles and worries. Also I've seen the movie at least nine times and this compares favorably to it. There are some significant changes--Scarlett is 16 in the book, she has THREE children and is desribed as not being pretty (which Vivien Leigh certainly was in the movie), but they're minor. In fact the book helps explain some things that were left out of the movie and clarifies some of the actions of certain characters. But, even on its own, it's a GREAT book. VERY long but never dull. A classic. Pick this one up. Ignore the dreadful sequel \\"Scarlett\\"."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"After finishing Margaret Mitchell's first and only novel, the one that landed her a Pulitzer Prize and was adapted into a film that is considered one of the best movies of all time, I felt what was to be expected: completely exhausted. Obviously a book this size cannot be completed in one sitting, and (since I was determined not to rush it) it took me the better part of two weeks to get through it; two weeks to struggle through the American Civil War and its aftermaths, not to mention the tempestuous relationship between four larger-than-life individuals: Melanie Hamilton, Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes and the infamous Scarlett O'Hara.Of course, I use the word \\"struggle\\" in a good way, as this is a book that sucks you up into the trials and tribulations of the time, and spits you out the other side. By its end, I was completely drained, something that no book has left me sinceTess of the D'ubervilles: 2500 Headwords (Oxford Bookworms Library).Scarlett O'Hara is a young Southern belle, one of the most popular debutantes in her community. Although she has power over almost every single young man she knows, one continues to elude her. She has loved Ashley Wilkes since she was fourteen years old, and reacts badly when she hears that he is to be married to Melanie Wilkes - a timid young woman that Scarlett despises.After loosing her temper with Ashley (after her declarations of love to him are not reciprocated, despite an admission that he *does* care for her), she is humiliated to find that their encounter was secretly witnessed by the amoral Captain Rhett Butler, a man with a bad reputation who seems oddly amused at Scarlett's conduct. Furious at both men and incapable of understanding either, Scarlett is barely of aware of the political tensions rising around her.Yet Scarlett is about to be swept up in a conflict far beyond the confines of her heart: the Confederacy and the Yankees have declared war, and her entire world is thrown into chaos. Life is whittled down to its most basic elements: hunger, death, love, birth, morals and - paramount to this particular story - survival. In particular, a question that arises during the story is (particularly in relation to Scarlett), what is survival worth?In creating Scarlett, Mitchell has created one of the most intriguing literary figures of all time. Spoilt, selfish, practical, driven, determined, passionate and often unforgivably short-sighted, Scarlett is an individual whose desire for comfort and security gradually erode away at any sense of right and wrong, her development as a complete individual, and her even personal dignity. Just as Macbeth had his ambition and Othello had his jealously, Scarlett's fatal flaw is her inability to *understand*.She does not understand any of the three most important people in her life (Melanie, Ashley and Rhett), she does not understand her own people or what drives them (she is frustrated at their blind ability to the Cause), and she does not understand the sacrifices that must be made in order for her to find contentment...that is, she does not understand until it is too late.This is character study at its most nuanced, for Scarlett is totally believable and understandable, even when she's doing morally reprehensible things. At the beginning of the novel, her faults are somewhat amusing - the fact that she hates the war mostly because it deprives her of the luxury that she loves, and that she loves Ashley even though she finds him unfathomable.Later though, it takes on a more tragic air, as inner peace continues to elude her and we gradually discover the loneliness that comes with total self-interest. It's beautiful, haunting, heart-rending stuff.However, as it seems with every famous book, there is some controversy and it largely concerns Mitchell's treatment of the pre-war South. Mitchell would love to have us believe that the pre-war South was a golden age of chivalrous landowners that treated their ladies like jewels and their slaves like children. When their society is swept away by the winds of war, we are meant to feel grief, as though a living thing has been snuffed out and its memory slowly dying in the remnants of the people who are left to linger on. Ultimately the book is what it is, and I would certainly still recommend it despite some of its dated and overly-romantic views of the South.I actually watched the movie before reading the novel (it was want wanted me to get hold of the book), and I must say that the two go hand in hand. After reading the book I realized how spot-on the choices in casting the movie were, and it was interesting to see what elements of the book the screenwriters decided to cut; semi-important characters like Will Benteen and Archie, and events like the Yankees raiding Tara and circumstances surrounding Gerald's death. Most surprising in the book was the fact that Scarlett actually had three children, one to each of her husbands. The movie kept only Bonnie, and to be honest, I could understand why this decision was made, considering Wade and Ella have very little to do in the story, and are largely ignored, by the author as well as their mother.Ultimately, the driving force in the book is not the attention to historical detail, the clear and vivid prose, or the weight of grandeur and importance that lies on every page; it is the complex and fascinating relationship between the four major characters: the angelic Melanie, the noble Ashley, the rakish Rhett and the driven Scarlett - and I don't just mean how Scarlett relates to each of them. Just as intriguing is Rhett's admiration and protectiveness toward Melanie, Melanie's blind devotion to Scarlett, and the fact that Rhett and Ashley are uncannily similar in thought, though not deed. The quartet makes up one of the most tangled and intriguing set of relationships ever put to paper, and that alone is worth the time it will take to read \\"Gone with the Wind\\"."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Atlanta, Georgia- No other book has defined the south more than Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell. Growing up in the south, I deemed it was time to sit down and read this classic which is in celebrating seventy five years in print.In the 75th Anniversary addition, Pat Conroy write a preface where he chronicles how this book was a bond between he and his mother as she would read it to him and how it profoundly influenced his writings.With over a 900 pages, it is a brick of a book but it does masterfully captures the consequences of what we refer in the south as \\"the war of northern aggression\\".The principle character Scarlett evolves from a young women ready to be conquered by a wide array of suitors. Her love Ashley has been wooed away and she spends a lifetime trying to pave her way. The allusive Rhett Butler fails to conquer this steel magnolia who always keeps hope alive by reiterating that tomorrow is a new day.Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell takes you to the allure of the gentile world of the south.

In my opinion, it is the greatest novel ever written. When I first read GWTW, I couldn't wait to get to the parts about Scarlett and Rhett. Now, though I still love the interplay between them, I read it for the incredible detail to history. Margaret Mitchell grew up sitting on the knees of old confederate soldiers while they reminisced about the war, then took that treasure and masterfully provided a moving account of the war and it's aftermath through the eyes of Scarlett O'Hara. The wonderful thing is that she is able to give this history lesson all wrapped up in the greatest love story of all times! All the characters are memorable - Mammy, Gerald O'Hara, Ashley, Melanie, not to mention the near-perfect man, Rhett Butler! And then there is Scarlett... While many people who have only seen the movie don't like Scarlett, no one who reads the book can help but admire her sheer determination to overcome the tragedy of the war and rebuild her life. At the same time, it is heart wrenching to see her throwing away the love of her true soul mate and ruining her life because of the fears the war sprouted in her. I admire Scarlett on many levels, and think she is the most vivid heroine in literature because of her failings and her strength. If you could capture Scarlett's fire and Melanie's kindness and roll them into one woman, she could rule the world and be adored by all.

Margaret Mitchell created an amazing story, romance saga of love and the most sentimental portrait of the Civil War. \\"Gone with the Wind\\" in my opinion is deserving of a five-star rating, because it is by far the greatest story ever written. Mitchell's \\"Gone with the Wind\\" is the story of Scarlett O'Hara, a spoiled southern beautiful woman, whose life is suddenly caught up in the turmoil of the American Civil War. Through her fights during the war and the six years of Reconstruction that follow, author showed her life pass through three husbands and three children. Within this background, we observe Scarlett's conflict against external and internal conflicts, her losses, gains, and hopes. Author described bright vivid characters and relationship between people, but she did not attach great importance to some problem, such as slavery; the book is very interesting and I certainly would recommend it to just about anyone.\\"Gone with the Wind\\" by Margaret Mitchell is a war novel, a historical romance, a comedy of manners, a bitter lamentation, a cry of the heart, and a long, cold-hearted look at the character of this one lovely woman. It is undoubtedly the classic novel of Civil War. The major characteristic that enables it to achieve its seriousness also criticizes Scarlett O'Hara to a life of unrequited love and dooms her potential for happiness with Rhett Butler. Mitchell created the character, Scarlett, wonderfully. She had spunk, determination, intelligence, and selfishness-traits that made her personality interesting. If Scarlett needs something bad enough, she will not hesitate to throw away proper social conduct or her own personal goals. She does what ever she needs to get her by. Then there is Rhett. He is this attractive man who is no gentleman. He brought a little bit of light into the dark parts of the book. He seems to be just a rude, ill-behaved man at first, but later his character is deep and full of emotion and feelings. Margaret Mitchell created a bond and passion between these two characters. It was a wonderful romance, with love and anger-a sort of bittersweet romance. Although Scarlett is a strong and independent woman, most people can relate to her because she makes mistakes like a normal human. This book examines different types of strength. Whether it is Mammy's honorable courage and dignity, or Rhett's keen level-headedness, or Melanie's Christian devotion to people, each person has his or her own root from which they draw their strength.The perspective is strength because it permits the author to vividly portray the destruction of Southern society better than any battlefield-centered novel could. Unfortunately, it also leaves the author, and therefore Scarlet as well, incapable of understanding the male characters. They are merely personalities that fade in-and-out of the background to shape the narrative. While they are characters that can stand up off the page and cast a shadow, there is no tone or timbre in their images. Some author's descriptions of the reconstruction are degraded. For example, blacks were only happy being slaves. Big Sam says he had enough of freedom and wants to go back to Tara. He even states doubtfully that while in the north whites wanted him to sit at the table like he was their equal, but he could not do it because he is not the equal to whites. At one point Mitchell is describing how the southern whites hate the Yankees so much because the Yankees have money and food and power and they do not, yet she does not have any sense of irony to see that the whites are in the position that they put the slaves in for centuries.If someone loves historical fiction with a little romance, this book is perfect for their. The writing is superb, and the plot is dramatic and sad, but it includes enough of Scarlett's triumphs of strength that sets it apart from all other books. Scarlett O'Hara is the perfect Southern belle who is incredible to read about. How she attracts men with her charm and little helpless acts is unbelievable. She is used to having slaves serve her and she treats them with little or no respect until she needs them. One cannot stop thinking about how much they would hate Scarlet if she was real, but they are not able to stop feeling sorry for her and they want to help her to realize how stupid she is. This is a must read for any person who loves classic literature.\\"Gone with the Wind\\" is really one of the world's most well written romance novels. Set in the backdrop of the American Civil War in the eighteen century, it tells the story of the people who fought for survival during the War and the Reconstruction Period through sheer shrewd wits and cunning business methods. Margaret Mitchell is an absolute talent. She was nowhere close to the cheap romance writer many had portrayed her to be- she was a realist. She was actually writing about how human spirit and determination, how it can be applied to help one over such obstacles. Mitchell's book broke sales records. Within a year of publication, 1,383,000 copies had been sold. Today, sales stand at over 21,000,000. In 1937 \\"Gone with the Wind\\" was awarded the Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is the first phrase in the book to describe the spoiled Scarlett O' Hara, who was made immoral by Viven Leigh in the movie verison of ' Gone with the Wind' ( 1939 ). The book is 1024 pages, which is long, but the book is so good, you wouldn't even realize how many pages there are, and you'll be asking for more.The story is about a spoiled Southern Belle named Scarlett O' Hara, who lives in Georgia on her family Plantion, and basically lives the life of a southern belle of her time ( mid-1800's ). Scarlett gets anything she wants, all she has to do is bat her eyelashes. But the one man she wants, Ashley Hamiltion, she can't give. No matter how hard she trys, she just can't get him, and to make matters worst. He's marrying the mousy-type Melanie. Scarlett than goes through the rest of the book, trying to get Ashley through revenge and through her love. Along the way, she meets the handsome Rhett Butler, the man who truly wants to be the only one for Scarlett, but knows he never can.If your fan of the movie ( like I am before I read the book ), then you would notice BIG differences between the two. But the book describes each character perfectly, Scarlett is even more interesting to read about. For movie fans, hearing Scarlett's thoughts is even more of a treat. I'll recommend this book to ANYONE."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Margaret Mitchell was born in Atlanta in November 1900. When she was around thirteen, her family, affluent but not wealthy, moved into a big house on Peachtree Street, one of the principal settings for Gone with the Wind, which she began writing in 1926. The Macmillan Company published Gone with the Wind in May 1936; it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. The movie, which won ten Academy Awards, premiered in Atlantic City on December 15, 1939.I read the &#65533;Special Commemorative 60th-Anniversary Edition&#65533; (paperback) purchased from Amazon.com in February 2003, which commemorates the film, not the book. The back cover of that edition quotes the Washington Post claiming it&#65533;s &#65533;The greatest love story of our time, the story of Scarlett O&#65533;Hara and Rhett Butler&#65533;.&#65533; I suspect the person who wrote that saw the movie, but did not read the book. If it&#65533;s the love story that interests you, I suggest you buy the video. If you want to understand the origins of the South&#65533;s point of view though, at least the upper middle class Georgian point of view, then read this book.I was raised in Connecticut and have been often perplexed by the notions of some of my Southern white peers, puzzled for example by the intractable bigotry of intelligent people who are unwilling to understand that they ought to know better. Conversely, I&#65533;ve admired the generous, unselfish, seemingly pointless hospitality given me by a Southern adversary, a rival, so incongruent that it smacked of hypocrisy. Having read Gone with the Wind, I&#65533;m less perplexed and puzzled now. These people were bred on deep roots.Margaret Mitchell fashioned her novel from stories about slavery, the Civil War, reconstruction and abolition told by those who had survived those dramatic events. The people who lived through those terrible times, or their children, told those stories. From these tales, Margaret Mitchell painted a broad panorama of a culture in forced transformation: The brutal and reprehensible conduct of the Yankees, the greed of the carpetbaggers, the noble origins of the KKK, and the corruption of the North&#65533;s reconstruction. It is Southern noblesse telling the story of their decline. Margaret Mitchell is their apologist.The paperback version I read has 1024 pages of small type with narrow margins. Mitchell&#65533;s writing is sometimes exciting, but often it&#65533;s tedious. Descriptions tend to be excessive, and dialogue is often more like monologue. This style may have been fashionable fifty years ago, but I&#65533;ll deduct a star for it today."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"WOW~ There is barely enough words to describe how great it is, so I say, Thank You Margret Mitchell, for such a wonderful book.

She was a person of her place and time. There were no documentaries to compete with \\"Birth of a Nation,\\" no internet, and entire towns were segregated. Most white people never heard the other side of the story. Who is to say what Mitchell's attitudes would be today? Probably, like most of the country, she would have become much more thoughtful.While it's tough not to cringe at the casual use of the n-word and \\"darky\\" in the book, it is what Mitchell knew. Even sweet, precious Melanie decried going up north because her son would have to go to school with \\"pickaninnies.\\" Forgiving her for romanticizing a vile, inhuman system that degraded women of all colors, \\"crackers,\\" and black men is easy, because she knew little else. There is no excuse for the twits who swoon over the book and ignore inconvenient facts, because they know better (or should).It takes nothing away from the fact that Mitchell was an awesome writer who could bring characters and settings to life like nobody else.

The only reason why one might hesitate to read the book is, it was written by a Southener and you do have to endure insults hurled upon the \\"darkies\\".

The book however is far better. I was so spellbound by this novel that it put the movie to shame (although I am still in love with the movie).The words of Margaret Mitchell combined with the voice naration of Linda Stephens sets an imaginative scene unlike any other. I will admit there were a couple areas in this audio book that somewhat dragged a little and there were other parts where Linda Stephens' voice dramatized a little too far.Margaret Mithchell wrote a breathtaking novel of true passion combined with the overwhelming heartache and the meaning of love in it's finest. And Linda Stephens brings out the roll of each charactor, each with a pitch of their own.Chapter by chapter leads out the fall of selfishness, the depth of passion and the power one has in the will to correct. Gone With the Wind portrays how one [Scarlett O'Hara], like so many can blind themselves in seeking to gain wealth of money and false imagination - where as it can fool (time and time again) to throw away the richest love one could ever gain."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"\\".....Was Tara still standing?

The book is still worth reading today as Mitchell very skillfully brings to life the years just before during and after the Civil War from the viewpoint of white Georgians. When Mitchell started writing this book the Civil War had only been over less than seventy years (very comparable to a contemporary author writing about the events surrounding World War II) and the country was very deeply divided between North and South. Mitchell's Southern sympathies and prejudices are often very apparent and the modern reader needs to realize the author was a product of her time and not be so easily offended that they can not enjoy what the book has to offer. Mitchell created many memorable characters in her novel and though it has been called a \\"soap opera\\" the situations and characterizations are not unrealistic and the historical research is sound."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"It is a long book and oft discussed with over six hundred reviews, thus this is not an attempt to give a general, overall review. But there is a point I'd like to discuss:I was amused at several of the comments written by other reviewers regarding the point of view in Gone With the Wind. It is easy to only watch the movie and quickly read the book and leave with the wrong impression of what Mitchell wanted to portray about Southern culture and Southern values.But if the reader takes his or her time and carefully reads the passages, a very different picture of the antebellum south comes about. Pay particular attention to the dialogues between Scarlett and her mammy, and Scarlett and Rhett, and even Ashley. Scarlett routinely complains at having to act like a simpleton in order to win men's attention, and having to conceal her often much brighter \\"smartness\\" (I hesitate to use the word intelligence here, because, Scarlett, for all her skills and quick smartness, probably doesn't qualify as an intelligent person) in fear of scaring away potential suitors.The antebellum upper class woman, as portrayed by Mitchell, was a dainty flower, but one whose life was heavily circumscribed by the social expectations of the men. Mitchell points out the juxtaposition between plantation mistresses being expected to appear to the public as dainty china objects, yet behind the scenes be expected to manage large plantations, oversee dozens or hundreds of slaves, and deal with the everyday facts of nature (such as childbirth and sickness). Ellen O'Hara is portrayed as the archetypical plantation mistress who successfully pulls off this image: while her husband spends his day hunting and riding horses and drinking whisky, Ellen had a dawn to midnight existence as a tireless manager of a plantation, and \\"her hands were never seen still.\\"To some people it seems that Mitchell idolized certain aspects of antebellum southern culture-the theatre of manners that the southern upper class created for themselves, but the author was well aware and effectively portrayed to the reader how limiting it was to women. In fact, it was only with the destruction of the plantation world and the class of chivalry that Scarlett, her main character, was effectively liberalized. It is very much a feminist novel in the sense that it is the woman who succeeds (at least materialistically) when most men around her failed.The issue of slavery is a relatively minor one in the book, and not one that Mitchell discussed to great lengths. However, one must keep in mind that the book portrays the views of the upper class aristocracy class, and it is interesting to note that despite the supposed benevolence of the O'Haras and their neighbors, of the 100+ slaves at Tara before the war, only four remained to stay with their old masters. Mitchell did not get into great details on the brutality of slavery before the war or of white-black relationships, but she didn't completely ignore it either. During a scene when Scarlett visits several neighbors (all women) on a nearby plantation after Sherman and his army had passed through, one of the women mentioned how all the black women had gone off riding behind the Yankee soldiers, and that they'll get nothing but yellow babies out of it. The other ladies, shocked at the bringing up of a delicate topic, hushed her, but old Grandma Fontaine retorted back with, \\"We've all seen yellow babies before and we know what it means.\\"There is, of course, Rhett Butler's consistent disparaging of Southern culture and southern values.Mitchell did not idealize the antebellum south, far from it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With the Wind is novel of epic proportions, and it does read like a soap opera. Then again, so does every book this long (try War and Peace sometime). This book examines a spoiled, ante-bellum socialite who has never had to lift a finger and the way she deals with utter poverty, death, and tragedy all around her. The book does have its flaws, which I will touch on in a moment, but it should be read simply for Scarlett's struggle. Yes, she is rude, mean, and a generally selfish and scheming woman, but she also a paragon of strength who simply refuses to bow to anyone. Throughout the book, people say that Sherman himself should beware of Scarlett, and they're right.Getting away from Scarlett--difficult in this novel--there are several other main characters. Rhett-the only man she cannot lure with her charms, Ashley-the only man she cannot get with her charms, and Melanie-Ashley's saintly wife--the antithesis of Scarlett, whom Scarlett hates but feels compelled to help.Much of this book is somewhat depressing, reading about hunger, toiling in the fields, working on the sick, but it does make you appreciate what you have.Now, for the flaws. First, the big one: Racism. Yes, this book is racist, but, for heaven's sake, it was written in 1936 by a woman from Atlanta who had been raised with her antebellum grandmothers. It's set in the Civil War, and it does accurately portray the feelings of whites at the time. Some of the black sentiments (&quot;Gee, Miss Scarlett, I wouldn't know what to do without you telling me&quot;) are a little incredulous, but there were some plantation owners who were nice to their slaves. Of course, the ones who get publicity were the evil ones. While evil slave owners did exist, this book is not about them, and it should be taken at face value. No, it isn't politically correct, but it wasn't meant to be. If you only want politically correct books, then you really can't even read the Bible.Other flaws: the subjecation of women to men (think of the time era again), the length (some descriptive parts can be skipped), and the many plots (watch the movie as you go to keep it all together).Other than these few things mentioned, this book is a marvelous example of Southern literature, but don't take it as a historical novel of the Civil War because it wasn't meant to be that. It's the story of one woman's refusal to surrender to whatever comes her way. It just happens to take place during the Civil War. It could have happened during the American Revolution; it just didn't. Also, it leaves you with a serious debate with yourself: Scarlett--justified or evil? Yes, she gets her riches and life back while everyone else mopes, but they eventually get their lives back as well--they just didn't demean themselves. Rare is the book that makes you question your own thoughts on the main character."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"ARGUABLY one of the greatest romance novels ever written, Margaret Mitchell's Gone With The Wind is also a quintessential war anecdote.I found nothing more powerful than to read of an American war set in 1864 and hear the television espousing our current warfare in the background - some things don't change.The vivacious, yet practical-minded, Scarlett O'Hara is a clean slate for Mitchell to mar with the outset of war, providing a powerful metaphor for generations to come.Unfortunately, many young people are not introduced to such classic literature and the distinct and poignant parallels between the American Civil War and the current Gulf War II may be left undiscovered.Considering her novel was written in 1936, it is easy to confuse her ability to evoke such universal emotions for modernity.Mitchell's delicate portrayal of the South set against the harsh backdrop of war can still be affiliated to by readers in the 21st Century.Reasoning war, censoring protestors or 'speculators', and anticipated outcomes are adeptly constructed by Mitchell that you wonder how predictable human nature must be.\\"All wars are sacred... To those who have to fight them. If the people who started wars didn't make them sacred, who would be foolish enough to fight?\\"It's such honesty, in a time of ettiquette and refinery, that makes the abhorrent Rhett Butler such a formidable character.Coercing the seductress to dispense of typically Southern notions, Rhett epitomises the way a war will corrupt and educate a sentimental nation.Mitchell presents her flawed characters with affection. You may find Scarlett simple and Rhett a rogue, but you come to love what they add to this charged scene.Gone With The Wind should hardly be dismissed because of its romantic formula and age. This book is timeless and has much to teach younger readers."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I read this book two years ago during the summer I was fourteen. It was definitely one of the best books I ever read, and I don't think I would be me today without the influence of Gone With the Wind. Margaret Mitchell is a witch with a pen; her thrilling story of Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, and Tara is as compelling as it is frightening. You love every character and hate them at the same time while next to them you feel their pain, their longing, their heartache, their confusion, their human wickedness, and their love.Two warnings: I made the mistake of reading the ending of the book before I got to it. I didn't understand the ending but thought I did, so it ruined not only the completion but also my enjoyment of a matchless masterpiece. Do not, under any circumstances, read the ending. Secondly, if you have not seen the movie, don't watch it. If you have, don't be fooled. I read the book long before I saw the movie and felt like a part of GWTW. The movie is supposed to be one of the best ever made, but I was disappointed with it. The characters seemed compromised somehow, and the glory of my imagination was warped.GWTW is a daunting book, but I have not met a person on earth who does not call it a mountain above most. Read the book and love it!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Thirty-two summers ago, I read my Great Aunt Cora's old copy of GWTW. The size was not daunting, even at twelve years old. I lived in Margaret Mitchell's Old South for weeks, shunning the sun as all Southern ladies should. Excitingly, I told my mother that Scarlett just kissed Rhett on the road to Rough and Ready, so they were bound to live happily ever after. I remember her secretive smile like it was yesterday. I still have that old book, and have probably read it more often than Aunt Cora. No other book has ever captivated me to the point that modern customs and places are foreign, while I am at Tara, Twelve Oaks, Aunt PittyPats', and even Belle's! The best of all times for me."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"It was a tale beautifully told.I just finished reading it,and I can't get out of it's spell.The tragic end is absolutely perfect. I'm a person who likes everything to be pleasant,and I expected the end to be a happy one - like Scarlett saying &quot;I love you!&quot; to Rhett and Rhett hugging her and saying he loved her too.I'm not dissappointed,just heart-broken.I didn't cry like one customer says she did,but still the odd feeling in my stomach won't go away yet.As I said,I just put down the book and it's great,even though it left a sinking feeling in my stomach. I can't figure how I can really be happy for an hour or so with this emotion left from the book. Let me tell you - this book is so powerful.I loved it.I feel sadness and pity for Scarlett.It's good that nothing like this really happened and it's just fiction.If you're sad,think like this - it's just a tale,not true,(even though it seems terribly real) and it just added things to your outlook on life and to your literature knowledge. You don't want to lose a moment of your life mourning over a tale that didn't even exist,and Scarlett wouldn't want you to. :)) So just smile,and let that smile be a grateful one to Margaret Michell.She really changed you,didn't she?"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I don't know if there is anything that Margaret Mitchell failed to put into this book. It is obvious that the author poured her entire being into this book and it is evident as you read that this story must have been very close to her heart as it always grabs hold of the hearts of countless readers. The book is written by an obvious historian and gives many details of the way of life of the people of the old south and the Civil War days as well. There is romance, a glimpse into the past, heartbreak, hope, triumph, struggle, life lessons, love, and the story of Scarlett O'Hara that will continue to live in the hearts of readers for generations to come.

Its main characters include Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler, from whose point of view the story is told, the charming and fickle Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes, the object of Scarlett's affection, and his wife, Melly. I say, if you read only one book in your life, this should be it!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Margaret Mitchell's characters are very real and life like. Scarlett is never portrayed as perfect. Rather, the change from the young belle of Tara to the poverty-stricken lumber dealer and then to a lady sitting on a mountain of wealth shows her faults. The infamous Captain Rhett Butler always finds Scarlett. As her hatred for him increases, the more the reader sees the love between them that she is blind to.

I can only say that the book was not a disappointment. Scarlett O'Hara is the kind of character that you hate one minute and love the next.

While the book may be rather long, you won't be able to put it down once you start it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"GWTW is, by far, the greatest romantic piece of historical literature ever published. It takes into account the psychological drama of an egotistical teenage girl coming of age as her world falls apart. Scarlett is portrayed with many imperfections (just as we all have), but in the end she sees the error of her ways. It is an American classic because of its representation of our societies obssession with self, and I believe everyone can see at least a piece of themselves in her, which is what makes the story so compelling. I read it for the first time at the age of 13, and 12 years later it continues to stand as the greatest novel ever written in my mind. I recommend it to anyone interested in analyzing a seemingly bad character and finding the reason behind their actions."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone with the Wind was truly the best novel I have ever read and by far my favorite. Margaret Mitchell described every little detail so one could see it vividly, even if it was only in one's imagination. The characters were very much like real people and that is something not all author's are able to accomplish. The sequel, although it was a good effort, could not compare to the original. I think Gone with the Wind is a novel that everyone should read. If you haven't already read GWTW, then you don't know what you are missing. :-) :-)"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is incredible in every way! When I read it the first time, I became obsessed and was transported back to that era.

As large as the novel is, you won't regret a single moment you spend reading it. I recomend Gone with the Wind to anyone, especially anyone who loves to be transported to another time and place!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Every time I read this novel, it makes me stop and think how there could be so few genuinley talented people on this earth, with someone like Ms. Mitchell to set such a fine example. Her ability to make the characters jump out from the pages is astounding. Her description of raw, human emotion move Scarlett from haughty, capricious and naive, to indignant, through livid and past loquaciously melancholy. This novel is unforgettably and extraodinarily real, penetrating, and poignant. And as for the sequel, A.R.'s 'Scarlett', I think it was great. Obviously not as good as the original, but the effort was recognized and well noted. (I hope that doesn't in any way sound patronizing). I recommend both novels to all ages, and regardless of what type of books you usually like to read.

It is an immortal novel and people of all ages will continue enjoying it. Even those like me, who are not Americans will enjoy it because it is a novel for all nations. Every nation passes through a revolution or massive change atleast once in its history which turns the structure of its society upside down as shown in this novel. All the emotions portrayed so beautifully in this novel like love, hate, determination, a will to fight and struggle are universal.

I've read all the classics, and I even know some Literary Theory. Gone With the Wind? Pul-lease, racist, sexist, revanchist trash, made popular by all the young woman dreaming of being Scarlett and having both their Rhett and Ashley. Cheerleader fare. Escapist. WRONG!Gone with the Wind is an American War &amp; Peace. This is serious literature, which won the Pulitzer prize, no less. Most people don't see past the epic plot (which isn't as cut and dried as you may think) or the love story, but this is no less than a successfull attempt to reclaim a discarded culture. It is not about crinoline and lace, it it about the Apocalypse and how losers of the counter-revolution must learn to live in a place where all their politics, personal or civil, are demolished. Scarlett O'Hara is popular because she is an American, driven, materialistic, sentimental and utterly ruthless. Rhett Bulter is the tragic character of this book; the way of life and ideals he disdained are killing him, and he suffers like no one else in this post-apocalyptic landscape. His departure at the end is an act of contrition as much as a romantic failure; he had tried to recreate the materialism of the ante-bellum world, but negeclected the spirituality (such as it is) of men like Ashley Wilkes. Both men, the dreamer and the realist end up alone in a very sterile place. This book is proto-feminist as well. Scarlett survives, even as everything around her dies, but in the end, she too is alone.Don't dumb this masterpiece down. The movie fails to capture even a tenth of the depth here. And that awful sequel! Caused by the mistake that this book is some kind of romance novel. This is Art, and you can't stick a new ending on it, any more than you can a great painting or musical composition."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I've read GWTW many times -once you get going you can't stop!

I'm glad I'm in the company of true 'Windies' so I thought I'd share with you some interesting facts about the book: -Scarlett was originally named Pansy-Scarlett was partly based on Mitchell herself and her grandmother-Rhett was based on Mitchell's first husband Red Upshaw-the initials JRM in her dedication refer to her second husband John Reginald Marsh-Margaret Mitchell maintained the only character taken from real life was Prissy the maid-When asked who she'd like to be in the movie version, Mitchell said 'Prissy'-Like a detective novelist, Mitchell wrote the last chapter first and the first chapter last-GWTW is the only book to sell more copies than the bible-Mitchell nearly went blind just proofreading the manuscript!-Mitchell scrupously researched every detail for GWTW, even going to the town register to ensure there was no Rhett Butler or Scarlett O'Hara alive during the Civil War-The novel took ten years to complete, most of it was written in three-For style, she endeavoured to make her prose so that a five-year old could read it-If she were ever to write a sequel, it would be called 'Back With the Breeze' On that note,please avoid the Ripley penned sequel 'Scarlett', it is atrocious.-Gone with the Wind is my favourite book of all time, and yours too, I hope.

I haven't read this since I was a young girl in the early 70's and should never have waited so long to read it again.

I am going to miss the people I will have to put behind me now that the book has come to an end, Rhett (SIGH), Scarlett, Mammy, Prissy and Aunt Pitty Pat (LOL).The author's use of prose was beautiful, all the scenes and action came alive for me. Some people seem to be offended by the racism in the book, but that's how things were back then.

Appreciating it then, with 'fresh eyes' I share the view that \\"Gone With The Wind\\" is quite simply the most readable long novel of all time. With world-wide sales nudging 25 million, it's probably fair to say that most first-time readers (apart from the odd reviewer here at the world's biggest web site) have shared that opinion in the almost 70 years since Margaret Mitchell wrote her one-and-only book. At least one other, highly readable novelist of the past century, the late James A. Michener certainly felt that way.I'm recalling an interview of thirty years ago in which Michener - a master storyteller in his own right - expressed awe at Mitchell's achievement. I remember Michener quoted a long-forgotten critic who greeted the book's release in 1936 with the perfect, one-sentence summing up: \\"It's the shortest long novel I have ever read!\\" Michener predicted at that time (1975) that \\"critics will forever have to grapple with the problem of why Margaret Mitchell's novel has remained so readable, and so important to so many people.\\"Michener singled out a few of the \\"super-dramatic confrontations\\" so perfectly conjured up in Mitchell's lucid, timeless writing style: Mammy lacing Scarlett into her corset; the wounded at the railway station; Scarlett shooting the Union straggler; the girls making Scarlett a dress from the moss-green velvet draperies; Rhett carrying his wife upstairs to the long-unused bedroom.Yet for all of its amazing drama, the novel does not ultimately depend upon major confrontations for its page-turning momentum: Michener I remember, zeroed in on two 'central' paragraphs which provide the reader with perfect glimpses into the way the two major characters have 'grown' before our eyes within these pages. One of these paragraphs captivates our imagination in about the middle of the book (chapter 29):\\"Somewhere, on the long road that wound through those four years, the girl with her sachet and dancing slippers, had slipped away, and there was left a woman with sharp green eyes, who counted pennies and turned her hands to many menial tasks, a woman to whom nothing was left from the wreckage, except the indestructible red earth on which she stood.\\"And, in the final pages, that indelible portrait of Rhett, age forty-five:\\"He was sunken in his chair, his suit wrinkling untidily against his thickening waist, every line of him proclaiming the ruin of a fine body and the coarsening of a strong face. Drink and dissipation had done their work on the coin-clean profile, and now it was no longer the head of a young pagan prince on newly minted gold, but a decadent, tired Caesar on copper debased by long usage.\\"It's true to say (again as Michener noted thirty years ago) that the weakness of \\"Gone With The Wind\\" is the almost exclusive focus on Atlanta, ignoring the rest of the South: When in fact, it was really the ENTIRE South that changed, \\"altered by war, and defeat, and social upheaval - and stark determination to re-establish itself.\\" Michener astutely observed that GWTW \\"depicts with remarkable felicity, the spiritual history of a region.\\"Most everyone these days would concede that Margaret Mitchell's personal views on the \\"liberation of the former slaves\\" (as expressed in subsequent interviews) were less than compassionate. Nevertheless, it was NOT Mitchell who composed those words which make some of us wince when they're scrolling up the screen in the movie version - words quaintly poetic perhaps, but manifestly insulting to those Americans whose ancestors never mistook the days of slavery as part of some \\"pretty world\\" poignantly longed-for, or in some way better than America today. (This reviewer has a pretty good memory for well-cadenced English prose, and this is his memory of those opening words from some anonymous male screenwriter.)\\"There was a land of cavaliers and cotton fields called the 'Old South.' Here, in this pretty world, gallantry took its last bow. Here was the last ever to be seen of knights and their ladies fair, of master and slave. Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered, a civilization gone with the wind.\\"So much better are the novelist's own words, distilled into so many sentences and paragraphs that positively 'sing' in our memory. Like this one:\\"He swung her off her feet into his arms and started up the stairs. Her head was crushed against his chest and she heard the hard hammering of his heart beneath her ears. He hurt her and she cried out, muffled, frightened. Up the stairs, he went in the utter darkness, up, up, and she was wild with fear.\\"Or this:\\"Hunger gnawed at her empty stomach again, and she said aloud: \\"As God is my witness, as God is my witness, the Yankees aren't going to lick me. I'm going to live through this, and when it's over, I'm never going to be hungry again. No, nor any of my folks. If I have to steal or kill - as God is my witness, I'm never going to be hungry again.\\"-----I have often thought that \\"age twenty-six\\" is the single most important year of any long and healthy lifetime (for too many subjective reasons to list here; but think of the athletes or musicians we've admired when they were at the very summit of their game -- in their twenty-sixth year). So it comes as no surprise to learn that Margaret Mitchell was at that same magic age when she began work on this --- the book another great novelist of the last century would term \\"this long and powerful recollection of her home town - destined to become a titanic tale of human passions, loved around the world\\" . . . (its astonishing impact) \\"a mystery then, and remains one now.\\""},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Growing up in Georgia, I've had a first hand look at the American South. After reading Gone with the Wind, I realized the South hasn't changed that much. We don't have slavery anymore but the lifestyle and traditions remain much the same. THAT is what makes Mitchell's work so enlightening. She relates the Southern Culture better than any other writer barring Pat Conroy. She shows the strength, the loyalty, the compassion, and the gumption of a good southern woman. She also relates the frustration and rebellion at being expected to take a backseat service-oriented role in society and especially in the family. But it doesn't stop there. Mitchell also weaves one heck of a story scattered with some of the most unique and memorable characters in fiction. Characters such as Scarlett O'Hara's love interest Ashley, her bestfriend/worst enemy Melanie (Ashley's wife), and of course the sly Rhett Butler. The book is timeless, the story compelling.A romantic at heart, I appreciate the subtleties of the struggle for love unattained and love unreturned, both of which give this story a personal touch. If you are curious to see why this novel is the 2nd best selling book in the world next to the Bible, pick it up and expect a long, complex story with unforgettable characters, a glimpse of a fleeting culture, and prose that tastes like an expensive red wine."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Margaret Mitchell wrote, for her first book (an earlier work, called &quot;Lost Laysen&quot; has since been published), an exhaustingly researched, wide-ranging, exciting and thrilling book set in the Civil War. This book - Gone With The Wind - was a runaway success; and ultimately made into the biggest movie of its day. Alright, let's admit it, by modern standards it's sexist, racist, overblown, and melodramatic. And it's pretty darned brilliant. I have read this book no less than ten times! In theory, one ought to detest that spoiled little brazen, Scarlett O'Hara, but Margaret Mitchell makes her into a vivid, strong human being, a woman with spirit and the will to survive, but who was essentially immature and spoilt. But she was fiercely protective, loyal, and someone who you were forced to admire, even as you disliked what she was doing. She also had a alarming propensity to fall in love with the wrong men - this was a woman doomed to claw her way anywhere to succeed, but at the same time, estranging herself in the eyes of her Society. But does she give up, does she make it a tragedy? No. She gets up and keeps going, she just doesn't let people see that she minds it very much. She is an inspiration, but she doesn't really deserve to be. Scarlett is flawed, hideously so, but none the less, we are forced to admire her. She IS the book. A weaker or less flawed heroine would be irritating or just TOO unsympathetic. Her unrequitted love is very believable, it's happened to most of us at one time in our youth, and we never really quite shake that first infatuation off without a rude or painful awakening.The attitudes which feature in this book, although sexist and racist to us now, were perfectly normal for Civil War Southerners - Margaret Mitchell really understood the way people behaved at this time, and did not make them behave out of period or in anachronistic ways. Like Georgette Heyer and Regency England, she has a true understanding and insight into the period she is writing about - she LIVES it, and her people could have been alive then without unduly standing out as unusual or unremarkable.Scarlett is a rebel, but she does not go as far as a modern author might make her heroine go. She loves her family and her land, though she may deny it, and she is very proud. She is an inspirational woman, a true forerunner of the power woman of the 1980s - a sensational concept, even for the 1930s! The clever thing is how, in such a huge and spreading book, everything comes together. It may seem trivial and unnecessary to discuss Aunt Pittypat's drawing room, or go into the minutae of Scarlett's wardrobe, or to discuss events that happened a long time ago, but believe me, it is all very important in building up a coherent and very accurate (scarily accurate, for 1930s historical fiction - Heyer and Mitchell, as far as I know, were the only authors at this time who really bothered to research in depth for their &quot;lightweight&quot; historical fiction writing.) Gone With The Wind is a masterpiece. It must not be read with modern eyes, but as an amazing study of how people behaved, lived, and survived throughout the Civil War in America on the losing side."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I love this book and have read it many times however this particular edition is missing a page, page 713 has been replaced with page 813, and you don't want to miss a word of Gone With the Wind!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Margaret Mitchell was born in 1900 in Atlanta, Georgia. Throughout her childhood she heard stories of life before, during, and after the Civil War. In the 1920s she suffered a broken ankle. In order to pass the time, and inspired by the stories of her childhood, Mitchell began to write a book. She did not consider herself a novelist and did not think about publication--until 1935, when she impulsively gave the ragged manuscript to a visiting publisher's representative. The rest, as they say, is history: GONE WITH THE WIND was a phenomena. The reading public loved it; even the critics hailed it; and a celebrated film version merely added fuel to the fire. It has been translated into a host of languages, it has never been out of print, and to this day it remains among the most widely-read novels ever written.In hindsight, it is obvious that Mitchell was somewhat overpraised as an artist. She is not a writer who can complete with the likes of Jane Austen or Mark Twain, and she has a distinct tendency to write \\"on the surface\\" rather than in depth. But she has two great strengths, and the first of these is narrative power. If nothing else, Mitchell was a born story teller with an instinctive grasp of what it took to make you turn the next page; at one thousand pages, GONE WITH THE WIND is a long book--but it never seems long when you are actually reading it. Mitchell's second great strength is ability to create archetypical characters that seem to embody everything you know as well as everything you feel you should have known, and Scarlett O'Hara joins the ranks of Austen's Elizabeth Bennett, Thackery's Becky Sharp, and Tolstoi's Anna Karenina as one of the most memorable female characters in the history of literature. As art, the novel does have faults, but it is vividly, sharply alive. You believe in the world and the events and people that Mitchell presents.Social critics presently accuse Mitchell and GONE WITH THE WIND of racism. I find it difficult to criticize a writer and a work from the past for failing to adopt the attitudes of the present; all writers bring their own day and age to the table, and Mitchell's attitudes and ideas about black people and slavery were in the American mainstream of her day. In this sense, the book is perhaps best considered as a marker of where we once were and how far we have come since its original publication. It is also worth noting that while GONE WITH THE WIND is set before, during, and after the Civil War, and while many of its characters are slaves or freed slaves, it is not a novel about the Civil War or about slavery. It is about a self-centered woman of that era who is clever without being intellectual, who is remarkably hypocritical, and who can in many ways be described as morally bankrupt. We see this world through her eyes, and since she is utterly uninterested in the causes of the war, and even less so in the myriad of moral and ethical issues that swirl around slavery, we learn very little about either in any real sense--and to further complicate matter Mitchell never implies that Scarlett, those who swirl around her, and their attitudes and actions are to admired or accepted; they simply are.This said, social critics do have a significant point when they note that the popularity of GONE WITH THE WIND had the effect of perpetuating the idea that slavery was \\"not all that bad\\" long after such ideas should have been no longer tolerated. I do indeed recommend the book--it is extremely memorable, so much so that it virtually created the genre of romantic historical fiction without every being bested by the host of novels that followed it--but I do not recommend that any one come to it without a fairly good idea of what the Old South was like in actual fact. It is all very well to see that world through the eyes of Scarlett O'Hara for a time, but we need the ability to pull away from her point of view, and to compare it to reality, once the novel is set aside.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"\\"Gone With the Wind,\\" as a novel, has been mistakenly dismissed by literary critics as pulp fiction for the masses. This view is premature and biased, in my opinion. If one digs deeply into the fabric of this very complex novel, one is likely to find that this novel works on two very different levels: the external level, in which themes such as survival and romantic love figure prominently; and the internal level, in which themes such as division v. reunion and the child v. the adult figure prominently.An external analysis of the novel yields much that has been obvious to the reading and movie-going public for years. \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is, most obviously, a very powerful novel about a young woman's survival of two unique crises: the American Civil War and Reconstruction of the South that followed. The personal qualities of those who survive and prosper in this novel -- characters such as Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, Mammy, Will Benteen, old Mrs. Fontaine, even Mrs. Merriwether -- are contrasted sharply with those who do not survive and prosper: Ashley Wilkes, Ellen O'Hara, Gerald O'Hara, and Scarlett's first two husbands, Charles Hamilton and Frank Kennedy.Melanie Hamilton presents an interesting study in the story of survival. Margaret Mitchell uses her to represent the dignified stateliness of the Old South matron. Rather than becoming a victim of the Old South's disintegration, she survives in a way that equals or even surpasses Scarlett's survival. Melanie, whom Mitchell originally intended as the novel's heroine, is the woman who saves Tara from burning to the ground; the woman who drags her father's Mexican War sword to the landing at Tara, helping Scarlett defend it from the Yankee invader; and the woman who stands against polite society in order to defend Scarlett, her beloved sister-in-law, from the town's gossip. Yes, she dies at the end of the novel, and Mitchell uses this to represent the passing of the Old South. However, even here, Melanie dies in her own bed, in her own home, with her own family about her, and she dies on her own terms: after conceiving a child she knew placed her own life at risk.It is also about three interconnected love stories: the traditional, dignified courtship and marriage of Melanie Hamilton and Ashley Wilkes; the thwarted, unconsummated relationship between Ashley Wilkes and Scarlett O'Hara; and the temptuous, passionate courtship and marriage of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. The central theme of these love stories is summarized early in the novel by Scarlett's father, Gerald O'Hara: \\"Only when like marries like can there be any happiness.\\"These themes, while universal and very powerful, are only external to the novel, and I don't believe the novel's power or universality are derived from the themes of survival and love. I believe its power is much more subtle. Indeed, for years, it has been a mystery to literary critics why this novel was received equally well by 10-year olds as well as 95-year olds. Therein lies its secret: it is a novel with which both the 10-year old child and the 95-year old adult can identify strongly. It is a novel about children and it is a novel about adults.Every one of the major characters has qualities of both children and adults in them. These are handled subtly, not obviously, and the language of the novel, which I believe Margaret Mitchell crafted deliberately along these lines, takes the reader in this direction. For example, listen to what Scarlett says about men: \\"All the men in Scarlett's life, the Tarleton twins, the Calvert boys, Charles, and Frank, she could dismiss with the phrase, 'What a child!' Not Rhett. He was an adult in everything he did. Only Rhett and Ashley ...\\"Scarlett is portrayed as both child and adult. \\"I'm always your little girl,\\" she says to her mother in the middle of the Civil War, when in fact she is a widow with a 2-year old son. The woman whose heroism saves Tara from oblivion is evaluated by Rhett at the end: \\"My pet, you're such a child.\\" By the end of the novel, when Scarlett is only 28 years old, she has been married three times, widowed twice, given birth to three children, and buried one of them. Yet, in her dreams, she is still \\"a lost child.\\" When asked if she thought Scarlett ever got Rhett back, Margaret Mitchell said: \\"I don't think so, but I do think she finally grew up.\\"Melanie is the adult who masquerades in child's clothing -- and has a child's figure. Mitchell takes pain to describe Melanie's physical appearance \\"as that of a 10-year old boy, with narrow hips and height barely coming up to Ashley's shoulders.\\" Yet it is Melanie who has the wisdom to see Scarlett's finer qualities, her strength of character, her commitment to her promises, and her ability to survive -- wisdom that is ironically viewed by Scarlett (and others) as foolishness. She is portrayed as foolish to be so loyal and loving to Scarlett; yet it turns out, in the end, that Scarlett's attachment to Ashley was imaginary, and it turns out in the end that Scarlett loves Melanie deeply. She is portrayed as foolish for defending Rhett Butler so staunchly, yet her wisdom about his good qualities is thoroughly vindicated by the novel's end. Of all the principles, it is Melanie who is the most wise -- and the most adult. Yet her external appearance is very childlike.Rhett is usually depicted as an adult, the black sheep of a prominent Charleston family who makes his own fortune as a blockade runner from just a $1,000 investment. He admits, at novel's end, that he wanted to care for Scarlett, as an adult would care for a child; yet he is relentlessly mothered by Melanie, especially toward the end: she straightens him up so that he can be presentable to Scarlett after her miscarriage; and only she can convince him to consent to Bonnie's funeral. Further, he enables Melanie's mothering throughout the novel. She is the only person that he truly respects because, I suspect, she is a reminder to him of his own mother, a character who is rather prominent in the novel, though largely absent. Interestingly, it is only Melanie who comes into contact with her, as she greets mourners for Bonnie in the parlor of Scarlett and Rhett's mansion.Ashley Wilkes is the real child of the four principles, but it takes Scarlett the entire duration of the novel, more than 12 years, to realize this. Ashley is the weakest character, the one who has failed to give up the \\"life that [he] loved,\\" the one who depicts the charm and grace of the Old South to Scarlett -- the only time that she succumbs to the mistake of looking back. Mitchell is very deft with this scene. It is portrayed as a scene that exposes Ashley and Scarlett's illicit love for each other. However, what's really being exposed here is their common dependence on the past, Ashley's being overt and Scarlett's much more deeply repressed. By implication, it's also exposing the true nature of their attraction for each other, because they shared a common upbringing, growing up on neighboring plantations.This scene is expertly crafted. While Ashley and Scarlett are reminiscing about the charm and grace of their common past -- an event which culminates in their hugging in a truly platonic manner, one in which they begin to understand each other -- they are exposed to the gossip and criticism of Atlanta society. What's being exposed here is not their unconsummated romance; it's their common reliance on living in the past. It's fitting that they should be exposed when they're reminiscing about their common past, because that is the real force of their attraction, the real reason for their love (an ultimately childish love, by the way). Mitchell uses this scene to expose them not to Atlanta society, but to the reader. They're not in love with each other; they're in love with a life that is (forgive the cliche) gone with the wind. At the end of the novel, when Scarlett realizes she truly loves Rhett, she sums up her relationship with Ashley: \\"I've lost my lover and I've gained another child.\\"Virtually every relationship in this novel can be evaluated as child v. adult; think, for example, of Mammy, the real mother figure of the novel. Look at Ellen and Gerald O'Hara; he was 43 when they married and she was 15; yet she mothers him, right up until her death. Consider one of their final episodes, recounted to Scarlett in Atlanta by John Wilkes, in which Gerald wanted to fight in the war. Ellen puts him to the test insofar as riding his horse is concerned, a test that \\"little Gerald, who barely came up to her shoulders\\" failed miserably. After Ellen dies, Gerald's life collapses and he is a broken man, right until his death.Finally, there is the theme of division and reunion that appears on numerous occasions throughout the novel. Consider how the novel starts: Scarlett is seated on the front steps of Tara between the Tarleton twins -- a divisive force for two brothers who are otherwise as \\"alike as two bolls of cotton.\\" The novel begins with internal and external symbols of division. The Civil War starts. We are introduced to Scarlett and Melanie, the two heroines who are complete opposites and, at least for Scarlett, adamantly opposed to one another. We are introduced to Ashley and Rhett, the two heroes who are also complete opposites, at least externally, and rather opposed to one another; Ashley dislikes Rhett's blackguardism, and Rhett has contempt for Ashley's weaknesses.Mitchell deliberately tries to convince the reader, by cleverly contrasting their external characteristics, that these characters are hopelessly divided. Scarlett \\"hates\\" Melanie because she is a foolish simpleton and Ashley's wife; Rhett is a symbol of the New South, and Ashley is a symbol of the Old South; Rhett is a survivor, Ashley is a victim. Scarlett is a divisive figure in Melanie and Ashley's marriage. Scarlett is a divisive figure in the Hamilton-Wilkes families: toward the end, she is the indirect cause of a family feud that splits the family into two separate camps. Scarlett, herself, is a divided character - the result of an alliance between an Irish immigrant and an established aristocrat from the Savannah coast. \\"In her face were too sharply blended the sharp features of her father, an Irish immigrant, and the more delicate features of her mother, a French aristocrat from Savannah.\\" Mitchell has even put division on Scarlett's face -- one reason that Vivien Leigh, who as an actress utilized divided eyebrows (one up, one down) for Scarlett, was such a perfect choice for the part. \\"She is my Scarlett,\\" admitted Margaret Mitchell.Division is the premise of the novel. Reunion is its conclusion. Everything that was divided is ultimately united by novel's end. Melanie and Scarlett reach an understanding with each other; Scarlett comes to realize how much she loves and relies on Melanie, and comes to appreciate her strength, the \\"steel courage\\" that has sustained her through many crises. Indeed, the evolution of their relationship is one of the most touching and endearing aspects of the novel. Whereas we begin the novel with Ashley depicted as the war hero whose life is lived for \\"dignity and honor\\" and with Rhett depicted as the blackguard who is motivated only by crass selfishness, we end the novel with Ashley reduced to a helpless, purposeless victim and Rhett enhanced as a loving husband and father. Along the way, the stark contrasts that Mitchell draws early between Rhett and Ashley yield to sympathetic comparisons. \\"Did it ever occur to you, Scarlett, that Rhett and I are fundamentally alike?\\" Ashley inquires toward the end. Yet their similarities are evident -- though repressed -- from the beginning. In a surprising confrontation with Mrs. Merriwether, Melanie defends Rhett's criticisms of the war because they mirror things her husband has written to her. Ashley and Rhett begin the novel as divided and opposed to one another; they end united and unified as characters. Melanie and Scarlett, likewise, begin the novel as opposed opposites and end the novel united and unified. Division begets reunion.This theme, division and reunion, is especially powerful when you consider the historical context of the novel. In my view, it is no accident, but rather a careful decision on Margaret Mitchell's part, to time the action of the novel from April 1861, the start of the Civil War, the ultimate symbol of division, to September 1873, the end of Reconstruction, the ultimate symbol of reunion. It is a breathtaking historical backdrop for a novel whose dramatic power is derived from characters experiencing division and reunion in their lives.It is curious that Mitchell's novel has born the brunt of belittling and contemptuous literary criticism over the years. When it debuted, it sold millions and won the Pulitzer Prize; no film, before or since, has ever been so widely anticipated as the 1939 film was. Its massive popularity, I suspect, and Mitchell's melodramatic writing style have contributed to this contempt. However, when one considers the thematic breadth of the novel, its impeccable structure, and the awesome scope of its narrative force, \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is a singular and astonishing achievement. I believe its universality, its appeal from the 10-year old to the 95-year old, is best explained by the themes of child v. adult and division v. reunion. I also believe that it is these themes that explain why it captivates us after 71 years and will continue to captive generations to come."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I saw the movie before I read the book, and I thought it would be too much to read a book that was so long. But I was enthralled by the 2nd page, by the descriptions and the dialogue. The rest of the novel kept me enthralled because of the unconventionality of Scarlett and Rhett, and the messages about war, the finished past and the unavoidable future of the South in the mid-1800's. I loved the richness of the descriptions of the Old South, which made me feel so nostalgic even though I'm not even from the South! Also, I found the many characters to be well-developed and each major character had a distinct and sympathizable personality.My favorite parts are the ones with Scarlett and Rhett at each others' throats, before and during their \\"courtship\\" and even after they were married. Their dialogue is hilarious and clever, though admittedly the wit is all from Rhett and the amusement comes from seeing Scarlett brought down a few notches. Though it hurts to know that even though Scarlett FINALLY matures enough to dump Ashley and realize she needed to change, Rhett is no longer willing to give her another chance. It seems whenever Scarlett is actually sincere about something nobody believes her or is willing to give her the benefit of the doubt (except Melanie of course). What's great about the novel is that if one was one of the characters, he would just see Scarlett on the surface: selfish, conniving and coy, but with the narration, one can see where Scarlett is coming from, and actually sympathize with her actions. She was definitely a woman born in the wrong era. She would do just fine in the 21st Century.Scarlett is very much my favorite character, because even with her insensitivity, selfishness, and materialism, she is oftentimes the strongest person in the passel of main characters. She worked to the bone when she returned to Tara, knowing that her hands would have to be ruined in order to eat and live and provide for the family that looked to her for leadership. Sometimes it seemed she was the only practical, level-headed person in the whole book (excepting Rhett), especially since people like Suellen were just refusing to work because it was \\"beneath\\" them, refusing to admit things have changed and work had to be done. Scarlett knows what she wants and has the sense to go ahead and try to get it.Although, many times Scarlett's selfishness comes up so unexpectedly I burst out laughing at the outrageousness of her personality. For example there would be a long conversation or narrative about how the past was so beautiful and peaceful or about a nice thing a person has done, and the book has Scarlett completely overturn the comments with her contemptous thoughts on the contrary of what was just described. Her problem is that though she sees what's in front of her, she doesn't get the POINT of what she's seeing. Hence the character of Rhett. He is so much like her, but he is able to see what she misses. He points them out to her plainly, and in Rhett Scarlett meets her match. He has what she's missing. As a result, another piece of the novel comes together: through Rhett, Scarlett is able to mature and bridge, to an extent, the gap between the ideals of people living in the past and those living in the present. Unfortunately, this maturation is not without consequences.Because of Scarlett's headstrong personality, I found GWTW endlessy amusing, and I think it was meant to be - in showing the huge gap between the over-the-top, in-the-moment practicality of Scarlett and the immaterial dreams of yesterday held so tightly by Old Southerners like Ashley, Melanie, and the rest, Mitchell tells us that both ways of thinking have their benefits and faults. It's not good to hold on to the past without moving forward, but only worrying about current physical security without holding tight to family and identity will cause pain and loneliness in the future. The messages are many in GWTW, and none of the 1000+ pages are superfluous. It was a pleasure to read, to laugh at the witty dialogue, sigh with sadness or nostalgia, scoff with annoyance at characters' actions, and feel the pain of the bitter ironies that define the lives of characters like Scarlett and Rhett.GWTW is not just a love story to me; it's so much more than that. It makes you think about what's past, but warns you not to dwell on the memories. Also, issues about war, race, and gender are definitely touched upon, oftentimes subtly, and it makes for great analysis. I can see why this novel won the Pulitzer Prize. Many issues are laid out all at once in front of you, forcing you to acknowledge their presence, whether it's painful to do so or not. \\"Gone With the Wind\\" made it to my \\"favorite books\\" list by page 150. It's an amazing literary work; a real masterpiece."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Being a freshman in high school, my opinions are not usually taken for notice, however, I challenged myself in reading this book and found myself all the stronger a person for it.

I am always interested in a good book, and most of my picks are action or mystery. I have read hundreds of books in my life so far, some of them poorly written, some of them average, but many of them incredible. These books have captured my imagination, but Gone With the Wind took my soul. I almost made a new lake out of my tears when Melanie died. And I loved Mammy! She added some of the funniest parts to a book I have ever had the honor to read. I am still wondering how she'll ever get Rhett back after what happened. I haven't read the sequal yet but I intend to do so. In fact, I am trying to order it from Amazon.com as soon as possible. I don't care if dozens of people didn't like the sequal. I HAVE GOT TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT IN THE STORY! That's also one of GWTW's strong points. Most people won't read more than the first chapter, but if you decide to go the extra mile (or two) you will find yourself dodging bullets in Sherman's seige of Atlanta. If there is one weakness to it, it's in the movie itself. It followed closely to the story line, but strangely the guys making it forgot about little Wade and Ella, and almost forgot Will entirely. But even worse, they got Mr. O'hara's death completely mixed up. And some of the guys that they got to play the beaux didn't know the first thing about acting. Charles Hamilton may have been an idiot, but surely he wasn't that dumb! Sorry, I'm getting to into the movie (I just finished watching it for the first time today).

Everybody in my family has read it. I thought, \\"What's so great about this huge book about the war? Boring.\\" I finally picked it up this year. Definitely not boring.16 year old Scarlett O'Hara was not necessarily the most beautiful girl in Georgia, but her emerald eyes, 17 inch waist, and stubborn yet flirtatious attitude attracts all the men except Ashley Wilkes. The one man she thinks she truly wants. She has almost the perfect life; living on a huge plantation named Tara, and she's finally old enough to wear gorgeous dresses to various parties. She has the perfect slave, Mammy, keeping her in check throughout the story. Ashley has a party at his plantation, Twelve Oaks, to inform the town he is getting married to his cousin Melanie. Scarlett first puts on her flirt into overdrive to try to win him back, but when that doesn't work, she goes crazy breaking dishes and screaming while she should be upstairs napping with the other ladies. A mysterious man with a bad reputation just happened to be watching the whole thing. Rhett Butler. He was not intimidated by her like other men, he just laughed in amusement. But, the marriage does not stop Scarlett from getting what she wants. The Civil War doesn't either, it just greatly impairs it. Scarlett has to figure out how to live off of nothing and still keep her charm with the few men that are even around, not at war. She has to watch everything she loves break down to pieces before her own eyes; her family, Tara, and her wealth.Scarlett is such a brave character. She is a stubborn and selfish American heroine. She always says, \\"I'll think about it later. After all, tomorrow is another day.\\" This is an inspirational and true statement everybody should remember. People didn't know exactly how wonderful of life they had before the war, before they lost everything. I think all people experience this feeling. The knowledge that nothing will go back to the way it was. Miss Melly acts like nothing happened and hopes for the best. Scarlett on the other hand kept fighting herself and did things even a man wouldn't do to get her life back together again. She started her own business, married men for their money to help her family, and rode in carriages without an escort! That was scandalous and unheard of in the 1800s. It's the stubborn Irish coming out in her. She always wanted the best for herself. Not necessarily the people around her. But then there's Rhett who keeps popping up throughout the book giving Scarlett expensive gifts from Europe. Scarlett despises him for his smirks and smart attitude, but does she find she loves his sarcasm and money? Does she love him or hate him? You don't know until the last chapters.America was not joking when they voted Gone with the Wind as it's favorite novel. A classic. It's definitely a page turner. (All 1030 pages) You get a feeling of the other side of the Civil War. In history books the North was always the good guys. The Confederates hated the Yankees and their ways. I mean, who would want to have to free such devoted and motherly slaves like Mammy?This novel almost makes you mad because it doesn't go the way it's supposed to be. They should go back to being rich and happy! You want to pop into the book and get things all straightened out so it can be a happily ever after ending.I loved Gone with the Wind for many reasons. First of all, it made me realize that people in the old days were just the same as they are now. The characters are so real and have real life thoughts. Scarlett thought, \\"If I have to steal or kill - as God is my witness, I'm never going to be hungry again.\\" The people are not saying the perfect things at the perfect time like most books. Also, I loved the side stories with Scarlett's sisters, Ashley's relationship, the war, Rhett, the babies, and Scarlett's determination. It truly is one of the best books out there."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Why is this novel the second best selling book in the world? Because every character evokes deep emotion to the reader whether love or hate. The complexity of the personalities written by Mitchell is amazing in itself, but place on top of that a writing style that flows like poetry and you've got in your hands the most fun a person can have with paper. Vivid descriptions of the Southern landscape, the Old South traditions, the Southern gentility, and the graceful way of life pre-Civil War are second to none. I have lived in the South my whole life and much of the lifestyle Mitchell relates in GWTW are accurate and still exist in one form or fashion. The South is the only true culture left in America and this is a window into how it began and what it was like in its peak. Traditions die hard down here but they are dying fast, get romanced by life south of the Mason-Dixon before it gets washed away in a flood of \\"progress\\"."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"If you've ever read any classic like Pride and Prejudice you will love this novel. My friend once mentioned this novel was fantastic so I got my hands on a copy. Boy was I surprised to see how long it was and how small the font was. But it was completely worth it in the end. Margeret Mitchell really gets the point through with her novel. All the characters, such as Scarlett, feel so real throughout the whole book and everything is so thoroughly explained that you feel like your actually there. I also enjoyed the history in the book because I'll soon be studying the Civil War at school and this novel really helped me understand it in an enjoyable way.There are also many timeless lessons that are valuable for anyone.So anyone who loves romance, don't mind how long the novel is because in the end it's worth it. I urge you to go out and buy a copy NOW. :>"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"To put it simply, this is the best book ever written. you have not lived until you have conquered this masterpiece of prose. For some, the length is intimidating, but it goes fast, so dont use that excuse. This book is a romance novel, a war story, a documentary all roled into one. there is something here for everyone.While reading this book, I found myself wishing so badly to be more like Melanie. Unfortunately, I am more of a Scarlett myself. I suspect most readers, if they are to be honest, would also admit to this. Yes, she is cruel, materialistic, unyeilding and rather spoiled. No, she isnt one to be envied. But still, there is something about her that one cant help but relate to. perhaps its because we watch her grow from a careless young lady to a hardened, stubborn adult. We know her story. we know her hopes and her fears and what drives her so far, and we cant help but admit that if we were in her shoes, wouldnt we have a similar response? all the same, one feels very little sympathy for her in the end, as she loses everything that matters, and is left with nothing but her money.Rhett, as another reviewer said, is certainly the tragic figure in this story. He is ultimately driven to accept the lifestyle that was originally so repulsive to him and that he worked so hard to avoid. ah, but for some there is some pride to be found in not being recieved! He loves Scarlett so much, yet due to her blindness to her own emotions, and the general reservations between them, their marriage fails. He tries to pour all the love and emotions he would otherwise show Scarlett onto Bonnie blue, but when she dies, there is nothing left for him. Its ironic, hes a big man, a strong man, a man to be afraid of...yet one almost cant help but to pity him.Great book.Read."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Published in 1936, can any serious reader expect Gone With the Wind to mesh with 21st-century sensibilities? Of course not. Therefore, it may be wiser to open this book, put sensibilities aside, and let it rip because Gone With the Wind is simply a classic. Margaret Mitchell's Confederate sympathies hold little in the way of ambivalence. The dream-like plantation lifestyle, it's total devastation, and the abject humiliation of it's adherents under Reconstruction are starkly protrayed. Amidst the tragedy of civil war, Mitchell places a bevy of unforgettable characters whose inner strengths and weaknesses receive vivid definition - the interplay of which is truly sublime.Gone With the Wind is ultimately a story of traumatic loss and dogged perserverence, overcoming disaster, peeling oneself off of the cold, hard floor. To be sure, there is wicked condescension, biased justifications, premises so one-sided they defy belief, but through it all Gone With the Wind stands with Tolstoy's War and Peace in it's ability to bring the social costs of war to the surface in a manner both eloquent and disturbing. This book should be read by all. 5+ stars."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"GONE WITH THE WIND effortlessly uses the English language in ways I never thought possible, to tell the sweeping timeless story of a strong woman who stuck it out. People who say they don't like her are missing the point. Books are supposed to entertain, not preach. Scarlett may be selfish and stubborn and materialistic, but she is not boring. She lights up the pages with her vivacity. Give me an interesting heroine over a moral example any day.For more great books about Reconstruction in the South (and a girl who is in some ways exactly like Scarlett, and in others her polar opposite) go to littlecolonel.com and read the out-of-print Little Colonel series for free. Offers a new perspective on Scarlett's time."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. Everyone should find time to read it. I realize it is 1024 pages of very small print and also that there are sixty-three chapters; however it is amazing. I realize too that it is in some cases a bit racist and there are people who are offended by that; to them, I privately say, \\"Grow up\\". Gone With the Wind is not about slavery. It is not about white supremacy. It is not even really about the South. It is about how war destroys people. You could take it and apply it to any war. I am by no means a white supremist, but those feelings need to be pushed aside while one enjoys such a wonderful book. I do not agree with Scarlett, or Melanie, or Ashley, or Rhett completely, but I can't help but tear up as I watch their world disappear again and again. It is a million times better than a history book to understand the causes of bigotry in the South after the war. As for Scarlett, she is infuriating, bullheaded, selfish, and childish, but I cannot help loving her anyway. Perhaps my favorite lines, though, come from Ashley, lost soul though he is:\\"It's a curse--this not wanting to look on naked realities. Until the war, life was never more real to me than a shadow show on a curtain. And I preferred it so. I do not like the outlines of things to be too sharp. I like them gently blurred, a little hazy...It isn't that I mind splitting logs here in the mud, but I do mind what it stands for. I do mind, very much, the loss of the beauty of the old life I loved. Scarlett, before the war, life was beautiful. There was a glamor to it, a perfection and a completeness and a symmetry to it like Grecian art. Maybe it wasn't so to everyone. I know that now. But to me, living at Twelve Oaks, there was a real beauty to living. I belonged in that life. I was a part of it. And now it is gone and I am out of place in this new life, and I am afraid. Now, I know that in the old days it was a shadow show I watched. I avoided everything which was not shadowy, people and situations which were too real, too vital. I resented their intrusion. I tried to avoid you too, Scarlett. You were too full of living and too real and I was cowardly enough to prefer shadows and dreams.\\"Everytime Ashley says what he truly thinks, it makes me cry. I never cry about anything, but I cry over Gone With the Wind. It's not that I want to be a part of that world, the pre-Civil War South, because I don't...it's just that Margaret Mitchell's words are magic, creating characters so real that I can't help but long for them to have what they want."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"...into the ad hoc matriarch of a shattered plantation family. Scarlett O'Hara makes you wince at her infuriating shallowness earlier in the story. You can spot it in a conversation between herself and Ashley Wilkes, the man she wants to steal away from Melanie Hamilton. Ashley comments that Rhett Butler (who Scarlett has just seen for the first time) looks like one of the Borgias. Scarlett asks which family they are--she doesn't know them. Ashley patiently explains that they're Italians. \\"Oh,\\" says Scarlett dismissively. \\"Foreigners.\\" The type of prideful ignorance that my own working class demographic (\\"crackers\\" back in those days) expresses like this; \\"I'm dumb as hell and proud of it.\\" One thing the movie doesn't capture by a long shot with Vivien Leigh as Scarlett and Olivia DeHavilland as Melanie is that these girls are teenagers, antebellum \\"valley girls\\". So actually, what do you expect? Basically, Melanie beats Scarlett out for Ashley's affections becase she is nowhere near as immature. But Scarlett's father frequently comments on her \\"willfulness\\", possibly without realizing himself that it's a clue to a titanic courage in his firstborn. In the ensuing story, the Civil War grinds up people and land. Melanie, Scarlett's onetime despised rival, becomes dependent upon her. Ashley is destroyed in spirit as well--a rich dandy doesn't have the moxie to endure war when it lands in his backyard. The main reason Scarlett ends up getting involved with Rhett is that he's the only man with her level of guts. Scarlett reminds me of Pat Conroy's \\"Great Santini\\" character--at first you can't stand her, you thank God no one like her is close to you, but when the chips are down, she's a survivor. And people associated with her survive as well. One thing this book points out is that the ugliness of war is a force of human nature, and people who think themselves insulated from it, or \\"above war's barbarism\\" wind up finding out the hard way that they're dead wrong. Now if only our present-day sheltered middle class and \\"thinking people\\" could face that inescapable truth..."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"If there is comfort food Gone with the Wind is comfort reading due to it's open and honest style.

Mitchel never wrote again, though in the mid 1940's she was struck by an automobile on Peachtree Street in Atlanta and her body was dragged for more than 100 feet.Her fiuneral was more majestic than Scarlet and Rhett's wedding.a signed first edition of this book today is worth well over $15,000.As for the new introduction written by Pulitzer Prize winner, Pat Conroy (\\"The Prince of Tides\\") He is, after all a Southern Writer and his own material is considered literature. I'll leave his words up to you. I respect his work a great deal. Even if not his opinion. And that's all an intorduction or a review is; a critic attempts to establish crredability with words. and in seeking out a Soutern Writer, though there are dozens of well qualified women writers (Lett's, Flagg, Kingsolver) With Styron, Clemens and Faulkner gone we are left with Conroy and John Grisham. I'd be interested to know what all of these people would write in an introduction.\\"Gone With The Wind\\" is a terrific story, fairly well written and highly emotional. It is one of the few war novels in history written from a woman;s perspective (that includes battle scene action) and the character of Scarlet O'Hara- our protaganist and ingenue - has become an adjective in describing other characters. In some ways, this novel; is a huge step forward for the feminist movement, but far more so it set the civil rights movement back subsgtantially and continues to every single time someone reads it. People read that book and actually believe that slaves were treated like family members. Mitchell writes about Mammy and Poke and Prissy passing along the perfumed hearsay her grandmother told her that the \\"houise darkys\\" are given \\"family status\\" but still Scarlett's frustration over Prissy's idlesness causes her to threaaten to break a switch acorss her back. Miss Scarlet runs into Big Sam as the Confederate Army leaves Atlanta to the Yankees while Scarlet must stay to bring Melly's baby (A love promise she made to Melly's husband)He is a Field Hand but she speaks with him because he is an overseer and only becausee the Yankee's canons and guns can be heard on the hprizon. She gaters information and does not wish him well;she will never see him again and as readers we never hear of him again. Neither the book nor the film do anything to expose what slavery was and the way in which \\"Gone With The Wind\\" has injured the rights for descendents of America-slaves is sinceely nauseating.There are millions who would break a switch across my back for this review. I saw go to it,k but you'd better re-read thge book before you do it. Perhaps watch the film as well, as it is less harsh than the book. (I own the screenplay)So by all means, everyone should read \\"Gone With The Wind\\". The more controlversial, the more one should read. But before you do, read Alice Walker's \\"The Color Purple\\" which also won the Pulitzer Prize. I've taught these books together as WAlker's also takes place in the South in 1935 and gives a clear idea of what life was like for the once-slaved,now impoverished. Thern read GWTW. After you get all teary and warm with \\"Gone With The Wind\\"(and you will be) then you must read William Styron's \\"The Confessions of Nat Turner\\", also a Pulitzer Prize winner, which was written in 1966, utilizerd what little is known of the trial of Nat Turner and tells us more truth about what it was to be a slave. If after that you still haven't gotten the picture pick up the recently published book about Paul Jennings, \\"A Slave in The White House\\"- the book that first speaks of a black man in the oval office, only he was dusting it, pouring drinks for President Madfison and he was, in truth, the one who rescued the lifesized portrait of George Washington. (Dolley Madison was a selfish, nasty woman who became frighened of her 104 slaves after President Madison died; oit is a fact, that during her lifetime at Montpieler after James died, Nat Turner's revolt occured and in New England the ship \\"Amistad\\" was overturned. For so many of us, fiction is a way to step into the minds and souls of another person in another world. With \\"Gone With The Wind\\" you run the risk of emerging a bigot."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is not a review or comment on Margaret Mitchell's work, but on the cheap, shoddy way that Scribner decided to package it. My daughter is in her third reading since we purchased this volume as a Christmas present in December, 06, and is the only one reading it in the house. Chunks of pages have begun falling out of the binding. The spine is paper, and not sturdy at that.I'm no expert on bookbinding, but this casts an image (for me, at least) of cheapness over the publisher. I'd like to have thought that for the price, this could have been expected to last a bit longer than 4 months.I guess this one's not going to be an heirloom.

It shows that the Confederates didn't like the treatment of slaves, but they didn't care about the slaves. I kind of liked this book."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I only knew the story from the movie, so I bought this book the week before we invaded Iraq, I'm sure at some subconscious level to read a viewpoint about war. The first half of the book was ok, I liked the descriptions of the suffocating constraints of upper class society at the time and Scarlett's rejection of them. The devastation of war and the struggle that Scarlett and her family went through were powerful. However, the second half of the book completely turned me off to the story. Margret Mitchell's descriptions of the reconstruction were so vile I almost put the book down. Blacks were only happy being slaves, they were too stupid for anything else. The only good blacks in the book are the ones who can serve the whites. Big Sam says he had enough of freedom and wants to go back to Tara. He's even incredulous that while in the north whites wanted him to sit at the dinner table with them like he was their equal, but he couldn't do it because he is not the equal to whites. Mitchell actually says that he smiles and feels better when Scarlett starts to tell him what to do because someone is telling him what to do again. Mitchell also uses animal metaphors when describing the black characters.At one point Mitchell is describing how the southern whites hate the Yankees so much because the Yankees have money and food and power and they do not, yet she doesn't have any sense of irony to see that the whites are in the position that they put the slaves in for centuries.And another thing that I did not like about the book is that most of the characters are serious sociopaths. They kill anyone who breaks their rules of racial propriety. Rhett kills a black man for being \\"upity\\" to a white woman, another character, one of the Fontaine boys, kills a black man for for saying something to a white woman. We are not told what but it is pretty obvious it was sexual, so we have the sterotype of the black male sexual prowler. Then the same Fontaine boy kills Jonas Wilkinson for telling black men that they are equal to whites and that they are alowed to have white women!! He doesn't just kill him, he cuts him to ribbons with a knife. There are many more examples of this psychotic behaviour. And Mitchell treats these behaviors as if they are to be admired. While reading I kept thinking these people are all nuts. I was glad they suffered and I'm glad they lost the war. I lost any sense of caring about what happened to any of them, including Scarlett.Also, this is a very anti-American book. Mitchell keeps going on about how awful the Yankees and the Union and the federal government are and how great Georgia and states rights are. Of course, states rights here means being able to murder anyone who annoys you. The reconstruction section of the book should be read by everyone just to show why the flying of the Confederate flag is so offensive. It is completely un-American.And one last thing. This isn't a great love story. Rhett is really only a supporting character in the book until the last 200 pages when they get married, and for a book over 1000 pages, that's not alot. I think people remember the movie more than the actual book.I was really dissapointed with this book. I was looking forward to enjoying a nice read and discovered that it was horrible propaganda.

This book is mainly about the difficult times for Scarlett O'Hara. The book was focused around the era of the Civil War. Gone With the Wind is a romance story about Scarlett O'Hara,her love of her homeland, Tara, and her search for love. She was jealous of Melanie Wilkes who married her cousin, Ashley, whom Scarlett desired. In the rage of Ashley marrying Melanie, Scarlett marries the first man who asks her, Melanie's brother Charles. Within 2 months Charles dies in the Civil War leaving her with a baby. She desperately tries to win over Ashley by moving in with Melanie and Melanie's aunt after Charles died. When Scarlett becomes bored with her living conditions, she goes to a fundraiser and meets Rhett Butler, a wealthy man from Georgia and he falls in love with her. But Rhett is very annoyed with the fact that Scarlett is in love with Ashley. Then tragedies start when the Civil War comes close to Georgia and Atlanta. Melanie gets pregnant and Ashley goes to war because Atlanta is attacked. Scarlett would have to escape back home to Tara before the Yankees come. Scarlett, along with her son Wade, her servant Prissy, Melanie, and Melanie's son Beau travel to the plantation Tara, where Scarlett was born, and Scarlett finds no food, no animals, only 2 remaining servants, a dead mother, an insane father, and 2 sick sisters. In desperation to survive, Scarlett marries Rhet Butler, and has a baby girl named Ella. She realizes too late that Rhett is her true love, but Rhett is tired of being second to Ashley, and leaves Scarlett. She decides she wants to get Rhett back, and then says \\"I won't think about that today, I'll think about that tomorrow. After all, tomorrow is another day.\\" I enjoyed the book a lot, and would recommend it to anyone who has a lot of time, and likes to read love stories.

Scarlett is a feminist, driven to extremes to ensure her future well-being and wealth; she is selfish and egotistical, but admirable in her stubbornness. This book is an epic, starting at secession and ending during reconstruction with carpetbaggers and scalawags stripping the south of its feudal past. The book is to some extent racist and revisionist southern pride. Was this Margarett Mitchell's interpretation of how southern's themselves feel in the 20th century, or does she truly believe that slaves were relatively happy as prisoners on a plantation?

From her, I inherited some of my facial characteristics,and also a talent for writing. I first read my aunts book when I was in 7th grade, and fell head over heels in love with it. It was a story that depicted the life from a southern point of view. In a vast majority of the Civil-War era novels, the Confederates are made out to be unruly rebels. Not ALL southerners were like that. Take The O'Hara family for example,did not treat their slaves badly, as many southern plantation owners were made out to be. I'm not denying the act of slavery as being horrible, for I know that it was, but at the same time, Margaret showed both sides. She showed the hardships and difficulties, loves and pleasures of southern life, and for that I am unbelievable proud to say that I am her blood."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Not a bad novel for a first writer. It could almost be a classic except for a few points - a) it's unecessarily long and could have used more editing; b) the second half is weak and not very interesting; c) it's description of Reconstruction is very one-sided and half-correct and d)it's too racist.

It was so awesome!! Its my favorite book ever!!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"GONE WITH THE WIND is an excellent novel for a first time novelist, despite its many flaws. Scarlett O'Hara is one of the most memorable characters in literary history and Miss Mitchell's description of the Civil War years in Georgia is well-paced and exciting. Unfortunately, the second half of the book does not live up to the promise of the first. The pace is not as swift and Miss Mitchell's description of Reconstruction is a tad one-sided (though understandably so). The novel's main weaknesses seem to be Scarlett's long-running infatuation for Ashley Wilkes. Given their characters and Scarlett's acquaintance of Rhett Butler, this infatuation borders on the realms of disbelief. Another weakness of the book is the lack of thorough editing. In Part One, Miss Mitchell nearly devoted an entire chapter on the Tarleton family, who happened to be secondary characters. Other than that, Miss Mitchell did an excellent job. It seemed a shame that she did not continue her writing career."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book has a very involving story and I quite literally could not put it down, though I did a few times in outrage over the portrayal of slavery, the Civil War, and the Reconstruction. This novel exemplifies the Lost Cause movement, which showed the Confederacy as noble but outnumbered, and slavery as a benign and paternal institution. It is worth reading for the story, but I shudder to think that some may take what it states as fact. I am not saying that the book should be banned or censored, but it is certainly difficult to read the numerous descriptions of freedmen as lazy and the countless explanations that slaves were just so dumb that they needed the care of white people.Also, Scarlett O'Hara is a terribly unlikeable character. Whether she is stealing her sister's boyfriend or daydreaming about murdering her only true friend, Ashley, her actions and thoughts will just appall you. She is also phenomenally oblivious, not realizing that Rhett loves her until it is far too late. I was sad that Rhett left her, but who could blame him??"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This classic Civil War-era romance novel won the Pulitze Prize in 1937 and was made into the classic movie audiences around the world know and love two years later. This terrific saga begins before the Civil War (which the Union won four years later, paving the way for the 14th Amendment, which ended slavery in 1865, several months after Abraham Lincoln's assassination) and ends during Reconstruction. I won't go over the plot again, as many who've either read the book or seen the movie (or both) know what it's about. Those who haven't read it, read the editor's reviews. One major difference between the book and the movie is that the book has a lot of cursing and the movie only has one swear word: \\"Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.\\" The way Rhett (Clark Gable, who won Best Actor in 1934 for the delightful screwball comedy \\"It Happened One Night\\"; review coming soon) says that to Scarlett (Vivien Leigh, in the role that won her her 1st Academy Award for Best Actress; the 2nd one was also for Best Actress in \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" in 1954) makes it seem like it's not a bad word at all. Watch the movie AFTER reading the book, you'll appreciate it more. The book is rated PG-13 for intense thematic elements, strong vulgar language, mild war violence, some images of wounded, violence, intense domestic conflict, mild sensuality and brief nudity. The movie is rated G.SCARLETTEveryone expected a sequel to \\"Gone With The Wind,\\" but those hopes went up in smoke when Margaret Mitchell died in 1939, the same year the classic movie (see my review on it) came out and three years after it was published. Imagine how surprised I was when I found out about the sequel, advertised on the back cover of the Large Print Edition that I borrowed countless times from my local library before buying it from \\"Doubleday Book Club\\" (rarely do they have anything worth buying). Alexandra Ripley (who is she?) wrote this follow-up with the \\"Permission\\" of the Mitchell Estate and look at the result. True, the story picks up where the original left off, but a twist of the supernatural (what the hell was she thinking?!!) just ruined the novel. It too was turned into a movie starring Joanna W.-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton (two-time James Bond in \\"The Living Daylights\\" and \\"Licence To Kill\\" [see my reviews on them]), which I don't know if it's any good. Ripley got some things right (adding more backstory to Rhett, etc), but she completely missed the mark on others (killing Mammy off, what the devil were you on, cocaine?) It's good reading if you want to find out what happens between Rhett and Scarlett, one of the most famous love affairs in literature, but if you expect the sequel to be as good as the original, don't bother. The novel is rated PG for some violence, mild language and brief nudity.GONE WITH THE WIND:5 starsSCARLETT:2/1/2 stars"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"(that is if it takes 6 weeks to read... so you better start reading!!!)In a word... you will RELIVE Scarlett's experience and she will become a person to you :) If you are a person who likes drama and human emotion, then this is the book for you! The fact that it is set against the chaotic background of the American Civil War is just an added bonus since the real storyline of the book is the tale of a woman's struggle against time and change when her world is falling apart."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book was very well written. It was a classic. I was intrigued at how well Margaret Mitchell spun this story together. Scarlett was a character that had so many different characteristics about her than I doubted it would ever end. You meet Scarlett O'Hara in Tara and soon you find out of her passionate love for Ashley Wilkes. War is declared on the South and Ashley marries his cousin Melanie Wilkes. Scarlett becomes jealous and as a way to get back at him she marries Melanie's own brother, Charles Wilkes. Charles and Ashley go to war leaving Melanie in Atlanta and Scarlett in Tara. Shortly after Scarlett gets a telegram informing her of her husbands death. She is desperate to get out of black widow's clothes. She goes to Atlanta to stay with her Aunt Pittypat while she tries to get used to wearing all black and never dancing. There they meet Rhett Butler for the first time. Soon Scarlett realizes shes pregrant with her dead husbands baby. Scarlett has the baby fine with no troubles. The Southern army passes through Atlanta and Ashley visits Scarlett and Melanie. Melanie gets pregnant. Nine months pass by and Melanie is deathly ill and is going to have the baby shortly. Siege is laid on Atlanta while the baby is near coming. Scarlett is forced to deliver the baby for all the doctors were busy with wounded soldiers. Scarlett takes charge and Melanie, Scarlett, Beau(The newborn), and Scarlett's child all flee to Tara. After a ravaging journey Scarlett makes it safely. After Scarlett sets up Tara to running again her and Melanie go to Atlanta once more. Ashley returns and Scarlett decides to marry her sister's bethrothed, Frank Kennedy, for his money. She uses his money to keep Tara running and she starts her own Lumber mill, something unheard of before this time, a woman working was taboo. Her husband and Ashley go to a Klu Klux Klan meeting and Ashley gets shot and Frank dies by a bullet to his head. Rhett goes and gets Ashley and saves him from the Northern army by pretending that Ashley had been visiting Belle Watlings house of 'ill repute'. Rhett proposes to Scarlett and they visit New Orleans and many places. Scarlett is happy. Then she has a baby girl who Rhett dotes on. Scarlett and Rhett fight a lot over silly things and then Rhett lets the girl jump with her horse and she falls, breaks her neck, and dies instantly. Rhett and Scarlett fight and Rhett comes home drunk one night and they have a few 'passionate' moments and Rhett leaves for good. He comes back and Scarlett tells him shes pregnant. He says rude things and she lunges for him, misses and falls down some stairs. She has a miscarriage and Rhett leaves with his famous line. \\"Frankly my dear, I dont give a damn,\\"."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Everyone knows this story, even without reading the book so I thought I'd add a bit about Mitchell's racist attitude towards the slaves. There are conversations amongst Scarlett and her family/friends regarding the Northern's erroneous assumptions about their slaves. They claim that they would never beat their slaves nor know of anyone that would behave that way. Of course we know that slaves were abused but there is huge denial here. Mitchell's characters also portray the slaves as child like, and the owners justify slavery saying that the Negroes are too child like to take care of themselves. Also remember that the men in Scarlett's lives are part of the KKK. Mitchell sees the group as Southerners protecting their family.It's astounding how much of this attitude is not commented upon. We could all learn that Mitchell's attitude is the type of thinking that people used to justify slavery and the treatment of Blacks after they were freed.Of course the novel itself is full of compelling characters, even if it is at heart a soap opera. Scarlett and Rhett are drawn so deeply that they feel that you would know them if you encountered them. By all means read the novel, but don't dismiss the racism."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Margaret Mitchell may have only written one book, but she well deserved the awards she won and the praises bestowed upon her. I have read this book twice and was taken aback both times by her colorful yet brutally honest account of the Civil War, mixed with her artful and often humorous accounts of emotion and the social expectations of the period. This book is truly an \\"objet d'art\\", a wonderfully sculpted work, that is ageless and timeless. It takes one's breath away with its mix of humor and brutality; its insight of human behavior, propriety, pride, vanity, and patriotism. This book, and the part of her soul (a great part, I may add), will never die."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"On the one hand, Gone with the Wind is a wonderful novel. Scarlett O'Hara is probably one of the best female characters I've ever read in a classic novel. She is not nice. She is not good. And yet, the most interesting characters rarely are. Melanie Hamilton Wilkes and Ellen Rollibard O'Hara were wonderful women, but the point of Scarlett is she will never be that woman. She's resourceful. She's \\"a scoundrel.\\" When the women of the South are thrown out of their comfortable lives Scarlett claws her way back to the top - and doesn't learn until the very end that she lost everyone for it. Her determination is her greatest asset and her biggest tragedy. But at the end, when she has lost everything, she decides to keep going as always.On that same hand, it's a wonderful story. The five parts are set up like a Shakespearean Play. Margaret Mitchell, for all her faults, is a wonderful writer and her descriptions put you in the story. She's also an intelligent enough writer to be able to write from the viewpoint of many different people, even if she mostly sticks with Scarlett's point of view.But on the other hand, the descriptions of slavery are offensive. While I believe that there were probably some benevolent plantation owners and some slaves that wanted to stay with their families (although, in the novel, it's interesting that the \\"house\\" slaves - the ones who lived with the family day by day and recieved many more privilages - are the only ones who care to stay while the field hands leave as soon as possible), slavery was indeed a horrible institution. And the novel does seem to argue that it was all better before with slavery (although the North gets the brunt of the blame for wrecking things - even though the South are blamed for starting it). Also, some of the heroes of the novel are Klan members, and the only criticism of their choice is that it's \\"too dangerous\\" and \\"not the way to get things done.\\"As offensive as these thoughts may be to modern sensibilites, the novel still remains a great work of art. I resisted reading this book for a long time, but now I'm glad I did. For all its faults, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Ok, wow! What a great book! I first saw &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; on a classic movie channel, and now I've read the book. If you buy it, you will not put it down - I mean I read 1041 pages in 3 days! This book will make you cry, for Rhett and Scarlett and is the best book I've ever read. It will make you cry so much, and personally, I really disliked Ashley for leading Scarlett on. This book is NOT racist, and it will give you a sense of romance better than Titanic ever could! The book describes Rhett's eyes, and make him come to life soooo much, and at the end it's sooo sad. Which is why I'm going to buy the sequel! Beware it leaves you hanging. Possibly the best book ever written EVER! BUY IT!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I never really considered reading this book before and I'd never seen the movie. I'd intended to, see the movie that is, but I'd never even thought about reading the book until a friend had it sitting around and wasn't reading it so I said \\"what the heck, what's the drama all about?\\".Having the forward done by Pat Conroy certainly helped as he is one of my favorite all time authors, so I dug in. I can't believe I'd never had this book recommend to me before, especially since I'm an outspoken hater of Lincoln (may he and Sherman burn in hell forever). I mean I really hate murderous invaders so hating Lincoln is easy, I never understood how people can make a hero out of both Washington (fighting for self rule) and Lincoln (invading to stop self rule), but I digress.What was really amazing about this book is that Mitchell managed to give a history lesson and wonderful historical flavor without ever actually \\"telling\\" the reader, she just \\"showed\\" us and it was wonderful and delightful to read.The is so much rewritten history and people really don't understand much of what they believe or even why they believe it so anyone that thinks they know the about the invasion of the South in the War of 61 and they haven't read this, they are not being honest in what they say they know, they can't be. The way the characters show how life was compared to what we are often taught or simply left to believe because we view things through modern lenses is really an amazing feat and the reason why this is such a good novel.Now to the love and the hate and the clash of personalities and the human nature and on and on, I can't say enough about how great this book is. So much popular modern writing is just trash, or fluff, compared to this depth of characterization, and here's a little clue why: modern writers tend to give us hero's with minor flaws, Scarlet is written very sympathetically, one can't help but love her, and love her deeply in fact, yet she's often wicked, she's certainly totally self absorbed and in modern times we'd probably call her a complete narcissist, BUT we the reader simply can't help but love her.The race relationships in the book are very insightful and give the reader understanding into the culture and mores of the time, and read with a view to the future one can see the root of much of today's racial problems in America, the South was destroyed by the North, the slaves may have been freed in one quick stroke, but they were free for what? The economy was destroyed, enormous wealth was destroyed, and the seeds of resentment and hatred were watered, not just in the hearts of the Southern white upper classes, but in the Northern whites, the poor, the blacks and everyone that suffered huge loss by the actions of state in it's conquest for power.I wish I'd read this book sooner, but now that I have I'll continue to recommend it to any one interested in a great novel of American and Confederate history, and of love, love the universal, the love of family, the love of a woman. Love and hatred, two sides of the same coin and separated by slivers of fate."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Margaret Mitchell's classic may be an historical novel, but it is packed with the truth of what was done to a peaceful and blameless section of our Country. Most people do not realize the huge numbers of Europeans (unsuccessful in their Revolutions of 1848)who came to this Country, were given enlistment bonuses (when fresh from the boat) and allowed to wreak havoc on a people whom they held responsible for all of their miserable conditions. Mrs. Mitchell weaves an excellent story, filled with characters who are relevent, even in today's world, while utilizing, as a backdrop, one of the world's greatest tradgedies. It is obvious that Mrs. Mitchell used a large number of primary sources in writing her book, and it deserves to be placed at the top of every literate person's reading list."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I purchased this as an ebook as I already own a 1936 copy of the book and a hardback copy for reading.Gone With the Wind is a timeless classic that I have read probably a dozen times.

I truly related to Scarlett and Rhett. They are the all-time couple. The only part I hated was Bonnie's death. I think that affected me more now that I have a child of my own and I could feel the grief that Rhett was feeling. I will most likely read it again. It made me laugh out loud, think and want to cry. A very emotional read!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I'm fourteen years old, and I read both Gone With the Wind and its sequel, Scarlett.

All this while, Scarlett is still deeply in love with the man she can not have.

I think it is because whenever he popped up in the book, he always made me smile. I think that it was rhett and Melanie that made scarlett strong. They were standing behind her and pushing her along the way. Without them, Scarlett would not have been nearly as strong as she was. Gone with the Wind has some kind of charm that i cannot explain.

I agreed, although it was hardly a fair deal, seeing as how GWTW is over 1000 pages, and TKAMB is a mere 300...but it was the best thing I ever did. Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind is an incredible book--Scarlett O'Hara is the single most unforgettable heroine I have ever encountered--and though I often felt like strangling her for her selfishness, stupidity, and greed, I fell completely in love with her anyway. I came to know her so well by the end of the book that for awhile after I was finished, there was a bit of a hole in my life, and I missed reading about her as I would miss a friend on vacation. Fortunately, all I had to do was open the book back up, and I was again immersed in southern Civil War America. Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley--each and every one became like a dear friend, I knew their thoughts, their feelings so well.

I have no doubt that this book will always be remembered as the greatest romance novel of all time."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This was another book to be read and studied in English class. Every one of my peers thought that this book was going to be like most of the other books that we had had to read that year, but I wasn't so sure, as I was just beginning to learn to love the classics and literature books in the library. So, being curious, I read the 1024 page book in under a week, and I found it a marvelous book. It touches wonderfully on the hardships and problems of the civil war years in the South, and the feelings of the proud Southerners toward the Yankees and slaves after the war had ended and they found themselves stripped of their old ways of the plantation living (this book mainly touches on the lifestyles of the richer plantation owners, rather than the majority of Southerners, or the poor ones who owned just a little farm, and often no slaves). It centers around the story of Scarlett O'Hara, daughter of a great lady and a rich Irish plantation owner. It is a funny and charming story of Scarlett's love problems: she can have any man that she wants in the South, yet she wants an engaged man! The book goes through her funny predicaments and actions as she struggles to stay alive in the present, with her dreams of the past behind her...It also goes on about a notorious man named Rhett Butler, who associates himself with Scarlett, and yet who is not accepted in any home in Atlanta, Georgia, nor the South for that matter. This book is recommended to anyone who likes romance stories or books with heroines in them. In fact, I recommend this to anyone who can stand reading long, wonderful books."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With the Wind takes place in the 1800's and is about an American girl named Scarlett O'Hara trying to fit in Atlantas society .

Scarlett really seemed to marry Frank for his money, but she also seemed to love him because she gave him a kid and she slept with him for a couple of years. She seems to dislike her kids, but at times she acts like she couldn't leave them for anything. I really felt sorry for Rhett in the end because in the movie he doesn't tell how much he loves her.

Gone With The Wind is something I know i should have read years ago! GWTW is so superbly a tale of the old south, and how it's changed by war. I was taken not only by it's vivacious and lively characters, but by it's wonderful forshadowing. And Rhett Butler, I just love to hate him!Gone With The Wind is a total must read!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Me being 11yrs. old didn't think that I would like this book. Boy was I wrong. This is my favorite book of all time! The only thing that I didn't like about the book which I know almost everybody will agree with me on is that it ends so suddenly not even giving you a hint to the outcome. Margaret Mitchell is so good that she can even capture an eleven yr. olds mind with an adult book. This book is easy to put people you know in the characters spots and just sit there all day and daydream a new ending. Did I mention that I loved this book?"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I first read GWTW, when I was just a kid and fell in love with it from the first line. No other book has come close to how I feel about this novel (save for Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion and Rebecca all running close seconds!)If you have only seen the movie version of this book, please do yourself a huge favor and read the book. It is amazing! Scarlett has so much more depth as a person than the way she is portrayed in the movie (Vivien Leigh was a perfect Scarlett don't get me wrong) You will come to understand her motives completely if you just read the Book! Apparently I cannot stress this enough. This is just the best book ever written!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Ok, here's the deal. This book was great. I mean GREAT! I read it in 6th grade. The whole thing was so, so, so wonderful! I luved every bit of it, Except for.....the end. I hated the end!

I really like the part when Ashley all of a sudden has feelings for her. But, the best part about the book is how I could not put the book down. I first read the book 5 years ago when I was in the fifth grade, but then I re-read it last year. I understood it even more. I am now trying to give it to people so that they can read it. It is also one of my favorite books. I recommend this book to anybody, male or female, young or old.

When i was 14, my father gave me a special edition for the youth, and told me:&quot; read this book, you will enjoy it&quot;. Well, ladies and gentelmen i started reading it in Thursday afternoon, and i didn't put it untill Friday night. The book is simply wonderfull, and later when i was growing up (i am 28 now) i read the full version two more times, and some passages ( especially the first encounter between Scarlet and Rhett at the library)countless times. I think the strength of the book lies in its strong and very believble characters ( although i think there is little exaggeration in the power and charm of Rhett). The supporting characters are very believble as well, and although you might think that there is huge diffrence between USA and the Arab world, but the truth is we are people, and apart from few diffrences, the basic emotions, and behaviour are almost the same, that is why the book has such an enourmous success in all the world and with all ages and throughout its history. And as one of the reviewr pointed, that each country knew some major changes to its society, another reason why the book was a huge success. As for the romantic story, it is very powerfull as well. Finally, i would like to say, that i am almost Copy of Ashely Wilkes( without the skill of riding ..lol), and usualy i like the types of Melanie, but you can't help your self and admire Scarlett as a fiction heroine, although i doubt very much i would like her if i met her. I personaly strongly recommend this book.BUT i would like to make a warning for everyone thinking of reading the sequell, because the sequell is no more than a litreature piracy in my opinion, and it is a pure rubbish, and you can better buy a cheap romantic novel insted.I woul love if someone sent me an e mail."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is even better than the movie--really!

I started reading and even the librarian couldnt believe that such a young child, with such an adult book.My teacher, and class mates, IMPRESSED! For me, I never wanted to stop. From Twelve Oaks to Tara, the thrill never ends. So I finished it with partly understanding but then re-read it in sixth grade. The words that were chosen to make this book, is truly amazing. I have to hand it to your Margaret Mitchell, for creating the best book that America will ever know. Because with all of the books I have read and with all of the books I am going to read, I know there is nothing like, \\"Gone with The Wind.\\" \\"Frankly My dear...there is nothing like it!\\" So I am suggesting you start reading it soon, because if you dont have time to day, dont worry . . . \\"Because tomorrow is another day,\\""},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"The many adventures of a spoiled, vain, and annoying adolescent living in Georgia during the Civil War era.

I always feel as though I'm right on Peachtree Street with Scarlett O'Hara, and I never fail to get mad at her for losing Rhett. Everyone should try this at least once."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Scarlett O' Hara has to be the most famous character ever written in all of literature. Her story about coming to age just when the Civil War began and having to learn everything she was taught is of no use to her during war and after war is a must read for anyone. Her transformation into a shrewd, lying and spoiled southern belle is just about the best for any reader who loves stories based on the southern way of life. I just have to say this book is not racist and it was never intended to be. Many people just think it is because now we are bombarded into thinking blacks are the victims of society due to them having been slaves. People this is the story of Scarlett O'Hara living in times when not many black people were educated. Some blacks were but many were not as the belief back then was that blacks were just not too smart to learn. Which we now know is not true. But one thing is true and what many of us now have to understand is that many blacks who were slaves did not want to be freed. Where were they going to go and what were they going to do after being free? What did they know about this strange land being freed? How were they going to survive? They didn't know and they didn't know anything about taking the intiative of oneself instead of being told what to do. And many blacks were defending the then southern way of living. Many slaves did love there slaveowners and wanted to remain with them. Many slaves did fight on the Confederate side willingly. Even when the south did lose the war many ex-slaves did stay with they're ex-slave owners because in they're way of thinking they still belonged to them. It was a mutual love. They did die fighting believing in the Confederate way of thinking. They were not brainwashed it was just they way of living that they knew. They loved there white folk like many Mammies did love there white kids as if they were they're own children. We have to remember that the way of thinking was completely different back then. We have to remember if that way of thinking was now we would think the same way. Love knows no barriers. The love of another to another is just that. Even if it meant a slave-owner loving his slave like a slave loved his owner. Didn't God have a commandment to treat your slave with respect and to give him his seventh year free. The bad people of this story were the carpetbaggers. They caused so much damage in this country back then that the states suffered it for years because of them. They lied to the ex-slaves by telling them to vote them into office and then wanting to have nothing to do with them. As Margaret Mitchell tells in the book many blacks were put into also. I read many books about this subject and it is true. The most ignorant and hateful towards white were put into office. They saw this as a way to get back at the whites for having them in slavery. But that is not it. Many slaves saw it as revenge because of the wrong done unto them by being slaves. What the carpetbaggers did was poison the minds of the ex-slaves by telling them it was wrong and it was wrong but they made them hate the whites by telling lies about how many whites ex-slaveowners beat, torture, and rape and commit atrocities against the blacks. Okay yes it did happen. But like many stories it was embellished. Only about a one percent of the whites did own plantations. Something we dont't believe but it is true. We have been taught that all whites back then were rich and made they're riches on the backs of blacks. That's not true. If it was then there would be more blacks in this country then there are whites. WE as a people of this time know our TIME only, meaning now or present time. We are a product of the liberal public education system. I mean we don't know our history or any other countries either. We love to embellish the past, everybody now who was of voting age swear up and down that they voted for Kennedy when he was running for the presidency. That is a complete lie. So everybody who now who is black (this is excluding the newly arrived black Africans) swear up and down they came from slaves. That is a lie also. Many black families immigrated into the US after the Civil War and after the nineteen hundreds. So many black people can't say they came from slaves. What I am saying is that the Jessie Jacksons and Al Sharptons of this world have poisoned many black people of this country to the point of wanting to hurt them and keep them enslaved in hatred towards the whites of this country. We should remember the civil war but not be embittered by it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"What is the point of reviewing this book? Everyone knows that it is amazing - the movie won many Oscars and got 5 stars, a rare rating for a movie. I read this 1024 page-turner in about 1 month. It takes a little while to get into the story, but not long. Scarlett's character does get a little frustrating at times, you just want to yell at her so she understands!! But that's what makes this book a definite classic. There shouldn't be anybody in the world without this book on their bookshelves, and I mean anybody. And what is even better is owning an older version, or even a first edition! This book makes you want to know everything about it: the movie, the author, a sequel!! Speaking of that, there is &quot;Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind&quot; by Alexandra Ripley. I would definitely recommend that also, I'm about half way through it. Though the author is different, you get into her style quickly and fall back into the romance of Scarlett and Rhett. I would suggest saving the movie (if you haven't seen it) for after reading the book. A great summer read. Worth the $6!!!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is without a doubt the best book in the world! I loved the way Margret Mitchell made the charecters so realistic. If you don't read this book you will be missing out on alot. The ending however is heartbreaking.

This is a book you don't want to miss out on."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"It was amazing to me how much I could love a book with so few admirable characters. (One wonders if the film, &quot;The War of the Roses&quot; might not have been contrived from the story of Rhett and Scarlett.) But in all of her rage, Scarlett's stength and determination still makes her an attractive character, and after all of her shenanigans, you still want her to win. When assessing the characters, it is important to remember that they lived in a society where they played by different rules, often rules difficult for us to understand (e.g. rules regarding what constitutes adultery; and unbending rules of loyalty that might otherwise escape many of us). But all in all, beauty seems only to be found in Melanie and Mammy; a pitiful sympathy for Ashley and the other fallen &quot;Old Guard&quot;; and a most certain feeling that, indeed, Scarlett and Rhett, deserved each other, pain and all."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I always thought &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; would forever hold the title.But &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; may surpass it.As a damn yankee,I discovered I belong south of the Mason-Dixon line,where women are treated respectfully,parents are honored,loyalty to family and friends are boundless,and others postive traits exhibited,that are much too scarce today.Read this book and also find yourself wishing to protect and risk your life for Scarlett!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I grew up watching the movie version of Gone With the Wind, and I first read the novel when I was in 9th grade.

The story starts with Scarlett O'Hara, a charming, determined but stubborn and proud Southern belle, trying to get the heart of Ashley Wilkes, who is to marry all-so-sweet and kind Melly, heartily hated by the leading lady. After over 1000 pages it ends with Scarlett realization that she really loves charming not such a gentleman Rhett Butler, who is also very proud and stubborn.In between the first and the last pages there are 12 years of Scarlett's life, from 16 to 28, Civil War, 3 marriages (the last of them is with Rhett Butler), 3 kids, wealth, poverty, and then wealth again, unseen love of Rhett Butler, death of all beloved, her maturity from a child into a woman, and finally the realization of the true priorities in her life.

I read it again every few years. Why not? In spite of the long list of criticisms (melodramatic, insensitive, sexist, racist, materialism, soap opera, etc.) it is undeniably magnificent.

Lives and lifestyles were changed forever with the Civil War. Southerners had to adapt to an entirely foreign way of life and this novel explores how different people coped in the form of well-developed, complex characters.Difficult to put down, this novel is one you will read over and over again and eventually pass down to your children. Don't hesitate to buy a copy!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book probably has more reviews written for it than any other that I've seen on the Amazon site. As I said, I don't know what I can add that others haven't already said...but I have often thought, as I have read and re-read this wonderful novel, that I don't think Scarlett would get Rhett back in the end. I always thought Rhett was far more intelligent, well-rounded, and wise than she, and that an awful lot of his longing for her was comprised of her lack of availability (her heart, that is, that heart that belonged only to Ashley), and her looks. After all, when did he fall for her? When he looked up at her on the staircase and she was wearing that low-cut green-sprigged dress!The fascinating characters that Mitchell so deftly brings to life are what make this novel so unforgettable. I don't know that any of them are truly believable, but somehow that doesn't matter. The writing style is dated (all those exclamation points!), and of course the dialect and political viewpoints are atrocious in this day and age. The amazing thing is that none of this matters as we find ourselves caught up in Scarlett's world, a world, as Mitchell so poignantly writes,that was gone with the wind.When Rhett tells Scarlett at the end, \\"I won't be pursued as the luckless Ashley was pursued,\\" I believe he meant it. The fact that he could coin a phrase like, \\"Someone or something has convinced you that your lover is too large a piece of Dead Sea fruit for even you to chew\\" (not sure if I'm quoting this 100% correctly, but I've memorized large portions of the dialogue through re-reading) simply showcases how much more extensive his intellect is than Scarlett's. He realizes now that she no longer holds any appeal for him; her charm for him, simply, was her unattainable-ness. (not a word, either - sorry!)I never read the sequel. To me, that would be a sacrilege. Mitchell always said that for her, the novel ended when it ended. But no one who reads it can resist pondering...\\"Did she get him back?\\" And I say no.But read it anyway. It's a long read, but oh, such an enjoyable one."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is now my favorite book of all time (it contends with the Bible people!) and is the reason I am grateful to have sight and the ability to read, to enjoy masterpieces like this. I will admit the first 100 pages were slightly slow, but necessary to build the story. I loved learning more about the Civil War and appreciated seeing it from a perspective that often gets shrouded in history. Slavery was never ok but this book allowed me to explore slavery from the South's point of view. I also loved Scarlet, even with all her downfalls, and enjoyed the book most all when Rhett was highlighted.Every American should be required to read this book! That is how passionately I loved it.Also, the un-sequel Scarlet was a lovely read. Some contest that Mitchell's work should have been left alone and I can see their point. However, I wasn't ready to say good-bye to Scarlet just yet. No, the sequel does not quite compare to the original, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend the sequel to those who secretly want a happier ending for Scarlet."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"GWTW-I discovered it on the shelf of my highschool library & having never heard of it, I decided I would read it. I was completely unprepared for the ride! While we all want to be Melanie, the truth is-we're all a little Scarlett on the inside! I have since read the book many times (and of course own the DVD) and never tire of it. A definite book for gals-you get a glimpse into southern life at the time of the Civil War and experience a love story of enormous preportions. \\"Fiddle Dee Dee\\" is our catch phrase around the house!

Just make sure you have a lot of time to devote to this book, because once you start reading it, you won't be able to stop.

Maybe I'm not completely objective since I have seen the movie for about 10 time before I had read the book (this means I'm crazy about the movie) but still some things are slightely different then they are portrayed in the movie. First of all, there are a lot of characters that the film does not mention (which are quite important, but still, does not change the point) and the book is a lot more unfair I might say, to the slaves (only after reading I realized why there are, if any, contoversies surrounding GWTW phenomenon). They are often portrayed as silly, not so bright people (although very, very lovely and loving) and in the movie they are very smart, prudent people that often help when white people couldn't, that often show more courage and intelligence then the wihite people do and that's why I like them better portrayed in the film. But the things why I absolutely love GWTW, love between Rhett and Scarlett and deep friendship between Scarlett and Melanie, stay the same. So, all in all, I truly recommend this book first of all, to all the GWTW fans (because they CAN'T go wrong with reading it) and then to all the others who'd like to find out thing or two about how things were back in the old South, meet really great characters that are above all, believable and convincing and read about the greatest love story of our time, as it's been said on the covers."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I loved this book but the end reduced me to tears.

This is the best written novel I have ever read, and probably will be the ebst written novel I will ever read in my lifespan. This book has so much detail, the way the characters are described are almost impossible to compare to any book written. Not only is this an epic, but I find it to be a historical epic; it navigates through the years, when the civil war started (or months before it began), through the civil war, the end and the reconstruction. The reconstruction is something that is not ever really written about, and the novel actually depicts what the south is going through after the civil war.Some people might find Scarlett, to be selfish and well...a bitch. But I loved her! Wither her the entire story wouldn't work! I found her love over ashley to be rather mezmerizing, who would spend years after someone, and into three marriages?Scarlett! I thought the most detailed part, were the settings especially rhett's and Scarlett's dream home, talk about having a nice mansion!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone with the Wind is an epic tale of a Southern belle, living through the time that was the Civil War. Scarlett O'Hara, a beautiful yet harsh young woman, is the female protaganist, and the story follows her journey, beginning in a time when all is well; the balls, the parties, the beaux. Her vindictive and manipulative nature pushes her to make a mistake or two, and she finds herself widowed soon after the war has started. The novel leads the audience through the abundance of obstacles Scarlett must endure, allowing the reader to sympathise with her during the lost love of Ashley Wilkes, the neglected love of Rhett Butler, and the terrible times she experiences throughout the war.Margaret Mitchell, despite the fact that Gone with the Wind is her first and only novel, narrates the story with an ease in both the plot and the dialogue, throwing the audience head first into a world where the negroes work for the white man, where war has broken out, and where it is innappropriate to wear a dress revealling your bosom in the morning.Compared to other anecdotes narrating stories of the Civil War, Gone with the Wind is not only a tear-jerker, but a tale that captures hearts, and fingers; leaving readers unable to put the book down."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"First I fell in love with the movie,then I read the book.The edition I have was my moms from the 1930's so i think its an original copy.This story is more than a love story. It is a study in human nature from Scarlets temper tantrums to Rhetts deep devoted love of Scarlet so much so that he has to leave her for his own good.This is undoubtly the best book ever written and by a newcomer at that. Margaret Mitchell outdid herself on this one."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I was twelve years old when I first read this book and fell in love with Scarlett, Rhett, and the Old South.

The book is so much better than the movie, and I'm sure I'll be recommending it to people for many years to come."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"One of the icons of American Literature and deservedly so.First read this when I was a teenager and my friends and I would ooh and aah over the scene near the beginning where Scarlett was trying to decide what to wear to the party at Ashley's plantation.I read it every couple of years thereafter and as I grew and matured so did my appreciation of this magnificent book. I first became more aware of how detailed Mitchell's research about the Civil War must have been (no matter how biased she was) and this prompted me to read more books both fiction and non-fiction about that period.My next level of maturity was demonstrated by subsequent reads where I became more impressed with Mitchell's willingness to avoid a standard HEA. She never painted Scarlett as anything but what the character demanded: a spoiled debutante whose world had not only collapsed but was blown away forever by the \\"wind\\". Scarlett's true, unvarnished, bottom line goal in life became to ensure that she and her family would survive and so would that representation of survival - Tara. Compared to the mores of that lost civilization, she seemed to have fallen from grace. In reality, she, being so very young, came to understand which of the values and mores of that civilization were worth keeping and what were just superficial and ignorant societal expectations. Unfortunately, she didn't realize this in time to obtain the greatest of those worthwhile values - true and reciprocated love. However, she did get what she needed and was looking toward the future with her trademark confidence and assurance.Just a fabulous, fabulous book."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I had borrowed the audio from my local library, and after both realizing I wouldn't finish it in time, and that it was so very good I wanted to share it, I bought it.

I also have begun to understand some of the old family Atlantans' feelings about what happened to their society."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I cried when I finished this book. I honestly did. No, it was not the heart-breaking ending that brought me to tears, but the fact that there was no more Gone with the Wind. The book brought me so much into its depths, made me so much a part of its words, that at the end I felt almost as if a friend died. I just wish that Margaret Mitchell were alive so that I could talk to her, understand the mind that created such a masterpiece. I will never read a better book."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Okay, everyone has been saying that this book is insulting, that it's racist, etc.Yes, it is extremely racist. Slavery is one of the most horrible inventions of the world. When slavery became race-oriented, it got even worse.But everyone really needs to take GWTW in perspective. First of all, the African-American slavery was hugely propagandized by the North U.S. There were a lot less beatings and brandings than is commonly perceived. The real horror of slavery was the psychological effect. Imagine that you've been told all your life that you are worthless, and fit only to be a slave. Wouldn't you conduct yourself in that way? That was the true horror of slavery. The reason that there were few beatings and brandings was even more horrible. It was because slaves were considered to be valuable property, and the plantation owners would as soon whip their valuable horses to death as whip their valuable slaves. The Northerners really didn't need to exaggerate bloodhounds and whippings; these stories are enough to get the North into a patriotic fervor. So GWTW, although ridiculously romanticized when it comes to slavery, is not completely incorrect. But it does fail to take into account the psychological effects that I just mentioned. It also fails the characterize the black characters in the narrative.Despite all these faults, GWTW is not meant to cater to modern views or even what we would call \\"just\\" views. It is meant to depict the Southern attitude at the time of the Civil War and the Reconstruction. Obviously, since everyone is incredibly incensed about its attitude, it succeeds remarkably well.Second of all, the movie romaticizes the already romantic book. Mitchell did not portray the rich plantationers in GWTW, she portrayed the middle-class, uneducated pioneers, with the exception of the Wilkes family. They were not contemptuous towards Crackers and poor whites because they were only a step and some luck above them. Essentially they had started out in their position. Gerald O'Hara is harldy anyone's estimation of the typical rich, supercilious, high-class planter. There weren't any stereotypical planters in Georgia, anyway, not before or after the Civil War. It was more a homesteading state than a Kentucky.So, overall, GWTW did exactly what it set out to do. And yes, it really neglects the black psychological view and focuses mainly on Scarlett's and Rhett's, with a couple of other characters. But this is also in character of the time. If anyone really wants to read a clarifying book about GWTW, read Southern Daughter. It ought to help with the rather confused opinions being circulated about GWTW."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This has to be the best book ever written. Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, and Ashley were brought to life within those 1,024 pages. You felt there sorrows, joys, worries, and loves. I loved Rhett, he was such a character! Melanie is larger than life, and too good for Scarlett. As long as she had Ashley, she was unaffected by the war. Ashley was a gentleman in an era he did not belong in. He was simply an ornament not a laborer. Rhett was everything a character could be, (not to mention very dashing.) Scarlett is probably the only character that you love one chapter and hate the next. She had a very strong will to survive and a lot of selfishness. She was strong enough to survive the war, but she was not as strong as Melanie, (mentally.) My very favorite characters were the Tarleton twins, espically Brent. I do think Melanie was not very strong (physically) but she made up for it with her huge heart, you would have to have one to always stand up for Scarlett. My favorite part of the book is when Scarlett and Rhett are on their honeymoon. They were really, truly in love then. I would think Scarlett would love Rhett long before she did. He was so kind and loving to Bonnie. I think Rhett really did love her the whole time, and he really would not leave her. Why didn't Scarlett marry Stuart? The book would be very different, but Scarlett loved him. GREAT BOOK!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Oh my god!!! i just fifnished GWTW like an hour ago and i still keep bursting into tears. is that normal? maybe for other people but not for me.

For all of you who have not read this novel, it is a historical fiction romance novel about a girl who had it all, lost it all and had to learn to stop being so vain. It is a story that will never come out of the line of favorite books to read so one must read it at least one in our lifetime!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I have had this book in my library for well over 10 years. I often picked it up, but never began to read it. I knew of all the hype about this being the great American epic novel and a Pulitzer Prize winner. I had seen the movie twice. The first time when I was maybe 8 when I saw it with my grandparents. The only thing I remember was asking my grandfather, \\"Why is grandma crying?\\" The second time I saw it, maybe five years ago, I was deeply disappointed in its lack of realism. Today's movies of blood and gore made the battle scenes and the long bloodless dolly shot of the wounded soldiers lying on the ground in Atlanta look plastic and fake. Another reason I neglected to read this book: 1024 pages. But, finally I decided to give it a shot, and am I glad I did. It is difficult to find the proper superlatives to use here. One plus, because of my busy schedule I had to read this in fits and starts, and it took over two months. However, author Mitchell has given us such strong and descriptive characters and has given so much detail to all of the plot twists and turns, that it was easy to return to the book and have complete remembrances of what has happened in the preceding pages. The story is compelling. Scarlett is a complex and fascinating heroine; Rhett her perfect antagonist. The minor characters all are well drawn. From the battle scenes, the aftermath, the period of reconstruction, what we have here is history come alive. I will cherish the hours I spent with this book. As a result, I will now search for a biography of Ms. Mitchell to learn why this was the only book this magnificent author ever wrote."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I haven't been so engrossed in a book in a while. That's not to say I haven't read any good books lately, but there are some novels that take you hostage, laying siege to your thoughts until you can't think of anything else. You turn every single page, devouring them one by one. When it's over, you've ingested it and the story sticks inside you. It becomes so much a part of you that it's like looking through an old lens at something that happened to you a long time ago.Scarlett O'Hara has been forever ingrained in my brain as someone to aspire never to be like and someone to admire. She is completely oblivious to people and how they work-hurting feelings and breaking hearts-but she has gumption and ambition, which is admirable. Margaret Mitchell masterfully crafts a protagonist that is a completely different person on page 1,448 than she was on page 1, but still fundamentally the same. It's a brilliant blend of changing times and societies, a history lesson, a love story, a tragedy, and most of all a story of a person's capacity for change. I actually feel like there is nothing more I can say about this novel to do it justice.So, I suggest to anyone and everyone to read this book and not to be intimidated by the page count. It is honestly one of the best stories I've ever read; there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is rightly deemed a classic novel."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I am a native Georgian, and I cannot believe I waited so long to read Gone With the Wind. Pat Conroy's new introduction finally got me to pick it up, and it simply is one of the best books I have ever read. It is magnificent. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, it is a snapshot of a conquered nation and people - right here in the United States - and how they survive and persevere in the face of changing times, a lost war, and overwhelming odds.If your only exposure to Gone With the Wind is the film, you have so much more to discover. There are many important differences between the book and the film. ***SPOILER ALERT*** The book has many colorful characters sacrificed for the movie - Will Benteen, a Confederate Veteran who ends up running Tara and marrying one of Scarlett's sisters, Mrs. Tarleton (mother of the twins), Honey Wilkes (Ashley's sister), Uncle Henry Hamilton (Melanie and Charles' uncle), Dilcey (wife of Pork), and the much more fleshed out Aunt Pittypat and Belle Watling, just to name a few. In the book Scarlett has three children, one by each of her three husbands, instead of just Bonnie as portrayed in the film. Another major difference between the book and the film is that Rhett's motivations, background, and depth of feeling (and incredible suffering) comes through in the book in much more detail. In addition, by the end of the book I had a great affection for the quiet forgiveness, intelligence and iron-clad strength of Melanie that I felt was a bit lost in the film. Melanie truly is one of literature's greatest \\"steel magnolias.\\" ***END OF SPOILERS***I was very interested to read of Gone With the Wind's popularity overseas. It has been reported that the book has been translated into 40 foreign languages in 50 countries. It is amazingly popular in Japan, and in Germany more than 360,000 copies were sold by July 1941. I had never thought about it before, but Gone With the Wind was written during the late 1920's and 1930's about survival in the American south during and after the Civil War, at the same time Germany was suffering and rebuilding from its defeat in World War I. The European resistance movement during World War II found so much inspiration in the south's reaction to the Federal occupation in Gone With the Wind that the book was bootlegged during the war by the French Underground and other organizations. Orders actually went out from Germany at one point during World War II to \\"seize all copies.\\"During and after World War II people in rebuilding countries took the story of Gone With the Wind to heart. Margaret Mitchell stated, \\"In practically every European country critics wrote at length of the 'universal historical significance.' Each nation applied to its own past history the story of the Confederate rise and fall and reconstruction. French critics spoke of 1870 (the Franco-Prussian War), Poles of the partitioning of their country, Germany of 1918 and the bitterness which followed, Czechs wrote not only of their troubled past but of their fears of the future, and I had letters from that country just before it went under (Nazi domination), saying that if the people of the South had risen again to freedom the people of Czechoslovakia could do likewise.\\"The worldwide legacy of Gone With the Wind is truly astounding, and it all began right here in the Atlanta area with this book. Do not be put off by the book's size. Gone With the Wind is a real barn burner, and there is not a dull moment in the entire story. It is dramatic, brutal, romantic, amazingly intelligent, and quite shocking even by today's standards. The pages literally fly by. Read the first two chapters and if you are like me you will not be able to put it down. Margaret Mitchell's storytelling ability is an amazing thing to behold.Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This was my first read of \\"Gone with the Wind\\" and have to say it is by far some of the most vivid visual writing style I've encountered.

First, I saw the movie on TV - bought the DVD and watch it at least once a year. Whenever I think of GWTW, I visualize Scarlett and her father at the oak tree at sunset...as the music swells. I enjoyed the story of a strong woman who truly believes that she is only trying to do her best for her family. Now. I said all that, to say this: the movie is nothing compared to the book! The book fleshes out the characters, life in the deep south, and the civil war. The book is long,yes, but there are no gratuitous descriptors - every word adds to your understanding of the people, the time, and the politics. After having the movie 'in my head' for so many years, believing that it was the story - I was delighted to find so much more in the book. I now read the book about once a year. This book is a must read for anyone whoever saw the movie; and for anyone looking for a real novel!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I am 16 years old and finished Gone With The Wind a few months ago. This is the most amazing story I have ever had the pleasure to lay my eyes upon. I have had an obsession with Gone With The Wind for quite some time and I read anything and everything I can about this novel and the film, my all time favorite movie. This is an amazingly captivating novel. Margaret Mitchell is perhaps the greatest author in American history. She is a literary goddess and her timeless characters have left a huge impression upon me. People say that the greatest tragedy in literary history is Romeo and Juliet...I think not! When I finished reading Gone With The Wind I realized that those people were wrong...when Rhett leaves Scarlett after all of her pleading and apologizing...it is undescribable in human terminology. Mitchell's amazing recount of the Civil War, the Old South, and the lives that were touched by both is unparalleled in the history of recorded language...I have become ! extremely interested in the history of the Old South and the greatest American crisis-the Civil War. This novel is by far a literary phenomenon...it will never be equalled or surpassed!

I became so hooked on the romance between Scarlett and Rhett, I just thought about it for days and days. I convinced my friends to read it, and they were addicted to it also. The film Gone with the Wind is superb, I imagine Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable perfectly as the two! The descriptions and wit in the novel is unsurpassed, by the end of the novel I felt like I knew Scarlett &quot; down the her bones&quot;. Very few books made me laugh aloud, gasp, sigh, and cry--this is one of them. Every time I pass the book on my shelf. I want to read it again. Once you get started..it's hell to stop. The sequel is pretty good, I just needed more of Rhett and Scarlett to keep thinking of. I wish terribly that Margaret Mitchell had written more for us to eternally cherish.

Take a ride in a horse carriage to a ball, and there be introduced to some of the most memorable people you'll ever meet. I'm refering to the exciting experience of Gone With The Wind. Nothing you ever read will captivate, motivate, affect, or teach you more. The characters are so real that they become part of your life, they change your life. Scarlett O'hara is the most beautiful, unforgettable heroine of any novel. Spoiled and self-centered, but there's still no denying that she's a very intelligent, strong person. You get to know Scarlett so well that she becomes part of you, and she even changes how you view yourself and your life. You fall in love with dashing, dark, handsome, mysterious, yet, charming Mr. Rhett Butler. Not to exclude the other wonderful personalities of Ashley Wilkes, sweet Melanie, Aunt Pitty Pat, and certainly not excluding Mammy. Witness the horror of the Civil War, and learn the truth about the Old South. While also learnig about love, life, and the exciting unpredictablities of both. I love, adore, and cherish GWTW!

But when she learns the man she had been psuedo-courting, Ashley Wilkes, is marrying Melanie Hamilton from Atlanta, his cousin, she schemes to win him back. When he refuses, she immediately marries Charles Hamilton in spite. But Civil War has come to the South, and Scarlett quickly finds herself a widow, stuck in Atlanta, with a child, unable to be the pretty belle she had been a few months prior. Will Scarlett ever get Ashley? What about the strange Rhett Butler character, who is constantly tweaking her? Will Scarlett and her family survive the war?Let me preface my review with this: I don't read a lot of historical fiction or chick lit or romance or anything. My speciality is science fiction, fantasy, and urban fantasy. However, this book absolutely, positively blew me away!At first, I found the novel a bit slow. There were so many characters, and at first, it seemed like nothing happened. But that wasn't to last. Quickly, I became interested in Scarlett's schemes to snatch Ashley away from Melanie, all the while hating her for her bad behavior. By the end of the book, there were points were I was in near tears.Scarlett wasn't my favorite character. She was a rude, bitter, selfish woman. But I completely understood her predicament. To the reader, she was completely honest, despising her first husband's death (and life!), her dislike of children (don't see that much in romance do we!), her dislike of women's poor station (always having to act \\"silly\\" in front of the menfolk), and taking the reigns of business to make a life of her own. So while I didn't like her, I also didn't hate her. I understood what she was trying to do and found myself rooting for her against the odds. She is a brilliantly written character, so dynamic, multifaceted and full.Melanie Hamilton was probably my favorite character. This might seem odd as she does come off as a Mary Sue--perfect and sweet to everyone, always right, yada, yada--and I hate Mary Sues. But I really never found Melanie a Mary Sue. Scarlett repeatedly downplays Melanie's beauty. Melanie is strong-willed and works diligently, but tires easily (such as when she works at Tara in the cotton fields). Like Scarlett, Melanie was definitely not a 1-D character. She appeared weak on the outside, while maintaining strenght in the face of danger, in the face of childbirth, in the face of hard times. She was a true inspiration to me.Rhett Butler made me so furious, sometimes I wanted to slap him like Scarlett! But other times, he was so charming and debonair, that I wanted to melt in his arms like butter. I loved how forthright he was, how practical and realistic he was, and yet how at times, his passionate nature came through (joining the Confederate army at the end, for example).Side characters, such as Miss Pittypat, Mammy, Dilcey, Pork, Uncle Peter, Mrs. Meade, Belle Watling, and more, jumped out at me. They felt like real people, people influenced by dreams, desires, and feelings. Probably one of the sweetest moments was when Dr. and Mrs. Meade were talking and she mentioned she would rather him be at Belle's than dead. Given what Mrs. Meade had been through, what she held dear, it was particularly poignant.I could go on endlessly about the amazing life lessons and themes and symbols in the book. Quotes about the status of women at the time, about changing with the changing times, about strength of character, about being who you are, and about what is really important in life abound in this book. Most of the ones that really touched me may be found on my profile page, though the whole book is brimming with it.As this deals with the South during the Civil War, there is much talk of slavery; one of the reasons, I believe, it has been so frequently placed on the Banned Books list. Some people believe that it shows slavery in a favorable light, that blacks were/are children that need to be tended by whites. My opinion is this: it shows how many white Southern plantation owners viewed slaves. Not all slave owners were Mr. Simon Legree of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Conversely, not all slave owners are like the O'Hara's. Yes, there are a lot of black stereotypes (Mammy, Prissy, etc.), but this is a snapshot into the past. You can't take this book and try to force modern views of civil rights and racism into it. However, I do believe it makes a brilliant discussion piece: comparing Scarlett and other Southern whites' views of blacks with other accounts (such as Uncle Tom's Cabin or the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn).All in all, this is a brilliant book, made more excellent by the narrator, who deftly interprets the Southern dialect and accents for the listener. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was heart-broken, but inspired, when it ended. I highly recommend, even to those, like me, who aren't big into historical fiction.Brought to you by:*C.S.

However, halfway through the second page, I began noticing that the words were flying by, and my world was slowly grinding to a halt. Everything stopped so I could continue reading. The book was absolutely enthralling. The chemistry and romance between Rhett and Scarlett was so incredibly well written that I could see sparks flying out of their eyes, and here the firecrackers crackling as they traded insults. Even if they didnt know that they were perfect for eachother, we knew. After reading this book, I have come to the conclusion that, not only is Margaret Mitchell a phenomenal American writer, but she also is one of the best people to describe the South during and around the Civil War time period. She completely deserved the Pultizer Prize that she won, and I will continue to pass on the message about this amazing book. Such an archetypal novel should be timeless; it will never die out or become obsolete."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"well, ok, the cover looks like a romance novel and i wouldnt be caught dead without some kind of a dust jacket.it was very engaging and a fast read though its size can be daunting. with colorful discreptions, wonderful prose and excllient character development it is well worth the time it takes to finish it. it's one of the few books i would say is much better than the movie. you'll be glad you read it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Originally, I fell in love with the movie.

I haven't read this since I was a young girl in the early 70's and should never have waited so long to read it again. The characters were exceptionally well drawn, the dialogue was brilliant, particularly between Rhett (SIGH!) and Scarlett. I swear there was sparks flying off the pages. I am going to miss the people I will have to put behind me now that the book has come to an end, Rhett (SIGH), Scarlett, Mammy, Prissy and Aunt Pitty Pat (LOL).The author's use of prose was beautiful, all the scenes and action came alive for me. Some people seem to be offended by the racism in the book, but that's how things were back then. Sugar coating it would have ruined the story reducing it to a Harlequin romance.This is an incredibly well written book about the death of a civilization and the struggles to survive in the new era. This is a book that should not be missed, particulary those who enjoy historical fiction."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I actually discorved Gone with the Wind when I was eleven, and it is an interesting story. I was in a race against a classmate to find the longest book in the school library, read it, and pass the test on it before she did. I read it, wondered why they put a book like that in an elementary school, took the test, passed and basked in the glory or beating someone. But when it was time to return my copy to the library I was disappointed, and renewed it three times until the librarian made me give it back. Then, months later I was visiting my grandmother (she lived in Texas, I in Nebraska) and noticed that she had a copy of the book (with a sticker on the front that said 50 cents.). I took it out of the shelf and started to read it, and when my grandma found me reading it, she said she never liked it and gave it to me. Bam. Love at first page. I read it three times and got the sequel from the public library (not bad, but it will never compare to the original), and saw both the GWTW movie and the 'Scarlett' miniseries, before I was twelve.I am always reading Gone with the Wind. My old copy is hidden away somewhere, but I bought myself a new one in slightly better condition. I am in ove with this book. I read it late at night every singe night, and when I finish the book I instantly start again. I have yet to find any book by any author that could possibly stand up to this novel. To anyone to is considering this book but can't decide-buy this book. The money you pay for this piece of writing will be the most well-spent money you've ever given for a book. This is an unforgettable tale with two of the greatest characters of all time. Need I say more?"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This vivid tale of the Civil War and Reconstruction is not idealism (as reviews calling it racist imply) but realism. The rich characterizations and deep plot reveal its author to be one of profound understanding, not only of human nature and of life itself, but also of the forgotten, overlooked, untaught aspects of war and racial strife.Observe the polemics of those who call it racist. I dare say that that charge would be made by the same people of any book using any approbrious terminology whatever, regardless of the context.Also, as you read the negative reviews, notice the consistent lack of specifics of those who doubt its historical validity. There will not be one single example. This is part of their method of deterence, and they have nothing but hollow, unsupported invective. Anyone who needs clarification is welcome to email me.I am a constant reader, and I found Gone With the Wind not only sublime in its narrative and poetic in its dialogue, but an excellent adventure into the &quot;house of cards&quot; that was the lives of the Southern aristocracy."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler are classic charecters along with the rest of them. They're as classic as the story. So much history is in the book. It gives a clear and good picture of how it was during that time. Everything isn't perfect. I'm 11 years old. That may seem too young to understand such a classic love story but I did. It was even better than other love stories like Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Not to say they aren't classics. Ms. Mitchell writes the story clearly and comes straight to the point unlike for instance Henry James who takes up 2 pages to describe a woman's dress. If you read one love story in your life or watch one movie make it Gone with the Wind."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"As with all great classics, I am hard-pressed to say anything original about Gone With the Wind. This is my second reading and I still love the book. If you have seen the movie, but have not read the book, read the book. There is a great deal more that will only add to your enjoyment of the storyline.Some things I did not know about Margaret Mitchell made re-reading the book all the more interesting (thank you Wikipedia). Mitchell's maternal great-grandfather was from Ireland and settled on a slaveholding plantation in Georgia. Her grandfather fought in the Civil War and made a lot of money in the lumber business after the war (just like Scarlett!). As a young girl, Mitchell heard a lot of Civil War stories from her relatives and visited the ruined plantations in Georgia. And, most interesting to me was that her mother was a women's rights activist.I think these points are important because they give you a better understanding of the characters in GWTW. And I think the most interesting point is Mitchell's portrayal of Scarlett as a shrewd and independent businesswoman during a time when no women ran businesses or even played a role in commerce, except maybe in selling pies like Mrs. Merriwether and taking in sewing and boarders like Mrs. Elsing. (Or Belle Watling's business. Belle's character is also quite modern, profession aside.) Mitchell also portrays Ellen, Scarlett's mother, as the true head of the plantation, with Gerald as a figurehead.Although I love this book, it is difficult to read the sections about slavery and the slaves on the O'Hara plantation. The O'Haras take pride in their kind treatment of their slaves, yet the O'Haras and other plantation owners come off as very condescending. And who knows whether kind treatment was common on all southern plantations. It's a bad part of American history and all accounts of this time-period make you cringe. But I think it's important to note that some of Mitchell's slave characters (Mammy, Pork, Uncle Peter) are smarter and wiser than their owners.I think Mitchell's description of the post-war period is very good and it shows what a mess Atlanta was and how the Southern way of life known and loved by its people was forever lost. I like how the characters, particularly Melanie and her followers cling to their committees and old customs, even when the Northerners take over the city.There are certainly many, many other points to add about the characters and the book, Melanie's goodness, Ashley's displacement in the new South, and Scarlett's inability to understand and appreciate the people around her until it is too late.I like Rhett Butler the best. He is very modern, thinking it ridiculous never to mention pregnancy and birth control. He loves children and these things make him even more appealing. You want to forget how he makes his money, his drinking and what he does over at Belle's house because he is so likeable and smooth. His flirtatious conversations with Scarlett are so fun to read, but my favorite parts are when Rhett shows his true feelings to Melanie, and sadly to Scarlett at the end."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Simply put, Gone With The Wind is a masterpiece of epic proportions. It doesn't get any better than this. The movie by comparison is an utter waste of time. I have read Gone With The Wind over and over again and it never gets old. I couldn't recommend a book more."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I never saw the classic movie Gone With the Wind until I was in my late teens. But I had read the book. Of course I'd heard of the movie, and I had a vague idea that it was a romance tale set during the Civil War. But something drew me to it. Perhaps I picked up that it was an epic tale, or something similar.Anyway, one day while walking through a book store while in my early teens, I decided it was time I learned what all the fuss was about. Being a guy, I didn't expect to find much to like, but I figured I give the novel a chance.I'm glad I did.Yes, at its heart, Gone With the Wind is a romance story, though some might consider it a tragedy since (SPOILER ALERT) the romance dies in the end, but I loved the story.The characters were grand. The backdrop was ... well, it was epic, truth be told. The plotting was somewhat complex without being overly complicated. And it was pretty good writing.So why should I shun a novel just because it's romance? Because I'm a guy? That's silly.Especially considering, at least in my own opinion, this novel is so much more than just a romance. Believe me, as a form of education I've read a few romance novels. None of them come close to anything like Gone With the Wind.No bodice ripping here. There a scream or two from the heroine, but they're at appropriate times. And what a heroine! Scarlett O'hara is no wilting violet waiting for a man to save the day. No, she has no problems standing up for herself, maybe too much at times. In fact, Scarlett's hard-headedness is one of the character's tragic flaws within the novel.Okay, if you're one of those guy readers who thinks you could never pick up a romance novel, do yourself a favor and read Gone With the Wind. Though it's set in the American Civil War, you're not going to find page after page of descriptions of troop movements and battles and all that jazz. But you will find complex, interesting characters who are as real, as bold, and sometimes as weak as any found in the best literature of the world."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is the classic tale of wanting what you can't have ... until you can. Romance aside, this book is chock full of history, drama, suspense, emotional turmoil and philosophical whimsy. It's peppered with a dry, cynical wittiness that will keep you, not only turning pages, but smiling, laughing, and even occasionally gasping incredulously. Especially whenever the irresistible Rhett Butler enters a scene.The dialogue is simply smashing. The characters are realistic and resonate on a soul deep level. This is something that the movie version was, understandably, unable to pull off. Scarlett came across as a one dimensional, selfish, cold hearted monster on the big screen. In the book, however, we have behind the scenes access to her mind, heart, will and emotions. When this story is appreciated in literary form, one finds it difficult to either love or hate her entirely because, just as in reality, there are too many shades of gray.I have seen some people label this book as racist and intolerant. While I agree that there are some rather uncomfortable themes and an indisputable usage of inappropriate language, readers must bear in mind that this is a work of fiction depicting the culture and mind sets of characters living during the Civil War period. If the story had been written in any other way, it would have detracted from the authenticity of the tale. That being said, if you are sensitive to such things, you should probably steer clear.As far as I am concerned, this is a must read for any fan of historical fiction. Yet, I must warn you; Don't expect a happy or conclusive ending lest you be disappointed. After reading Forever Amber and many Anita Shreve books, I am always emotionally prepared for such a let down. Still, that didn't stop me from turning the last page of Gone With The Wind, anxiously looking for more. I was breathless with wonder, racked with unanswered questions, passionately angry at fate and, of course, torn between love and hate. When you really stop to think about it though, how could two personalities as dashingly quixotic as Scarlett and Rhett be expected to depart in any other fashion?"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I read GWTW one summer when I was a teenager, and got completely absorbed in it. I woke up one morning to the smell of bacon and stretched luxuriously in my bed as if I were Scarlett. Margaret Mitchell created a rich view of the antebellum south and characters that seemed real, making it easy for a reader to feel the horrors of the Civil War and empathize with the characters. Mitchell once said that Scarlett was a hussy, so I guess she was, but I never saw her that way. To me, she was a strong young woman who was forced out of her pampered world, determined to seize control of the future instead of cowering in a corner, even if it made her a social outcast."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Margaret Mitchell wrote one of the most popular novels of all time. Set against the breath-taking backdrop of the red hills of Georgia during the American Civil War, Gone With the Wind is a window into a society that was swept away by war. Although I must say I doubt the portrayal of slavery is authentic in this work, every other aspect must be accurate. I have read some background information on Mitchell and, to my knowledge, she spent a significant amount of time researching every detail of her story--even down to the time of day that the list of deaths from the Battle of Gettysburg arrived in Atlanta.As a Southerner, I am proud of Mitchell's success and her novel. I would have to say that this is my favorite novel of all time--a great epic about the South and its storied past.However, as vast as the setting may be, it's easy to forget that there are two different plots going on: that of Georgia, and the South, during the Civil War, and that of Scarlett O'Hara and her struggle of hunger, poverty, love, and much more. The timing that Margaret Mitchell used in her novel (i.e. the death of Melanie, thus setting Ashley free; but at the same time realizing she, Scarlett, loved Rhett all along.) is amazing. However, the last part, Part V, moves a bit fast. But I suppose you can't dwell on 12 years worth of dialogue and narrative...I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a historical novel. Although this book has been known since its publication as a romance, I would say that Gone With the Wind is anything but a modern romance--it is the epitome of what a romance SHOULD be."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With the Wind is one of those books that for years I've been telling myself I really should read, but other books just kept getting in the way. I finally decided pick it up, and couldn't put it down once I started it. It's such a wonderful story, and the ending is one of the best endings I've ever read in a book. The book is so much more than just a romance. I really wish Mitchell had written a sequel, because I would love to know what happens next to Scarlett (I know there are a few sequels out there by other authors, but to me that just isn't the same..I won't be reading them).One thing that was very hard for me to take was the extreme racism in the book. Of course, reading a book set in the South during slavery times and you know at least some of the characters will be racist. What surprised me though was how it is very apparent that Mitchell was very racist as well, and wasn't afraid to make her feelings about blacks and the South in general known. I really had to mentally block out some of Mitchell's attitudes in order to fully enjoy the book. At one point--around page 600, when Mitchell is describing the Restoration--I nearly had to set the book aside; it upset me so much. I'm glad I didn't though, because it is a great story, and one that will stay with me forever."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"The color red. It usually represents blood or love. However, Margaret Mitchell uses a little bit of both meanings in her description of Scarlett O'Hara, protagonist of Gone with the Wind. Scarlett represents two of the most powerful human emotions: love and hate. Gone with the Wind is truly classic American literature, as it encompasses such strong emotions and redefines the reader's historical understanding.It is hard to describe the level of feeling one gets from reading this book. Mitchell has loaded her story from cover to cover with strong details that take the reader on an intense voyage of human emotion. The reader can easily become involved in the story through this detail. The feelings Scarlett has for Ashley draw the reader back to his or her childhood. As Scarlett matures throughout the course of the novel, so too does the reader. Love, hate, anger and sorrow are all common emotions everyone experiences, and Mitchell uses her words to draw out these emotions from her readers so that they can truly understand Scarlett's character.They say that history is always written from the winner's perspective. This novel counters that, as it tells the story of the South from the South's perspective. For example, it provides a new point of view on Sherman's march to the sea, showing the way the Southern cities were affected and the feelings of the people living in them. Because the events are familiar to the reader, they stick out and maintain the reader's interest.Gone with the Wind is a classic in American literature, and is a touching story of a young woman experiencing life. Her name reflects her various personality traits, and makes for an interesting story. Everyone should read this book, but make sure you have plenty of time, as it is quite a lengthy book. Also, while extremely touching and a fun read, it can be difficult at times due to the broken Southern used as dialogue. Despite these few drawbacks, the novel is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys curling up with a good book and becoming emotionally part of the story. It is a good story that reflects the many aspects found in the color red."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Great book just as I knew it would be. I can't believe that I've never read it til now. The movie itself is one of my all-time favorites, but they changed quite a few things which bugs me & the book's so much better. I can't wait to read \\"Scarlett\\" the sequel..."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I know this film so well and often quote dialogue but had never read the book. My first purchase on the Kindle and off camping. A thousand pages of southern saga sweeping off the page. It amazed me how the characters in the book are simply written descriptions of the eventual actors. You would recognise Clark Gable and Vivienne Leigh, even Melanie and Ashley like old friends. It was amazing. Also made me understand better a few things in the movie that were not clear to me - the Ku Klux Klan for example.If you are a fan of the movie but had never read the book - do so. It may be from the 1930's but the story holds, as does the film. Well worth the read and a great camping weekend relax."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"It's no wonder this is the second most sold book in history.

I read it over a two month span and was so sorry to reach the end."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Truly a classic by Margaret Mitchell. This was one book I read and loved since high school days, and that was forty plus years ago. The literary style with its vivid descriptions is excellent - the unforgettable civil war of the late 1800's,the rebuilding of the beautiful Tara estate, and of course the emotional stirrings and passion of both Scarlet O' Hara and Rhett Butler. All these and more bring us back to the good old days and the lessons that we have learned to value through the times."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.

In fact, I think I love it even more now, with a little life experience under my belt. Just a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is a rich, breathtaking classic that can (and should) be read over and over again. It is a long, long story spanning twelve eventful years, but it is definitely worth the time it takes to read. The book is like an epic - Margaret Mitchell's voice is powerful, poetic, wise. Characters are the most important element of a book for me, and this book has the most beautiful, complex, unique characters I have ever encountered in a work of fiction. Scarlett never ceases to amaze me - her resourcefulness and ambition are incredible for a woman of her time. It is incredible how tragedy transforms her - from flighty and carefree to a harsh, driven woman whose compelling desire is to return to the security and prosperity before the war. She is also a frustrating protagonist in her narrow-minded stubbornness and inability to understand others and her own heart. Rhett Butler is the other character in this novel that captivates me. Readers will love his subtle sarcasm, sharp wit, and suave mannerisms. It's impossible not to! He is the quintessential \\"bad boy\\" that countless authors have tried to recreate. But he runs deep too, especially in his love for Scarlett and sentimentality for the charm of the Old South.The historical fiction aspect of the novel is extraordinary as well. I fell in love with the deep South as Mitchell described it, even though I have no connection to that part of America. I never considered the plight of Southerners during and after the Civil War, but this book revealed its devastating effect on the people and customs of the South. Books about the destruction of a society rarely end happily. But it surprised and disheartened me when the author paralleled Scarlett and Rhett's love story with the downfall of the South."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I loved Gone with the Wind.. The time period was a crucial time for shaping America as we now know it. So many things stand out in my mind from the book but the one that I see the most is the relationship between Scarlett and Rhett. I think we know he loves her from the moment on the stairs at Twelve Oaks.. Scarlett to me seems like our modern day power hungry woman.. going against tradition in a mans world and proving a woman can survive..however she did marry Mr. Kennedy..but he was just a means to an end.. nothing more to her but a way to get what she wanted.. Then again like many modern day women her children were not anyone she really cared to be around and left them in the care of others while she worked hard to get the money she so wanted.. I think Scarlett always loved Rhett and did not know it till the end and when she found out she saw that she finally had all the money she could need but she did not have the one thing that could truley make her happy.. LOVE.. The story left me a little sad because of all that the people went through during those years of war and reconstruction.. but with those changing times we saw the freedom that so many deserved and the way of life of the South forever changed (regardless of those who can not seem to except that after all these years) I myself am a southerner and I can say that there were many things about the old south that seem magical..but so many others that were just plain wrong. Gone with the Wind shows so much of the Old South and of all the characters I think Mammy was the strongest and smartest of them all.. She was a woman that could tell you right from wrong in a world that you thought you knew everything and she stood by her \\"family\\" through more than blood kin would have.. Gone with the Wind is a must have on any book shelf."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is my all time favorite. My Nana lived five houses away from MM in Ansley Park, an Atlanta suburb. She pointed out the house many times, she must have thought I wasn't listening. Nana, a staunch Presbyterian finally broke down and read the book, considered somewhat scandalous. (my mother said that Nana disappeared for days until she finished it...and did like it) Margaret was a bit ahead of her time...wanting to be a journalist, to work where only men were permitted. Finally, just to get her off their back...The Atlanta Constitution hired her to cover the homicide division. She flourished.She married Red, then divorced him but they would \\"meet up\\" from time to time. Apparently there was ample chemistry. She fashioned Rhett Butler after her handsome rogue of a husband so much so that MGM required Margaret to get a release from him fearing some kind of lawsuit. He signed it gladly, happy for the likeness.I first read the book at age 16 and have since read it five more times. The research for its historical accuracy, the language, the complex characters, the rich texture of the tale and then the FABULOUS ending! Still impressive.

It's a long book but I figured my familiarity with the story line would help me through it.Why did I wait so long to read this book--it was wonderful! So much more than the movie, with additional detail and real perspective on the characters. Those overwraught emotions make so much more sense after reading the book! Although there is a rich historical background in this novel, it's really about one woman's struggle against herself, her time, and her enemies.I also really enjoyed the narrator of this audio book. She did a wonderful job of bringing the story alive and giving depth to the different characters (with different voices and inflections) and had a wonderful way of telling the story.If you are a fan of GWTW the movie and have never read the book, I urge you to get out there and find a copy.

Yes, racism is rampant, but I loathe history and I loved this book."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I absolutely LOVED the book! I never would have read the book, but I read a review somewhere that someone said don't wait until you're 50 years old like her to read the book. It was very easy to read and I enjoyed the author's writing style. Even though the book was Fiction, Mitchell wrote it with realistic and actual events of the pre/post Civil War. I had a great and better understanding of why the Southerners thought the way they did about the Yankees and continue to grasp their love for their land, values, and ideals of the Old South even to this day.I had seen the movie, \\"Gone with the Wind\\" a few years back but didn't get a true appreciation of it of why it was such a great movie, and after reading the book, I purchased the DVD. Having read the book, it was easy to follow and understand the movie which doesn't always capture the true essence of the book.I am on a pursuit of reading classic novels and this was on my list. Take the time to read this book...it is quite large so it will take some time to read but is well worth it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This wonderful book deserves 10 stars at least. I just re-read it and, even now 30 years after I first read it, it still stands head and shoulders above any other work of fiction I've ever read.There is good reason why GWTW remains so enduringly popular. First of all is Margaret Mitchell's wonderful verbosity; this allows her to describe the physical setting in lush detail and to create characters of enduring interest and complexity. When it comes to characterization, no author I've ever read can even touch Margaret Mitchell's skill.But what also makes GWTW so enduring popular is its readability. Except for Scarlett's occasional \\"Fiddle-dee-dee\\" and \\"God's nightgown!\\" and the almost unintelligible dialogue of the blacks, Gone With the Wind reads like something written by a modern day author. The language is simple and direct and forthright, never complex or flowery. This gives the book a timelessness and makes it, even at 900+ pages, an amazingly fast read.Although reading GWTW this time as a middle-aged adult I found it far more tragic and sad and far less romantic, what I appreciated more about it was the background story and the way the author worked it seamlessly into her narrative. She vividly describes the effects of the war and Reconstruction on Southern society in a way that is evocative without ever sounding bitter or angry.If you've never read GWTW then you owe it to yourself to do so immediately if not sooner! Trust me, you'll never be sorry that you did. The characters of Rhett, Scarlett, Ashley and Melanie will become like real people who will live on in your mind forever."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"In time for the Diamond Anniversary of the publication of this formidable American classic, as well as the 150th anniversary of the Civil War that it depicts, I present my editorial musings about Margaret Mitchell's iconic literary piece.As an African American, it was a touchy and sometimes uncomfortable read for me. But as a child of Barbadians, my ancestors had been free for roughly 30 years by the time the story begins, and as subjects of the British Crown, had the option of attending British Universities, whereas America was on the verge of its most catastrophic war, in which slavery was a major issue, and Jim Crow laws would succeed slavery, I can and did read this novel with a little more detachment than most African Americans could.It took me 17 days to complete it, my eyes flowing faciley over the pages of the Avon Book rendition.Margaret Mitchell introduces her heroine, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, a willful green-eyed beauty of Franco-Irish descent, on an April day in 1861, where the 16-year-old is entertaining two suitors, the Tarleton Twins, on the front porch of her family's Georgia plantation, Tara.The lanky handsome red-haired Tarleton Twins, Stuart, and Brent, had been expelled from college,but were planning to join the Confederate Army, and they begin to aggravate their coquettish young hostess with their frequent talk of war. Scarlett threatens to go inside and lock herself away if they fail to change the topic of conversation, and is obliged. In due time, of course, the young Southern Belle would have to shed her preconceived notions about war as a gender-segregated issue, and accept it as everyone's business, regardless of gender.In the meantime, the topic turns to the upcoming barbecue at the neighboring Wilkes plantation, Twelve Oaks, where the handsome, blond Ashley Wilkes, whom Scarlet desires above all others, resides with his widowered father, John, and sisters, India and Honey. She learns Ashley will marry his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, who is sweet, delicate, and of a milder mold than she, who despises her.Literally turning into something of a green-eyed monster, Scarlett schemes to steal Ashley from Melanie--a central plot in the story.Her firey Irish father, Gerald, discourages her pursuit of Ashley, knowing such a union would be an unhappy one. Like most of the men closest to Scarlett, he had her best interest at heart.Her mother, Ellen Robillard O'Hara, from a notable French family from Savannah, tends to the plantation, nursing the sick, settling the accounts of the estate, and spending ample time delivering and baptizing the out-of-wedlock children of the impoverished Emmie Slattery, who are fathered by the O'Hara's Yankee overseer, Jonas Wikerson.Although better educated that the lowly Slatteries, his profession bars him from association with Georgia's upper echelon. So he turns to the lowly Slattereys for companionship.Ellen asks her husband to fire Wilkerson for his immorality, but Gerald refuses.Ellen appears too busy to really notice her oldest daughter's intrigues.The evening ritual of family prayers provides some temporary solace for Scarlett, who has quarreled with younger sisters Careen (baptized Caroline Irene) and Sue Ellen(baptized Susan Elinor). Servants Mammy, Pork, Dilcey, and Prissy stand guard as Ellen leads the family in Roman Catholic breviaries.Mammy knows Scarlett best, and calls her out as her charges prepares to attend the barbecue, but Scarlett has ways of manipulating Mammy to get her way.At the barbecue, Scarlett shines. In due time, it is revealed that all the men who will play a pivotal role in her life are there. She gathers her suitors under a tree, flushed and flirtatious.In the meantime, a mysterious man from Charleston with a murky reputation has his eye on the raven-haired beauty. As Scarlett is winning men's hearts, this man, Rhett Butler, earns the ire of the same men by giving them a realistic account of their chances of defeating the Yankees, as he has visited Northern factories, and areas of that region many of John Wilkes' guests had not.Gradually, it will be seen that Rhett Butler is right, and most of the men quarreling with him are dead.Slipping away from the rooms where the young ladies are napping, Scarlett confronts Ashley in the library to reveal her feelings, and is gently rebuffed. In a tearful rage, she slaps the man she claims to love and throws a china bowl decorated with roses, smashing it, and startling Rhett, who had been sleeping on the couch, initially out of her sight. Her response to his remarks about her behavior reveal her to be unsure of her own mind where Ashley is concerned.Amid Scarlett's dealing with the hurtful sniping of other young ladies, the word gets out that recruits are called for and all eligible men, including Ashley, rush off to enlist.A moment of desperate jealousy towards Ashley and Melanie leads Scarlett into an ill-conceived union with Melanie's brother, Charles--the day before Ashley and Melanie's marriage--. Charles dies of illness while at war, leaving Scarlett widowed and pregnant with their son, Wade, with whom, like many parents in wartime, Scarlett will have difficulty bonding.During a visit with her Aunt Pittypat, the widow scandalizes Atlanta by dancing with blockade runner Rhett at a ball benefitting the troops, while clad in widow's weeds.The story follows the young beauty through nursing soldiers with Dr. Meade and a pregnant Melanie, her frustration with Prissy during Melanie's labor(Prissy's simplemindedness was most likely a ruse as it was for most slaves), and her perilous flight back to Tara from Atlanta despite bad weather and battles, during which Rhett journeys with her only part of the way before rushing off to enlist.With Melanie, Wade, Prissy and newborn Beau in tow, she returns to find Tara still standing, unlike Twelve Oaks, although blighted by soldier's lootings, Mammy, Pork, and Dilcey about the only remaining servants, her sisters ailing, her father non compos mentos, and her mother dead of typhoid fever contracted from nursing Emmie Slattery.Finding only rotten produce to eat, she vows to rebuild her life by any means necessary, and as the saying goes, \\"There is nothing angrier than an educated Southern lady.\\"Using all her cunning, education,and inner strength unleashed by harsh circumstances, she acheives her goal at the expense of many friendships, marrying twice more, bearing daughters Ella(by Frank Kennedy, the \\"old maid in britches\\" she steals from sister, Sue Ellen when she realizes his business can help pay the taxes on Tara) and Bonnie(by Rhett) along the way--the last of whose strong will matches her mother's, leading to grave consequences.In a very poignant ending, Scarlett does come to appreciate how much Melanie really means to her, seeing how her kindness and fortitude complemented and buttressed her own grit and determination, and she finally sees Ashley as a hopeless and perpetual dreamer in view of her own willingness to face and deal with life's realities head-on.Intriguing characters include the amputee soldier, Will Benteen,and the crude Hillbilly, Archie, whose history proves the practice of Honor Death was not confined to Mid-Eastern culture. Both show how the war brought disparate social groups together, as does Madame Belle Watling.The political incorrectness, mysogyny, and racism may ruffle a few feathers. But it is appreciated that these people were products of their time, although impressively, Scarlett's mother forbade her to use the \\"N\\" word.Still, this story is an American epic that reflects the resilience of a human spirit that never conceded defeat.I recall that during a televised airing of the film version of this epic in the early 1980s, the announcer referred to Scarlett as \\"The Jewel of Tara\\", and indeed, in facing life's great calamities, she does prove to be \\"Diamond hard\\"."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"\\"Burdens are for shoulders strong enough to carry them\\"Tara Plantation, near Jonesborough, near Atlanta, GeorgiaKatie \\"Scarlett\\" O'Hara is the most charming Southern belle, gathering the attention of beaux all over the surrounding areas. But when she learns the man she had been psuedo-courting, Ashley Wilkes, is marrying Melanie Hamilton from Atlanta, his cousin, she schemes to win him back. When he refuses, she immediately marries Charles Hamilton in spite. But Civil War has come to the South, and Scarlett quickly finds herself a widow, stuck in Atlanta, with a child, unable to be the pretty belle she had been a few months prior. Will Scarlett ever get Ashley? What about the strange Rhett Butler character, who is constantly tweaking her? Will Scarlett and her family survive the war?Let me preface my review with this: I don't read a lot of historical fiction or chick lit or romance or anything. My speciality is science fiction, fantasy, and urban fantasy. However, this book absolutely, positively blew me away!At first, I found the novel a bit slow. There were so many characters, and at first, it seemed like nothing happened. But that wasn't to last. Quickly, I became interested in Scarlett's schemes to snatch Ashley away from Melanie, all the while hating her for her bad behavior. By the end of the book, there were points were I was in near tears.Scarlett wasn't my favorite character. She was a rude, bitter, selfish woman. But I completely understood her predicament. To the reader, she was completely honest, despising her first husband's death (and life!), her dislike of children (don't see that much in romance do we!), her dislike of women's poor station (always having to act \\"silly\\" in front of the menfolk), and taking the reigns of business to make a life of her own. So while I didn't like her, I also didn't hate her. I understood what she was trying to do and found myself rooting for her against the odds. She is a brilliantly written character, so dynamic, multifaceted and full.Melanie Hamilton was probably my favorite character. This might seem odd as she does come off as a Mary Sue--perfect and sweet to everyone, always right, yada, yada--and I hate Mary Sues. But I really never found Melanie a Mary Sue. Scarlett repeatedly downplays Melanie's beauty. Melanie is strong-willed and works diligently, but tires easily (such as when she works at Tara in the cotton fields). Like Scarlett, Melanie was definitely not a 1-D character. She appeared weak on the outside, while maintaining strenght in the face of danger, in the face of childbirth, in the face of hard times. She was a true inspiration to me.Rhett Butler made me so furious, sometimes I wanted to slap him like Scarlett! But other times, he was so charming and debonair, that I wanted to melt in his arms like butter. I loved how forthright he was, how practical and realistic he was, and yet how at times, his passionate nature came through (joining the Confederate army at the end, for example).Side characters, such as Miss Pittypat, Mammy, Dilcey, Pork, Uncle Peter, Mrs. Meade, Belle Watling, and more, jumped out at me. They felt like real people, people influenced by dreams, desires, and feelings. Probably one of the sweetest moments was when Dr. and Mrs. Meade were talking and she mentioned she would rather him be at Belle's than dead. Given what Mrs. Meade had been through, what she held dear, it was particularly poignant.I could go on endlessly about the amazing life lessons and themes and symbols in the book. Quotes about the status of women at the time, about changing with the changing times, about strength of character, about being who you are, and about what is really important in life abound in this book. Most of the ones that really touched me may be found on my profile page, though the whole book is brimming with it.As this deals with the South during the Civil War, there is much talk of slavery; one of the reasons, I believe, it has been so frequently placed on the Banned Books list. Some people believe that it shows slavery in a favorable light, that blacks were/are children that need to be tended by whites. My opinion is this: it shows how many white Southern plantation owners viewed slaves. Not all slave owners were Mr. Simon Legree of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Conversely, not all slave owners are like the O'Hara's. Yes, there are a lot of black stereotypes (Mammy, Prissy, etc.), but this is a snapshot into the past. You can't take this book and try to force modern views of civil rights and racism into it. However, I do believe it makes a brilliant discussion piece: comparing Scarlett and other Southern whites' views of blacks with other accounts (such as Uncle Tom's Cabin or the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn).All in all, this is a brilliant book, made more excellent by the narrator, who deftly interprets the Southern dialect and accents for the listener. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was heart-broken, but inspired, when it ended. I highly recommend, even to those, like me, who aren't big into historical fiction.Brought to you by:*C.S.

I ended up reading all night and was wiped the next day in school. It's impossible to put down.Now 25 years and many thousands of books later it is still my favorite book. I get so mad at Scarlett, we should all be so lucky to find a Rhett and she doesn't appreciate him! Still makes me cry."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I think &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; was a great book. I liked the book better than the movie. The book went into more detail than the movie. I wish Scarlett would have waited for Rhett when he was in jail though. I wish Scarlett would have just admitted to Rhett that she loved him sooner. I think Ashley was kind of a wimp, and I did not understand why Scarlett had wanted Ashley when she had a man like Rhett who wanted her. I was glad when she tried to get him back at the end and I can't wait to get the sequel."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I'm 16, just finnished it, the only regret I have is not reading it sooner. Mitchell did a beautiful job. I became so swept up into the story I couldn't put it down for a second. It's almost like be there, back in the 1800's, during the civil war. You feel the characters, there joy, there pain. The movie wasn't that great! I look forward to reading the sequal.

Margret Mitchell is an amazing author even by picking up the dilect of Mammy and the slaves. Even though I'm not American and don't study their history I understood and learned a lot from this book. This book is comedic, dramatic, exciting and filled with romance. The friends/foes/lovers relationship between Rhett and Scarlett is unforgettable. I found this to be a truly inspirational book, how to treat people properly and how to be a true friend and lover. This book is amazing , I couldn't put it down and I finished it in only 3 days. I am also starting to read the sequel &quot;Scarlett&quot; by Alexandra Riply. I give this book 5 stars! *****Jenn"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I have reread this book four times in the last year, and everytime I read it, I catch more than the previous time. The love story told compares to that of Romeo and Juliet. The sequencing of events could not be better; it grips you until the last page, and leaves you wondering how Scarlett deals with her personal losses. The intermixing of historical fact and fictional characters is phenomenal. Never again will a novel soar as high as this; it is as popular as the Bible."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I think that it is the best story I have ever read!!

I fell in love with it instantly, and have never read a better book since. This book has affected how I think and act. You can't help but admire Scarlett and all she stands for. At times all she had was her determination to survive and her pride. Once in school we had to do a report on the person we most admire. I had to convince the teacher to let me do it on Scarlett. Whenever I come to a hard time in my life, I try to be strong and I compare strong to Scarlett. This book tells not only how the South was affected but how the lives of the woman left behind were affected by the Civil War. The book is so vivid that you feel that you are with Scarlett, Rhett, and all the other unforgettable characters. I hope that I meet a man like Rhett. He loved Scarlett for years, knowing the worst of her but still loving her despite her faults. The book is the epitome of the Old South; with all the grace, beauty, and pride to go along with it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I loved this book!

To me it is an inspiration; its plot is magnificent, its characters well developed and true. It is a book that truly embodies the dream of writing the &quot;Great American Novel&quot;"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Let me make a simple statement: This novel is a perfect interpretation of the Antebellum bourgeousie South. Margaret Mitchell was born in the early 1900s and therefore the stories she heard, the ones that inspired this novel, were admittedly a bit skewed.HOWEVER, there is a lot of truth to Gone with the Wind, whether people like it or not, and beyond that, this novel is probably the perfect love story because it is so heartbreaking and so imperfectly human. Whether or not you agree with the portrayal of slavery, the Civil War, the Reconstruction, etc. that this novel presents, it is unfair to dismiss the greatness of Gone with the Wind. You can read all the Twain, Faulkner, Fitzgerald that you like, but until you have read this book, you do not have the full picture of American literature."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Epic. Heart-rendering. Encouraging. I don't know where to start.If you have not read this book, I highly recommend it. If you have already read it, treat yourself to another read.\\"Gone with the Wind\\" is a book that I have read annually from the time I was a teenager. The characters keep calling me back. The story reaches out and grabs me. So, I go back every year for a visit with the characters who seem so real and present to me.What speaks to me the most is Scarlett, herself. Despite hardship, she provides for the people around her. She is determined. Scarlett is taught from childhood that who she is fundamentally is wrong and she should try to be someone else...and she does try for a while. (Does this seems familiar to any of us ladies today?) Only Rhett sees her for her true self and appreciates it. Despite being a renegade, he keeps his word, loves Scarlett and Bonnie (their daughter) honestly and deeply, while carelessly providing luxuries and lavishing them with attention. A real man!!!!! Mitchell's characters are complex, true, and touching.Also, Mitchell brings the battles of the American Civil War to life. The battles are explained in a style that is compelling and breath-taking.Scarlett and Rhett are people who are real and live life with passion and strength. If you want to meet Scarlett or flirt with Rhett, all you have to do is open the book and read as the past come to life.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone with the Wind is one of the best books ever written, maybe the best.I can not even express how much I love this book.Many people disregard Gone With the Wind as a just a lenthy romance, but this is NOT what it is. Gone with the wind is SO much more than a romance. It is, for one, a book about the Civil War from the Southern people's perspective. This book gives the reader a brand new perspective on the Civil War and it is refreshingly NOT like all the other mundane Civil War books. It is full of history, but there is never a boring moment: Margret Mitchell is a brilliant writer whose beautiful and exciting descriptions, livily dialoge and none-stop story keep the book engrossing and never boring. I couldn't put it down!Again, Gone with the WInd is not just a romance, as I said, it is a refreshing Civil War book; but it is not only that. Gone with the wind has many suspensful, dangerous, and sometimes violent moments, such as The Burning of Atlanta or the event when Scarlett shoots a Yankee invader.The characters of GWTW are immortal. Each character is so beloved to so many readers, and there is a good reason why. Every character has his own fascinating personality. Every type of person, from selfish to greedy to tragic to stupid to controlling to timid to utterly kind is expressed in the book's countless engrossing characters.The story line is also wonderful. It is very complex but never confusing; it has such a good main plot and so many intriuging sub-plots.For the reasons I have attempted to state above and for so many more, Gone with the Wind is a beloved American Classic that has endured and will endure for many years to come.Whether are a man or woman, girl or boy, old or young, READ THIS BOOK!You will not regret it.And it just may be, that after you have entered the world of Gone with the Wind, you will find in it a new favorite that is worth reading over and over again."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Margaret Mitchell was a genius.

If you want a great romance you won't be disappointed.However, the story behind the romance is what really made this book wonderful for me. It questioned what happens to people when society changes.

Happy Reading!!!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is one of my favorite books. Don't get me wrong, it has its faults - sometimes too-slow pacing, and deeply embedded racism to name a few. But we don't love things because they are perfect, or because of their morality. We love them because they touch us.As this book touched me.How can I explain the affecting emotion aroused in me by stubborn, foolish, sensible fiery Scarlett? Or the adoration of tough, roguish Rhett? Or the kinship I felt with the both of them? By that last, perhaps.This book is a historical romance, member of a genre known for its cliches. But it is no Harlequin. I have read enough of that genre, and am not a fan. This book is part of a genre known for crappiness, yet the romance between Rhett and Scarlett is real, not contrived, and feels real. Mitchell has accomplished what many have tried and failed to do, here: to write a strong romance novel that even readers of the non-sappy sort can enjoy.And the racism, that, too, has a purpose, though I doubt Mitchell intended it insomuch as it just was, because she herself was racist. A lot of historical novels (bad ones, at least) take characters from certain places and times, and make them into MODERN people, with MODERN values, misunderstood and inexplicably ahead of the times. Scarlett is a southern belle in the civil war south. This is the setting of the novel. Does she 'break the rules' at times? Yes. But she does not do it on every single count, and any messages thus conveyed are not overtly preachy. Mitchell has created something that is simultaneously believable, and yet transcendent, sometimes heroic, and larger-than life."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I am only 11 years old. Still, no one stopped me from reading the classic, Gone With the Wind. I encourage myself. When I started reading the book, I got so caught into Scarlett, Ashley WIlkes, Melanie, and Rhett Butler, that I felt as if I were living with them as well! When I got to the end of the book, I felt as if Margaret Mitchell had left out something very valuable, like she hadn't really meant to publish the un-finished book! I am getting very crazy about Gone With the Wind, and it's truly the first book that I can ever say sincerely that was my \\"Favorite book\\" ever! For anyone who thinks Gone With the Wind's words are too small, or that the book is too \\"mushy and gushy for us,\\" it's not! It's a nice, sad romance novel that I shall remember forever.

I am currently asking for the book, in hardcover original edition, for my birthday."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK!! Rhett Butler is one of the best characters when it comes to writing and so is Melanie, and Scarlett. Mitchell outdid herself in this classic novel. I love the movie too, but the book is much better with so much more detail. Yes, Scarlett is a little whiny and selfish and takes Rhett for granted, but I love her anyway! Ashley is a huge git, but you have to like a lot of the other characters inculding Aunt Pitty-pat and Melanie. This book is 5 Stars and nothing can change that. I hope Mitchell is smiling down from heaven when she sees us reading her book-because it is a true gem."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"What can you say about this novel? The prose evokes comparison to Edith Wharton's. The characters live and breathe before you on the page. The setting is set in intimate detail, and it swirls in your mind's eye as you drink in the words. Amazing novel. Scarlett seems much stronger in literature than her flighty character in the film. Once I could escape my preconceived notion of the characters taken from the film, the book became pure joy to read."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With The Wind is a great book,about a young girl, Scarlett, who is a terrible flirt. I read it this summer and I'm only nine, the context wasn't too challenging. M.M. wove the story plot extremely well,it kept me in suspense until the very end, and I want to read the sequal. All in all , if I could, I would give this book infinity stars."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is a classic historical fiction novel with vivid descriptions of the Old South and the Civil War. It is from the Confederate's point of view, and the protagonist is Scarlett O'Hara, a headstron, stubborn, and spoiled Southern Belle with deep strength and passion. If Scarlett needs something bad enough, she will not hesitate to throw away proper social conduct or her own personal goals. This strength comes not from within her, but from using the misfortunes of others to her advantage. She is like a child in the sense that she orders people around and always gets her way. The problem in the long run is that this strenth all too often blinds her to the good things and the love that reaches out to her, but she pushes them away, so set in her own ways that she wont even consider other possibilities. Tara is Scarlett's one true love, and she would do anything for it. Scarlett survives the hardships of war as her would falls down around her with only her wit and determination left. She cannot ignore life, nor can she put on a polite mask and act as though there had never been a war. She uses the struggle to rebuild Atlanta to make her start in business. Although Scarlett is a strong and independent woman, most people can relate to her because she makes mistakes like a normal human. This book examines different types of strength. Whether it is Mammy's honorable courage and dignity, or Rhett's keen level-headedness, or Melanie's Christian devotion to people, each person has his or her own root from which they draw their strength. The writing is superb, and the plot is dramatic and sad, but it includes enough of Scarlett's triumphs of strength that sets it apart from all other books. This is a must-read for any person who loves classic literature."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book touched the hearts of millions, and truly makes us realize the appreciation of life.

I won't repeat the many positive reviews here. Just let me add one note: the book has an extraordinary amount of cynicism in it which is startling at first but makes perfect sense as this novel is about the destruction of all that is good by men-on a large scale, the south's destruction, on a smaller scale, the destruction of Rhett's love by the vices and selfishness of Scarlett."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I have read Gone With the Wind 16 times(I'm eleven yrs. old)and it still ties for my favorite book(with The Mists of Avalon) I know all anyone would ever want to know about the movie(and a lot more besides)and plenty about the book.

Once you pick it up, you can't put it down until it's finished. I felt that it was similar to &quot;North and South&quot; in content, but that the emphasis on the characters was more personal. Also, it has a little of everything--history (without being dull), romance (without being overdone), and personal triumph."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I began this novel in the 11th grade prepared to hate it to the core. Everything I knew about it made me expect a silly, eye-batting trip into a fairy tale world of the Old South with its impossibly virtuous ladies, its foppish gentleman and grinning content slaves, and I was actually looking forward to making fun of the characters, story and author.I could NOT have been more wrong about this novel. Margaret Mitchell, I salute you!This is to American letters what Les Miserables is to France, or War And Peace is to Russia. Nowhere else are characters like these to be found or is the human spirit portrayed as so unconquerable. I fell in love with this book. From its would-be detractor I became its most vocal champion. I was stunned over and over at how inutterably magnificent this contribution to literary greatness was. As one reads along about the lives of these larger than life men and women all set against the backdrop of the fall of an entire civilization, any sensitive person can only be compelled to acknowledge that there on the open page is a book that shall live in literary eternity.Of any work of fiction a person might feel compelled by \\"duty\\" to read at some point in a lifetime, Gone With The Wind deserves to be at the head of that list."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is a wonderful leatherette version, with a self ribbon place marker and a lovely gold dark gold and blue cover and heavy fine paper, with plenty of cloth fiber used in the making of the paper.

It is the story of the South right before the Civil War, during the war, and the aftermath when Reconstruction began in the South. It is filled with drama, romance, tragedy, real characters with flaws, and I can see why this book won a Pulitzer Prize and why it continues to be a very popular book decades after it was first published in 1936.I don't need to go into a synopsis of the book, if anyone hasn't heard of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, I'd be very surprised. If you have only seen the wonderful movie adaptation of the book, but have never read the book, I highly recommend you read the book. The movie doesn't capture the essence of the characters, the entirety of their personalities and motives behind certain actions and behaviors.I was captivated from the very first page. I can't describe exactly how or why, but Mitchell wrote in such a way that pulls you into the story. Her writing is simple and straightforward, and it touches you in a way that helps you relate to the characters and the world she wrote about. Her writing resonates with you, and keeps you reading. Her writing of the scenery and backdrop of the South, her depictions of the various characters, their motives, their thoughts, their innermost secrets that make them who they are. Mitchell brought this time period to life and causes you, the reader, to empathize with the characters and the struggles and upheaval they go through.Even though I know this story, how it unfolds and how it concludes, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough until I reached the very end. Scarlett O'Hara isn't the most sympathetic character you'll encounter, but as I gradually read her story, I found myself liking this character and rooting for her happily ever after, although you know she doesn't get that HEA in the end. I actually found the ending appropriate, it fits in with Scarlett's personality of a person who won't quit no matter what. She has seen the worst in life, and she remains stubborn in defeat that she can win back Rhett's love.Scarlett was a very selfish, manipulative, and cruel young woman, the only person she cared about was herself (with the exception of her mother, Ellen O'Hara, who she revered and respected and was the only woman she trusted). She was a simple person, not easily able to understand more serious and complex issues, which she usually shrugged off in a careless fashion as insignificant and unworthy of her time. She presented a facade of a lady of gentility to the world, all the while seething secretly inside at what she perceived as injustices against her or the unfairness of life if she didn't get her way. She was also willfully stubborn in her unrequited love for childhood friend, Ashley Wilkes, and it was quite sad to see her pine for a man who rejected her even though he did love her but was too cowardly to do anything about it.Despite her numerous character flaws, Scarlett had some admirable traits, such as her perseverance and flinty determination to survive. There were so many times where she was numb with weariness and feeling desolate at the heavy burden on her shoulders, but she would always put off her morose thoughts and say, \\"I will think about it later\\", and mentally force herself to take it one step at a time in order to stay sane and calm in a chaotic world. This was in contrast to her weak sisters who couldn't seem to comprehend that their old lifestyle had vanished forever and that a change was needed within themselves in order to survive. Scarlett, with her unladylike blunt honesty and very practical nature realizes this almost immediately. She was so unlike her tender and kind mother, Ellen, in almost every way except in one. Like her mother before her, she became the mistress of Tara, and in her newfound role she fills her mother's shoes in becoming what her family needed. Someone to look up to and lean upon for aid when needed.I found Scarlett a contradiction of sorts. She would look upon in contempt or disgust at those who depended on her, yet she would cast such thoughts aside in order to fulfill her duty to them as she couldn't abandon them. For her family because they *were* family and an O'Hara always helped family, and for Melanie, Ashley's wife, because of a promise. On the one hand she was a strong woman, strong in that she was able to survive the devastation of the South and show a courage of spirit in facing adversity and impossibility, but on the other hand, she was weak too. Weak in continuing in her girlhood, idealistic, puppy love for Ashley that blinded her to real, true lasting love with Rhett Butler who was her true soul mate. In some ways she was finally a woman, having the burden of responsibility of her family forcing her to mature, but in other ways, in her relationship with men, she was still a child. Of course, in the latter category she realizes too late what she knew instinctively all along, that Rhett Butler was the man for her and she had just been too immature, stubborn, and childish to see it clearly.Rhett Butler was the perfect match for fiery Scarlett. He was exactly like her, unscrupulous and looking to number one first (although, he did have his gentlemanly and kind moments beneath the veneer of mockery and sardonic amusement). Unlike Scarlett, he didn't pretend to be what he was not. He was no refined Southern gentleman and he took perverse pleasure in flaunting this in subtle ways. He is basically Scarlett in masculine form, only more intelligent.Some of my favorite moments of the book were the scenes with Rhett and Scarlett sparring with the other. It was amusing to see Rhett get the upper-hand over Scarlett every time. His witty quips most times went completely over her head, as she wasn't as clever as he, but that made it all the more amusing to see Scarlett finally meet her match in Rhett. I laughed aloud several times as I read Scarlett getting frustrated and upset stating he was no gentleman, only to see him laugh at her and agree with her he wasn't. Other scenes I enjoyed reading was the scenes back at Tara after she fled Atlanta, where you are witness to the transformation of Scarlett the Southern belle to Scarlett the survivor as she toiled in the cotton fields in Tara and tried to put food on the table for her family.I thought it was quite saddening to read about the delusions people in the South had regarding the war. The characters in Atlanta, such as Mrs. Merriweather or Dr. Meade, with their desperate, futile hope, and optimism that the South would prevail was sad to read about. Defiant to the end, in their naive and stubborn pride they thought the South and \\"the Cause\\" they fought for would triumph no matter the cost. It was this hope they clung to even as Atlanta was under siege by the Union army. None would know (or wanted to admit to knowing), except those perceptive enough to see the truth, such as Rhett Butler or Ashley Wilkes, that the way of life the South enjoyed up to the war was dead and gone. An old world that wouldn't come back, even if they had won, as it was forever changed, and like the title of the book gone with the wind. This book was poignantly sorrowful in that regard, you get a brief glimpse into the South portrayed pre-war and then post-war, and you realize it was never to be the same again.Although this story is told from the perspective of a Southern woman and her story of surviving the war, I think one could say her personal story reflects on a larger scale the entire South's struggles to survive in a new and changed world. The scenes of the ruined and abandoned plantations, with their eerie tomb stillness, was described in very convincing detail, and I found myself with Scarlett mourning the lost world she loved and grew up in.I could keep on writing about the various aspects of this story that were enjoyable and what I thought, but this review would get very lengthy if I did! Let me say this: the book was wonderful. Just read it! You won't regret it, yes, it is quite a hefty book but this story is so engrossing, compelling, and captivating you won't even notice how long the book is."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. Maay critics of today have harsh criticism for this book, but a book is not always ment to meet current day social standards, it is supposed to take you away and entertain you.

If you are looking for an enchanting story if survival, adventure, romance, and whimsy, than do not hesitate to buy this book."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"What can I add that has not already been said about this novel? It truly is one of the best novels ever written. I read over 75 books every year, many of them historical novels. I don't know why I waited so long to read this one, but I'm glad I finally did. And no, I haven't seen the movie. The characters were multi-dimensional and despite their often-displayed negative qualities, we keep hoping for them. They are more real and probably like ourselves than most of us would care to admit. Perhaps that is the real beauty of the story. We can see how selfish actions can lead to consequences without having to live through the pain ourselves. The style is easy to read and enjoyable to follow. And the backdrop of the Civil War and the early reconstruction period (from the South's point of view) is among the best I've ever run across. Despite its length, the book keeps you enthralled, every step of the way. This is one of those classics that you simply must read, not because you should, but because you will be so glad you did."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"When my mom brought this home, at first I thought I wouldn't understand it.

I am only eleven years old but I still hold Gone With the Wind a treasure to my heart. My favorite character was Melanie. I became Melanie for the couple of weeks that I read this book.

A must read, though whether or not you like it is up to you. I've loved this book since I was fourteen, and I think it is one of the best novels to ever come out of America.It drives me crazy when people say this book is racist. Really? A book written by a southerner, closely related to former slave owners? Racist? NO! The book is written about a south that the people of the south say and believed in, and the characters are all people who fit into this setting. This wasn't a story about enlightenment and aboltionism. It was a story about a woman in the south and the Civil War and reconstruction through her eyes. Not your eyes. Not the eyes of the northern aboltionists. Not the eyes of a slave. It was shown through the eyes of half the population of the US at the time, and that people try to nullify these views is wrong. This is the way people thought and felt, and villifying all slave owners (many of whom grew up in that society and didn't know much better) is no better than making all negroes stupid. In the end, it's a work of fiction. A book. Reading and enjoying it doesn't make someone a racist, and I would hope that people would please stop saying that. Don't like the book? Don't read it. I, for one, would say that books like \\"The Wind Done Gone\\" is no less racist, though there will be hell to pay if someone actually says it out loud."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"The summer I was 15, between Junior High and High School, my mother recommended that I read this book. Of course I wasn't going to listen to HER...so I pouted around for a few days, and then one evening, afraid I was going to succumb to utter boredom, I picked it up.For the next week, I did nothing but read Gone with the Wind. I read it every waking moment, far into the night, first thing in the morning. I remember having a perpetual headache from eyestrain. I simply could not stop until the last page, when I burst into tears, and sobbed for what seemed like hours.The book has much the same effect on me now. Every few years, I read it cover to cover, even though I can quote key passages by heart by this time. So let me tell you a little bit about Gone with the Wind, the first thing being that it is not what you think it is. It's hard to compete with David O'Selznick here, even though he's dead, but I beg you to put the movie aside, and prepare yourself for sheer, satisfying, bosom-heaving pleasure. This was a thoroughly amazing book in the thirties, and it wears well. It is much more than the story of spoiled, willful Scarlet O'Hara and her deadly flirtations. Scarlet may have been the first feminist. Women in her day had no power whatsoever. Their entire lives were decided by convention: whom they should marry, what they should eat, where they should live, what they should wear. But Scarlet would have none of it. And the only way she could break free of convention was to use her wiles to flaunt it. She did--and it worked. She was and is my hero, selfish and vain as she was.On quite another level, this is the heartbreaking story of the War Between the States from the Southern point of view. As a teen who was raised in California, I had no clue about how the South felt about the War, and no way to find out. This book, silly as some may find it, taught me that there are two sides to any conflict, two equally powerful and opposing points of view that are tragically at odds. Sound familiar? Not much different than the Middle East today.Now a word about the book's purported racism. Yes, there are slaves in this book, and I am not going to presume to tell you not to resent or be angry about that fact. But considering the time in which she lived, I think that Margaret Mitchell tried to deal with the issue of slavery as best she could. The slaves in the book are not the simpering fools of the movie. They are portrayed with as much dignity as I think Mitchell could manage when considering that there was no way she could condone OR ignore that slavery was a fact during the Civil War. Mammy is not a caricature in the book, Prissy is a much more sympathetic young woman, and the other slaves are portrayed as thinking, feeling, human beings.The Emancipation is not regretted, and is seen from the freed slaves' point of view as much as possible. That having been said, I am not advocating this book as something it is not. It is not an abolitionist work, and it is not anti-slavery per se. It is not anything more than phenomenally well-written story with a lot of truly interesting historical information about the 1860s and beyond.Gone with the Wind is the story of a lifetime, not the caliber of War and Peace, but for its time, incredibly good reading. Summer is almost upon us. This is a perfect time to sit under a magnolia tree with a mint julep and treat yourself to an old-fashioned story you'll never forget."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"When I was in middle school I shared my locker with my best friend. Her favorite movie and book were Gone With the Wind, we had posters in the locker and she talked about it non-stop. I looked at it, saw how long it was and laughed at her for her obccession.Now as a senior in college I decided to pick it up and see what all the fuss was about. I don't have a lot of time to read during the semester, but I had this book finished in less then 3 weeks. I didn't want to put it down, and it ate at me during classes to not know what was going on in Atlanta in my absence.This is quite possibly the most amazing book I have ever read. Mitchell's writting style is amazingly easy to read dispite the era she was writing during, and her descriptions make the state of Georgia come alive for a girl who has never left New England.The character of Scarlett both infuriated me and drew commanalities to myself. While sometimes you want to scream at the book and make her realize her love for Rhett hundreds of pages before she does, I think theres a little of every women in her. Her hopes and fears are still very real so many years later.I am so happy to have read this book, and now its one I'll reread in a few years. I highly reccamend it and am completely in love with it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I personally very much enjoyed \\"Gone With the Wind\\". It was filled with romance as well as peril and unpredictability. I recomend this book for young adults and adults because it is not a kid theme."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I read this book once. Once was enough, but twice would be better. I'm an avid reader, and writer. This book captured every emotion that literary devices are suppose to capture. I found myself crying, laughing, scared, shocked. I've been searching for a book that competes with Gone With the Wind and haven't found one. You know the main characters like they are in your life, and you're taken back to the Civil War. Nothing is downcasted, everything is how it was in the eighteen sixies. Scarlett O'Hara was such a wonderful character, she lives in everyone hearts long after the last page is turned. Even though the book is lengthy, it keeps your attention, truely, until the last page and would keep it further if it were longer. The book was amazing, a true American Literature Classic. I highly recommend this book. You won't be able to find another like it. Gone With the Wind is a true, diamon in the rough."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"and hope she loves as much as I do.I have read this story several times- so many that I have it commited to memory!I always had a copy of it with me until my last one feel apart from reading it to many times.!Scarlett is a strong woman, and in that time that strength was frowned upon by both men and women.

I had to read this book for an English class. My mom suggested it to me and I decided to make her happy I would start it, but I knew I'd never finish it- I mean 1,000 pages???? But, the first time I picked it up I read until page 70 and I would have kept reading, but it was late! It made me laugh, cry, and everything in between. I love how the book ends how it ends.(I can't tell you how!)I did read the sequel, and I have to say, it was OK, but not nearly as well written as Gone With the Wind. I would recommend this book to anyone who is in need of a good novel. Don't let the 1,000 pages intimidate you because when you read it, you'll forget there are that many pages, honest!!!!!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Margaret Mitchell captures the essence of the Old South and skillfully interweaves that history with the travail of the civil war. She illustrates the high purposes for which the South fought the war and also demonstrates the utter futility of the Southern position and the senseless nature of most conflicts."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"IT IS ONE OF THE MOST UNFORGETTABLE STORY I HAVE EVER READ . IT IS ONE STORY THAT IS HARD TO RESIST AND STOP READING . WHO CAN EVER EVER FORGET THE FIERY CHARACTER OF SCARLETT O'HARA AND THE COOL , DASHING SOLDIER OF FORTUNE , RHETT BUTLER AND THEIR UNUSUAL DEVELOPMENT OF LOVE ?"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Before I picked up this book, I read most of the reviews, but I knew better than to let the opinions of others influence me tremendously. And so, I read through 1000 pages of war, Southern society/conventions in the antebellum and reconstruction South, and of course, the tempestuous romance between Scarlett and Rhett.I was expecting a romance, but I cannot classify GWTW as romance, but rather as historical fiction. Margaret Mitchell writes with a voice that captivates, evokes emotion, but most of all, she brings the Civil War and its aftermath to life especially through Scarlett O'Hara. The destitution, plights, burdens, and silly notions/convictions of Scarlett's reflect the people of the time; it gives readers a glimpse of failure, poverty, and the desperation war leaves in its trail. This is why I enjoyed this novel-the sentiments, struggles, and even the uncharitable thoughts going through Scarlett's head allowed me to feel empathy and to relate. The ignorance, grief, desperation, painful repercussions, and hope that circulate throughout novel are artfully portrayed.As to the romance, it wasn't what I was hoping for, but it was realistic. Honestly, I didn't like a single character in the novel because none of them knew the true meaning of love, and if they did, they didn't know how to express it. Scarlett is comparable to a spoiled, pampered child who lives eternally in her bubble even after all her hardships; she sees but does not grasp and doesn't have the will to do so. However, her strength and courage are to be commmended because despite her beliefs, she does not fail herself or others when it truly matters. Rhett is a complete idiot and their disastrous marriage is partly his fault because he never fought for his love...just like his blase skeptical outlook on people and life, he let it all slide by because what he hoped for didn't turn out to be reality. He used the wrong approach and so the ends did not meet as it should have, and how he hurt in the process. Mellanie was just too nice and naive to really be human; I find it almost unbelievable at times to see how much faith she had in everyone. Just as Scarlett's selfish, ill-conceived thoughts never ceased to amaze me, Mellanie's belief in man's better nature was as tedious. She is however the most likeable character. Ashley is weak, pitiful and as Scarlett realizes, the type of man girls dream about, but not worthy of their idolatry because the disillusionment is not worth it. Despite having a hard time liking any of the selfish or selfless and infinitely unworthy characters, I must admit that the characterization was dynamic. I really wanted to slap Scarlett, Mellanie, Rhett, and Ashley at some point or other. And at the same time, my heart went out to them because I could understand why they did the things they did.GWTW is an entertaining read, unique to its kind (just like The Fountainhead), but I didn't find it magnificent or glorious. The novel is as bitter as it is uplifting and I couldn't find a balance between the two. Just a lot of tolerance for silly, selfish, careless creatures and pity for those who reach the \\"aha\\" moment when it is too late. Because it's so well-written though, I know for sure that it is not a novel I am going to forget (which is often the case) and I am very glad I forced myself to read it. It was definitely an experience."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book was published in 1936; in the ensuing seventy years, no one has even come close to topping it. Enough said."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is definitely worth the read. Although long, Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell has a lot going on in it. Mitchell develops the characters so well that you can almost see them. It is also great for history. This is because I always learned about the civil war through the northerners eyes. In this book you see it all through the eyes of a southerner. As the story progresses you build up more and more grudges against Scarlet, who is not your best friend. Scarlet is rude and takes on too \\"manly\\" duties. Close to the end, though, she finally gets kicked back. When hard times hit she becomes more sweet, gentle and womanly. However, that does not last long enough. When her marital status changes she regains money and again, she gives up her sweetness and goes back to her old self. This book would be good for those who enjoy romantic, historical and classic novels about the civil war. Stick with it through the slow parts and you can easily enjoy the rest.

A woman who's strong, beautiful, and vain... and gets away with it. Rhett Butler is the epitimy of what a man should be. He's romantic and keeps you wondering what he's going to do next. All of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler's trials and happy moments are what makes Gone With the Wind the classic that it is.

I really cannot specifically pinpoint why &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is my favorite book.

Buy a different version!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"GWTW is a classic, undoubtedly - sweeping, romantic, colorful, well written, all of that. I have read it so many times and seen the movie enough to recite it word for word, loved swashbuckling Captain Butler and plucky, selfish Scarlett for all that she is, a woman of her own worth during times when women were showpieces more than anything else. And i absolutely love the descriptions of the civil war background - it is sweeping, historically accurate and touching, many times. I can slip the movie in at any scene or pick up the book and spend a few hours undisturbed just lost in its language and flow.All of that said, i think it is important not to forget that Mitchell has not mentioned one word against slavery in the 800+ pages she penned, slavery being the burning, heart rending issue of the time the novel was set. Every country and state goes through change, for good or bad and we lose times that were precious, sentimental, valuable - or we lose a 'land of grace and plenty' as she calls pre war Georgia. But we also gain causes that are worth it in terms of human reslience and courage and value/respect for others. Looking at it that way the novel comes across like a victorian painting - pretty and appealing but lacking in soul."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"People read the book and leave all the politics aside if you're going to read this book. Enjoy it and remember this book was written in the 1930's. Very different way of thinking back then. I have read some of the reviews and I just threw my hands in the air and decided to write my review. That is how mad I got. Why? Well, everytime someone decides to write a review about a book that took place during the civil war someone has to put in there two cents, about how horrible the whites treated the slaves or how horrible slavery was. Please. Okay, yes slavery did happen. And I don't conden it niether. But everyday one can not escape not listening to it about the subject on t.v.(especially the Oprah show, I really think that lady spends her life talking about the subject, bitter woman, or movies, or songs, ect. ect. ect. From all I have read and seen and learned does one really believe all the plantation owners beat there slaves and killed them? I mean would a plantation owner who paid top dollar for a slave just take him home and starve him, beat him, and have chained him and just treat him worse than a dog. I don't think so. It just not possible that all plantation owners did that. If that really was widespread as we are lead to believe then now, then there would have been an uprising of slaves sooner then Civil War. There would not have been any need for a Civil War if all the whites of the South then were the cruel vicious monster we have been lead to believe they were. As allways when we have a small majorit of people to tell us history (that is t.v., roots, and all them bad history channels, and magazines and supposely non-fiction books that are written with the liberal mentality), they just re-write history. If one really wants to find out the history of the south. READ OLD BOOKS ON HISTORY!!! NOT THE NEW ONES!!! OLD BOOKS!!! WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HISTORY IT HAS ALL BEEN RE-WRITTEN!!! Whew! I feel better now.Oh by the way. This is from a Hispanic telling you this.So if you really want to enjoy this book. Enjoy reading Scarlett scandals and her fight to never be hungry again. Enjoy her trying ever art she knows to take that poor excuse of a man Ashley away from the every loyal Melanie. Enjoy Scarlett when she tries to figure out Rhett and why she just cannot get it through her thick bull-headed head that she always has been in love him."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Like it or not-- and there are PLENTY of reasons not to like GWTW-- this book earns its status as a classic. It reminded me of Anna Karenina: well-written, brilliant &amp; deliciously soapy plot, and ultimately depressing. In the end, I was fed up with Rhett &amp; Scarlett, but I still cried for them.As a northerner living in the south, I got a new appreciation for/insight into the rich history of white southerners, but good luck finding any insight into the world of black southerners. True, Mitchell was a product of her times and one needs to allow for that, but she says some HORRIBLY insensitive things about black people.If you read this book, keep it in context. Remember that it is only one part of history, only one book, somewhere in the middle of truth and lies and legend.P.S.-- Zora Neale Hurston's &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; would be an interesting book to read afterwards, especially if you need to restore your faith in true love."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Haven't finished yet (300 pages left) but I'm loving this book... nothing horribly suspenseful happens yet I can't put it down. It's also easy to read- I never find myself thinking, &#34;Okay, let's get on with it&#34; as most people expect to do from books of this time period. It's very long (1037 pages) but don't let that deter you!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This could/should be the book required in high school on the American Civil War and Reconstruction. It's also a romantic novel from a female's perspective, which is an interesting twist on a genre that traditionally has male heroes."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"First, let me say that Gone With the Wind is possibly the best and most satisfyingly well-written novel I have ever read. To quote Alice Randall, the author of another favorite of mine, The Wind Done Gone, &quot;Above all, Gone With the Wind made me think.&quot;Anyone who gives this book less than three stars invariably does so because of the rampant racism throughout the novel. One cannot say in defense that it was simply the views of the people at the time, because Magaret Mitchell, the author, was not just being historically accurate; she was racist herself.The horror! A racist novel by a racist author! And what's worse, it's one of the best loved novels in America.Parts of this book did make me cringe and leave me angry, namely the roles of Prissy and Big Sam. Yes, those parts were atrocious. But here's a thought:Pretend for a minute that you were born in the early 1900's, in the deep South, with Confederate veterans and aging Southern belles for family. Now tell me you wouldn't be racist. Of course, any middle class enlightened white person would say they'd know better, but would you? I greatly doubt it. Gone With the Wind is fiction, not fact, from the mind of a woman who embodied what her family taught her, no more. Take it and move on. Sure, it's offensive, but it's also wonderful. There are too many layers to this novel for the complexity of it to be fully appreciated in my review, but if you're can't get past the racism to appreciate this book, then I have to wonder what else you're missing in life.What I did when I finished Gone With the Wind was go out and buy Alice Randall's book The Wind Done Gone. It's very thought provoking, and it will mollify a bit of your anger dealing with the bad treatment of blacks in this book. Also, I reccomend The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, because it deals with the internalized racism that slaves felt in the pre-war South. Beloved is another great one that will show you what the slaves REALLY went through. But don't miss out on Gone With the Wind. Read it, love it, and let it show you the past."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I haven't really heard anything about this book nor have I seen the movie, so I didn't know what to expect when I started reading. I suppose I could use my desire to to broaden my reading scope as a reason for picking up this novel. I haven't read enough of the classics, the heavy stuff, the stuff that should have a good reason for staying around this long.Anyway, this book was teeming with racist undertones, and it annoyed me, to say the least. I could never really get comfortable with the writing, however beautiful and applause-worthy it was, because in would come the worthless diatribes about the slaves and how dumb and shiftless and worthless they were. It's not that the book was written about times of slavery and the aftermath of the American Civil War; I understand that people in those times had their reasons and their own beliefs. (I read Queen by Alex Haley with no problem, although I will concede that Queen was written by descendant of slaves and the view would be slightly different.) But I wonder if the woman who wrote Gone With the Wind was racist--or at the very least more than mildly prejudiced--because she wrote unnecessary addendums when describing the 'darkies,' superfluous ramblings that seemed to be more her own thoughts than the thoughts of the book's characters. She wrote things like, [the slave girl] couldn't comprehend...in her little black skull, and the use of the 'n' word when something else would have sufficed. The way she described Big Sam's excitement in seeing his mistress again after the war almost made my blood run cold. I ran into a lot about how the 'good' slaves all hated the idea of being free and the 'no good free issue' slaves were the ones who, apparently, realized that they were getting a raw deal when it came to that 'peculiar institution.' Really, wanting to be equal to whites [in every way that counted] was such a preposterous idea! I get the feeling I'm overreacting, but that's what happens when you read material like that in times such as these.Another thing that bothered me about it is that this is supposed to be the greatest love story of all time and almost eight hundred pages into the thing, Rhett and Scarlett still weren't together. He loved her--he admitted this to her at least thrice--and she didn't realize that she even really liked him, let alone loved him, until she halfway got over her Ashley Wilkes obsession.My third problem with the book came in the form of one young Miss O'Hara. As much as I tried to remain sympathetic and understanding to Scarlett's plight and her reasonings, her behavior made it easy for me to remain unmoved while reading. While I applauded her moments of unselfishness (very few and far between), Katie Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler was a nuisance and she was one of the main reasons I walked away from this book without too much feeling. However, I did love the way Rhett was written, for reasons I cannot properly articulate because even I do not know why I liked him so much. I guess I believe he and Melanie Hamilton Wilkes were the only truly likeable people in this book.The language was beautiful, the scenes vivid, breathtaking and all of that which is desirable when talking books. Ms. Mitchell wrote a really good book but sadly, it's not for everyone to enjoy."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"A real classic that I read first in 1963, and have read many times since. Just buying a copy for Kindle."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Margaret Mitchell's Scarlett was a strong woman who could just as easily lived in the 1960s as she did the 1860s. What a strong, admirable role model she must have been for girls when this book first came out in the thirties. All those pages and yet, I couldn't put the thing down."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Mitchell combined love and war the way no other writer could have done it. The romance between Scarlett and Rhett left readers clinging to every word spoken between the two. In the midst of their world falling apart, Phett still had a passion for Scarlett, and Scarlett for Ashley. However, she never tells whether or not Scarlett ever gets Rhett in the end."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With the Wind is, obviously, my favorite book ever, but I truly believe it is one of the best ever written. I read this book when I was 12 years old, and I finished it in four days. I was so entirely engrossed in the setting, characters, and plot that I could honestly, literally just NOT put it down.Although the issue of which I am about to address did not bother or offend me in the least, however I am not racist or pro-slavery, I will talk about this in hope of enlightening a few more people and maybe helping to share the magic of GWTW. Sure, there are some things relating to racism, and of course to slavery, but I don't see why people are so offended by this. Yes, racism is wrong, and the way some slave owners treated their slaves, and how whites treated blacks, was absolutely horrifying, but, this is only a book. Slavery has long since been abolished and racism is now, thankfully, dwindling to almost nothing.At first, I'll admit, I was not fond of Scarlett, but after a while, I became used to her ways, and I really became absorbed into the book and felt as though I was walking in her shoes, and I understand why she did some things she did. The character development in this book is amazing; so is the extensive description.Gone With the Wind is such an amazing book for many reasons, but for me it has to be the ability which Mitchell has to take her readers into the story as though they were living the events themselves. I also loved the desperation and want Scarlett felt for Rhett as she realized she truly loved him, and of course, their stubborn relationship before they were married.There is not much more I can say that hasn't been said, except this: for hopeless romantics and avid readers (of which I am both), you will surely love GWTW. For everyone else: keep an open mind while you read. Remember that times have changed drastically and try to imagine if you were Scarlett yourself. Also, dive in the culture in which this book was written. Even if you don't agree with it, I believe everyone deserves an enjoyable read from of Gone With the Wind."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Imagine that in a flurry, your old life disappears; what was once poverty and happiness has transformed into poverty and a new, bittersweet lifestyle.

Like it wasn't finished and it desperatley needed a sequal. It would have been wonderful if Margaret Mitchell had written the sequal but she didn't so A. Ripley gave it her best shot.

Mitchell did her research and managed to produce on of the finest authoring efforts the history of American literature has ever seen.

It is always difficult to stick with a book that is sooo long, but Gone with the Wind was one that wasn't a problem. I loved how Scarlett realized that she loved Rhett because I think that many people overlook their true loves for a lust object that would never make them happy.

I knew a girl with a learning disability that caused her to read at a very slow rate, therefore giving her a genuine hatred of books.

(If you didn't understand the buisiness about the attack at Shantytown in the movei, read the book for a better understanding.) Margaret Mitchell also gives vivid, loving descriptions of the Old South, though I had to skim most of them so they wouldn't slow me down!

There are almost no books I feel that way about. I'm a writer and I abhor censorship. But this book is so outright racist it gags.Why should such stereotypes be allowed to continue for generation after generation to absorb?What would the world think of a romantic novel about dashing German SS officers and a beautiful blonde \\"maidchen\\" cavorting charmingly before concentration camp slaves? All the while talking about those slaves as if they were simply \\"children\\" who didn't know any better than to be wearing striped pajamas, carrying out humiliating tasks for their \\"masters\\" and existing pleasantly and contentedly in their cute little \\"barracks\\"? Critics would be up in arms. Such a novel would fall into disrepute and no one would claim it to be a great work of literature, even if it was well-written. So why do we stand for GWTW - this travesty of lies, lies, lies?I notice that one of the reviewers below mentioned that slaves weren't, in fact, badly treated. Hello! To begin with, slavery is slavery: an abomination upon the Earth. Any person who is enslaved is being treated badly. Period. Second, that reviewer should read Toni Morrison's \\"Beloved\\"to find out what it was REALLY like to live as a slave on a southern plantation. That depiction rings true. GWTW, on the subject of slavery, is complete clap-trap.Over and over again, it is mentioned that Scarlett's mother, \\"Miss Ellen,\\" would be \\"turning over in her grave\\" to see howScarlett betrayed her southern belle roots. Well, I contend that Margaret Mitchell is turning over in her grave because she knows what a monstrous mistake she made with GWTW. Hopefully, she's evolved, and, knowing her feminist views and her basic fairness as a person, I think she would agree with me - BAN THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"For $10 you'd think there would be a working table of contents.

I saw the movie when I was young and disliked it immensely. Therefore, I never read the book until it was selected for a book club. With some trepidation, I began reading and was immediately plunged into a riveting tale.This epic concerns the headstrong Scarlett O'Hara, a southern belle who becomes embroiled in the Civil War and Reconstruction Era. It is a story of Scarlett's selfishness and also her courage. The story revolves around the tumultuous relationship that develops between Scarlett and Rhett Butler, an enigmatic, harsh, and pitiable man who recognizes within Scarlett a likeness to himself. However, Scarlett's unrequited love for a gentler man, Ashly Wilkes, proves to be astumbling block to her happiness. Her unrelenting quest to obtain money also causes her to make many enemies. Scarlett symbolizes the changing times, and she and Rhett are a perfect match. Ashley represents the \\"old ways,\\" and thus this story can be seen as a symbolic journey. Times change, and people must adapt in order to survive. Although I do not necessarily agree with \\"survival of the fittest\\" mentality, the theme is addressed very poignantly in this story. I was repulsed by Scarletts ruthlessness, yet I also admired her courage and strength. Rhett was heartbreaking as he seemed to be ravaged by his own anger. He was a man who was desperate for love as are we all. Rhett seems to symbolize our own hungry souls. He is strong in some ways yet startlingly weak in others. He reminded me a little of the character Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\".My only complaint of the book is the treatment of black individuals. Many people have written on this subject, so I will not do so here. I did like Mammy's character even though she was stereotypical.Mitchell's characterization is superb. My favorite character is Melanie Wilkes. She is portrayed as a gentle yet strong woman. Melanie is courageous in her own way, and I loved her bravery in standing up against others who criticized those she loved. I also felt empathy as well as repugnance for both Scarlett and Rhett. All the characters are memorable, and Mitchell paints a vivid picture of struggle, disstruction, and triumph as the people within the story fight against the ravages of war.This book will stay with you long after you read it. Please give this wonderful story a chance. I'll definitely watch the movie again. I think I'll have a better appreciation for the film. God bless you all."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I've been a fan of the story since I first saw Gone with the Wind when I was a little girl. I didn't even know it was based on a book until all the media attention that the sequel Scarlett got when I was in junior high. I immediately went to the library and checked out Gone with the Wind. Even though I loved the movie I loved the book so much more. There are so many details that have been left out. Since then I've read a lot of other historical fiction but this one is still my favorite. There's a good reason why this is such a popular classic novel."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"After seeing the movie many, many, MANY timea, I finally decided I MUST read this book. This is my selection for our book club. I could hardly put the book down. The movie was wonderful, but the book is FANTASTIC! Love it, love it, love it. We will be discussing this selection in our book club in early February and I know each of our members are thoroughly enjoying this read!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This was my third time reading this book, each time in a different age period and each time with different experience and reflection on the story and characters of this wonderfully lavish and complex drama. yes I agree that the story is biased and somewhat racist. However, it reflects the attitudes of the general culture and way of life that existed back then in 1800s during and post Civil War. Put that aside (or rather become familiar with that specific culture), the story is heartbreaking, informative, and really addictive. I mean I would definitely recommend that before starting this book, clear your schedule for a week or two because once you start it is hard to put it down until you have reached the last page! You just get drawn into the this very well written story and you fall in love with all characters that are portraited with all of their complexities, strenghts, weaknesses, and yes lots and lots of mistakes and misunderstandings! So much that it breaks your heart over and over again and you can't help but to shake you head or even swear at them!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With the Wind was recieved exactly when described and in the condition as advertised. GREAT book by the way."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With the Wind was a fantastic book. It's about this young woman, Scarlett O'Hara, who is living during the Civil War-in the south. Her rich and perfect life is ruined once the south loses the war and she is thrown into a time of starvation and misery. She becomes a widow and has to face those troubles as well.Mitchell created the character, Scarlett, wonderfully. She had spunk, determination, intelligence, and selfishness-traits that made her personality interesting. She does what ever she needs to get her by. Then there's Rhett. He's this dashing man who is no gentleman. I have to say, he brought a little bit of light into the dark parts of the book. He seems to be just a rude, mischevious man at first, but later on, Mitchell makes his character more full, shall I say. His character is deep and full of emotion and feelings-I really can't describe it.Then Margaret Mitchell created a bond and passion between these two characters. It was a wonderful romance, with love and anger-a sort of bittersweet romance. I felt I could connect with these characters.I loved this novel; I couldn't put it down. I read it at a young age, 11 to be exact, but I was into it none the less. It kept me hooked for 7 weeks until I finally finished it. It's long-really long-but absolutely worth it.

To repeat all the reasons why would be quite redundant of me. Simply, I recommend GWTW if one wants to discover the white southern female point of view concerning the Civil War era American south. I also recommend Harriet Jacobs' &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot; to anyone BRAVE enough to discover the black southern female slave point of view concerning the Civil War era American south. Seeing as GWTW is very long, and Ms. Jacobs' work is around 200 pages, I'd read &quot;Incidents&quot; first. It's another truly amazing literary work...an account of southern slavery from the pen of a former slave herself! There is much much interesting information concerning the relationship between mistress and female slave/house attendant that will provoke thought as one reads GWTW afterwards."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I started out reading Gone with the Wind last year, and I thought it was the most awful chore of a read ever.

Millions of people not only remember Gone with the Wind, but re-read it faithfully. Literary critics and scholars don't like this book and wish it would go away. The reason? They can't quite account for its enduring popularity. It's sentimental. It doesn't break new literary ground. It's racist. Blah, blah, blah. And yet. How many other works of so-called \\"popular fiction\\" from the '30s and '40s are remembered, let alone read, today? None. How many are even in print? None. The hub-bub surrounding Alice Randall's satirical follow-up last year had less to do with that novel's merits than the near mythical status Gone with the Wind has achieved in American culture. Why? Because Mitchell tells a helluva story. Unforgettable and complex characters, an involving plot and a timeless theme: survival. The pacing, structure and language run circles around most books published today, yes, even those with literary aspirations. All this and heroine who dares not to be liked. Come to think of it, maybe Mitchell did break new ground. Pick it up.

Characters are well developed and constant in their portrayal of the complexities of love and life under the strain of a collapsing civilization. Survival amidst tremendous hardships and the source of strength in the human soul are topics that the novel/movie address nicely. However, taken in a context of reality, \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is insulting to the reader's/viewer's intelligence and to the ancestors of Southerners, both black and white, free and slave, through its completely one-sided depiction of life in the plantation south. Many other reviewers on this site have commented that \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is a nice change from other books and movies in that it portrays the master/slave relationship as being affable. The truth, however, is not so pleasant. It is evident from the reading of historical documents that even the kindest of slaveholders did not keep their slaves as well-clothed, well-fed, and lightly worked as the O'Haras kept theirs. Only once did the movie portray slaves doing field labor. It never showed the slaves' living quarters, which were often less than comfortable. The only brutality and punishment it showed was when Scarlet hit Prissy for not moving fast enough when Melanie was giving birth. The representation of Mammy is partly accurate in that she was a jack-of-all-trades woman who cared especially for the master's children. The other side of the \\"Mammy\\" role however, was that on most plantations, the mammy was overworked, on-call 24 hours a day, and abused sexually and physically by the master. Also, a mammy would have never had the authority to boss around a master's daughter like Mammy bossed around Scarlet. For those who desire a well-written piece of fiction that takes place in a beautiful and gentile fantasy world called the Old South, I would surely recommend \\"Gone With the Wind\\". For those who know better than to believe in illusions of peace and warmth in the plantation south and who enjoy books that have at least one foot in the doorway of reality, \\"Gone With the Wind\\" will not be on your list of favorites."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Nice story, feels a little like a soap opera at times, but the civil war part of the story is excellent. Could have and should have been shorter...lots of filler.Overall it is pretty good read."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is one of those books where you find a little bit of yourself in each character, rather than finding one you can entirely associate with. It's imposible to completely like or completely hate any of the characters.There are many reasons I can't bring myself to read any of the liscenced or unofficial sequels to this book:1)This book was written about 73 years after the time setting of the book itself, & when the author was born in 1700, Having read books from that time, like Baum's Oz series, culture of the late 19tch century & early 20th century were more similar than the 1900s are from now, so she wouldn't have had to do nearly as much research on life in the Confederate South as a sequel writer would, & a sequal writer younger than herself would have their cultural views skewed by the changes of modern times.2)It doesn't really need a sequel. If you think about what direction the story might have gone in if Rhett didn't leave Scarlet; They were incapable of being happy together it might have had the same kind of tragic ending as Warren Adler's \\"War of the Roses.\\" Or since Scarlet is such a proud woman who has been married to many men she didn't love, she might return from Tara & decide to divorce Rhett upon his promised occasional returns & marry the childish Ashley just to kick Rhett in the side for abandoning her. Or she could have gone another 5 or 10 years persuing Rhett only to loose interest in him when she finally won him back; like she looses interest in anything else when the hunt is over.I recommend \\"War of the Roses,\\" as well as Jane Austin's \\"Pride & Prejudice,\\" as I find similarity in their rough relationship as well."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I think that Gone with the wind is the best book ever written the movie is a winner to .

Will they survive the war. Who will live and who will die. You read through the tragides and the good times . I give Gone with the Wind and will argue with anyone who differs."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Thinking of this book, it's hard to avoid a real feeling of sadness. Unfortunately, many people know NOTHING about post- Civil War Reconstruction besides what they read in GWTW and saw in the 1939 movie. Everything from both sources that relates to the Reconstruction era is wrong-- and yes, I do mean EVERYTHING. America reached a peak of racial harmony in those years that in many ways it has yet to reattain. It was an era of honest, integrated government, integrated education, integrated workplaces, and so much more. Many, many white people, including Southerners and former Confederates, were able to lay their racism aside to an astonishing degree and attempt to rebuild a new South. It was a shining, extraordinary period of our nation's history. Too bad few people know anything accurate about it, and instead get totally incorrect information from sources like GWTW!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"The cover of this book appealed to me more than the classic, hardback and so I purchased it instead just a few weeks ago. The book arrived on time and everything appeared to be in perfect condition. However, the old adage, \\"You can't judge a book by it's cover\\" must be very true, indeed, considering that at least two pages are missing and that one is replaced with a later page.With that aside, being that I am an avid reader, I'm almost ashamed to admit that I have not read this book until recently and fortunately, I wasn't succumbed to it despite all of the cult-like adoration it receives. Besides Margret Mitchell's writing being possibly the best I think I've ever come across; passionate descriptions, believable characters and dialogue, etc.,GWTW is filled with anti-equality, anti-Republican, hate speech that is impossible to ignore, and the book could have easily been shortened by at least 300 pages. Though Mitchell's writing style was obviously brilliant, she tended to delve too far into trivial details concerning things that were utterly pointless in my opinion.I agree wholeheartedly with another reviewer that Ms. Mitchell would possibly have an extremely difficult time getting her book published today."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I love this book, I've read about 6 or 7 times at least. It's fun reading about someone more: clueless, and selfish than me."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"First of all: I adored the movie. I fell in love with Gable and with Leigh at the same time. Everyone could see that they were made for each other. I mainly expected a romantic love story when I started to read the novel. Yet it was nowhere to be found though a lot of reviewers seem to have seen what I obviously could not see.The first shock was that Scarlett is apparently only sixteen when she first meets Rhett, aged thirty-three, an already middle-aged, sophisticated man who chases after an incredibly shallow and vain teenager with much more gumption than wit. Scarlett is so emotionally immature and ignorant that it borders on blatant stupidity. I usually love it when the heroes indulge in verbal duels but those in this book I could not enjoy for Scarlett always looks foolish in them. To make it worse she is as cold as a fish, extremely childish and calculating. The authoress referred to her charm, intelligence and allure more than once but I couldn't see any of it except her beauty of course and that she was hard to get. She could be Becky Sharp's little sister but at least Thackeray's lady possessed intellect, a good judgment for people and a great sense of humor. To be fair I have to say that the heroine is resilient and smart when it comes to business. She also isn't afraid of hard work though exactly those only likeable traits make her suspicious to the good people of Atlanta. Yet Rhett was hardly a Harlequin hero either. Unlike his movie character he is bitingly sarcastic and acidly derisive instead of charming, amusing and witty. I found him considerably more sinister than Gable. He is violent, unreliable and really ruthless in a menacing way. With very good reason men usually don't like him. The way he is portrayed I couldn't like him either. I had no clue if Rhett loved Scarlett or not and if he did, why? Her reactions remained equally enigmatic in the novel. The book was surely a fascinating read for a lot of reasons but it made me unhappy in an unpleasant way. The characters often treat each other in such a hateful and cruel way that it was painful to watch. Whatever kind of love those two felt for each other, tenderness and true concern for the other seemed to have been no part in it. For fans of true romance I cannot recommend this book."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Yes, it is a magnificent novel, an American classic. Filled with larger than life characters Gone with the Wind takes the reader to a chapter of American history not readily remembered (Southern Reconstruction) and to institutions we wish we could not remember (slavery, racism and the KKK).Lets talk about the novel. It is not a book for the faint of heart- my edition is over 700 pages. Yet, Margaret Mitchell has the gift to immerse you in a world that has long since passed. From the comfort of our armchairs it is difficult for us to imagine the sense of lostness the southern gentry must of felt during and after the war. They simply lost everything. Yet, there is something about the American character that does not want to give up, a stubbornness best personified by Scarlet O'Hara.I first read Gone with The Wind in the early 90's, it left an indelible imprint on my mind. About a year ago as I was persuing my library, it caught my eye again. I pull it for the self, sat down in my wing back chair and began reading eagerly anticipating being drawn into Mitchell's south once again. This time, however, I could not finish the book. A few hundred pages into it, I gently closed the cover and put it back into my library. What was it that caused me not complete this book? It was the blatant racism that seemed to permeate every other page.Yes, I realize that this book was written by a southerner reflecting a time and culture long since gone. Yes, racism is an appropriate subject to write about. Yes, one may write a novel that reflect the racism of the antebellum south- but this is one country preacher who will not read it again."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Really, that's my only gripe. Too many pages and all that dialogue and long paragraphs with Mammy and Prissy and all the others talking so strangely.

It took me a whole year to read this damn thing, but at least I finally finished! And I am not going to read SCARLETT or THE WIND DONE GONE!Anyways, I loved the movie especially! Vivien Leigh is hot and gorgeous! Gable is Gable, classy and smug! I have the tape at home as part of my Best Picture collection. The movie is also long, at nearly 4 hours! But in the end, Mitchell did a good job. Alice Randall and Alexandra Ripley should be ashamed of themselves for thinking they could do better!

It's not like I don't know the plot, but still, I've always imagined that it's a classic piece of American storytelling. Let's just say that the writing can be hackneyed, and at times cringe-worthy. But what will make this book last is Mitchell's ability to tell a story, to make people want to turn the page, and experience what happens next. This skill is often undervalued and overlooked, but makes her talent stand above the abilities of others who can write a better sentence. I would recommend this book, not as a timeless piece of literature, but of storytelling."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This was a gift for a family member.

I have not read anything quite like this novel which took me weeks to read, and I thank my lucky stars I am me, living in a tiny country where people don't go mad. The sheer volume of words describing conflict, emotions, deprivation and loss was unbelievable. If you want to tuck up on a rainy day (or days) and learn what it was like to live in that century then this is the book for you. Scarlett needed a good smack, Rhett needed a good hug, Pittypat needed a box of tissues, Ashley needed a ramrod for his spine and Melly needed a sainthood. Yes, I understood what was written about the war, and loathed it, but isn't that what a story is supposed to do? Wring out your feelings? And I certainly am wrung out.

Thanks!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I was reluctant to read Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind because I thought it was basically a romance novel. It is not. It includes some very appealing characters and lots of action.The focus of the novel is on Scarlett O'Hara. She is a magnificent creature, beautiful and strong, but she is completely defined by her selfishness. When she is a fresh young woman, her selfishness is actually appealing - at least to Rhett Butler, a rogue who appreciates anyone who flaunts conventional morality. As time passes, though, Rhett matures and Scarlett does not, and her selfishness has more serious consequences.The plot moves quickly through a series of exciting episodes: battles are won or lost, men and women fall in love, babies are born and soldiers die. The author maintains suspense as we await the defeat of the Confederacy but of course the result is never in doubt. At the end of the war, genteel Southern society collapses and is replaced by coarse commercialism and opportunism. The aristocracy is ruined and its members are forced into trades. Against this backdrop, we watch the romance between Scarlett and Rhett Butler develop and then wane.Mitchell depicts the antebellum South as a happy society with a place for everyone, from the planter aristocracy down to the slaves who thrive under their paternalistic care. This depiction is affecting but obviously idealized. Many subsequent passages of the book, dealing with racial relations during the reconstruction, are even more offensive to African-Americans. Mitchell wrote Gone with the Wind 70 years ago and her views on race are not modern ones. Still, there is no denying her ability as a writer, and there is no denying that Gone with the Wind is a great novel."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"\\"Gone with the Wind\\" by Margaret Mitchell is one of my favorite books of all time. Scarlet O'Hara, the foolish southern belle is in love with Ashley Wilkes, a scholar who won't have anything to do with her. To rebel, she marries his fianc&eacute;e' s brother and when the war breaks out, it turns ugly. She is then forced to move to Atlanta to her husband's house. In Atlanta, Georgia during the Civil War things aren't easy. It is hot and sandy. The sticky humidity is horrible to live in yet the feeling of \\"home\\" is evident everywhere. There are always barbecues and lazy afternoons up till the war. The south is mostly cotton fields, with little factories while the north is full of manufacturing. Things don't look too good for the south when the war breaks out and to make everything worse, the ports are soon closed off. All too soon Scarlet feels the bitterness of war as her childhood friends die for a losing cause. When she finds Atlanta being attacked by General Sherman she must flee for safety and there is nowhere to go.This story is about a girl who has been spoiled her entire life and then must learn to do things on her own. She faces the fact that she can't have everything and that she has to make sacrifices. Her whole life she has been the brat that depends on everyone else so she can't do anything on her own. She is blinded by her own insolence to the truth that nothing is fair. Sweet Melanie, her sister in law is kind to her and is too sweet hearted to see the wrong in anyone; she doesn't see how corrupt Scarlet' s mind is. She is always on Scarlet' s side despite the horrible things that she does. Scandalous Rhett Butler loves Scarlet for her foul heart and chases her throughout the whole book. Rhett has a history for doing unthinkable things to girls. (Unthinkable at the time; refusing to marry a girl he courted, publicly kissing, etc.) Everyone despises him for making a profit off of the war. All proper people support the failing cause and Rhett makes fun of them. He is a businessman, so nothing is personal till he meets Scarlet. As time progresses, Scarlet comes to realize the damage that she has done with her being wicked to everyone. She literally is and was a spoiled brat. Her suffering teaches her a lesson that we all should learn.If you love historical fiction with a little romance, this book is perfect for you. Scarlet is the perfect Southern belle who is incredible to read about. How she attracts men with her charm and little helpless acts is unbelievable. She is used to having slaves serve her and she treats them with little or no respect until she needs them. You cannot stop thinking about how much you would hate Scarlet if she was real, but you can't stop feeling sorry for her and you want to help her to realize how stupid she is.In this book you have a look at how the south was before and after the Civil War. They were still people with feelings, not horrible people who were wicked. You fall in love with the chivalry and way of life. You also realize how wrong slavery was. Even they knew it was wrong, they just couldn't imagine life without the slave labor. I think that the book is written well, you see why people did things and the reasoning behind their actions. I didn't always agree with what Scarlet did, but I knew why she did things. The book is very interesting and I couldn't put it down at all. I certainly would recommend it to just about anyone. I certainly understand the era better now. The book got me interested in other books about the war and now I can see why people felt the way they did. I can see the good and bad in slavery. I feel that lack of education on the issue is what caused such disastrous effects."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Introduction: This classic novel is full of famous statements like \`Tomorrow is an other day.'

When you are reading the book, the character's personality will attract you. But I don't really like Scarlet. Although she is beautiful, she is vain and mean. It has a very good storyline. It makes you continue reading page after page. This book teaches us a lot of lessons. And it also tells us how bad, cruel war is. I think this is the greatest love story ever.Audience: This book is good for age 13 or above. It is good for everyone. But I'm afraid that the complicated story will confuse younger readers. J"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I read this when I was in 5th grade, and I fell in love with it! Scarlett is one of the most interesting, fun-to-read-about characters ever, and you're pretty much transported to the world of the antebellum American South.There's a reason this book has such enduring popularity!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With the Wind is an amazing book that leaves you a changed person.Treasure, treasure, treasure your first time read because the impact of this book is so deep you'll be left in a trance for days. Whilst reading this novel you will eat, sleep, breathe Gone With the Wind - so place any important activities on hold and don't read if there is any exams ahead!The first time you read it is a feeling that will be in your heart forever!!! A magical journey that grips your senses and rips at your heart, but devestatingly,can only be travelled once. But don't worry, although you can never really grasp those same feeling ever again, the book will still have you hooked everytime you read it. You will still hope and wish that Scarlett will find true happiness, even if such dreams are futile. I've read it on average once a year since that first awesome time and it neevr ceases to hook me in.The characters are all well-developed, particularly Scarlett (the main character). The reader is given a great insight and undestanding of Scarlett which is why she rightfully claims her spot in history. She is quite simply unforgettable. An amazing character who stands the test of time and, in my mind, has become a memory of a real person.Reader's should not look to this book for the rights and wrongs of slavery or deep insights of the civil war. This is a romance novel that Mitchell has intwined beautifully with minor war details and a subtle look into the pre-war South.There is a reason why this is one of the most well-known and purchased book of all time. Read it and you will find out. But be warned, the ending will break your heart and it will be as painful as any real-life romance. Hard to believe I know, but the characters so amazing that they stay with you 24 hours a day whislt reading and you feel their emotions like you are them. Margaret Mitchell was a very talented lady."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"The last book that I finished was Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell. It is set during the Civil War in the South, specifically in Atlanta. It is the story of Scarlett O'Hara and how her life changes during the Civil War and early Reconstruction. She is selfish and vain and will do about anything to rebuild her life after the North wins the war. She is left very poor and has to provide for the survivors of her family. She will do anything to make some money, even marry several times to people that she doesn't care for while the real \\"love\\" of her life is married to her sister-in-law. Scarlett just wants to have enough money to once again become the belle of the county.One character that she meets on this journey that I particularly enjoyed was Rhett Butler. Rhett is a charming, opinionated man with money that sees Scarlett how she really is and tells people the truth, however harsh that it is.I liked this book because it is about the Civil War, but through the eyes of a vain young woman whose life drastically changes. If you like historical fiction with a romantic twist, you will probably enjoy this classic tale of love between two interesting personalities."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Hey, 'Reader from Santa Fe'. Yes there are passages which are cringeworthy. And do you know what? Thank God it's never been banned! For MM to have written it any other way would be a fib. No, I'm not talking about the glorification of slavery and their 'barracks.' I am with you and Toni Morrison 100% on the reality of this outrageous part of history. But for MM to have written it any other way would hardly ring true. Anyone who knows about her life knows that she was writing from the perspective that she did because that was her experience. She lived in a world of white supremacy and segregation, and do you know what? I read this and think thank goodness we don't now! Thak goodness I can have the friends that I want to and date the guys I want to, regardless of their background. GWTW is as much a historical document, albeit laced with southern pride, inasmuch as it shows what past attitudes were. I see GWTW as a great story nonetheless, with strong characters clashing with each other and riding roughshod over others in the name of self-survival. Not always attractive qualities, but qualities that have themselves survived. May I recommend The Wind Done Gone by Alice Randall? She writes that MM and GWTW inspired her to think. They inspired me too."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"After I read the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (by Rebecca Wells), I really wanted to read Gone with the Wind. In Sisterhood, Wells characters actually attend the premier of the movie. I have seen the movie, Gone with the Wind, several times, but, as usual, the book is much better. I really enjoyed the &quot;love story&quot; about Scarlett and Rhett. I wish Mitchell had written the sequel, which I have not read. She did an excellent job with the characters and I amnot sure if anyone could do it better. The story is true to life. Scarlett seemed to think the grass was greener on the otherside and that money/material things is the answer to everything. Not always true. Scarlett failed to see what she had in Rhett, until she lost him. Something to think about. I really hated to see this book end."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"The book &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; by Margaret Mitchell is my favorite book ever. Since I was only in sixth grade when I read it, even I found it a great book. Both the movie and the book have been American standards for literature. There are dozens of memorable characters, with plenty of juicy parts to hold it together. Even though it is 1,024 pages, it is very hard to put down. I read it over three months, about 20 pages a day, and I had to limit myself! This is surely the greatest book ever written. However, if you are the movie type, do not let me limit you. See the Academy Award winning move &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; with Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable give thier performance of thier career! Filled with lots of exciting characters, events, scenery, and detail; all of this is needed to create the best piece of American Literature, and &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; by Margaret Mitchell has it all."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Ever since reading Gone with the wind in sixth grade, it has been my favorite book! It is fun and easy to read. Margret Michell knew how to perfectly balance a story with seriousness and pure comic relief. The story takes place during a rough time in the South, The American Civil War. Scarlet is devoted to the Cofederate cause, or at least at sometimes she seems to be. At other times she appears to be more devoted to herself. Rhett Butler, the other main character could care less about the outcome of the war, as long as he is benefiting from the finanical booms it results in. Both the characters are so equally stubborn making them perfect for eachother, but neither of them can see this until it may be too late."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone with the Wind, by Margaret Mitchell, is a stunning book which is sure to hold readers enthralled. Embark on an exciting journey, following the flirtatious Scarlett O'Hara, dashing blockade runner Rhett Butler, sweetness personified Melanie Hamilton, and the wistful Ashley Wilkes. Scarlett has always been a petulant, coquettish, southern belle. But too soon, the Civil War strikes, and Scarlett's perfect world shatters around her. Her beloved Ashley is married to Melly, a girl Scarlett feels is the perfect example of boredom. During the tragic, bloody years of the Civil War, the sardonic Rhett Butler enters Scarlett's life. This stunning book is not only a historical melodrama, but also a book that reflects the human heart and shows how Scarlett can change from a selfish person to a strong woman."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is another world that I lose myself in while reading it. I get so involved with the story and plot that when Scarlett is dismal, I am dismal. When Scarlett is defiant, I am defiant. This book never fails to move me. While some people see it as a racist pledge to the Confederacy, I see it as the key to how the South felt about the war, about the Reconstruction, about life..."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Read this book. And then read the sequel by Alexandra Ripley. Gone with the Wind is THE BEST! Beautiful, witty, definitly involved. What I love about these two books is that I became the character. I had read about her so much that I knew her inside and out, and I like books that do that for me. Margaret Mitchell is truly amazing and Alexandra Ripley did an outstanding recreating Scarletts life."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I first read this book at the age of ten and have re-read it at least 15 times over the last decade. With each reading, I admire Mitchell's characters more and more. Mitchell's pen has an unerring eye for the telling detail. Aside from Rhett and Scarlett's stormy love, I think one of the most complex and fascinating relationships in the book is that of Scarlett and Melanie. Although Scarlett thinks she hates Melanie, she really depends on her as a substitute mother, and whether she realizes it or not, her actions towards Melanie are truly generous and good. Melanie, for her part, seems to worship Scarlett almost to the point of idolatry, and from the Twelve Oaks Barbecue scene until her death at the end of the book, never ceases protecting Scarlett from her detractors - just like Ellen O'Hara. Melanie is the only person who can ease Scarlett's anxiety about her fog nightmares other than Rhett. One of the most tragic things about the story is that when Scarlett fina! lly realizes just how much she loves and needs Melanie and Rhett, they are both lost to her on the same day. I've always wished that Mitchell had written a second volume (the Ripley book is wretched!), although I myself don't really see how Scarlett could get Rhett back, and there are no other people in her life who could take Melanie's place. Mitchell's story is both inspirational - Scarlett offers many lessons on how to cope with adversity, sorrow, and loss - and a magnificent exploration of the complexities of the human heart and mind. Each time I read this book I almost forget where I am and what else I should be doing. Margaret Mitchell was a great storyteller. I wish this book was longer."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is an incredible book! I found it extremely hard to put down. Margaret Mitchell guids you through all of the human emothions with this one. I is a griping novel about this civil war and it truely shows you what a horrible thing war is. Although I have not had that much time to read many books I can easily say that this book is the best I have ever read. I would esily give it 6 stars!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"When I picked up this book, I expected a long romance novel about a woman and her lover. What I read kept me up until 3 a.m. trying to finish it in one sitting. I would reccommend it to anyone. The one star I removed was due to the fact that it sometimes became confusing, with all of the marriages and deaths. I loved it. I severely do NOT reccommend to ANYONE the sequel, Scarlett."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book, Gone With the Wind, was so beautifully written that it seemed like the characters came off the page. Scarlett was not just someone from a book, but actually someone who lived.The book was the tale of Scarlett O'Hara from when she was 16 till she was 28. At the beginning of the book, Scarlett, daughter of a wealthy plantation owner, is in love with Ashley Wilkes. But Ashley is to marry his timid cousin Melanie Hamilton. Scarlett is very upset, but ends up marrying Charles Hamilton, Melanie's (also timid) brother to hurt Ashley. But war starts, and the men go off. Scarlett starts to realize that the war isn't just an exciting, little game, and she meets Rhett Butler. During the siege of Atlanta, I held my breath, anxious to see what was next. Scarlett ends up marrying twice again and has 3 children Wade, Ella, and Bonnie.Excellent book! The movie was great too, though it left out some things. But if you want to read more details than the movie, read the book."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Although this is the longest book I've ever read in my life (1024 pages in my edition), it wasn't long enough, and it never could be. I loved this book, and now that I've read it all i can say is that I'm glad there's a sequel. From the first few paes the book catches the readers and and wraps them up in it's pages, carrying them along with the life of Scarlett O'hara. We laugh with her, cry with her, feel her her emotions as if they were our own. You cannot stop thinking about the book, even though your mind should be on other things. The only desire is to keep reading and find out more, until the book finally lets go. Then the reader is left alone and confused, wondering what has happened, and where the story has gone. The book is a masterpiece, a novel in perfection, and my only regret is that this scale only goes from one to ten, for Gone With The Wind deserves a 100."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"First and foremost, Gone with the Wind has no mundane narratives, heartwarming and heart-rending from page 1 to 1448, 1448 was not enough!Brace thyself to be swept away by the Old South. If you heard this is a novel which glorifies racism and the age of slavery, you are misinformed; magnanimity is quite a virtue fellow savant.A captivating theme supported by characters with character, what more dost thou needeth? GWTW is a Pre-Civil War novel which portrays the monstrous adversities Southerners were manhandled to weather upon the slaughter of their civilization and way of life. For those attempting to prevail over a disheartening tragedy, GWTW shall inspire thee to walk the path of Rhett Butler or Scarlett O'Hara, for it once had for I (I, a former Ashley), though I held onto my chimerical nature. Wikipedia relays an excellent analysis of the characters, better than my own.People believe Southerners were fighting to defend slavery and the Confederacy, and I am sure a number of the arrogant wealthy landowners were, but the majority of Southerners were simply defending their homes and those they love. What would you do if an army was en route to your town and will pillage, burn, and commit unspeakable horrors unto your town's women, welcome 'em with open arms? Unlikely, unless you are gutless or a damn fool. You would, like I, commit monstrous acts to all extents, even if it were to leave you a corpse. I can go into historical detail debunking many fallacies people have about those who fought for the Confederacy, but it would serve little purpose, try reading the quote at the end of this review. GWTW is a Pulitzer Prize winner, it is doubtful that it would have been awarded such an honor if it were based on a horde of slack-jawed yokels praising slavery. GWTW is a novel of epic proportions, I highly recommend it.The 1939 film cannot compare in depth to the novel itself, but it is damn good for 1939. Clark Gable's performance was praiseworthy, such fiery passion, and Vivien Leigh, wow! What a powerhouse she is, almost intimidating, but in a cute classy way, if that makes sense, especially when she says \\"I will not listen-\\" (p. 1306)Memorable scene:Scarlett: [pleads with Rhett as he is about to leave to join the Confederate Army] Oh, Rhett! Please, don't go! You can't leave me! Please! I'll never forgive you!Rhett Butler: I'm not asking you to forgive me. I'll never understand or forgive myself. And if a bullet gets me, so help me, I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot. There's one thing I do know... and that is that I love you, Scarlett. In spite of you and me and the whole silly world going to pieces around us, I love you. Because we're alike. Bad lots, both of us. Selfish and shrewd. But able to look things in the eyes as we call them by their right names.Scarlett: [struggles] Don't hold me like that!Rhett Butler: [holds her tighter] Scarlett! Look at me! I've loved you more than I've ever loved any woman and I've waited for you longer than I've ever waited for any woman.[kisses her forhead]Scarlett: [turns her face away] Let me alone!Rhett Butler: [forces her to look him in the eyes] Here's a soldier of the South who loves you, Scarlett. Wants to feel your arms around him, wants to carry the memory of your kisses into battle with him. Never mind about loving me, you're a woman sending a soldier to his death with a beautiful memory.

Because even after 72 years and billions of kudos, GWTW is still underrated. I was skeptical when I picked it up. But MM is one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, and she immediately hooks the reader. And she never lets up. And she spends the last third of the novel sucker-punching the reader over and over and over again, with each twist and turn more painful than the last. There's no one left to root for at the end of the book, and that's as it should be. Because it becomes clear that the characters in this novel (the adults, anyway) have all been playing a variety of dangerous games and, just like real life, they have to pay the price in the end.Scarlett is smart and courageous, but in the end she pays a price for her selfish behavior. Rhett is also smart and courageous, but at the end of the book he's a broken mess groping for his dignity and sanity. Melanie remains sane and dignified, but she's selfless to a fault (a characteristic which leads to her demise), and Ashley...well...This book makes me weep every time I read it. And yet I've read it at least 100 times. And keep coming back for more. Too bad all the sequels are so bad, but there's some fabulous fan fiction out there."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"If you read GWTW strictly as a love story,you're missing part of the picture,and I'm saying this as someone who DID read it as a love story many years ago at the age of twelve. And I don't mean just the surface historical picture either.It goes so much deeper.Scarlett is of course the central character,and to me,a metaphor for the \\"New South\\",in that she compromises with the new circumstances in order to survive.Melanie appeared to me as a symbol of the \\"Old South\\"-but the part of it that had integrity and strength.They needed each other in order to survive,and it took Scarlett until the end of the book to realise this.Ashley is the part of the Old South that couldn't adjust.Rhett is the person who though he despised the old ways and all they stood for until age and time made him begin to realise what he had thrown away.He still had a cynicism about it,but he also had an appreciation for the charm of a time that would never be again.As with many others,Scarlett was my favorite character in my first few readings,but I came to a new appreciation of Melanie over time. I began to see that she had a true quiet strength that Scarlett could never approach,one that didn't require her to compromise her principles and her loyalty,as Scarlett had to,in order to survive. The character of Ashley,on many further readings,doesn't appear quite as pathetic as before(though I never found him THAT pathetic in the first place).He was simply,as he tragically recognised,an anachronism in his time,a beautiful dream which evaporated under the harsh glare of a new reality.He was the part of the dream that Scarlett clung to,even as she clung to the ideal of her mother Ellen,never seeing the truth of these ideals-the honor,strength,and integrity of the dream,rather than the outward forms.This was HER tragedy-even though she was a survivor of a kind,she had to destroy all that was good in order to do so.Melanie had the true moral courage that allowed her to survive without destroying the good-to me,a much more difficult kind of survival.I'll need to read this book so many more times before I'll feel finally understand it all,if I ever will.I understand the old story,being born and raised in the South,of the struggle to hold on to your identity and still be a part of the world around you.I understand why The War can feel like yesterday-after all, most of it was fought on the soil here,and the losers always remember longer.I think the background of Scarlett's father,Gerald O'Hara from Ireland,neatly ties into this.Read and re-read this book,because everytime you do you'll find depths you didn't plumb before.There is so much symbolism to be explored,each reading will provoke new thoughts."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Perhaps because it was made into a hit movie, this book is sometimes considered a &quot;romance novel&quot; instead of great literature. It is, in fact, one of the great American novels. Mitchell does not portray the antebellum South as an ideal but rather a doomed society, like the &quot;Tara&quot; of Irish myth. The characters are thoroughly developed and complex. A must read for anyone interested in the Civil War, women in fiction, and American literature."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I absolutely loved Gone With the Wind. I read over the summer because it was one of the choices on my school reading list and my mother and sister had read it and loved it.

I&iexcl;m so obsessed with the book that I think about it every day, in spite that I&iexcl;ve read it for like a hundred times. I cannot tell why I cannot get enough of the book. I&iexcl;ve been trying to tell myself that it&iexcl;s just a book of 1000 pages, telling the story of a belle&iexcl;s maturity and struggles for living, yet I just can&iexcl;t cut off my bond with it.Due to the colorful plot and intriguing dialogues, my opinion about it changes with time. As I first read it during junior high, I viewed it as a moving love story. Oddly, there was a time that I really hated the novel because it inevitably posed discrimination on African Americans. Nevertheless, my love for it was resurrected on my way of learning to grow up, for I highly respect the female main character, Scarlett O&iexcl;hara&iexcl;s courage and passion for living. Above all, I can always get something from reading the book.With its vivid description, I can picture a broad land, a luxurious house, people&iexcl;s looks in my mind. Though the novel is already pretty lengthy, still some parts were unsaid, leaving to readers&iexcl; imagination. I guess that&iexcl;s one of the reasons that make the book so catchy and unforgettable. With its classic movie version, it&iexcl;s amazing that my thoughts about it remain unaffected.The book is generally true to its historic background, and since the author depicts female mind profoundly, I can easily comprehend the idea she tried to convey or the metaphors. When Scarlett is happy or heart-broken, it seems like I&iexcl;m just there on the scene, feeling the trouble or pleasure she is confronted with. And it&iexcl;s one of the few books that make women respectable and independent, causing me to identify with it even more.I won&iexcl;t deny the fact that I&iexcl;m an incurable fan of the novel. It enriches my life and somehow glorifies my imagination.

It tells of the southern life during the Civil War. Even if you aren't interested in history, like I am not, you can still be sure you will love it. I recommend this book to anyone who has patience and who loves Love-stories."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone with the wind was the best book I have ever read. It is utterly captivating. Scarlett, the main character in the book, is someone that everyone should strive to be unlike, but secretly, throughout the whole book, you are rooting for her. Even at the stupidest things, you cry when Scarlett feels distraught. It will come deep into your soul and play with you emotions until all you can do is focus all your energy into reading this book. From the beginning to the end, you won't be able to put it down. It is a great (and sometimes quite graphic) display of what the civil war does to people and their beings. You will not regret reading this book, in any way shape or form. It is the most tantalizing book you will ever read. It is a great love story of desperate unrequited love and of hidden emotions that never show themselves until; it is unfortunately, too late. Everyone should have the experience of reading a book that is so magical that you really will never forget the way you felt through each amazing chapter. It is a must read for people over the age of ten. It will make you blood curdle and go cold at almost the same instant.

No matter how many times I read it and re-read it I have always falling prey to it's spell of great reading. I don't care for other people who have a fanatical hatred for this book. It seems sad that these people who call this great classic racist are also the same people saying that the South deserved what it got and the southern people too got what they desereved. How can they even suggest such a thing? The killing of civilians, the pillaging, the murder of whole families and black ex-slaves, the stealing of homes, the burning of whole towns, civil liberties taking away when the south and it's people were doing their best to start again and be part of the Union again after the war, martial law being the order of the day for over five years, the robbing of state government money, over taxation again for the South and it's people after the war and after taxes being one of primary reasons for the the war, the murder of many more man and their families for being defiant against a Government that lied to them again, and all is being condoned by people who live now in the present who say the Southern people deserved what they got for having slaves and daring to follow what the Consitution allowed? the right of session. Do these people not know the law? history and American governmentworkins?, and the right of session being an American and constitutional right?. How sad. Gone With The Wind is a book. A great book. The story of Scarlett O'Hara and her fight to never be hungry again, her fight to never let the Yankees beat her, and her fight to keep Tara her land from the Yankees. Scarett is a role model for anyone who will do anything to survive when the time comes to keep from being poor. Whether she is spoiled, caculating, and shrewed or just plain mean she gets what she wants, just like I think she would have gotten Rhett back sooner or later. Or Rhett would have come back. He loved her too much and waited to long for her to just give her up easily. Remember how he waited till the burning of Atlanta to enlist in the Cause to save the Condfederacy, of course he would have returned back to her in the end. And for all the people who think slavery was the only issue pertaining to the civil war. Read your history. Not public school history or present history. Read real history before 1970. You'll get the history you were robbed from. Remember slavery was legal so that made it okay in the eyes of the law before the Civil War. It was legal. It didn't make it right. Abraham Lincoln too said he wasn't sending troops South to end slavery, he was sending troops to end the Antebellum South."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I read it when I was 11 and I could hardly put it down, it took me 5 days to read this amazing book.

Now I know what everyone is raving about. This saga simply swept me off my feet! This isn't just a novel for young girls...it's for everyone and you just have to read it.

I went through this book so fast...at times I laughed but there were also times when you ge so annoyed, frusturated and angry at Scarlett's antics (forget about Ashley already!) but you cannot help loving her for who she is too. Though GWTW may not be 100% historically accurate...who really cares!? Also, I just saw the movie...don't miss it!! That was just wonderful as well. (it was also voted the #2 Romance movie of all time by the Amerian Film Institute recently!) As for the sequel, Scarlett, I was a little dissapointed but I had to have closure and have the comfort of knowing Rhett took Scarlett back. All in all, read Gone With the Wind! This monumental epic has all the aspects of a book anyone could ever look for."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"You can tell by every other review of this book and probably by the advice of people you know that &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is an enduring classic. I LOVE THIS BOOK! But, be warned that this paperback edition has several spelling and gramatical errors. I was quite disapointed by the editing done here."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With The Wind is one of the most powerful works of literature I've ever read- its fluildy eloquent style and intricatly crafted descriptions make it seem more like a scene being played out, rather than words on page. I couldn't put it down- there are so many twists, and nothing turns out the way you hope it would. This is the best book I've ever read, and I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With the Wind is a great book that gives lots of descriptive detail, it as if you are there in the story. The book puts the movie to shame. I read the book before seeing the movie and I am glad I did. With as much detail that is in the book it is hard to make any kind of movie from it. The book story line is set during the Civil War. Placing the story during the Civil War makes the action and adventure seeker want to read the book. Although the book takes about war a lot there are several love triangles in the book. Having these love triangles in the story keeps the tension in the story and makes the read wonder who will be with who next. Having the story take place during this time brings a sense of realism to the book and makes the reader feel for the characters during this time. The book is also set in the point of view of the south. Having the book take place in the south is different and makes the reader realize why the war was being fought. This is a very fun book to read and I would recommend it anyone."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With The Wind is the best book I have ever read. I like it because of the setting{I like the old time books}and the characters. I also like it because it is very long and keeps my interest, which is very hard to do. So I think it is a good book to read."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is an great book. The character interaction, the historical sweep, everything. If you love, or even like, the movie, you should definitely read this book. There are so many things, even characters, in the book that were left out of the movie, the book fleshes everything out. I absolutely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"As an avid reader, I read this book, all 1037 pages, within about a week. I just couldn't put it down. Margaret Mitchell has skillfully woven life's everyday struggles in with the struggles only faced during Reconstruction. Although I do not beleive in Scarlett's thoughts about the war and Yankees and so on, it was almost hard not to empathyize with her and her struggles. Although all in all a nasty person, sometimes you can't help but love her.The strength of character portrayed by Melanie Wilkes has decided for me what I will name my first little girl. Melanie.As for Rhett, I do believe he is my favorite of them all."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book was an amazing view of the Civil War era as well as a beautiful love story. It is a testament to the strain the war caused on every person in the country at the time. Aside from the war it let's you in to the parts of your soul that too many try to hide. Some people think Scarlett was a demon, but I think she was and is a part of every person. Everyone should read GWTW. If you don't your really missing out. It is by far the best I've ever read and I'm convinced I'll never find better."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is not the type of book I usually read. I am into Mary Higgans Clark and John Grisham. I only read this book because of school, and thought that I could sort of skim through it. Well after the first sentence I couldn't help but read every page word for word. This book is a page turner if I've ever seen one. You would think that the ending would be annoying, because it is so open, but I love it. I won't ever read the sequel because it could never even come close to the book. No matter hot good it is GWTW will be a thousand times better. I read this book in 10 days. That's like 100 pages a day, but I even forgot there were 1000 pages. You get so involved in the romance of Scarlett and Rhett that you could care less of the thickness of the book. I you haven't read this book, your are missing out on not only the greatest love story ever, but the greatest novel ever written. I picked up the book thinking that I had to read a book during the summer and that with all the talk about this one I might as well try it. I soon realized that ever positive review I have read about it can't come close to describing this book."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is my all time favorite book. I read it in the eigth grade and since them I have read it several times. I first started reading this book because of the movie, but after reading the first few hundred pages, I virtually forgot that there was a movie. The 1939 movie with Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable is spectacular but Mitchell's book surpasses that greatness. This is the novel that proves the saying that the book is always better than the movie.I have read all the reviews that people have published on this site and it amazes me that anyone gave GTWT less than five stars. I couldn't put this book down!Gone With the Wind is romance to the highest degree and it only improves each time I read it. Scarlet's encounters with Rhett are my favorite part of this book. Everytime they meet it draws me in. The thing that makes this book great however, is that it isn't just about romance, it is about survival and although Scarlet isn't the nicest person like Melanie, it is hard to not root for her. She does everything all the way and never holds back what she is feeling."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 14 and I havebeen in love with it ever since. Scarlett was desperate for love, butwas looking in all the wrong places. She loved Rhett, but was too determined to make it in the world without him in an era that frowned on women behaving in that manner. In the end, she only defeated her own purpose; she had plenty of money, but no love. The characters in this book were written with such vivid color that they will live forever, whether in print or on screen."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I read the book before seeing the movie, and the movie makes the book look horrible! I have read GWTW at least ten times and it gets better everytime I read it. I can picture the scences as I read the book. This is the ultimate love story about a woman looking for love and security when it's right in her face. I always cry at the end but I know Scarlett will get Rhett back, she'll just put it out of her mind and think of it tomorrow."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is the best book ever written. I first read it the summer before eighth grade, and then again around February of that year. There is so much drama. I read the book before seeing the movie, but I don't think it matters what order you do them in, as long as you do both. Everyone should read and watch Gone With the Wind sometime in their life. My favorite character is Scarlett, because she changes and learns so much throughout the book. She learns that she really didn't love Ashley, and she really loved Rhett, although she realized that too late. Scarlett realized how selfish she was to marry two men she didn't love. She married Charles when he was really India's beau, and regretted it when Charles died, like what happened when she stole Frank, her sister's beau. I know I gave this book five stars, but it deserves so much more. Gone With the Wind is a must read for anyone!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I had fought against reading the book for many years. Having seen the movie many times, I thought &quot;Why should I wade through a thousand pages?&quot; Well, something drove me to start the book and I surprised myself by not being able to put it down. I recall actually rushing home from work, barely eating and reading late in the night. The story line is good, and the characters believable. It also provides come insight into a phase of American history, something we all could use. Don't delay - read it soon. I doubt if you'll regret it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I am 17 and just finish reading Gone with the Wind and thesequal. I loved all the charaters except Ashley. I believe everyemotion that the characters felt and I even know people who are as selfish as Scarlett. The author did a great job in describing everything but I did not enjoy the racism. But one must understand that she grew up in the early 1900s and in the south. She must have heard stories of the war because the rage and anger was still fresh in their minds. It cannot be expected that the book will not be racist when the author grew up with it. It must be overlooked in order to enjoy the great story. In the days that I read it I did not eat, sleep, talk to anybody, or even watch t.v. because it swept me into the world of the American Civil War. The 1000 and plus pages go by in a flash and you wish there were more. I suggest to everybody not to read the sequal because it ruins the characters and is completly unbelieveable and foolish. I loved Rhett, Scarett, and Melly because they have true human emotions. I recommand to watch the movie first so you won't be disappointed. You'll enjoy the handsome Clark Gable, the beautiful Vivien Leigh, and the charming Olivia de Havilland. Great novel!!!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With the Wind, the timeless tale of the old south, depicts colourful characters as they strugggle with the hardships of love, life and the Civil War. Scarlett O'Hara, a tragic hero, matures of her love of Ashley Wilkes, by means of her life experiences, which wisen Scarlett of her downfalls and also her attributes. The fact that the situation thrust upon her wisens her, she is forced to mature herself, and this included her selfish ways. Gone with the Wind is a classic, a must for all who study, or who are remotly interested in the modern history of America."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Well, for starters, I read the book before ever seeing the movie. Margaret Mitchell did a great job on her first novel. I read Scarlett (gets a bit nasty in places, and totally unbelievable), but GWTW is THE book to read. My copy is 1,024 pages long. Don't freak. Amazingly enough, even people who don't like long books ought to like it. Now for the opinions. I hated Ashley, in the book and the movie. I didn't like Melanie very much (&quot;Oh, Melly, don't be a goose.&quot;) 'cause she was so lovable. She was basically perfect. Rhett was a total jerk at times. You probably figured out by now that I side with Scarlett. She was tough, yet tender at times. I think that this book should occupy a place on your shelf or in your hand."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I'm 14. I read this book last winter and still quote words and actually use things the characters learned in this saga to improve my own life. Its almost like self-help but in such an entertaining way. The way the book is written, it is almost as if you are afraid to put the book down because the characters (especially Scarlett, she is quite busy) may do something without you. It is truely the best book I have ever read, and I don't even like historical fiction! i recommend this to anyone who can read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"It isn't all about the romance. Let me just blurt this out: Rhett is the HOTTEST MAN and after reading this you will be disappointed in every man you meet! He makes my blood boil like mad! He drives me mad! God, he's so damn sexy. He truly knows a woman and what she wants, and definitely what I want. I suggest that every man read in detail of Rhett's kissing technique because we need more men with skills like those. But enough of my gushing. Gosh, I wish I could have met this gifted writer who has combined multiple themes, tones, characters, and ideas and weaved it into this novel. I am not kidding nor exaggerating when I say this is the best novel, was always the best novel, and will always be the best novel. I've never laughed so hard or sobbed so much for a book. Everything fits right into place. THis is a perfect symphony on which the description of setting flow so well into the characters. I love the clever remarks of Rhett. Yes, he's VERY clever, as well as sexy. However, this is NOT a trashy romance novel. Margaret Mitchell does not give the usual and cliched damsel in distress heroine. Many intelligent and not-so-intelligent people have complained that of supposed rape, the inaccuracy of slaves were actually treated by their owners, and other indecencies. The one about rape is a flimsy complaint that can be easily refuted because it wasn't and the description of the scene fully suggests otherwise. However, the latter complaint has more value. However, if you really want to see the truth of the treatment of black slaves, just pick up Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States for such purposes. I am glad that the heroine was an imperfect hero. She was as real as any human. Scarlett is the person name for her because it certainly reflects her red-hot devotion to her beloved home Tara and her parents. Other characters such as Melanie and Ashley were so excellently developed. The characters can't get any closer to reality. However, I have lost many nights of sleep for reading this. This is so addictive that I could give up sleep for days in a row."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"As the title of the movie portrays it, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is the disappearance of a whole civilization after the Civil War, or a civilization gone with the wind. The movie is about the different stages at which the South was before, through, and finally during Reconstruction. At first, we observe how the Southern aristocracy lived during their peak years when the price of cotton was up in the skies. At the barbecue at Twelve Oaks, the Wilk's plantation, the movie depicts the arrogance of the southern gentlemen, since most of them wanted to go to war and blabbered expressions like, &quot;...a southern gentlemen is worth any ten yankees...&quot; They are all absolutely sure that they will win the war in a matter of months, but as it turned out they were absolutely incorrect. During this part of the movie, the views of the South that we observe are pretty biased, because slaves were treated as part of the family and with a lot of respect. In some plantations like the O'Hara's it could've happened, but it was very rare. Suddenly, when war is declared all of the southern beaux go to enlist into the army feverishly. The only one with a realistic view is Rhett Buttler, since he tells the men that before they start talking about victory they should be concerned in building more factories to supply their troops with such things as weapons and clothing. At this time, Rhett is looked at with scorn. But afterwards, he becomes a hero because he is the one who breaks the Union blockade and smuggles supplies into Charleston. When the war drags on, the south is just lingering its defeat. The movie also depicts the southern courage during the war, but with just courage and persistent one can't with the war. The movie is actually very realistic when it shows the wounded and the lack of supplies the southern hospitals had to help them. Finally when the war is about to end, we see General Sherman's troops marching into Atlanta and the evacuation of the city. In this scene, the movie also portrays Scarlett's courage by managing to take Melanie and the baby to Tara. When they finally arrive to Tara, we really see the devastation that took place at the South by the Union troops. At this moment, Scarlett vowed that no matter what she had to do, she would never suffer from hunger again in her life. Later, the carpetbaggers, or the blacks that come from the north, and the scalawags, southern people that supported reconstruction, make life very harsh for the southern people. They raise the taxes to the skies knowing that there is no way for them to be paid, but Scarlett with her strength and wit manages to pay them. Finally when she is established and married to Mr. Douglas, she starts a lumber business with Ashley Wilks. All her old friends criticize Scarlett, since she has become a scalawag herself and is dealing with the northern merchants. This part of the movie is very ironic because Ashley refuses to gain profit from forced labor, in this case prisoners that are brought to the mill by an overseer. Scarlett replies that he used to own slaves, but he tells her that even if the war didn't occur, they were going to be free when his father died. Again we observe the nostalgic and sympathetic view towards the South in the story line. Finally, the movie also presents the reactions that the Southerners had against the colored people. When Scarlett is attacked in the dark side of town, her husband and the other men pretend to be in a 'political meeting' while they are raiding into the blacks area burning their houses and killing some men. They wanted to 'clean' this area so it was safe for Scarlet to travel to the mill. Similar events did take place after the war. In fact, some of them took place in a larger scale and included lynchings and other violent acts. This anti-black feeling lead to the sprouting of groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the violence among both groups continued for a long time. Overall, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is a great movie that gives us a feeling of what it was like to live during the Civil War. Although it gets carried away sometimes by being slightly biased, the movie is a very good representation of the events that took place during this period. Besides from providing some historical evidence, it presents the different feelings and responses that the people had towards the confli"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is captivating from the start.The characters are so real.They aren't all good and Scarlett is a horrible person.That fact only makes you like her more.The ending of this book left me wanting more.That is why I can't wait to read the sequal.Gone With The Wind is a classic and anyone who hasn't read it is missing out."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is my favorite. I have read it straight through a few numerous times, but my favorite thing to do is just pick it up and let the pages fall open. It's the kind of book you can do that with. I love the emotion the characters show, and especially what they hide, waiting for you to find out. The vitality of the Old South meeting with the views of one courageous woman and those both behing her and against her is amazing. Scarlett O'Hara , Rhett Butler, and the others are characters never to be forgotten, immortalized forever by Margaret Mitchell."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"GWTW has many flaws -- the political views of the book can be most kindly described as &quot;naive,&quot; and its racism is apparent on virtually every page. The second half of the book feels rushed; once Mitchell has actually united Scarlett and Rhett, she no longer seems to write them with the same imagination and humor. All that said, this is the quintessential blockbuster -- not a deep book by any means, but entertaining in ways most novels or movies could never dream of being. Mitchell has a gift of creating fantastical situations for her characters -- and making them seem not only believable but unevitable. The characterization is stronger than is generally realized; Scarlett, Rhett, and Ashley all have layers of complexity that far more &quot;literary&quot; novels often fail to create. It's part of pop culture, and American culture, and for all its flaws and frustrations, an endlessly enjoyable and memorable read."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"some people should just shut their mouths. Gone with the Wind was the best book ever written!!! I read it in a week when i was fifteen and fell in love. I had seen the movie seven times before i had read the book. After i read the book though, i became completely obsessed with Gone With the wind, i bought the book and the movie, and have been hunting for any pictures, quotes and reviews. Gone With the Wind- it's not only one of the best books i have ever read, it's an obsession, it's my life.By the way, to those who thought that Gone with the Wind was a ridiculous read because of the length, they can go and get a brain. Good books have a lot of depth to them, and they need all the extra pages they can get. Gone With the Wind is not all about trash, as an underimaginative few found it. It's not only an overdramatic love story, it's not only another one of those American civil war stories. It's really about the complexity of human emotions, feelings, and the way people handle obstacles and life,consequences of actions and emotions and also about certain people and their mutual understanding of each other. When i finished GWTW for the very first time, i continued to think about the extra depth in that book which i just couldn't understand. I read the book several times more, and also began reading in between the lines. In the end i discovered that Magaret Mitchell was an absolute genius. She was no where near the trashy romance writer many had portrayed her to be- she was a realist. She was actually writing about how human spirit and determination, how it can be applied to help one over such obstacles. For those who say there was no depth to gwtw ought to read the book again. Perhaps they read the book to fast for their own benefits, it's such a shame because it only denotes what shallow and uneducated people they are, not being able to understand truly what an amazing conquest Margaret Mitchell had achieved."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Read this in the early 1960's, named my children Ashlie, Melanie, Rhett & Katie Scarlett, so loved it then, love it still."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I finally had the time to read this wonderful book!

I STARTED reading it because it is so talked about I figured I should. I came to the conclusion that I should spend my time reading books I find entertaining. I don't see how anyone could possibly find this book entertaining. The three stars I gave it are because it is a well written book, and I figure, hey any book with this kind of a reputation deserves something. One note, what about this son of Rhett's? Did Margaret Mitchell just forget to tell us the background on him? Obviously there is a big story behind that...all I can figure is that he is the child of Belle Watling, as the book never really did say why he got involved with her in the first place. I dont feel like reading a sequel that wasnt even written by Margaret Mitchell to find out what happens...

A great, spellbinding novel. With that said, the history in the book is terrible. This is such a warped perspective on slavery; it is history through the eyes of Simon LeGree. We are supposed to believe that the slaves really loved \\"Massa\\", instead of being kept in place by the lash, the chain, and the gun. Further, the Reconstruction governments in the South did some great things. The South has done an excellent job of rewriting history to make themselves look good. This novel is unfortunately the basis for many people's view of history of these times. We are supposed to feel bad that the \\"glorious\\" days of the slave plantation are \\"gone with the wind.\\""},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I am sorry , but I did not like Gone With The Wind(I am a senior in highschool and despite what everyone thinks about highschoolers, I am well read. And I have read books by James A Michener and John Jakes). I will admit that Scarlett has an amazing ability to survive, but it is only by her own selfishness that she does. I would rather read a different book about the civil war that contains better people than Scarlett. I feel sorry for the men that fall in love with Scarlett and I feel sorry for Scarlett because the one man she loves is lost to her. I do not believe in pining after something one cannot have, it wastes a lot of time and is too much wasted emotion. Even though I do not like Scarlett, I do appreciate the facts that Mitchell worked in about the civil war, such as the burning of Atlanta and what happened when the former slaves were given the right to vote and hold office. All in all, Gone With The Wind is an O.K. book, if you do not mind inconclusive endings and selfish people."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"The book was well written but personally I liked the movie better. Yes the book was about many things but the part that urked me was the romanticized view of the South's struggle with \\"the low class treacherous Yankees\\" and the so called uppity negroes. Oh how insolent and thirsty these \\"brutes\\" were for any thing white in a dress (southern propaganda of the reconstruction era and of Mitchell's own era.) Mitchell leaves out the fact that almost every Southern slave owner was himself only a gentleman during the day but at night was more treacherous to black womanhood than any \\"darky\\" ever was to that of white womanhood. Unfortunately many Americans know very little about history and therefore will sadly accept the lies and fantasies that Mitchell's book has exposed our society to. As I stated earlier, it was well written and I took great pains to read it in its entirety waiting for the point in which Mitchell's account of the South would be fair and balanced (since the movie wasn't so bad) but unfortunately it seemed Mitchell really believed that blacks who had been stolen from their homeland, whipped for not picking someone else's cotton fast enough, raped by their masters, abused by jealous mistresses were supposed to turn around after being freed and say \\"thankee Massuh fo' all dat ya dun dun fo' me.\\" Thank goodness for Alex Haley's Roots!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"oh god the ending! the ending! the ending!(it is best to read the book before you watch the movie)"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"As angela camack pointed out, the film &quot;gone with the wind represents the institution of slavery as a walk in the park. The fact that the movie lasted over a period of years and it rarely showed a violent act towards a Black person is solid proof. The truth of the matter is that slavery in the deep south, likes places such as south carolina, was incredibly brutal and violated most human rights. The film attempted to depict slavery as a life where none of the slaves got beaten, whipped or raped, when in reality violent acts towards Black individuals was a common day occurrence. According to Frederick Douglass slaves were beaten weekly to strike fear into the other slaves. Women were raped continually over years of their lives in order to perpetuate the institution of slavery. Families were torn apart from each other due to the trading and selling of slaves. Gone With the Wind could have done a little more justice to Black Americans by not under emphasizing the torture and pain that they endured during the 19th century.Apart from its ignorant illusion of slavery the movie does illustrate, as Mark Burgh points out, the hardships of post Civil War life in the south. Scarlett O'Hara never had to do a thing for herself before the war. By the time Sherman was done marching to the sea she had made up her mind that she was going to conform to the new northern way of life in order to survive under the new politic. A lot of people in the south had to make that change, and I think that movie does an excellent job of showing the changes in life style before and after the war"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"but it works, mainly because of Scarlett and Ashley, who are engaging if limited characters.

It takes us back through time, to a civilazation long since forgotten. To a time when all was well in the Old South, where beauty ran wild amidst the red clay of Georgia. From the outbreak of the Civil War in the view point of Georgian belle Scarlett O'Hara, to the end and beyond we become engrossed to the point where it is impossible to put the book down. The story follows the life of Scarlett O'Hara daughter of a wild Irishman and an aristocratic but kind French lady. We follow Scarlett through her weddings and her childbirths, through her long trip home to her beloved Tara. We experiance her rejection and her revilation that the land is the only thing that really lasts and the only thing worth fighting for. Through her pain and her misery, through her laughter, and her tears we laugh with her and cry with her. We feel the hardships of war and the fury of the aftermath, and we watch, as does Scarlett and the rest of the all star cast, the destruction of a civilazation that is truly Gone with the Wind. For everyone who loves the Old South, for anyone who loves a good book. Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind truly touches her readers, and makes one unforgettable novel."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I finally read this book years after seeing the motion picture. I fell in love with the characters and found my sympathies and compassion straining towards those I hadn't imagined I could feel anything for... Rhett knew what he was getting into, yet he loved Scarlet despite all her fall-backs and the knowledge he'd always be in another man's shadow. Rhett and Melanie were my favourite characters because they were both strong people who had the courage to love. I agree this book could be seen as racist, yet I also believe it is a historical novel in some parts which does justice to the Southerners side of the story. Yes, none of us agree with slavery. However, those were the times and that's how life was. Margaret Mitchell is being true. She displays the sympathies of the time her book is set. Judging it by modern standards of racism is the same as judging Shakespeare by modern political correctness. You can't. I belive this is a beautiful book and a beautiful love story. I encourage anyone with an open mind and a compassionate heart to read it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is absolutely the best.

She's got spunk and sprit!Melanie is such a sweet charachter! Rhett is imposible, but hysericaly funny! This book takes you through 12 years of Scarlett's life. It is funny, touching, and very real.

I recomended this book to any one!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is a very interesting one. Me being 14 years old, I didn't think I was going to like it at all because I'm not the fondest person of reading. But I found it very interesting, and easy to follow most of the time. It took me back to the time of the Civil War, and I felt I was actually there. I would recommand this book to amyone. Especially ones that are interested in Historical-Ficiton."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Scarlett O'Hara is the ultimate survivor. She has more inner strength and passion than any man or woman in the story except, of course, for Rhett Butler. &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; is the kind of book that you don't just read; you actually live the story, and when you finish reading the last page, you are bereft because you miss the characters so much. The characters are so clearly defined you feel that you know them. The story of the finely detailed lives of every single character, told against the background of some of the most romantic, disburbing, and turbulent years of American history, is unparalled. It is a great tribute to Margaret Mitchell that her only published work is loved and revered by so many. Anyone who thinks he knows the story of &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; from seeing the movie is sadly mistaken. This story MUST BE READ to be truly appreciated!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I not only have one dog earred copy of this book, I have two dog earred copies of this book on my nightstand. What a great book! Inspiring, thoughtful and interesting all at that same time. Yes, there are racist elements and sterotypical themes (the use of the \\"n\\" word is discusting and offensive and the view that the slaves were \\"Happy\\" was absolutely discusting). The issue of slavery was sugar-coated - the slaves were never depicted as being human beings with thoughts and feelings - they were just charactures meant to serve their Caucasian \\"masters\\". I enjoyed reading about the historical aspect of the Civil War. The characters of Scarlett and Rhett do not pretend to be something they are not - both are shrewd, focused, fiesty. Is Scarlett a spoiled little brat? Yes, of course she is, but somehow the author makes you want to root for her in the end because Scarlett fights for what she wants and never gives up. I think those are admirable qualities for any person to have.I agree with other posts that there was no reason for a sequel(s). The sequel really served no purpose other than to confirm what (most) of us already knew or hoped - that Scarlett and Rhett would end up together anyway."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I think everyone either loves or hates this book-so here I'm just going to say that I love this book, and I really believe it is one of the finest novels ever written. Yes, it portrays black slaves as their owners saw them in the Civil war-as inferior people. But would it really have been historical fiction if it had been any other way? This is not just a novel about Scarlet and Rhett Butler-this is a book about the pre-civil war way of life in the South and the way the real southerners, the ones who lost their slaves and plantations and had to make a major adjustment on their viewpoints on race, lived. Scarlet and Rhett and Melony and Ashley-they are some of the best written characters ever created. And no, you shouldn't be able to understand their mindset. They lived a hundred and fifty years ago and no one today has a mindset like that. Good historical fiction should always put you in a mindset that it hard to understand and relate to-because otherwise it's just a character in the past with a modern mindset.Read this book if you want to know true history. The way the war is portrayed is gruesome and terrible, but like a car wreck you can't look away. The writing shows the true effect it has on the lives it touched and the horrible way it changed and damaged all the people who lived through it. It is fascinating, impeccably written as far as the historical facts go, and also romantic and enjoyable. I read this book every year and every time I love it. If you like historical fiction, read this book. If you like history, read this book. Even if you think this book is raciest and terrible, read the book. Understand a different viewpoint on history.Besides, the author was not a raciest at all. This is FICTION folks.This is the ultimate historical fiction, and every one should read it. From page one you will be trapped.So much more than five stars."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Having just watched the movie recently after many years, I realized anew how wonderful the book is in comparison! Scarlett is more than just a money-hungry b****, Rhett is *much* more than the wimp who kept telling her he loved her in the movie, etc.I love GWTW because it's one of the few books that remains true to its characters. A happy ending was never possible for Rhett and Scarlett, because she saw him as more scoundrel than soul mate until the very end. He put up with *more* than enough from her before his love gave out, and he hid that love from her except on two memorable occasions.This is an interesting portrait of the South, and in turn, of Marget Mitchell herself. The racism in this novel never bothered me, because she was simply seeing life through the filter of her own life and experiences. Things were so different back then; how can anyone judge from today's perspective?I'd recommend this book to anyone. I read it first when I was 11 years old, but so much of the adult content and nuances went over my head that I wouldn't recommend this to children."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With The Wind is no doubt THE classic Civil War novel. However, the major characteristic that enables it to achieve its greatness also condemns Scarlet to a life of unrequited love and dooms her potential for happiness with Rhett. That attribute is that it is written entirely from the woman's viewpoint.The perspective is a strength because it permits the author to vividly portray the destruction of Southern society better than any battlefield-centered novel could. Regrettably, it also leaves the author, and therefore Scarlet as well, incapable of understanding the male characters. They are merely personalities that fade in-and-out of the background to shape the narrative. While they are characters that can stand up off the page and cast a shadow, there is no tone or timbre in their images.For example, Rhett notes that he was nearly killed stealing the horse to get Scarlet out of Atlanta before it was burned. But Mitchell does not describe the theft. Therefore, Scarlet (and Mitchell herself) cannot appreciate Rhett's ordeal or gain true insight into his character.In another instance the novel mentions that Rhett fought at the battle of Franklin. What Mitchell does NOT tell the reader is that Franklin was probably the bloodiest defeat of a Confederate army in the entire war. For Southern arms its horrors are unmatched by any of the better known battles in Virginia or elsewhere. Mitchell fails to narrate this experience and thereby misses yet another opportunity understand and appreciate Rhett.In short, since Mitchell herself failed to share much of Rhett's (or any man's) experiences, the chances that Scarlet could find true love were as slim as an Apache Indian getting elected Pope. Mitchell and Scarlet sought only to be understood and not to understand."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book has permanently damaged my brain cells.

I'm not saying that there weren't good moments back in Antebellum days, but let's be realistic.

Mrs. Mitchell really captured the whole Cival War theme and added a ruthless heroine to the amazing plot to make it even MORE addictive. It tells the story of a woman with gumption, as she called it, spirit, pride, and an everlonging love for Ashley Wilkes. People say it is a racist and sexist book but, in truth, the opinions and views of the characters were how the Southerners thought in the Old South. She wrote about a dream and a mystery that did not survive but was the setting of a love so passionate and endearing that it cannot be described. It told the tale of Knights and their Ladies Fair, of master and of slave. I, personally, thought that the sequel was just as good but it did not give Scarlett the same ruthless qualities. But we must cut Mrs. Ripley some slack, it would be nearly impossible to equal a book as great as GWTW. The plot and characters were simply amazing. Scarlett, the conniving and strong woman that the book focuses on. Rhett, the lover and third husband to Mrs. O'Hara who loved Scarlett so much that it was almost unreal. Melanie Wilkes, the only true friend to Scarlett who was a true gentlewoman with a sense of polite gumption. And then there was Ashley Wilkes, the poor soul that was crushed when the war ended and a person who loved Scarlett dearly but could not and would not abandon his wife and child for society honor. These were the characters that sculpted the greatest love story ever told. It was a Civilization GONE WITH THE WIND."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Fast shipment!!! Great Product! Can't wait to watch the movie again.

It is powerful and filled with completely three dimensional characters. It follows the struggles of Scarlett O'Hara through the harsh realities that women faced during the war and the determination not to starve and to rebuild her life after the fighting ended. Scarlett is a very strong woman-forthright and levelheaded and stubbornly practical. She is a product of the hardships she had to overcome in order to keep her family and herself alive. No, she isn't a likeable character. But it is her flaws that make her endearing. Melanie is a perfect angel and my favorite character. She seems weak on the surface, but she is the foundation for everyone around her. It is her quiet strength that helps everyone stand on their own two feet. You can't help but love her. This book will live in my mind for a long time.

There is really nothing that this reviewer can think of to match the intensity and dynamics between a temperamentally-suited couple such as Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. The author, Margaret Mitchell, whose own life story is extremely interesting, leaves us at the end of her magnificent saga to determine in the mind of Scarlett as perhaps those of other readers, whether she is going to be resigned to a life of long regrets, or forge ahead 'Tomorrow' in search of her true love. A brilliant portrayal of war and passion between a man and a woman as Old Dixie goes up in flames. One of the best and enduring American love stories ever, Margaret Mitchell hailing from the South, wrote from her heart and about what she knew at the time while never pretending to be an intellect or an historian. And, to think that a vexed Mitchell would not have agreed to make such a splendid contribution to American literature if a friend of hers had not been overheard saying: 'Peggy is too silly to write a book!'."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"My purchase arrived on time and in the condition advertised.

Seeing that it was the 75th anniversary of the book, I decided to pick it up again. I am so glad I did. I didn't remember much about the book or movie after all these years.Mitchell did a fantastic job of describing people and settings. The story is about romance, family, survival, loss and determination. The characters are presented as real people with both good and bad points. Scarlett is manipulative and selfish for the most part but also loyal to her family when times are hard. Melanie is ever so sweet and innocent but we also see she is smarter than she first appears. Ashley is book smart and brave on the battlefield but is stuck in following the rules of conduct he has been taught his whole life. Rhett can be selfish and mean but deep down he really cares about people.I have lived in Georgia all my life. I grew up near Macon, where Sherman's troops marched. My 7th grade Georgia History teacher was a huge Civil War buff and made sure we learned more than just what was in the classroom history book. We saw the places the troops fought, we heard the stories handed down through the generations of the war, we read newspaper articles from that time period. Most of us were descended from people who experienced the war in their backyard. Often historical novels have twisted facts to fit the story, but the historical and geographical details of this book are accurate.For the critics who say this book is racist, you need to understand it is based on one view point of the south at that time. Not all Southerners owned slaves, very few owned plantations the size of the fictional Tara. Many slaves were mistreated, and of course owning another person is wrong. Rich whites did look down on poor whites. Whites did look down on blacks. But that is what happened at the time. The book isn't glorifying racism. It is just describing how a rich white family saw things during the 1860's in Georgia.Also, many of the men fighting were not slave owners but were just trying to protect their family. They did what most of us would do if we felt someone was coming to hurt and kill our families. Lincoln didn't set out to free the slaves. His main objective was to preserve the country as one entity."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"One of the best novels I've ever read. Margaret Mitchell has a way of bringing the reader into a tumulus period in the United States history. Near 1000 pages but easy to read and informative to what Southerners went through.

My favorite book is Gone With the Wind. The Main characters are Scarlett O'Hara, Ashley Wilkes (BOY), and Melanie Hamilton. Since Scarlett is mensioned more often, we'll call her the mainest character. Scarlett is selfish, arrogant, hypocrative, and just down right mean!In this story, Scarlett is in love with Ashley. Ashley is to marry his cousin, Melly,( Sick right?), even though he loves Scarlett. Though Scarlett tries to make him jealous by marrying other men, Ashley stays loyal to his frail wife. Then, Scarlett, after 2 marriges that ended in the husband's death, comes upon a broad-backed, strong, handsome, rich, Charlestonian man. In the end, Scarlett ends up with her 3rd husband, leaving her with 2 children from previous marriges, one dead child, no friends, a large house, and oodles of money! Isn't this what she's wanted?Although this story is from evil Scarlett's point of view, it's still a wonderful story full of action, romance, sad and happy times, and hilarious scenes that don't quite seem to fit. Scarlett does the most hilarious things to get Ashley to notice her and he does many in return. I think that this book should be for 8th grade and up. If you're a boy you have to LOVE romance to like this and ladies don't need to be any personality or like any types of books, because there's things for all appeal.CAUTION: This book may lead to much dictionary research and much more study of the Civil War!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is a story about the life of a spoiled, selfish woman, Scarlett, going through the civil war period. It gives you an understanding of south's point of view. Several reviewers complained that it is racist. I would agree with those people but I don't like reading books that I agree with all the time. I found it valuable to try to understand what motivated the south to fight to preserve slavery. It seemed Mitchell was almost trying to defend slavery; if this offends and upsets you, then perhaps this may not be an enjoyable book for you.The character development is outstanding in this book. I constantly found myself comparing the book's characters with people I know. I've read many Michener books, which are also long historical fictions. I enjoy his books a lot, but this was far better than any of his books due primarily to her excellent character development.This book will stay with me forever."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This will always be my all-time favourite book. The most sumptuous and vivd imagery. Such intriguing and authentic characters. And of course Scarlett is one of the most fascinating women in literary history precisely because she is so ahead of her time and dared to be different. I just love her though I certainly don't like her much!As much as I adore the movie as well, particularly the exquisite Vivien Leigh, it doesn't capture even half the richness of the novel.This is one book I re-read every few years and continue to find new elements to fascinate every time."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I was out of non-fiction and had to settle for a novel, so why not the most famous of all? A smart move! I've read many historical accounts of the Civil War from many perspectives: The North, the South, the general, the private, the battle, the location, the time period,, and there is even one from the point of view of a horse! This is Scarlett O'Hara's view from her plantation, Tara, outside of Atlanta. What a refreshing perspective! The story is grand and Mitchell's graphic style keeps the images flashing onto every page. Yes, Scarlett is a bitch, but that just makes her all the more desirable. Yes, this is a \\"girl's book,\\" as was often pointed out to me, but guys can show their feminine side while reading of General Sherman laying waste to Georgia! A tip: See the movie first, it's a good introduction to the book. I read the book first and then saw the movie.

I wish I had Rhett Butler - I'd treat him right!! At the end of the book, just like the end of the movie, I ended up with tears running hopelessly down my cheeks.In addition to the adventures of a spirited young woman from Georgia, Scarlett also reveals much truth about the devastation witnessed in Georgia throughout the war and during the terrible years of Reconstruction.It's a gem to be treasured, and read over again."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Margaret Mitchell presents characters whose depth is astonishing, and depictions of varied relationships that can reach the reader on numerous levels. This is not merely a love story or glorified version of a tragic historical period, but an intense treatment of much of the paradox in human nature.Regarding the racial issue - I would say that the depiction of blatant racism in this book is all the more powerful because everything is told from the Southern aristocrat's point of view. The characters need to believe, and have convinced themselves, that they are benevolent and affectionate towards their slaves! Yet they refer to these same people as &quot;apes&quot; without seeing their own horrifying stance. When Melanie, supposedly the soul of kindness, tells Ashley that, if they move North, they cannot let Beau attend school and &quot;have pickaninnies in his class,&quot; it shows the horror of racism just as clearly as if the reader had seen the miserable lot of the slaves.Scarlett, certainly no heroine and one with no principles who'd like merely the reputation for being a &quot;great lady,&quot; is a most intriguing character. As Margaret Mitchell makes clear in many references, we have here one who is incapable of being at all analytical. (Except for Rhett, and, to some extent, Gerald, only Mammy can see through Scarlett's facade.) The Ashley she loves is a creation of her imagination - and it is interesting that, for all that she despises Melanie, the traits Melanie has which Scarlett most derides are very much the same as those in the Ellen that she idolises.The book has so many fascinating characters that one could read it ten times and still find one has only scratched the surface. Those like myself, who cannot imagine too many settings they'd like to enter less than the &quot;old South,&quot; can find it interesting to explore the situation of those who find their entire world has collapsed around them."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With The Wind is the best book ever written short of the Bible.I have heard people say it's rascist- my opinion is why sugarcoat everything that happened in the Civil War? I think there was rascism at the time the book takes place. The book was written with exhaustive historical truth- if you make it sound like blacks ran around in tuxedos, then you undermine their suffering. And make the book unreal.People did suffer, but not all slaves suffered.If you're looking for a superbly written romance, if you are smart enough to see through people, you will love GWTW. IF you can't, you won't be able to see how Scarlett, shrewd, hard, proud, stubbern, is also smart, learns how to yield, proud as a virtue, and persistant. She complains and dreams the whole time she saves Tara but through sheer grit she does it and saves the people on it.You maybe cannot see how Rhett Butler loves this unseeing woman with complete passion, devotion- 'as much as a man can love a woman'. How the dishonest blockade runner goes crazy when his adored little girl dies. How he is a real daddy to Scarlett's other fatherless children.Read this book--- it is all about people. Anytime we can see ourselves in something, with a small sense of guilt we indenify and fall in love with it.GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I loved this book! The most amazing thing about GONE WITH THE WIND (and there are many) are the beautiful characters that Mitchell creates. I felt pain, and laughter right along with Scarlett. All the characters seemed so real to me, and I grew to love them so. Mitchell is so brave to have not made a person like Melanie as the main character, a person that everyone would love. Instead she forces the reader to fall in love with a selfish, stubborn, mean, hateful person like Scarlett. Scarlett is definetly my favorite literary figure, she is by no means a perfect person, but you see parts of yourself in her, parts that you may not want to see, and that makes her all the more real. True to form, the most interesting characters in the book are the people with more sinister sides to themselves. To compliment Scarlett, there is of course, Rhett Butler. Every episode he was in came to life, just by the addition of his witty back handed comments, and his insightfullness to realize just how unscrupulous he and others are. Every diolouge is a joy, be it anyone from Prissy, to Rhett speaking, the words fly fromt the page, and never get boring. The turns that the book takes never fail to surprise. Once I got into this book, I couldn't put it down. The most important thing to remember while reading it though, is to take the book as it is. In parts, tales of the blacks lording over the whites, and the views of slaves, are hard to swallow, and painful to read. And they are not entirely accurate. But this was written by a southerner, in a different time, about an EXTREMELY different time, so all of these things must be taken in stride, and read with caution. Over all, this is a book that which will tear at your heart, make you cry with laughter, and, even make you fall in love with an ignorant, racist, Southern Belle."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone with the wind is an all time classic. This book is about a girl named Scarlett O'Hara who has a wonderful life until war breaks out and her world is turned upside down.She has to learn the basics to surviving but it comes with difficulty. Along the way she loses two husbands but has one final one which lasts. His name is Rhett Buttler. He helps her become a rich woman again. But is she truly happy? You will have to read to find out. Through all of this there is a moral which is, don't take what you have for granted and apprciate what you have because one day you may not have it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is by far the greatest love story of all time. The ignorant Scarlett O'hara is accustomed to getting her way all the time, but suddenly her once so stable, cushioned life falls out from between fingers. Choosing which dress to wear to balls used to be the issue, now Scarlett must struggle to find each meal, not only for herself but also for the family she supports.

This book if the timeless tale of a Confederate blockader and a fiesty Southern belle."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With the Wind will totally blow you away, it surely blew me away. This book is a classic love story. It totally draws you in with the push-pull relationship between the main characters, Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara. It makes you want to scream at Scarlett because she just pushes Rhett away unknowingly, and Rhett is trying to pull her into love with money and luxurious clothes. This book is a good book because the events could happen in our time, marry for money and make your selves misreable, but who knows how it could end. If you enjoy books that make you throw them down in frustration, but pick them back up again just to find out what happens next, this book is definitely good for you. If you enjoy this book or were unhappy with the ending, breeze through Scarlett, the sequel to Gone with the Wind. Gone With the Wind is an outstanding book and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspense and love all mixed together in a great book."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"i think this book is wonderful!i've always liked Gone with the Wind,but when my mom bought it for me,i looked at it and it was so huge,that it took me a long time to finally start reading it.but when i did,not even a bomb could of stopped me from putting it down.i read it every time a got a chance to(between commercials,before school,after school,from 6 to midnight)i even stopped doing everything else i used to do just so i could read it.it is so well written,that you know the characters in and out,even though you never met them.i knew what the characters were like,but just like in real life,there was just so much to know about them,that it's impossible to describe a character.this is the first book and movie that has ever made me cry.when,finally,at the end of the book,scarlett realized that she loves rhett, and not ashley,it's too late and the sad ending(at that time) seemed worse than anything i've ever had to think about.at first,i was mad at three people:rhett,scarlett,and ashley(if you can believe it).rhett-because he didn't tell scarlett that he loved her after they were married(at least not enought for scarlett)and scarlett is too childish to realize that all those things that he for her and her children is because he loves her.scarlett-because her stupid pride stopped her from telling him that she loves him in time and for not telling him that she was sorry for anything that she did or said.and ashley-for realizing and telling scarlett that he doesn't love her way too late.but,in spite of all this,i love this book and i will recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Margaret Mitchell's evergreen saga of the Civil War era has become a kind of cultural icon. This sprawling novel was her sole work, but what a book! Two of the leading protagonists, Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, are perhaps the best known fictional characters in American literature. The saintly Melanie Wilkes and her reticent husband Ashley are also widely recognized.Northern writers have yet to produce a comparable work. Mitchell's novel plugs into the antebellum nostalgia of the south. Even though her writing arguably does not meet the high standards of gifted southern writers (such as Flannery O'Connor and company), her wonderful narrative skills continue to make this book an enduring best-seller, decade after decade.As generations of American booklovers will testify, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a highly rewarding, romantic must-read."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Hello! I read this book because I felt like I had to( It's a classic) and I did think it would be extremely sentimental, soap opera- like and, in Germany where I live we say KITSCHIG. But after a few pages I realised that it was exciting, and I didn't put it down all day. The one thing I disliked was the Ku- Klux- Clan scenes. They all apreciated this terrible, violent clan. This made me angry.Scarlett is a great charakter. She's not sympathatic, but when finally her beloved ones die and turn away from her, you feel sorry for her. A must-have-read!!!!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone with the Wind is the most amazing novel ever! I read it in 8th grade for a school project and was so engrossed all 1,024 pages took me just two weeks! Living in the \\"North\\", I had never really thought about how hard it was for the \\"South\\" because I assumed they brought it on themselves. This book really opened my eyes and I'm glad it did. I love it so much that this year ... I read it again, just for fun, during the school year and it only took me two weeks again!! I highly recomend this novel to anyone and everyone in the world!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I am not sure how anyone can read the book and not see the love story. It may come near the end, but yes it is there. Gone With the Wind is one of the best books ever written. It incorporates action, romance, drama... I often find myself using silly facts that you learn from the book. Gone With the Wind gives the modern public a look at what life was like for a Southern plantation owner during the Civil War, and no book will ever challenge the status Gone with the Wind has achieved."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book had everything I like to read about in it. From the vivacious Scarlett, to the loyal Melanie, to the blatant Rhett, the soft Ashley, and all the others, this book has it all. It includes comedy, tragedy, history, emotion, and many other things. My favorite character was Melanie. Scarlett drove me nuts. You get so pulled into the book that I actually stopped reading for a while because Scarlett was eing so mean to Melanie!! Definately a must read in the life of a true gentleperson."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is one of those impossible-to-put-down sagas that everyone should read. It is a perfect read in the summer-nearly 1000 pages to keep you reading throughout those long, lazy days. &quot;Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized it&quot;...from the first lines of the book we are enchanted. And the passionate, emotional story of Scarlett O'Hara is the story of a how a war changed Scarlett's life, the story of how a pampered Southern belle became a woman changed by terrible circumstances. It is a love story, a story of one person, and story of Civil War-era South.There are a couple of key things that make this book the classic that it is. First, Margaret Mitchell really is one of those &quot;born&quot; storytellers. She is wonderful with description, and makes us &quot;feel&quot; things, yet seems to know exactly how much description is too much or too little. She effortlessly creates a seamless story taking place over many years, with never a dull moment on any one of the 954 pages. That alone is enough to make a novel &quot;stand out&quot;.&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is also filled with vibrant characters. Margaret Mitchell's effective descriptions and keen insights into the minds of each character make this book even better. There is Scarlett, whose stubborn streak, determined mind, and desperate love we see and identify with; there is Melanie, sweet, trusting, and fiercely loyal (she happens to be my favorite character); there is Rhett, the puzzling, reckless, and mysterious blockader who is much like Scarlett; and there is Ashley, the one love that Scarlett cannot have.The only thing about this book that ISN'T absolutely perfect is the racism. Like many Southerners at that time, Margaret Mitchell had a very biased opinion of black people and their place in society. It was disturbing to read descriptions such as &quot;their monkey-like faces&quot; and &quot;darkies need to be treated like children&quot; in this book. However, I think this was in the book because that was how it WAS in the South then, not necessarily because the author thought it SHOULD BE that way. Racism is certainly wrong, but that was a part of the Southern way of life before, during, and after the Civil War.&quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a wonderfully captivating book filled with characters that we can all identify with. Read it and you'll certainly see why this book, first published in 1936, is still popular today."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"It's racist and sexist, and some parts drag on a little too much, yet it made my heart flutter with delight. I love it when books make you feel like this one made me. It started off slowly, but 200 pages into it I was hooked.Scarlett, she's self absorbed and as thick as a brick, but some how loveable. Rhett, why he's condescending yet somehow so wise and sexy. And sweet Melly, while she is a goody-two-shoe, she is never annoying, quiet loveable. She has an inner strength. The characters come alive on the pages.Any book that makes me cry is a good book. Oh, and did I cry! THere were parts where I was blubering for ages. In other parts, my heart was racing and I couldn't read the page fast enough.Well, this book offically rocks my socks, and is one of my favourite books, ahead of Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice. Why oh why didn't I read this earlier?!? 6/5 stars!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone Wind the Wind is famous for many reasons. First, its characters are so deep and certainly born with human flaws. The plot is amazing; it is neither cliche or \\"dumb\\". Mitchell has done an excellent job in her historical research - it's as if you were really there in that place and era!Scarlett and Rhett are some of the best characters in all literature. Some may hate Scarlett, although I don't know why. She is unique, intelligent, beautiful, and knows what she wants. You can't blame a pretty face for knowing she is pretty. And besides, she is not so superficial or mean as one may immediately suspect - Scarlett is a three-dimensional character who learns many lessons in the end. She is certainly amusing and vain, and you have to love her for it!Although I did not like the ending at first, it now occurs to me that it was reasonable. Scarlett has made a lot of mistakes, and you can't blame Rhett for not wanting to put up with it all anymore.I know most people will enjoy this book, and it is not racist. It appears to be to the ignorant mind, but you have to understand that people spoke and behaved in such ways at this era. You cannot have black people and whites living in harmony during the Civil War, 1860's, right? This is a historical novel. And besides, doesn't anyone remember that Scarlett mentions how her black nanny is always there for her, is trustworthy and good? She does not disrespect African Americans."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I read over 150 books a year, and I always have read a lot. I don't go for romance at all, but this book is so much more than that. The writing is fantastic. The vocabulary is diverse. The imagery. The characters. The plots within plots. You are there. You know the characters intimately. This is the most amazing work of fiction I have ever laid eyes on.I'm not big on re-reading things, but I've read this novel many, many times. Buy it. Read it. Treasure it.If you're \\"offended by the racism,\\" please try to keep in mind that political correctness will destroy your education. And whether or not this book is racist (can a _book_ be racist?) does nothing to diminsh from its genius."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"There were times in this book when I would be so absorbed in the story that I lost all track of time and would be surprised to discover that things had changed about in my house because everyone else was continuing on with real life.This book is so vividly portrayed. Sometimes you can almost feel the heat, hear the flies buzzing, smell the smoke from the burning buildings, hear ladies in fancy shoes schlooching through the mud.This is an epic classic. The story follows Scarlet, a hard-bitten-or-is-she Southern belle, as she goes about the process of living just before, during, and after the Civil War. It's an amazing book for any number of reasons. One, a woman writes about war and just about blows the socks off the idea that only men can do that. Two, nearly every character you meet is a well-developed person, not just some caricature. Three, details of life like cooking, nursing babies (yes, breastfeeding...), eating, dressing, flirting, dancing, everything is there. I'm surprised there isn't any toilet scene, so much is covered here. Four, tragedies of every sort occur, from Scarlet and Rhett's love story to Scarlet and Ashley's love story to Scarlet and Melanie's friendship to the loss of Bonnie. So many things happen.If you ever thought that the Civil War was a right and just war and that the South got what it deserved, consider reading this just for the opportunity to challenge your conventions and long-held beliefs."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"&quot;There was a Land of Cavaliers and Cotton Fields called the Old South. . .Here in this pretty world Gallantry took its last bow. . .Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered. A Civilization Gone with the Wind.&quot;What other words could more perfectly describe the saga of Gone with the Wind?I am always astounded when I think that the 1024 pages of Gone with the Wind was Margaret Mitchell's first book! How can a green author roll so much passion, hope, strength, love, steadfastness, despair and humanity into a single novel? I blows me away, no pun intended!As reviewer kitam57 said &quot;I love Scarlett and yet at the same time I want to wring her neck.&quot; I totally concur, I admire Scarlett for her determination, her dedication to her family, her love of the land and her uniqueness. I'm more than half Irish and I too have a love for the land I live on just like Scarlett developed for Tara, as her father said &quot;It's the only thing that lasts&quot; and truly, even when Scarlett had nothing else she still had Tara and was willing to do anything, even prostitute herself to Rhett in order to keep it. She wasn't afraid to go out and break many of the social conventions of the time, like peddling lumber while pregnant, in order to take care of her family and loved ones. But at the same time, I HATE her treatment of Rhett, Scarlett had one giant blindspot by the name of Ashley Wilkes. Although, Ashley did lead her on, he never would say that he didn't love her and only loved Mellie. Scarlett clung to this hope, she pretended to hate Rhett the whole time and really deep down she knew she always liked him. I just can't understand why Scarlett thought she loved Ashley so much, he was dreamer, lost in books, music and Europe while Scarlett was practical, living for each day and facing up to harsh realities without a second thought.Rhett was always hopelessly in love with Scarlett too. It breaks my heart every time I see him try in the book and she just blows him off. When he was released from prison he ran straight to Scarlett to make sure she had enough money to keep Tara, when Scarlett tells him she's pregnant again he's so happy, and when he thinks Scarlett will die I cry too when he is nearly crazy with grief and sobbing into Mellie's skirts! There was still a chance for them later if she had just opened up and admitted that they had both been wrong! And that &quot;hungry&quot; look of Rhett's that Scarlett was always a bit scared of, it was really Rhett's starvation for love. He was watching her, waiting and hoping that she might show him some sign of love, as he said he wanted when they first danced together. Rhett's weakness was Scarlett and his need for her love, for once in his life he wanted someone to TRULY love him, not look down on him! And then tragedy enters in.Rhett of course has his scoundrel tendancies, but I admire him also for his rebellion against social conventions, he wasn't tied in by stupid traditions. he was more thinking than the rest, in that respect he and Ashley were more alike. Rhett and Ashley both knew what a war would do to the South and what a disadvantage they were at with troups and artillery. As Rhett said: &quot;I seem to be spoiling everyone's brandy, cigars and DREAMS of victory.&quot; Rhett's humanity always shows through in his admiration of Melanie, she was the one person he always treated with absolute sincerity and genuine respect.There also is the war aspect, Margaret Mitchell seems to have examined every tiny detail of the the South both during and after the war. She knows of the hardships, devastation, the starvation, the struggle, the indignities and humiliation of Reconstruction. One must always remember that just because people owned slaves, it didn't mean they were all bad people. Some were, we all know of the atrocious horrors that slaves suffered but, Margaret Mitchell shows the almost family-like relationships some people shared with their slaves. They do talk down to them and treat them as children, but slaves were not always educated at the time and therefore some didn't know how to act any differently. Mammy however is the perfect example of the smartest woman in the whole book! She always knew what was going on and loved Scarlett as her own child no matter what depths Scarlett sank to.I love the movie as well, Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable were Scarlett and Rhett brought to life, it's like they were born to play those roles! My only complaint is that they should have shown Scarlett's children with Charles and Frank in the film! However, I will always applaud the scene of Scarlett and Rhett dancing around in black amongst all the other colorful people. They are declaring their defiance and I completely admire that! In fact, I love the story of Gone with the Wind so much that I named my horse India after Ashley's sister. Next one I should name Scarlett! :)All in all, Gone with the Wind is a book for all time, no matter what your genre of book is, you will be able to appreciate it for the many dimensions of it and the ultimate truth, history, life lessons and basic human tenacity it portrays. No matter who you are, where you live or how old you are."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"What can I say? I am so glad to finally and proudly join the GONE WITH THE WIND readers. I have tried reading this book for years. I am SO glad I put nose to grindstone. Once I got into the story I was reading every chance I could get. And now that I am done, I am rereading snippets ... not willing to let the story go yet.What a miraculous book, a miraculous accomplishment, a masterful writer. The writing is eerily alive. Simply a brilliant brilliant work.The book is very true to the times. I have read many first hand accounts of that era, including hundreds of Slave Narratives and Margaret Mitchell told it like it was. To say this book is racist is just plain stupidity.We shouldn't read history because it's just not nice, it's just not the way we would do things, us being such enlightened souls.Waaah. Waah.How stupid. This book is about another place and time. DUH. Do a search on Black slave owners and Black confederates if you dare.As far as the human relationships in this book I rode a roller coaster.I personally loved the loyalty shown between slave and owners. &quot;they are part of our family&quot; It's true to the way it really was except the slave narratives are even more emotional and dramatic stating over and over &quot;I just want to go to heaven and see my mastus and missus again. They are the best on the whole world&quot; It's incredible. I am not talking about the selected slave narratives telling all manner of horror. I am talking about he Federal Works project that talked to actual ex-slaves and their families.As for Rhett, I had a hard time liking him. He was dashing at first but his &quot;career&quot; during the war turned me off. His fine clothes and such while people starved bothered me.... But then he proposed to Scarlet and he was so romantic and I started to really like him. I even liked him in the parlor scene when he was drunk and tortured over Scarlet's wandering heart.But by the end I didn't like him much again. I thought it was really scoundrelish of him to simply say &quot;I'm tired of it, I'm tired of you&quot; Frankly my dear I don't give a damn.Him and Scarlet had both sunk so low. I didn't like their long violent fights. It really pained me. When Scarlet was sick ... oh that broke my heart how Rhett cried into Mellie's skirt.If only... If only ...That is a very difficult part to swallow with this book ... and yet it is still a &quot;right&quot; end.I loved Ashley for his Southerness and Melanie was a beautifully wrought character. I wish Scarlet would have proclaimed her love for her more surely though. They could have lain on the bed and recounted all they had been through together.This is not just a book. It is an experience.I am SO glad that Margaret Mitchell wrote this book, a book from the South. I hope it remains in print. A people and a way of life that is Gone With The Wind will always deserve to be heard and understood."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Why didn't I read this magnificent book before I was 49 years old?Perhaps because it tends to be classified in the &quot;historical romance&quot; genre ... because it was a vast popular success ... followed by a blockbuster movie ... it isn't taken seriously as a classic. It wasn't on academic reading lists, while works such as William Faulkner's &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; and Carson McCullers' &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; were. But it should be.Probably GWTW couldn't have been written at any other time than it was, or by anyone else. When Margeret Mitchell was born in 1900, many living adults had been through the war and reconstruction years, and were there to tell her about it. Hers was the last generation to grow up before radio, when the oral tradition remained vital and dominant. Yet, as a child of the suffragist era and somewhat of a social rebel (engaged once, married twice, etc.), Mitchell's feisty personality is expressed through Scarlett O'Hara with rich comic effect. I frequently burst out loud laughing at Scarlett's outrageously self-serving rationalizations, and the scandalous breaches of etiquette she perpetrates. This is anything but melodrama or bodice-ripper romance. It is sophisticated social comedy, as well as historical drama and tragedy.Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, and Ashley and Melanie Wilkes endure in cultural memory to this day because Margaret Mitchell takes us into their world so convincingly that they seem real, with all their strengths, weaknesses, vanities and foibles. She has an unerring ear for dialogue. The black servants are vivid characters, pictured sympathetically as generally speaking their minds and being their authentic selves, in contrast to the ego-preserving dissembling and self-delusion of the whites.Despite the entangling of Scarlett's life with Rhett, Ashley and Melanie throughout the story, old Mammy -- the matron of the servants -- is the character who graces both the first and last pages of the book along with Scarlett. She is the only one who never betrays or leaves Scarlett; who stands with her till the end.Books about the Civil War era and its aftermath must number in the tens of thousands. But none brings it alive and lets you see it, feel it and remember it as GWTW does. It is a masterpiece, a monumental achievement.What does GWTW mean to me? At my grandmother's gravesite in East Texas, nearby tombstones cite the deceased's CSA affiliation ... 1st N.C. Cavalry, and so forth. These old soldiers migrated west after the war, just as Margaret Mitchell describes. They were my great-grandparents' generation. Margaret Mitchell brought their world alive to me as no one else ever did or could.Thank you, Margaret Mitchell, for your magnificent life's work."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I can't belive i made it to 30 without reading the novel!

Scarlett O'Hara might be self-absorbed, provincial, and manipulative, but she also displays courage, resourcefulness, and determination. Gone with the Wind is more than just a love story; it chronicles Scarlett's growth from a spoiled planter's daughter to the head of a household struggling to survive the ravages of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Mitchell provides a fascinating depiction of the psychology of the South, which plays a critical role in Scarlett's story. To thrive, she finds she must alienate the remnants of her former life and accept the presence of the Northern invaders. Throughout Scarlett wrestles with her feelings for Ashley Wilkes, a noble refugee from the genteel past, and Rhett Butler, a scalawag building his fortune from the ashes of the confederacy. Many more wonderfully drawn characters fill out this novel, which already feels somewhat compressed despite its length. It's no wonder the movie version is four hours long; the novel has too much too good to leave out!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is just one of the best books ever. I can read it over and over again. I just love the story, the characters, the history, everything!Undoubtly the best book ever written...."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"GWTW is simply the most beautifully tragic work of literary art of the 20th century. Margaret Mitchell not only recaptures a lost shadow world, but she also creates characters of enduring depth and passion. Upon analyzing the characters it is easy to see how Melanie and Scarlett represent the two natures of woman as Rhett and Ashley represent the two natures of man . This two fold nature of man and woman, depicts the spiritual, emotional, physical, and material struggle of each sex. This heart breaking tale is not so much reflective a lost romance, but reflective of the inner and environmental struggle and development of the self and all that it entails.As for the \\"sequel\\"- yes on a surface level it satisfies those who are seeking closure. But that is the problem. There is no closure and that is what the rightful author intended. It is heart breaking yes, but that in and of itself offers a deep lesson to the reader. The heartbreak emcompasses not just the lost love between Rhett and Scarlett, Scarlett and Ashley, and Scarlett and Melanie- but the heartbreak of a time lost, pride forsaken, shame never to be laid to rest, and the stark reality of future yet known.All in all this is a breathtaking tragic journey that will ravage your heart and soul. Any serious literary reader will find timeless strength in these 1000+ pages of glory had and glory lost."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I purchased several years ago, and I can't remember how many times I have read it.

And uttered by Scarlett many times throghout the book, give it a fatalistic reality. Anybody who has ever been young, in love, would fall in love with Scarlett O'Hara, the greatest heroine of all time. Her charms are many and so are her bouts of temper, her fears, her desperations, her perceptions of life. This book is simply outstanding in every aspect. Margarett Mitchelle skillfully puts Scarlett's life under the microscope and disects it ruthlessly to give you a clear picture of youth, the pride of youth which is, believe me, terrible to behold, the vanity which rules the day, the plain pigheadedness that early age has and the heartbreak that follows when youth is gone overnight and adulthood encraoches.Don't at all be scared by the lenght of the book, it is very readable. I read this book for the first time when I was 14 and still had absolutely no trouble reading it, that says a lot about its readability. For 6 days I did little else than read with urgency to disclose Scarlett's fate. The book is so splendidly written, so complete in its rendition of that age, that from cover to cover that it encloses a world that is no more and exsists only in those pages. To think that this book was actually written 73 years after the Civil War of America began in 1860, is awe-inspiring in the sense that it seems the author could have had no means about knowing that civilization, the way she does with a completeness that is all encompassing, which was destroyed in that war, had not she been a part of it, saw the sun of those times, breathed the air that blew over Atlanta (where most of the story is based) and had the notions which she shared with those people. This is writing at its pinnacle of magnificience. She staight away begins the story from the word go in a no-nonsense way. There are no lenghty introductions of any kind, no changing in time frames or point of views (we solely see Scarlett's mind in the book though the book is in the first person), no telling about events even before they happen and the retrospection , if any, comes only on the charcters parts.And a very important thing, disbelieve all that jargon about it being in the greatest love story of all time. Infact it isn't a love story at all. Of course Scarlett does fall in love and has crushes that go nowhere, but the aim of the story is not to relate a mushy love affair but what circumstances do to people, how people are changed by the deeds they perform and how thay influence each other.We watch Scarlett fall in love. We watch her love with a passion and pursue her object of desire with a ruthlessness that only extreme youth is calable of. We watch her hate, with a coolness that is chilling to observe, hatred that only can be generated by hurt pride and stained vanity.Scarlett is young and beautiful and rich and brimming with life and health, no sorrow can touch her, and she sets out to conquer the world. Why should she not have everything she wants, every petty fancy fulfilled, every man falling in love with her? We know that the world dosent let such people be, these people invite almost too much jealosy, the world is very cruel to such people. So when the world does slap her across her face, she declares war aginst the world with her head held high. And still she is not a larger than life character, its as you or I would have reacted in such a situation, when you lived in a society in which she lived, if the world in which you lived was falling apart and war arrived at your doorstep. It potrays every kind of emotion a human ever went through and in all its splendor and glory.This story is also about tumultous times. It is the story of the Old South where innocent people lived the life of kings which is only present in memory. They are invincible in their paradise of cotton plantations and tea parties, but when war cuts through their lives like a knife, you can't but feel sorry for these people whose world ceases to exsist, and they live the rest of their lives serching like children for a meaning in their life they know isn't there, for an identity that has been erased, for salvation that will never come. Their inevitable tragedy breaks your heart and set at the heart of this interwining ouilt work of humanity lies the story of Scarlett. We see how she influences people around her and is changed herself in return by what she encounters.All in all the book is a treasure, one of the greatest contributions of America to the world of fiction and a must read for all generations. I recommend this book with all my heart. Read it and you'll thank the memory of Margarett Mitchelle for creating this piece of art."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"The book I am doing a review on is Gone With the Wind. This book is by the author Margaret Mitchell. This story is about an independent teenage girl named Scarlett O'Hara who lives in Georgia before the Civil War. She is in love with a boy named Ashley, and plans to be with him but he is arranged to be married with another girl, so Scarlett makes a big plan to make him hers, but before she can do it the Civil War breaks out and complicates everything for her. The front and back cover made me want to read it. If you are a person who loves adventure, suspense, and romance, then you should definitely read this book. This book is targeted for people between the ages of 15 and 70.The good thing about this book is that it has a plot that seems at some points seem irrelevant but are actually very important to the outcome of the resolution. If the book had even more conflicts then it would be even better because the conflicts make the story nail biting like this excerpt from the book. \\"Somebody hollerin',\\" said Porky uneasily. \\"The Yankees are coming! I saw them! Down the road! The Yankees ---,\\" Another thing I like about the book is that it has Scarlett, the main character, is a perfect mix of flare and emotions like this excerpt from the book. \\"I don't want your advice,\\" yelled Scarlett. I think this book has anything that I didn't like but if there were it would probably be the way there are many characters, but it sort of makes the story better, but for me it gets me confused sometimes like in this excerpt of the book. \\"Well push Randa off you, Betsy, and hush. Now listen to me Gerald O'Hara.\\" My overall opinion off the book is that I liked it very much. I think I like it so much because it contains a plot and setting that takes place in many different locations, it's not just stationary. So again, I think you should read this book because it contains vivid vocabulary, has triumphs and downfalls that make the story better, and has takes advantage of the readers' sense of adventure, and after watch the movie."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"A simply superb novel; it has become my favorite book. People of all ages can appreciate this masterpiece; I'm 16 and I couldn't put it down (not for food, sleep, or a six and a half hour flight), my 13 year old sister loved it, my little brother cried at the end, and an elderly woman and her husband, I met on the afore mentioned flight, said to me it was one of the best books of all time. &lt;space>Even though I had seen the movie -which I also love- so I knew what was going to happen, I wept uncontrollably. This is a must have and worth the 1024 or so pages. At the conclusion of this novel, the fact that it isn't any longer is the only disapointment. Reading it is a supreme pleasure."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I agree with the hundreds...wait, millions of people over the years who've enjoyed this classic. Despite her charater not being too sympathetic, Scarlett is a real survivor and that's why we still care for her. If you haven't read the book because you already enjoyed the movie, you are really missing a lot."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Oh, how I suffer for my enjoyment of this book! When I told a prospective lover that this was my fave tome, he recoiled in white liberal revulsion, demanding if I'd read \`Roots'. The truth is that I have never read GWTW for the racism, and condemning it almost seems superfluous. I take it as read that this is a work of its time, written in the 1930s which harked back to the days of slavery and the ante-bellum South. A \`Wuthering Heights' of the Confederacy, with its two passionate leads and wishy-washy support acts. Margaret Mitchell spend ten years writing GWTW, and it's perhaps thanks to her husband John Marsh, who persuaded her to write rather than read. After all she was an Atlanta journo in the 1920s and not short of a story or two... just what to do with them. The result is a 1000 page plus commotion which spans the years and charts the travels of various types, as they wind their way from having it all to down on their uppers to getting back up again. None more so than Scarlett O'Hara, who, fed up with playing the feminine card (which she nonetheless does to the hilt), benefits from the destruction of Southern life inasmuch as she answers her true calling - to be a better businessman than the boys. For which she pays the price of emotional loss, albeit of her own daft making.MM wrote at a time when many were denied the enfranchisement that we all deserve. And like many other works of the past, she falls foul of the politically correct watershed. But ignore the broadsheet bores if you dare, and see this novel for when it was conceived. And then relish the familiar themes of survival and in love with love and you might just enjoy it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"The power of this narrative of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction period after the war is overwhelming. Scarlett O'Hara is the centerpiece of this story from the beginning to the end. It is much more than a story of love, rivalry, and misadventure. It is all that and more. It offers the reader a portrait of the Confederacy and the candid view of life there as filtered through the eyes of Scarlett. It is Melanie Hamilton and Ashley Wilkes who represent the values of the old South and the ambition of Scarlett and the cynicsm of Rhett Butler reflect the newly emerging South of the Reconstruction."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Great condition. I am really enjoying it. Can't believe it took me 68 years to finally read this."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"It was a very loooong book but really good! Usually with long books there's always a part that drags on forever but it never felt that way with this book. It always kept my interest and the ending was different and not at all what I expected, which is a good thing."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I have always been a lover of the film, but I am so glad I finally read this book. It was packed with fascinating history and a wonderful set of characters. It is a long book, but definitely worth the effort! Its epic story and beautifully written dialogue paint a picture of the Confederacy, its fall and Reconstruction. This is a story of survival and the pure gumption it takes to get ahead. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I saw the movie GWTW as a kid, but the memory faded over time. I never thought to read the book, but took it out of the library on audio CD. What a wonderful, memorable, amazing book. Scarlett, Wrett, Ashley and Melanie are extraordinary portraits, and anyone interested in US history will find much to enjoy with the story set against the Civil War.Linda Stephens audio CD narration is spot-on, painting a nuanced compelling portrait of the characters and story.So worth going beyond the film!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I wish Margaret Mitchell had written more than one book. She was a talented writer and one of the best story tellers. Love her vivid description of war scenes and dialogues. Truly a classic, a great piece of American literature!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I love this book. I love these characters. I love how it's 1,000 pages long, so you don't have to leave the amazing world depicted too soon. I love how you can curl up with this book and read it for hours on end and never come to the last page. It's so completely absorbing, so real and life-like, so undeniably painted, that it's more than classic. It's a masterpiece. I asked for this book for my Confirmation present, and I will cherish it and show it to my children and my children's children. I hope to God that this book is never forgotten. It is simply beautiful and romantic."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this long novel and have to say that I was sad when it was over. Aside from being very easy to read and an interesting story line, the settings in rural Georgia and Atlanta during the civil war provide a realistic historical feel that you don't get from reading history books on the civil war. I have since read a history book on Sherman's march to the sea and realize that the general descriptions in Gone With The Wind about what happened to the residents of Georgia are true. Whether you want a more personal insight into what life was like during the Civil War in the south, or just a really enjoyable book to read, I would highly recommend Gone With The Wind. Also, ignore some of the book covers that make this book look like a love story, it is a book of equal interest to men and women in my opinion."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Scarlett O'Hara was never intended to be the heroine in this novel, but like all dynamic characters, she took over the tale. In reality, Margaret Mitchell wrote Melanie as the heroine, and I think the fact that Melanie shines so gently throughout the tale is one of the many things about this novel that makes it exceptional.Mitchell wrote this novel because she wanted to show how different women managed to survive the American Civil War. Thus, Melanie, Scarlett, India, and Ellen. These women each coped differently to outlive the greatest war of their century in America, and the fact that Scarlett stood so high above the others is a testament to her larger-than-life validity.This novel is, and shall forever more be, my favorite piece of literature."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book has been a personal favorite of mine since I was in Elementary School. Yes, I was born a book worm with an advanced reading level. I was named for Ashley from this very book and my brother was named for Rhett so I was required to read it, but not required to like it I just happened to fall in love with Margaret Mitchell and her story. It tells so many stories in one and has such an appeal to it no wonder it is still going strong after almost 75 years. I would recommend this book to anyone, although girls seem to enjoy it more as it is told by Scarlett's point of view. Scarlett is the girl you love to hate. She is so endearing and strong but so young and naive that you want to hit her and shelter her at the same time. Rhett is a man's man and women across the world want to have him. He exudes all that is strong and masculine while being head over heels in love with Scarlett and their baby girl. Ashley is a pity case as he is torn and used. Melanie is a personal favorite of mine, like a pet kitten. She is fierce and strong with claws of steel but purrs and mews with the innocence and undying love of a newborn baby kitten. All of the characters are developed well and are all very rounded. You will get lost in this time period and forget what a cell phone is."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"At the insistence of a friend, I picked up Gone with the Wind to see what all the hubbub was about. I expected a shallow romance novel, much like the movie it spawned, complete with the longing stares and the yearning desires of a woman who has been spited by circumstance. I could not have been more surprised to find so much more.What I found was a novel that is surprisingly layered. The outermost layer, of course, is the romantic narrative many will recognize, but beneath this superficial casting resides a deeper narrative about the tragic hubris, resulting fall, and struggle to reemerge by a small class of Southern aristocrats. As this historical narrative unfolds, additional layers advance and recede in waves, each ushered in with insightful dialogue and commentary by the book's fascinating characters.At the base of their hubris, for example, is layered an adolescent confidence in the invincibility of King Cotton and the superiority of the antebellum order, which one character ridicules and one character fears will prove all too true. Surrounding their fall, their economic and political naivety retreats before scarcity, Sherman, and a struggle to survive, all of which is replaced by a remarkable perseverance that is more a testament to the antebellum order than anything before the war. As their struggle plays out in the treacherous climate of Reconstruction, it eventually turns into a modest triumph capped by tragedy and accompanied by ominous undertones of the segregated order to come.Other layers abound and while each is fascinating in its own right, together they are interwoven to present an even more fascinating and coherent telling of the most tumultuous period in American history. Rather than shallow, Gone with the Wind is exceptionally deep, its characters eminently profound, and its telling extremely satisfying."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"My mother requested this book for Christmas.

I reread it with an adult's perspective of hardships, tough knocks and suffering, and while I still don't like Scarlett, I've come away with a greater appreciation of the hardships of living in an occupied land, 19th century societal expectations of women in the U.S.; and the tumult of changing social norms from one century to the next.

It's a very long book, over a thousand pages but a good story about love and determination."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I fell in love with the movie first, so I thought i would give the book a try. For those who loved the movie, the depth of the characters and complicated feelings it brings, the book is even better. I love that it gives insight into characters that the movie doesn't have a chance to expound on.I always finish the movie wanting just a little more. The book helps satisfy a bit of that. Even having seen the movie countless times, the book was still a page turner.Some are offended at the glorification of the south and the misrepresentation of slavery in the book. I don't think it's wrong to find the perspective represented as very idealistic. But maybe take it more as a book written from the warped view that some probably had about their relationships with their slaves. It really is about the end of a civilization and their entire way of life."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"It is a wonderful classic and I enjoy it so much I savor the time I get to read it.

Not until The Godfather was published had there been so much interest in a book and its inevitable film version. Impresses to this day and you can see the masterwork the film's screenwriters performed in getting this sprawling story onto the screen. I think every American should read this through at least once.God help the pukes making movies in this era who think they need to \\"reboot\\" this story...

I found this edition here on Amazon and had my husband give it to me for Christmas. It is lovely. Book was in really good condition, too."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"The story begins with Scarlett O'Hara flirting outside her home with the Tarleton twins. The inciting incident was evident when Scarlett finds out that her beloved Ashley Wilkes is marrying that dreadful Melanie. The entire book spans the time of the Civil War and some reconstruction era. Gone with the Wind is a brilliant epic because it's about a love triangle and a young woman who is trying to find her place in the world. The setting is quite vivid, and if you live in the south, you know the heat and the vermillion sky. Of course, to read the book, even the name conjures up the images of Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. The book itself, a classic indeed, isn't special. The words are verbose and at times rather pretentious. What makes this story amazing are the memorable characters.Scarlett O'Hara is the most obnoxious human being ever, but she's sympathetic. Thebook is at least honest in that it shows her motives. While other characters in the bookmisinterpret her greed and manipulation as strength, the reader knows Scarlett is quite selfish and egocentric. We see her continuous struggle with what society tells her and what makes perfect sense. The reader applauds her tenacity and refusal to accept hardships. Of course, in the book she's only 16.Rhett Butler is also rather vile as a womanizing, selfish renegade with little regard for the ways of high society. He's an older man by the standards of the 1860s at 27. What makes him so special is that he makes it quite clear that he can have sex any woman he wants, but he doesn't want to have mindless sex.He wants someone that interests him, can think for themselves, and he wants their attention. This person is Scarlett. Rhett is a man who knows what he wants. Of course, it's clear to the reader his acts of kindness aren't kindness but manipulated ways to get a hold of Scarlett.Ashley is the contrast to Rhett, a moral and kind man who is drawn to Scarlett but he loves Melanie. Ashley loves the idea of history, literature, and high society. Melanie is Scarlett's contrast. While everyone hates Scarlett, Melanie loves her and that drives Scarlett nuts.At the end of the book, the characters are the most memorable part of the book and considered a classic."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"There are few adjectives left, that hasn't been used to describe this book.

Buying from Amazon guaranteed that the item was shipped on time, well packaged and equally was budget friendly."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I read this book in its entirety when I was 13 or 14, and of course I know far more now than I did then. I feel that if you can read this book with its historical context in mind and just appreciate it as a period piece and an exciting story, you'll be fine.I was thinking today about the fact that I read this book shortly after I read Little Women, the story of the March sisters whose dad was fighting the Civil War as a soldier for the Union. The contrast is great because while Alcott's book is filled with so many upstanding citizen types, Mitchell's story is peppered with the roguish Rhett Butler, the self-centered Scarlett, and an assortment of amoral characters. A few stand out as worthy of admiration--Melanie of course, Scarlett's mother, and Scarlett's beloved Mammy.I don't recall this book with the sentimentality that I hold for a simpler classic, such as Little Women. I loved the excitement, the adventure, the ironies. It thrilled me when Scarlett delivered Melanie's baby all by herself and when she said, \\"As God as my witness, I'll never be hungry again,\\" and proceeded to pick cotton in the fields like a \\"common field hand\\" as I think she put it. Her crush on Ashley thrilled me, and their long-awaited kiss was well worth waiting for! Somehow I couldn't quite cotton to the roguish, worldly Rhett and so their romance didn't thrill me, but nevertheless I was crushed when he abandoned her at the end. I remember asking my mom, \\"Why?\\" I just didn't understand why he couldn't have forgiven someone he supposedly loved so much.Just as in Little Women, I loved hearing about the fashions and balls. I tried to imagine what it would have been like to have been as popular as Scarlett! The obsession with thinness, so similar to our world with all the Jennifer Anistons today, interested me greatly. Imagine a 17-inch waist!I doubt whether I understood fully why she kicked Rhett out of her bedroom when she discovered that her waist measured a full 20 inches, leading her to the decision to stop having babies after Bonnie. And I'm embarrassed to admit that I thought Bonnie was a spoiled little girl, a miniature Scarlett, and I didn't cry when she died. But I cried when Melanie died, the woman who Scarlett had looked down upon all her life, only to finally realize that she was a great person.So much drama, so much excitement--wasn't it Melanie who suggested to Scarlett that they search the Union soldier's pockets after Scarlett had killed him when he entered Tara? I'm not sure but I remember that scene vividly from both the book and the movie when they realized that they'd both be raped by the home invader if they didn't do something fast!When I read this book as a young teen, I'd never read anything quite so adventurous or sophisticated. I'd never even seen the term \\"sexual intercourse\\" in print before, and now I was reading that Scarlett liked kissing, but marital relations didn't really appeal to her. My first adult book and I ate it up.If you can get past your hatred for the glamourization of slavery and see this book as a story from history, it's quite a fascinating tale. I mean who else but Scarlett O'Hara would fashion a dress from drapes and go to visit Rhett in jail in the hope of seducing him and achieving financial security for her and her family. Forgive me, but I can't help but picture Carol Burnett doing a skit as Scarlett, wearing the drapes, rod and all!This book probably deserves five stars just because it's a grand epic, but I need more of a love story, more inspiration than I found here. When the final words of a book are, \\"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,\\" this is too harsh for me."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I fell in love with Gone With The Wind at age 14 when my mother gave me a copy. Now--many decades and books later--it is still my favorite book ever. I realize that it may seem dated to 21st century readers. But it was written in the mid-1930s, when society was vastly different. No other book has ever captured my imagination like GWTW. And Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler is hands-down my all-time favorite character. Yes, she was vain and selfish and willful, and spent years deluding herself about Ashley Wilkes. But she was also very brave and intelligent (and beautiful). While the rest of her family sat back bemoaning the past, Scarlett literally saved Tara. In my opinion, she was a surprisingly modern woman who, unfortunately, was ahead of her time. She lived in an era when strong, independent women were not acknowledged or respected... and for this, she paid a high price.Even though I loved Vivien Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett, I much prefer the book over the movie. GWTW is a book that can be revisited over and over again.

With the war raging all around her, trying to support her family and friends, and trying to understand Rhett, Scarlett lives through a time of hardships and scorn, and bears it stubbornly.

Please read this book, and cry for a lost civilization - the south."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"As this quote from the opening of the movie says, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a novel which truly brings us back to a different time, a time of southern gentlemen and hoop-skirted women. But if you've only seen the movie, you've only seen half the story. The novel describes the life of Scarlett O'Hara, southern belle, in much greater detail, and paints a vivid portrait of life and love in the Old South, and of the Civil War which destroyed it. This is an inspiring tale -- Scarlett is a strong-willed woman who faces the horrors of war and survives, rebuilding her life from nothing. &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a wonderful story masterfully written. It truly gives us an insight into, as the movie says, &quot;a dream remembered, a civilization Gone With the Wind&quot;."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I love &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;. When I was 14 my mother handed me the book and said it was the best book she had ever read. I looked at the size of the book and thought there was no way I would ever get through it. One day I began reading and I just couldn't stop. I was sad when I had finished it and asked myself the same question everyone does; what happend next? I gave the book to my best friend. She thought I was stupid, but since she had nothing better to do she read it. She soon learned I really wasn't stupid."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"What a thumping good read! Unright-on and politically incorrect it may be, but frankly my dear... This book contains all things horrid - racism, slavery, going for your best friend's man (and your sister's!), cruelty to animals and unfortunates, deforestation, to name but a few. But so what? The characters are so strong they could be placed in any walk of life and flourish. OK, maybe not that insipid piscean-like Ashley Wilkes, but he should've been drowned at birth anyhow! How Scarlett could've been gagging for him for any longer than a couple of weeks is a mystery to me, but I guess he was a challenge (no wonder Rhett felt inadequate!). To be fair, the book does goes on a bit in parts, and I feel Margaret Mitchell could've employed her journalistic skills and been a little more succinct. There are a number of characters that I see no need for and having seen the film so many times, I believe she could have honed her dialogue more. But Mags is so much kinder to Scarlett than Victor Fleming is in the movie. On film Scarlett is portrayed as a ball-breaker - which to a certain extent she most commendably is! - whereas in the book we see her thought processes and we understand why she is like she is. She's a tough cookie who is simply unprepared to have nothing 'coz her contemporaries harp on about honour and the good old days. She's MOVIN'! Plus in the book we see a far darker Rhett than the role interpreted by Clark Gable. He's cool, he's a bad boy, he's loaded, but let's face it, the guy's got problems! He knew what he was getting into when he met Ms O'Hara, but he still pursued her for years. He's got some gall to turn round and moan that she isn't the way he wanted her to be, believing he could have changed her and made her love him. And then when she discovers it for herself... well Scarlett, the game's over! I'm not interested anymore. But hey, we still love him, he still packs a punch more than Frank, Charles and that stupid Ashley and he keeps you guessing. Does she get him back? Probably eventually. Scarlett has screwed up by being such a foolhardy hothead, but give her a break! With Melanie gone, she's got no pals and you know Scarlett will honour her promise and look out for Ashley... urgh! With any luck the man will get abducted by aliens and everyone can get on with their lives!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Being a guy this is kind of hard for me to admit, but this is the best book that I have ever read to date. I know that this is a \\"chick book\\" but I found it completely fascinating. I learned much more about the civil war from this book than I ever did from a history book or a classroom. I also learned about the origination of the KKK, all about slavery and all about real southern hospitality. There is so much more to this book than just a great story. You actually get to feel what it would have been like to grow up and live on a plantation before, during and after the civil war. I believe that this book should be read by everyone because of its historical value even though the story itself is fiction. I have read very few books where you really know and feel for the characters like you do in GONE WITH THE WIND."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Set in the Civil War era in Georgia, Margaret Mitchell's runaway classic Gone With the Wind is the spellbinding historical fiction of the world's best-known southern belle Scarlett O'Hara and the infamous Rhett Butler. The book was later made into one of the most successful films in history, starring Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable as the love-to-hate main characters. Normally, one would despise a person so spoiled and selfish as Scarlett, but Margaret Mitchell writes the emerald-eyed belle and the other characters in the book as multi-faceted, understandable characters, all with surprisingly human emotions and interactions. Through all of her struggles in the course of the novel, Scarlett stays strong, and in the end her will survives and she concludes a strong woman hopeful of what tomorrow will bring. Gone With the Wind is magnificent in its entirety, so complete with accurate historical facts and an unpredictable plot. The narrator follows Scarlett through years of her life, pre-, neo- and post- civil war, building at a quick pace. Scarlett rises again after the deaths of many close to her, after her failed marriage to Rhett, after going home to her beloved plantation of Tara during Reconstruction to find everything gone, and after her unrequited love for Ashley. The book closes with Scarlett pronouncing the famous words, &quot;After all, tomorrow is another day!&quot; Poignant and absolutely enchanting, Gone With the Wind is a book I would recommend to anyone. It cannot be guaranteed that you will enjoy it as I did, but from reading this novel you will gain insight about a true struggle and eventual survival."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I recently downloaded the book, \`Gone With The Wind' to my Kindle. It's not because I haven't read the book - far from it! Like millions of readers world-wide, I have already savoured every page of this best-selling listed book of all time in hardback, at least twice so far. I was 6 years old when my grandmother first noticed me looking intently at her copy of \`Gone With The Wind' in her bookcase. And it was shortly after my grandmother passed away a few months later that the very same book was placed gently into my hands to keep (as was her request).There have been so many book reviews about \`Gone With The Wind', authored by Margaret Mitchell, that I was almost tempted not to write this review. It seems somewhat pointless in repeating what has already been written countless times about this masterpiece, and the only book ever published by this author in 1936, who received a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for it, in 1937. With over 30 million sales, a film, and sequel attempts by other authors in attempts to keep the \`Gone With The Wind' saga alive, it is a book well known, world-wide.For those unfamiliar; set in the state of Georgia, southern United States in 1861, \`Gone With The Wind' is the story of the high spirited, un-conforming southern belle Scarlett O'Hara and her tumultuous struggles of the heart, with (southern gentleman) Ashley Wilkes and (charming rogue) Rhett Butler. But it is not just a romance novel; it is also a novel bathed in American history, and the story of a young woman's determination and strength of will to save her beloved plantation home called Tara in any way possible, through times of the American Civil War and the early years of Reconstruction.I cannot recall why I was so captivated by this book when I looked at it on my grandmother's book shelf all those years ago (it did not have a colourful outside cover). I certainly wasn't at an age to fully comprehend the contents of it, despite the fact that as a child growing up in the Australian bush in the 1960's, reading was a huge part of my childhood, especially as my mother and grandmother were both teachers. However, once I read the book I realised that my grandmother would have known I would relate to Scarlett's love of the land; her home, Tara, which she fought to protect at any cost.My favourite excerpts:-Gerald O'Hara (Scarlett's father): \`'Do you mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, that Tara, that land doesn't mean anything to you? Why, land is the only thing in the world worth workin' for, worth fightin' for, worth dyin' for, because it's the only thing that lasts.''\\"Somewhere, on the long road that wound through those four years, the girl with her sachet and dancing slippers, had slipped away, and there was left a woman with sharp green eyes, who counted pennies and turned her hands to many menial tasks, a woman to whom nothing was left from the wreckage, except the indestructible red earth on which she stood.\\"\`Gone With The Wind' will appeal to readers for so many different reasons. I highly recommend it!J M Lennox"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Oh wow!! I was utterly and completely engrossed with this book. Mitchell did an incredible job on being very descriptive of everything. As I read I can really picture the scenery, the characters, and the war especially. Scarlet annoyed me and it was devastating how selfish, cruel, and cold hearted she was. Nevertheless, I couldn't put the book down. I was interested to see on what would become of her and Rhett, and Melanie and Ashley. The ending was a tear jerker for me especially for what happened to Melanie. The author did well on creating so much depth into this novel. Don't be intimidated by the long and many pages of this book. It was worth reading."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Saying you know the story of \\"Gone With the Wind,\\" because you've seen the movie is like saying you know Kansas from watching \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" Compressed and with composite characters, the brilliant movie doesn't hold a candle to the novel upon which it is based. The novel has undergone much criticism, for black dialect (which we studied, along with other dialects in History of the English Language), for rosy portrayals of slavery, and for being a forbidden romance that happens to have the Civil War as its background.\\"Gone With the Wind,\\" is more than a novel; it is an experience. Scarlett O'Hara is devout with faith---in herself, and is a survivor. The true tragedy of the book is that she is blinded by her ignorance into ignoring true love when it was present, and longing after an idealized love with a married friend. The book is lush with descriptions of the period, and very accurate in its detail. Scarlett is externally strong, with fragile emotions, while her foil Melanie Hamilton Wilkes is internally strong, with character and devotion that run deep. Ashley Wilkes is rather pathetic in that he never has the integrity to admit a lust for his childhood friend Scarlett but not romantic love, while Rhett, in many ways like Scarlett, and older and wiser, loves her for who she really is, not the face that society of the time demands she show in public. The story is mostly about character development in the face of tragedy, and shows three survivors with one \\"displaced person,\\" forever malcontent in the new world that the War has created, out of place, sad, and futile.A word about the slavery element: slavery was NOT a good thing. Not all slaves were named after their owners or treated as trusted members of the family or confidantes. Aside from Rhett, Mammy is the only person who knows Scarlett, what she is capable of, and chastises her for her lack of morals or values. I feel her character is critiqued based upon her speech patterns, not her actual actions. With the exception of Prissy, none of the African-Americans appear to be ridiculed or used for comic effect, nor do stereotypes surface. Pork, Dilcey, Mammy, and Prissy are fortunate that the emotional ties they shared with the O'Haras continued so much that they remain as paid staff after being freed. Cruelty from others is also depicted, usually in the form of Northerners who didn't understand the way of life.What remains is a tale of what happens when one's way of life and world are turned upside down, and how the principal character handles it, and relates with the others, failing at times to recognize the quality of friendship from her sister-in-law Melanie and the weakness of Ashley Wilkes. I quite wonder if Mittie Bulloch Roosevelt felt this way, when the enchanting Clayton County belle (from whom some of Scarlett's physical traits seem drawn) moved to New York State with new husband Theodore Roosevelt, Sr.While not all elements of the novel are positive, GWTW is a snapshot album of life during the Civil War and Reconstruction."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"In my humble opinion, Gone with the Wind is THE great American novel. It is brilliant, incredibly well-written, and highly enjoyable to read. It is at times charming, romantic, or bitingly funny, and at other times dark, cold, or heartbreaking. And always, it has the Civil War-era history as its dramatic backdrop. Its characters are fascinating and complex, though FAR from perfect. This book has everything, and its appeal is timeless.I first read the book as a young girl, after a couple of friends at school has been reading it and were enthralled by it when we were all about 13. I read it starting one Christmas break, and could hardly put it down. It's such a long epic, yet so fast-paced, that you just become lost in it. That's the very best way to enjoy a novel- to just become fully engrossed. The way it worked out for me was perfect too, because when I read it that first time, I had never seen the movie. (My parents had probably watched it a few times when I was little, since they love the movie, but I was too young to pay much attention). I knew nothing about the characters or storyline before reading it, and that just made it all the better. Of course, at that age I loved Rhett Butler and the love story aspect the most! Some of it was over my head or too \\"worldy\\" for me to understand then. Realizing this, I have since read the book again as an adult (I'm now in my late 20's and have seen the movie several times also). I loved the book just as much as the first time around, and certainly as an adult I got much more out of the historical elements, descriptions of the countryside, and the whole storyline.I would really encourage anyone who has only seen the movie to read the book. I do love the movie; It was incredible for its time, and is a classic itself; but to me it doesn't even compare to the book. Just watching the movie, you only get a sense of the most shallow outline of the story, without understanding much of its depth, character development, or wit. This is especially true in the second half, which was a bit rushed in the movie.A slight pet peeve of mine: Some people comment on Gone With the Wind being \\"racist\\" or \\"sexist,\\" as if that somehow detracts from its quality. Quite the contrary...Not only is that overstating the obvious, that's part of the point!! OF COURSE the characters' racist viewpoints were condescending and horrible. But they were historically realistic. The entire nation of the 19th century was shamelessly racist, especially aristocracy in the deep South, and this story is told from their point of view. Why read classic literature or historic fiction at all, if the past must be sugar-coated for modern sensibilities? There is nothing to be learned from that. OF COURSE some of the attitudes toward ladies seem old-fashioned now. That goes without saying. But that is part of its charm and helps to explain why Scarlett is as conniving as she is. She's no fool! The Old South had its faults and cruelties (namely slavery) but largely as a result of those faults, it also did not survive. GWTW portrays this fall. Thus, there is so much to be learned from the book, historically and morally. Its very brilliance is the way it captures a snapshot of that long-lost culture, from its most beautiful and genteel qualities to its faults that ended up being its downfall, and portrays it changing with the war. The Old South is \\"gone with the wind\\" but will forever be alive in the pages of this great American novel.Margaret Mitchell depicts the Southerners as what they were: just people, same as the Yankees, trying to defend their own and to sacrifice and to courageously fight for their side as they thought was right, in their stubbornly proud way. And after, when they had been humbled, they were trying to just pick up the pieces and survive, in a cruelly war-ravaged land. The only world they had ever known was ripped out from under them. Gone with the Wind follows Scarlett and our fictional storyline as it parallels every step of the historic timeline, through Reconstruction.In so many ways, Scarlett herself is like the South. In my mind, I feel like she represents the South. As the final page of the book describes, in one of my favorite lines: \\"......With the spirit of her people who would not know defeat even when it stared them in the face, she raised her chin. She could get Rhett back.\\""},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"There's probably nothing I can say about Gone With the Wind that hasn't already been said, but I'm going to put in a plug for it anyway, because it's an incredible book and because a large number of people (most probably haven't read it) just don't get it--I'm talking particularly about those who think it's a romance novel.Gone With the Wind is incredible for its value as historical fiction. Written in the early 20th century by an author who grew up hearing stories about the Civil War and Reconstruction, it recreates that era far more successfully than any modern-day writer could. I've lived most of my life within a half-day's drive of Atlanta, but had never heard the South's perspective in the Civil War laid out as it is here. Some have complained that the book is racist, but to me, that's part of the point. This is no whitewashed, modern-day version of what Southerners thought in the 1860s; instead, it's a priceless and sometimes surprising reproduction of what they really thought and how that culture (very different from today's South!) operated.Aside from the beautiful portrayals of the people, places and events of the time period, there's some good action--those turned off by long books will be surprised at how readable this one is. The main characters, like them or hate them, are well-developed. And, yes, they have love lives. But then, we're modern readers, even if Scarlett isn't, so we should be used to that, right?"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I read this book as a little girl of nine or ten. Then I reread it and reread it until I practically had it memorized. No other book has affected me like this, and I've read many other books, including many of the great classics of literature. I have yet to find another Gone With the Wind.This book is life changing. To those who dismiss it as sexist racist trash, I would argue this: If describing reality as it is is sexist and racist, perhaps that simply reflects that there is a great deal of sexism and racism in reality. Were the people of the South prior and after the Civil War racist? Yes. Of course. Were these sexist times? Yes. Does it glorify sexism and racism.Perhaps. It is only fair to give this last question some consideration. There are sentiments in this book that are racist. I think of the feelings expressed of longing for the old days, the days of slavery, expressed by the main characters. But these are certainly feelings that were held by the people who clung so steadfastly to that way of life.I do not agree that all of the African Americans were portrayed as stupid. Even Prissy, in her own way, was not stupid. She was a detestable character, black or white, but not necessarily stupid, just daydreamy. But Mammy is anything but stupid. She certainly has a greater understanding of Scarlett than Scarlett's own mother ever did.Sexist?I don't know if this makes me a \\"sexist\\" but I have never identified with a character as much as I did Scarlett. It was as if I were reading the thoughts in my own head. She is manipulative, headstrong, stubborn, narcissistic, a dreamer, a romantic, and ultimately a realist, who stays in reality, and stays strong by clinging to certain rocks as her world changes around her. Rocks like her farm, Tara. And I love that. I love that when everything else is blown away from her, she clings to the things she learned to value in her childhood. \\"Land,\\" her father had told her, \\"Land is the only thing worth fighting for.\\"This book has given me strength throughout my life. I don't cling to the land, because I have none to cling to. But I cling to the things that give me a sense of something permanent and unchanging in my world, and especially when times seem unstable, and change seems to ruthlessly rip out all the familiar structures I have around me."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I have to admit that when I first started reading the book, I had no idea what it was about. I read the beginning and was apauled to find out that I was reading a book about slave owners (I was a bit close-minded). After many assurances from family members that it was a very good book, I continued reading...and could not put it down.This book opened my mind to alot of possibilities. I really liked seeing the civil war from this perspective. Even though this is a fiction book, it did shed a different light on some of the events that took place in that time period. I enjoyed learning about some of the customs of this period and why they had them.Scarlett's constant battle with who she is and who she wants to be makes for some interesting situations. I found my own ideas of the characters changing with every page as new information was given of each one. Though I didn't like some of Scarlett's choices, I was able to understand why she made each one. You never know when something good or bad is going to happen in this book...it could be the next paragraph.This is a really long book, but it's worth every page. I think Margaret Mitchell did a great job writing it. It will definately be a book that I recommend to everyone I know."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"&quot;GWTW&quot; is one of my favourite comfort books; &quot;War and Peace&quot; is another. They are similar in that they are sagas involving families whose lives are changed by war and how characters are affected by war. Some people fall to pieces and cannot contemplate a 'new' life where they have no place( Countess Rostova and Ashley Wilkes); while others find a hitherto unknown inner strength (Natalia Rostov and Scarlett). Margaret Mitchell took 10 years to write &quot;GWTW&quot;, thus starting the book in the '20's. She drew upon the stories that she had heard as a child from Civil War veterans and her own mother . Scarlett is the heroine of the book and there are very few scenes (as in the film) where she does not appear. &quot;War and Peace&quot; was also written over a long period of time. Tolstoy's work focuses on an exhaustive cast of characters, and places the reader in scenes domestic (&quot;peace&quot;) and foreign -the battlefields (&quot;war&quot;). Mitchell keeps her reader confined to Scarlett's side with third person references to battles and other factors of war. One could write a thesis ( as I felt I was beginning to!) on this topic. Let's just say that both are wonderful books; &quot;War and Peace&quot; is considered a &quot;Classic&quot;, while &quot;GWTW&quot; a classic example of historical fiction!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With The Wind is a superb book.

Margrett Mitchell not only wrote on romance and love, but also on the very real issues of a woman's place, jealousy, loyalty, and respect. Scarlett is the ideal stong and independent woman. She did not need men for their money and protection; she needed them for more suitable reasons like love and comfort. The entire novel was a lovely and inspiring story with twists of all kinds. I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Having lost count of how many times I have read Gone With the Wind, I continue to come back to it as, by far, my favorite book. Margaret Mitchell creates characters so vividly they seem real and sets them in a period of American history, the Civil War, that many of us are familiar with but from a perspective few can relate to, namely that of the Southern plantation family. It's very easy to create a vivid image of the characters, the context, the time in history, and how these factors mesh together to create situations that Scarlett O'hara can stuggle through and flourish in. Mitchell's creation of such characters as Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler allow you to question what exactly right and wrong really mean. These characters are selfish and crude, and reak of something, but throughout the book they continuously do extraordinary things for others. If you are in anyway a fan of historical novels, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I thought the book was very good.

The movie was great, but the book goes into much more detail and causes one to be much more drawn to the heroine."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"It's hard to believe that I'd never read GWTW. I've seen the film multiple times and I know a bit about the history of the novel. _Gone With the Wind_ sold more than 1,000,000 copies in the six months after it was released in 1936, and a year later Mitchell was awarded the Pulitzer prize for her effort. It's certainly one of the best-loved books of our century, with fans ranging from feminists who are trying to reclaim Scarlett to groups like the United Daughters of the Confederacy.So when I picked up the book, my biggest question was whether or not it was worth so much fuss and adoration. I suppose that my answer has to be 'yes'. Mitchell's writing style is occasionally uneven and it took me 50 pages to get used to her diction, but the story is so sweeping and the characters so well-realized that all concerns about style and tone were lost in the experience of the book.In many ways, I found the book a much stronger story than emerges in the film. Unhampered by censorship, the world that Scarlett moves in in the book is much uglier than the one in the film-- painful miscarriages, brothels, wounds and poverty fill Mitchell's picture of the post-war south and make Scarlett's character much stronger and much less petulant than she emerges in the film.Although daunting in length, I found that the pages literally flew by, and I was sorry in the end when the story closed. Definitely a 'should read'."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Unlike the movie, this book is NOT a \\"romance novel\\"; it's a hard-hitting account of Southern life during the Civil War, told from a Southern point of view, told as if from the period. The racist attitudes of the time, though naturally, entirely unsavory from today's point of view, existed, and denying it won't erase the facts. Mitchell WASN'T trying to make a statement of ANY kind, pro or con; she merely wrote on how things were, as opposed to how one wished they might be, or wished them to be different. The dichotomies between black and white life are entirely realistic, and to portray them as anything otherwise would be foolhardy. The only way to know how ghastly our history was in terms of its treatment of humanity is to preserve the facts as they were, and this book, without even trying, does exactly that.Too, it would be a serious mistake to paint this book as an idyllic, romantic love story. Mitchell, to her credit, does not fall back on dime-store novel clich&eacute;s, and unfortunately, she is rarely accorded respect for this. Because of the movie, an entirely different, not altogether flattering, slant permeates the whole \\"Gone With The Wind\\" phenomenon - and which debased Mitchell's intentions in the appalling Alexandra Ripley sequel.If everyone who saw the film had read the book, realization might be more widespread as to how they differ, and how much more complex and sharply drawn are the characters.Scarlett and Rhett are two unapologetic opportunists who are startlingly lacking in typical \\"storybook\\" appeal. Instead, their \\"appeal\\" is in how earthy and shrewd they both are, survivors by discarding public approval and approbation. In the end, both are humbled (\\"redeemed\\" is too strong a word) by life and their chronic misunderstanding of each other - and wind up, naturally, alone. Mitchell, shrewdly enough, in a rare move of unsentimentality, does not go the \\"happily ever after\\" route - Rhett leaves Scarlett, ruthlessly, abruptly. How could Butler, after being so shabbily treated, retain his self-respect by staying with Scarlett? All the other characters are drawn with wonderful strokes of originality and vividness - human, flawed and far more appealing than the pastel versions portrayed in the film.Mitchell was an incredible vernacular writer, and her skills in doing so emphasized the differences between all the cultures, classes and races. Astonishing is Mitchell's ability to combine history, social commentary and fiction with unbelievable ease; after several hours of reading, the reader may feel as though he had been in a virtual time machine, so indelibly detailed are the locales, weather, sounds and even smells. Even more absorbing are the marvelous dialogues between the characters, especially those of Rhett and Scarlett. Mitchell had a grasp as to how humans interact through words, and unlike, say, Ayn Rand, the conversations sound as if they are spoken by real people.Finally, though, for those who thought that Mitchell was Olde-Tyme in her attitudes and conventions because she was able to depict them so vividly, I suggest the reader pay close attention to the character of Rhett Butler, and his disdain for Old South values. Mitchell pulled a fast one by revealing, through Butler's character, just how modern a thinker she was. Butler repeatedly upbraids Scarlett for her early adherence to an antiquated \\"value system\\" and mockingly scorns the society around him. He sees what a sham and fakery of all the conventions that exist, and of having to accede to a mass-mentality. Through Rhett Butler, Mitchell slyly tucks in her own incredibly multi-faceted, intellectually-based mindset.Mitchell's book is one of the true greats in American novels."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Roseywater, I don't like this book because it is racist. According to your \\"racist\\" point of view we all should consider that the Odissey is not a good work because it is also racist, we shouldn't like \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" because it is racist, we shouldn't like \\"The Great Gatsby\\" because it is classist, etc, etc, etc.You should leave out that way of criticism and appreaciate the essence of human relations that surfaces in this wonderful story. The book is not racist, some characters are. But remember this is a book that explores how people were in the 1860s in the Southern US and it would be unrealistic if some characters, or many of them, were not portrayed as racist."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Thirty plus years ago, I lived and breathed \\"Gone With the Wind\\" in one huge, invigorating, life-changing gulp. I am writing this review because there is a whole new generation out there that should be exposed to this ground-breaking book.Epic in scope at over 1,000 pages, \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is a story of the Civil War, set in the deep South. The central charater is the infamous Scarlett O'Hara, a tempestuous, beautiful southern belle who secretly loves Ashley Wilkes, a childhood friend who marries his saintly cousin Melanie. At their engagement barbeque, Scarlett meets the dashing, mysterious Rhett Butler, the black sheep of a distinguished Charleston family. This event marks the last day of their antebellum lives, and sets the stage for the ravages of war that follow. Covering a time frame of roughly twelve years, \\"GWTW\\" is also a story of the new South that rises from the ashes of the old.Scarlett, one of the most indelible characters of modern fiction, is ruthless and selfish, a survivor and a fighter. A feminist long before her time, Scarlett pays dearly for the choices she makes. Rhett is a more complex individual with one weakness. He hides his love for Scarlett, prefering to pop in and out of her life until he \\"catches her between husbands\\". It is Rhett who is the more sympathetic character, deeply intelligent, self-mocking and sometimes heartbreakingly sad. Rhett, in spite of his worldly ways, is more representative of the old south, while Scarlett depicts the new.\\"Gone With the Wind\\" is fabulously well-written, plotted and researched. It has been criticized as racist, and it is so. No author today could get away with these portrayals of African Americans. But you have to remember that this book was written in the 1930s. Keep that in mind if you become angry. Personally, I feel that Mammy is one of the strongest, noblest women to appear in a work of fiction.This work is a must read for everyone. Savor it, reread it and be moved as many before you have been."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"The book was excellent, however it was missing page 713. It had page 813 in its place. Therefore the book had page 813 displayed twice in the book. I also went to a local bookstore and noticed all 4 books by this publisher had the same problem."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Does anybody not already know the story? Well just in case, be warned there are spoilers ahead.First, let's get this out of the way: Margaret Mitchell's \\"Gone With the Wind,\\" a story of the Civil War and Reconstruction in Georgia, is racist, and it paints a falsely idyllic portrait of slavery. There's no getting around it. Blacks are depicted as the functional equivalent of small children or draft animals who are best off under the loving care and protection of their white masters. They fulfill a narrative role similar to that of the dog Enzo in \\"The Art of Racing In the Rain,\\" devoted servants who are sometimes loyal to the point of heroism, and occasionally wise observers of their owners. Slave owners are kindly taskmasters, willing to spend thousands of dollars to buy slaves they don't need from other plantations to keep families together, loath to use harsh words or inflict discipline, and generously concerned with their slaves' physical and spiritual welfare. Slaves laugh in their cozy cabins and have comfortable clothes, plentiful food and attentive medical care. The \\"better class\\" of slaves recognize how good they have it and stay with their masters after the Emancipation Proclamation. Abolitionists are ignorant outsiders who don't want anything to do with black people and who can't even imagine the family feeling masters share with their slaves. You can make all the excuses you want about where Margaret Mitchell was from, the stories she heard as a child, and prevailing attitudes when this book was published in the 1930s. I know of no other American novel of comparable \\"classic\\" status that contains such a sustained portrayal of slave owner benevolence and black inferiority.That said, and I don't think these concerns are small matters, \\"Gone With the Wind\\" works brilliantly as a popular novel. To be sure, it has its flaws. If you like minimalism, you will find much of the prose overripe. There are more characters and scenes than are strictly necessary, even allowing for the vast historic scope of the story. I could do with a bit less wallowing in the red clay soil of north Georgia. The operatically star-crossed romance of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara does not bear too close inspection.GWTW works so well nonetheless because Margaret Mitchell is touched with genius when it comes to structure, pacing, and characterization. As another reviewer put it, she has incisive insight into the human heart. She also has the good sense to leave her readers guessing all the way to the end. We can each draw our own conclusions as to whether Scarlett will get Rhett back. Aspiring novelists and novelists who want to write better novels would do well to study GWTW regularly.Reading this book again for the first time in decades, after many heart-fluttering trips through as a dreamy, lonely adolescent girl, I was floored by Mitchell's skill at setting scene after scene that grabs the reader's attention, drives the story forward, and tempts you to read \\"just one more\\" until the clock is ticking into the small hours of the morning and the sky through the crack in the window blind slips from black to gray. Mitchell's prose flows (sorry, cliche ahead) like a clear, swift-moving stream. It's not the highest art, but it's miles above most popular fiction.The characters, archetypes though they may be, are as vividly alive as any I can remember. Even before I re-read GWTW, I could, from memory, have told you all about Scarlett's childish willfulness, shrewd business acumen, lack of insight, fierce love of the land and insane commitment to keeping her word. I'd forgotten her occasionally touching acts of kindness, such as when, after her father dies in a riding accident, she gives his gold watch to his body servant, Pork, with no visible ulterior motive. I could have told you about Melanie's steely gentility, Ashley's dreamy weakness, Mammy's wisdom, Gerald O'Hara's sweet madness, and Ellen O'Hara's suicidal devotion to duty as she saw it. Rhett Butler is a wonderfully complex, infuriating character whose conflicts and sorrows come from his being a gentleman (at least by the standards of his culture) in spite of his own better judgment. The fact that people react so strongly to Scarlett, Rhett and the rest, favorably or not, is testament to Mitchell's having made them so real that we believe in them even when our rational minds suggest we do otherwise.Mitchell does a remarkable job capturing universal human emotions and frailties: the fearful, loving relationship a small child has with his mercurial mother, the wisdom that there can be happiness only when like marries like, the stubborn folly of romantic regret, the pain and blame that come to a couple when a beloved child dies, or the inability to see others as they really are, whether it's the strength of steel under a genteel, innocent exterior or a vulnerable, devoted heart lurking behind a sardonic facade.Every tragedy needs its comic relief. A seldom-noted feature of GWTW is Mitchell's humor. She directs a sharp wit at the hypocrisy of Old Guard Atlanta and affectionate humor at the child characters she, a childless woman herself, handles with such insight and aplomb.Pat Conroy's introduction does a nice job as far as it goes in explaining how GWTW shaped the inner lives of generations of women, especially Southern women and how it will always be popular in countries that lost a war. Beyond that, I think GWTW's popularity endures in spite of its cringe-inducing attitudes for a couple of reasons. First, it's an early story of female self-sufficiency. Driven by fear of poverty, aided by a sharp mind, a solid work ethic and scruples that are none too fine, Scarlett makes her own money. Not for her the ladylike impoverished widow's pursuits of millinery, baking, or boardinghouse operation, or the unladylike pursuit of a brothel. Instead, she goes into the building trades, buying and running lumber mills, competing as sharply as any man in the business. Second, it's a quintessentially American story of, as Mitchell herself put it, \\"gumption.\\" In the world of GWTW, anyone with enough gumption can triumph over any adversity. GWTW reflects something so deeply ingrained in the American psyche that it will have an audience as long as anybody anywhere believes in the American archetype of the self-made person.In spite of its flaws, GWTW deserves its place in the top rank of popular fiction."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book was wonderful. I love reading about the south and the Civil War era is a wonderful back drop for the story of the spoiled southern belle Scarlett, and the dashing Rhett. I personally feel that this book is the mother of historical romance and will last the test of time. I read this book the first time when I was 12 or 13 and re-read it again as an adult. My memory of this story was not altered by the length of time between these reads.Better then the movie and wonderfully descriptive with real characters that grow as a result of their experiences you will not be disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"5+ stars! I have read Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind 3 times over my 60 years and it still ranks in my top 2 greatest books ever written. It is an American Masterpiece. A classic of its time. Epic in scope, it is simply a good story that you never want to end. Happy, sad, contrite, vengeful, mean, loving, mysterious, hypocritical; yes, it has all the human emotions and foibles of life and more. To borrow a line from Charles Dickens' Tale of Two Cities: \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of time\\", but most of all it was their times.One of the vary best books ever written concerning character development. Ms. Mitchell was superb. Her use of emotion and empathy made the characters come alive and it was as if they were in the room with you.To say more about this wonderful American classic would be redundant and hyperbole.It is an absolute must read. A true American classic masterpiece.*Note: I have seen the movie many times and it too is an American classic. Stunning in character portrayal and scenery. BUT, the book has the broad scope and in-depth character development that the movie could never portray unless it was many hours longer. Simply put, The book Rules!!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"A fourteen year old who loves to read almost anything under the sun:I loved this book. When I was in seventh grade I checked it out of our little school library because it had a lot of points--we'd read books, take a test, and receive a certain number of points for that book. If we got everything correct, we got full points, and we needed many points to pass English every trimester.I didn't realize I was going to fall in love with the characters. Each person is beautifully made, intricate, and unique. You grow to know everyone in the story. Margaret Mitchell doesn't let any detail slide. She describes Scarlett beautifully.Scarlett is perhaps the most interesting character I've ever read. I hate her completely, and yet love her just the same. She was the most spoiled brat, and yet I felt like I was part of her, or she was part of me.Also, Margaret Mitchell does a good job of justifying the Confederate's reasons for breaking off from the United States. Although I don't agree with slavery at all, I could see where the southerners came off, believing as they did, and even felt a little angry at the northerners for being so hotheaded themselves.For those of you who have seen the movie and liked it, buy this book, its ten times better. And for those of you who disliked the movie, still get the book. It is very much different from the movie, you get in the whole world, and they left out so much in the movie. For instance, Scarlett ... well, just read it, it's good."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"While I admit to not being a fan of the romance genre, Mitchell's &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; towers above its imitators in style and substance. Set in the Atlanta area during the Civil War era, Mitchell's story exemplifies the proper writing of historical fiction, with painstaking accuracy of language, mannerisms, and morals. The war itself is also presented as it should be presented - in full color and with all its moral ambiguity, rather than the black-and-white presentation that so often is the norm in modern discourse.Mitchell's painting of southern culture and the all-encompassing war, however, serve only as the background for one of the most poignant love stories ever written. Following the life and loves of the willful Scarlett O'Hara, the work delves straight into the meaning and nature of love. Torn between her now-married childhood love, Ashley, and the outcast Rhett Butler, and in dogged pursuit of financial success after the devastating war, Scarlett lives a life of emotion and passion that few fictional characters have rivalled.Though this work is quite long, it is a very easy read. The style is light and brisk, the language uncomplicated except in the heavy dialect of the blacks, and the story compelling. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is a great book, a great movie, and perhaps the greatest love story ever told. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I love this book. I could read it over and over again. While it isn't very well written, it has the ability to take you there into the story and forget everything going on around you. It gives you a lot more detail then the movie, and makes you understand the characters more. You can really understand the motivation behind some of their actions."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"GWTW is undoubtedly an american classic for more reasons than one - sweeping storyline, strong characters and just the flow of simple lucid narrative prose that keeps you going from page to page with sustained interest (not an easy job if it is 700 pages!). I read it a few times when i was young, just fell in love with the movie and it is part of my library collection as well. I still enjoy the color and splendor and perky dialogue although the book is too long to read again with other reasons too.As i grew i figured out what was missing underneath the sentiments we have for it. There is not one word against racism or intolerance or suffering undergone by others during those times. Yes the south lost it all but times and lives change, some cruelly others more slowly with time - it is a natural order of things to change and intolerant lifestyles definitely have to. Lot of people have a longing for good times gone, but it needs to be laced with feelings for what caused it to happen and does not automatically mean bad times have come. I would think hidden beneath the huge popularity of the book so many years after it was made is partly love for simpler times but a lot of guilt for simplistic and intolerant ways of the past that were hidden by economic prosperity and picture postcard lifestyles."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I have watched the movie a zillion times. So since I liked the movie so much I thought I would read the book too. I was amazed how much better the book was than the movie. It goes into great detail and you get the entire story. And since I live in Georgia I'm learning about my culture. And I also found out that not all folks who owned slaves were cruel to them. Actually some of their owners were good to them. And also I fell in love with all the characters. I hate Scarlett but yet I love her too. She is like me in a lot of ways. We are both selfish and spoiled. And we both let our conscious get the best of us. I recommend this book to everyone. It is amazing. I never read a book before until now. I can never put it down. I have now read 4 times and gets better each time. It's nothing like the movie. It's far better!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell, is a captivating book about the southern way of life in the 1860s. Scarlett O'Hara, the main character in the book, is a young, outspoken girl for her times who lives on a big plantation, Tara. Gone With the Wind goes through the tough times of the Civil War. Scarlett wants a man that she can't have, Ashley Wilkes. She ends up marrying Ashley's cousin, Charles Hamilton, just to spite Ashley, but Charles died in war two months later. She found out she was pregnant with his child and named him after Charles's troop leader, Wade Hampton Hamilton. Scarlett waited awhile before she married her sister's beau, Frank Kennedy. She had a baby girl with him also, Ella. Frank was killed while attempting to kill the carpetbaggers who attacked Scarlett on the way to the lumber mill that they owned. She immediately married Rhett Butler, a urbane man that everyone loves to hate. She has yet another child with him, Bonnie Blue. I would recommed the book Gone With the Wind to anyone because its a twist of romance and survival."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Almost everyone had heard of the beautiful Scarlett O'Hara and the way she can make men weep. The book, Gone with the Wind, though enthralling through 1,022 of it's pages, with it's can't-put-this-book-down events, unexpected turns, tragedies and historical content, has an, in my opinion, very unsatisfactory ending. According to some, it's &quot;The greatest love story of our time. Maybe it is, but the conclusion to the love triangle of Rhett, Ashley and Scarlett was left off as if it were not the end, but the beginning. I suppose it could be argued that you should use your imagination, and that the author wanted to escape those cliche of the studly man living happily ever after with the beautiful damsel but the last two pages left me wanting more. However, if you're the type of person who can deal with not-really-the-end endings, I would really recommend this book. Although it has maybe, an overabundance of pages, Scarlett's life takes many unexpected turns and you sometimes you get so enraptured in the excitement and tragedy that you find that you've read several pages and not even realized it. This book is also full of historical information about the civil war, looking at it from the very different perspective of the women of the south. Margate Mitchell has a way of writing that always keeps you guessing and feed you words of wisdom to live by. Almost like one really long tragic soap opera."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Of course I love GWTW. I have read it at least a hundred times and it never fails to capture me. However, I want to make it clear to those who have children who wish to read GWTW, or if you are a young person yourself, that this is a novel which glorifies the ideals of the 'old south'. And that 'old south' so dearly loved and cherished by the characters of the book is one built with the sweat and blood of thousands of African Americans, and not those who reaped the benefits of slavery. By all means, enjoy this book for its romanticism. However, I think it is imperative that such misguided idealism and blatent cruelty must be treated as such and explained to those who are still rather impressionable."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone with the Wind changed my point of veiw on the Civil War and how hard women worked and tried to be ladies. Scarlett worked hard to prevent Tara from being taken away and preventing hunger of her family. My point on the Civil War was southerners were terrible people but GWTW changed changed all that, most people treated their &quot;workers&quot; or slaves as part of the family and were happy. It was the yankee's who were terrible the wouldn't let the south be they had to torture them.

In the beginning the way Mrs. Mitchell describes Scarlett is very good and gives you a good idea of the way Scarlett is. Rhett was my favorite character because he was so dashing and handsome. He also was kind and sweet you just couldn't tell most of the time, He was so funny when he was with Scarlett and how he hid his love for her made me sad. Scarlett was really a mean person most of the time, she was selfish and creul to the people around her. It made me mad the way she thought about Melanie, and how she used men to get money or revenge. Ashley was one of my least favorite characters, he was so unrealistic! The Tarleton twins were some of my favorites, they were vivacious and funny and sweet to Scarlett in the time you read about them. I just don't understand how Scarlett could just give up everything she had grown up in to be rich. Its just not right. I loved the part of the story during Rhett's and Scarlett's honeymoon! They were so happy! Bonnie was so like Scarlett it was unbelievable. You could understand why all the people and Rhett and even Scarlett loved her so! But how could she just send Wade and Ella away to Tara that way without any feeling about it. You could totally relate to the characters in the story, it on numerous times made me laugh, cry, mad, and jump for joy! I loved it!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"The minute I began this book, it was my all-time favorite. I had just turned eleven when I read it, and a lot of people thought it would be way over my head, but it wasn't. I read it in five days, that's about 205 pages a day. The instant I began reading it, Margaret Mitchell was my favorite author and GWTW was my favorite book. It is totally unsurpassed. It is and will remain a classic forever. Scarlett &amp; Rhett were very realistic, as were the other characters. I've read it several times. Every time I read it, I cry at the end, and at other various places in the book. There are no words that could ever possibly describe how spectacular, wonderful, magnificent, this book is. It is totallu unforgettable. If you read this book and didn't like it, there's something the matter with you, because it's totally lovable. It's impossible not to like it. I couldn't put it down the entire time I was reading. I took it everywhere with me. When I was done, I searched everywhere for the sequel, SCARLETT. I had to wait almost a week before it came in and I was dying to know what happened the entire time. I couldn't sleep some nights, for worrying about how things would turn out. I've been trying to get all my friends to read this great book. Some of them are actually thinking about it. There is just nothing else to say about a book as great as this one."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Long book, and it hurts your eyes to read it, but it is well worth reading. So often we hear of the north's view of the war, and now we see it through the strong southern belle, Scarlett. Scarlett isn't nice, in fact she's very down to earth and reflects the flaws as well as the compliments women today share. She is spirited and willing to risk it all to never go hungry again, after feeling the poverty and hunger once Sherman swept through. Unlike many southerners, she realized that the past is gone with the Wind and she must break ties with society in order to stay strong, alive, and comfortable."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"One of the best books and best movies ever is Gone witht he wind.

The only thing is the book is long a little to long at times but still it's a great read."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"\\"Gone with the Wind\\" by Margaret Mitchell is one of my favorite books of all time. Scarlet O'Hara, the foolish southern belle is in love with Ashley Wilkes, a scholar who won't have anything to do with her. To rebel, she marries his fianc&eacute;e' s brother and when the war breaks out, it turns ugly. She is then forced to move to Atlanta to her husband's house. In Atlanta, Georgia during the Civil War things aren't easy. It is hot and sandy. The sticky humidity is horrible to live in yet the feeling of \\"home\\" is evident everywhere. There are always barbecues and lazy afternoons up till the war. The south is mostly cotton fields, with little factories while the north is full of manufacturing. Things don't look too good for the south when the war breaks out and to make everything worse, the ports are soon closed off. All too soon Scarlet feels the bitterness of war as her childhood friends die for a losing cause. When she finds Atlanta being attacked by General Sherman she must flee for safety and there is nowhere to go.This story is about a girl who has been spoiled her entire life and then must learn to do things on her own. She faces the fact that she can't have everything and that she has to make sacrifices. Her whole life she has been the brat that depends on everyone else so she can't do anything on her own. She is blinded by her own insolence to the truth that nothing is fair. Sweet Melanie, her sister in law is kind to her and is too sweet hearted to see the wrong in anyone; she doesn't see how corrupt Scarlet' s mind is. She is always on Scarlet' s side despite the horrible things that she does. Scandalous Rhett Butler loves Scarlet for her foul heart and chases her throughout the whole book. Rhett has a history for doing unthinkable things to girls. (Unthinkable at the time; refusing to marry a girl he courted, publicly kissing, etc.) Everyone despises him for making a profit off of the war. All proper people support the failing cause and Rhett makes fun of them. He is a businessman, so nothing is personal till he meets Scarlet. As time progresses, Scarlet comes to realize the damage that she has done with her being wicked to everyone. She literally is and was a spoiled brat. Her suffering teaches her a lesson that we all should learn.If you love historical fiction with a little romance, this book is perfect for you. Scarlet is the perfect Southern belle who is incredible to read about. How she attracts men with her charm and little helpless acts is unbelievable. She is used to having slaves serve her and she treats them with little or no respect until she needs them. You cannot stop thinking about how much you would hate Scarlet if she was real, but you can't stop feeling sorry for her and you want to help her to realize how stupid she is.In this book you have a look at how the south was before and after the Civil War. They were still people with feelings, not horrible people who were wicked. You fall in love with the chivalry and way of life. You also realize how wrong slavery was. Even they knew it was wrong, they just couldn't imagine life without the slave labor. I think that the book is written well, you see why people did things and the reasoning behind their actions. I didn't always agree with what Scarlet did, but I knew why she did things. The book is very interesting and I couldn't put it down at all. I certainly would recommend it to just about anyone. I certainly understand the era better now. The book got me interested in other books about the war and now I can see why people felt the way they did. I can see the good and bad in slavery. I feel that lack of education on the issue is what caused such disastrous effects.Emily Norrod"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I had seen the movie and while I liked it, I HATED Scarlet.

The package arrived safely and in a timely manner. I was pleased with the transaction."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"When I first read Gone with the wind many years ago at age 25, I had watched the movie many times and loved it. Then when I read the book, I fell in love with it hailing it as the best book I'd ever read in my life. At that time though, I did find the in depth descriptions of the surroundings and of backgrounds of people a little tedious. Other than that, I loved it and my lifelong love of Civil War history was started right then and there. As the years went by and I read so many more books, a few years ago there began to be other books that took the title of \\"best book\\" in my eyes, always keeping that great love of GWTW in my heart. However, at age 52, I decided to read it again. It just called to me for some reason. This time, I loved it even so much more than I did then, and what I disliked about it years ago, the descriptive writing of Margaret Mitchell, is one of the things I loved about it most of all. It takes a tremendous amount of talent for a writer to totally immerse the reader into the setting they have created, when they can just see the lush beauty, the red clay, the desolation, the dying wounded, everything that was written, you lived it, smelled it, and felt it. I was in this story from beginning to end, and I lost myself in it completely. It now has rightfully taken its place as my favorite book of all time.Yes, It is a book where the main character is a selfish, spoiled rich plantation owner's daughter, that lost everything she had that she knew in the world, her home, her parents, many friends, her money, and how she clawed herself back to the top no matter who she ran over or hurt along the way. She is an unlikeable character that you cannot help but like anyway for the sheer will and determination she has to survive. Somewhere along that road of selfishness, she developed a conscience even though she stifled it whenever it reared it's head and went on being ruthless anyway. Also somewhere along the road, she realized that there was a feeling she could not quite identify in her heart about Melanie and Rhett, a feeling she did not realize was love until it was too late to enjoy that love. Oh you knew she was ruthless and hard, but you knew there was some good in her somewhere (was there?) and you rooted for her.Then there's Rhett. The rebellious, sarcastic, making money at the ruin of others, handsome man that fell in love with her the moment he cast eyes upon her. He was there for her so many times over the years, but she never really appreciated him. He loved her so much, but never let on in words that he did because he knew anyone that admitted they loved her, she would run over like she did so many other poor men that loved her, may they rest in peace. She realized she loved him much too late.There's Melanie, the mild, sweet shy girl-like woman who Scarlett said she hated because she was Ashley's wife (and of course Scarlett was in love with Ashley). So sweet and mild, she has a fierce loyalty and love for Scarlett, which Scarlett also didn't fully realize until it was too late.And Ashley, poor pitiful Ashley who she just thought she loved all these years only to finally realize she was In love with an idea of him, not him. She wasted all those years not realizing this, again, until it was too late.Mixing with all these wonderful characters and more, is a story about the south and how the world they knew was lost. Though it was a world that had many wrongs that should not have happened and that I'm glad was put an end, you can't help but feel their loss, feel the horror as they watched their houses and Atlanta burn to the ground. You feel their hungriness as they have nothing to eat, feel their shame as they have nothing but rags left to wear, feel their bitterness as they are under Yankee rule during the reconstruction.It's also a story about what different people do to survive. In this case, does one go with the flow and make the best out of a new situation and reap the benefits that they can in the situation they're in, or does one stay loyal to a cause that was burned to the ground and is no more and stay humbled and hungry? Does one sell their soul and prosper at the cost of others? Scarlett took advantage of the situation she was in and it made no difference who she ran over to do it or if she did forget the cause for which a war was fought. However, in the end, I think she realized that to have all she acquired, a very high price was paid for it all.This book was so great on so many levels, even more that what I've written here. For to go on, it would be way longer that this. I think it's a masterpiece.I do want to say one more thing, last but not least, about the author Margaret Mitchell. Though this was her only published novel, she did not drop down out of the sky to write this book out of nowhere. Growing up she wrote complete stories all the time as a little girl, was in drama at school, and as a young adult, worked as a journalist until she had to quit due to an ankle injury. She was born into a family rich in civil war history and many of her family had actually fought and lived during the civil war and she sat on many a lap listening to these stories throughout her childhood. She was born, lived and died in the city she wrote about, Atlanta. She knew of what she wrote about and it's historically accurate. She died, unfortunately, at the age of 48, hit by a drunk driver, crossing Peachtree St. (a street mentioned many times in the book), with her husband on the way to the movies. 5 days later she died, she was buried in Oakland Cemetary, (a graveyard mentioned in the book). To me, this book could have never been surpassed and I feel so good knowing that in her short life, she chose to leave this masterpiece for us all to enjoy forever. I, for one, am grateful. Thank you Margaret Mitchell."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I have to say, at about 60-80 pages in, I was tempted to give up on this monstrous, 1000+ beast of a book, but Ifm glad I didnft. I have this strange compulsion to ALWAYS finish books, despite how bad they are in the beginning, in the hopes they get better. And this one certainly did.I wonft spend much time on plot, because truthfully, the only people that arenft aware of the basic plot of this book are those of you who were like me and obviously living under the largest rock in the world. Ifd like to start, instead, with Scarlett.Scarlett happens to be the most reprehensible, vile, and childish character Ifve ever encountered. And I love her. No matter how foolish I thought she was, I always wanted to read on to see what happened to her. I think this is where Mitchell really did something really wonderful. It is almost impossible to have complete disgust in a character and still want to know what her ending is. This is how I felt about Scarlett. I wanted to shake her until she developed some semblance of sense, but I then realized that this book has a sense of a bildungsroman to it. Yes, it is about life during the Civil War, and about romance, and many other things, but itfs mainly about Scarlett and her journey to womanhood. In my personal opinion, the interesting part is that she never really reaches that womanhood, despite all her hardships.I am not one for historical fiction. I will admit that I like historical war fiction even less. But although the novel is set during the time of the Civil War, and there are excerpts of the battles in it, I wasnft overwhelmed enough by it to dislike it. It was vaguely interesting to me, and didnft take away from the main story.I also wouldnft call this a romance, because, for all intents and purposes, Scarlett is never in love with anyone. She appears to be in love with Ashley throughout the entire book, and despite the many comments I may receive about this, I truthfully donft think she was ever in love with Rhett. I think she was in love with the idea of both of these men. The only person Scarlett is in love with is herself. And the only thing she is in love with is money. Which brings me to my next point: Mitchell took a huge risk making Scarlett the woman she did.Scarlett become a strong, independent, although still childish, woman. Her only gfallh is that she realizes she glovesh Rhett too late in the game, and has to (presumably) spend her life wanting him and never fully having him. Generally, when women of the 1800s are fictionalized as strong and independent, there are seriously negative connotations associated with them. You see this some with Scarlett, but she doesnft let it affect her. She is all in all strong. Silly in many regards, but strong. This is where Mitchell, in my opinion, really broke the mold. She allowed her character to suffer through so much pain and heartache and yet let her continue as an unbroken woman. Scarlett doesnft appear to be marred by anything but her own agenda. And I absolutely respect that, even though I still think she needs a bit more sense.I have to give this one s s s s. I truly loved it, with the exception of the lack of a love story. I guess in my head, I had considered this the greatest romance of all time (and I honestly couldnft tell you where I got this misperception), and I really found that lacking.

Scarlett is annoying, not that bright, pretty cruel, and not my idea of a great lady. She doesn't really change for the better and her violent reactions become predictable.2. The story is woven very nicely, though it is extremely verbose at times.3. Mitchell created vivid, interesting characters who were fun to observe (with the exception of Scarlett, at times).4. People rant and rave over it being a racist novel, which is, in a sense, true. It is a book written about a racist group of people during a racist period of history in an area that was known to be very racist at the time. It was interesting to see how unapologetically racist people could be, according to Mitchell's storytelling at least. The book, though, is not racist in the sense that it supports racism and bigotry. In fact, I walked away from this book with a heightened interest in learning more about what freed slaves endured during the years following the war.

Years and years, (and years!), later, on the 50th Anniverary of GWTW, (the movie, I think), TV GUIDE ran two -- or perhaps it was three -- articles on this book / movie phenomenon. One was a general overview of the movie, and comments from surviving leading players. The other two were equally as fascinating: one was written by a White woman, the other, by a Black man.The White woman said that the value she had gotten from this book was that she had learnt from it, to withstand any hardship, no matter how great.The Black man said that he had been SO ashamed to buy this book. As much ashamed as he would have been, had he bought a pornography book! After reading it, he opined that it did NOT focus on the cruelty, pain, and degradation of slavery, but instead on a woman in love with another woman's financee and later, husband. He compared the book to a hypothetical novel set in World War II, wherein a Nazi officer, a guard in a concentration camp, was having a romance with a secretary. The pain and suffering of so many people, all around them, is all but ignored, in this hypothetical book, as all the attention is on the two lovers. Obviously, the Black gentleman who wrote this article for TV Guide did not like GWTW at all....I think it's important to keep BOTH viewpoints in mind. Because both are very accurate, and both speak volumes about the meaning of \\"Gone With The Wind\\"."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I have enjoyed reading Gone with the Wind. I found the book in great shape."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With The Wind is a classic of mid-twentieth century epic fiction. I read it years after being misguided by Ayn Rand and I was stunned when I realized how closely Rand mimicked Mitchell's prose. Perhaps it was simply the writing style of the time. Mitchell and Rand differ, though, and if both writers create characters that are larger than life, Mitchell's are real while Rand's are pure fantasy.Scarlett O'Hara starts off as a prissy, selfish sixteen year old. She's in love with a beautiful wimp and can't stand losing him to a saintly rival. She marries someone else out of spite at her loss just as the Civil War begins. She's soon a widow and her estate is destroyed, her family in ruins. She marries again to a man with a sound business but no business sense. She takes over his lumber enterprise and gets thing done. She's again widowed and marries Rhett Butler, a man who has all her gumption but whose self interest is tempered by empathy for the aspirations and hopes of others.Scarlett is a fascinating character. She has gumption, she gets things done but has no compassion for anyone but herself. Yet she never wastes any time on recriminations when wronged or when she falls victim to someone else's mistakes; she just moves on to the next task. She has a sense of responsibility, in a way she doesn't clearly understand, and that there are things greater than herself. It is the tension between her inner contradictions that hooks the reader into admiration and that brings about our empathy for her.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is one of my most favorite books.

In Deerflies, Gundy continues to seek out this reality--which at times he might name as the face of God--in the most ordinary of moments. His is a poetry in which we are asked to question perspective. One moment he may implore us to imagine what the redwinged blackbird sees; in another he may turn a sacred story on its head, suggesting that if we were not infused with the myths of this place we might see the world in very different terms; and still at other times we are privy to conversations between the likes of Simone Weil and Hermann Hesse, somehow resurrected long after their deaths. Deerflies is a book of strong poems and quiet meditations.

I'll definitely reach for her next book, Comanche Passion."},{"Title":"Comanche Eagle (Lovegram Romance S)","review":"From the back cover:He wanted justice...Angry and determined, Travis Black Eagle storms into Crystal Spencer's home, demanding justice. Her brother, the town doctor, was responsible for his beloved wife's death in childbirth--now he has a newborn son who needs a mother. As Cheyenne, Wyoming's first and only female Justice of the Peace, Crystal knows no court can force her to marry Travis. But she couldn't turn her back on his tiny, helpless baby...nor could she deny the sparks that set off an unrelenting desire within her when she first laid eyes on this proud, rugged half-breed.She wanted him forever...What began as an uneasy bargain soon grows into a consuming passion that gives way to a tormenting conflict. Travis has seen too much of life's injustices--and has little faith in laws of any kind, including those that govern the heart. But soon, Travis' own dangerous past, and Crystal's responsibility to uphold the law in this wild, rough boom town, will put their deepest convictions and their passionate new love to the ultimate test.And my review:I bought this book because I'd enjoyed this author's contribution, LOVE'S GIFT, to the AVON BOOKS PRESENTS: UNDER THE MISTLETOE Christmas anthology and decided to give one of her full-length romances a try. And after reading the rave reviews on this page, COMANCHE EAGLE looked like a good place to start.Unfortunately, this book did not fully live up to my expectations. There were things to like about it, however, and I will mention them first. One was that the author obviously did her historical research. For instance, I didn't know that Wyoming was the first state to give women the right to vote and hold public office. I felt that this premise was an interesting one, and well executed in this story. The historical backdrop was well done, but didn't get too \\"textbook\\".However, I never really felt connected to the characters. They just never came alive for me. This was especially in the case of the hero. I just never felt like I got a real feel for who he was deep down. He came across as more of the stereotype of the brooding, misunderstood hero of mixed blood, half of which was Native American. It wasn't that he was a bad guy, or anything, I just never felt like I really knew him on anything more than a superficial level.While the heroine's character was more fully sketched, I found her quite annoying at times. She had the irritating habit of viewing everything in black and white. If something was law, then it had to be obeyed, even if the law is unjust. For instance, they find an adolescent boy on their land so badly beaten that he's near death. They nurse him back to health, but because he's a minor child, the law says that he is the property of his parents, even though his father is the one who beat him. And the heroine is determined to obey the law and return the child to his father (if the father comes to fetch him), because, well, it's the law! Never mind that the law was clearly wrong. A man does NOT have the right to beat his children, never has, even though the law used to say that he did. The heroine was so rigid on this point that it really grated on my nerves after a while. (Slavery was not always illegal, either, but that didn't mean that the law was right or just!)The heroine was so unyielding that she basically didn't even have a struggle between her duty to the law and her conscience. I would have liked for the author to use this conflict to really develop the heroine's character. Instead, the heroine ended up sounding like a broken record with her constant \\"but it's the law\\" rhetoric.Also, one other minor complaint: this book needed better editing! There were numerous grammar and punctuation mistakes, such as commas in places they shouldn't be, misused words (eg: \\"there\\" instead of \\"their\\"), and even misspelled ones at times. And there were also some continuity problems. For example, the baby is eating, he falls asleep, a paragraph later, he's still eating, and then in the next paragraph, he falls asleep again. No mention is made of the baby waking up between those two instances of falling asleep--so this sure looked like a mistake to me. I don't blame the author for this as much as I blame the publisher/editor, but still, these kinds of mistakes are very annoying because they jar the reader out of the story.I might try another of Sara Orwig's books, but only if I find it at a garage sale or a thrift store. I recommend COMANCHE EAGLE only if you're already a fan of this author, as it's not the best read out there."},{"Title":"Comanche Eagle (Lovegram Romance S)","review":"Crystal Spencer is a female Justice of the Peace in Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory in 1871. She was appointed by the governor and takes her job very seriously as she doesn't have much else in her life besides a drunken brother. She moved to Cheyenne to be with her physician brother after the rest of her family in Baltimore passed away. She doesn't really fit in with people in Cheyenne, partly because she keeps to herself and partly because men resent a female judge. Her brother is robbed and killed one night while on his way home from a delivery where a woman bleed to death after birth because he was too drunk to help.Travis Black Eagle blames Crystal Spencer's brother for his beloved wife's death. He barges into Crystal's home a month after his wife's death, demanding she marry him to help with his little son who is motherless thanks to her drunken brother. There are no other suitable women to marry to be a mother to his son. The eligible young ladies wouldn't be allowed to marry him because he is a half-breed Comanche and he doesn't trust the soiled doves in town with his baby. The only person left was \\"Judge Spinster\\" as the men called her. He knows she is in dire straights after her brother's death due to his debts, so he proposes a marriage of convenience - she gets a place to live and his son gets a badly needed mother. He makes it clear he does not want her in bed, just as a mother to his son.Crystal is a practical woman so she realizes that this is her one chance to become a mother, as she had resigned herself to being a spinster. She marries Travis and moves to his ranch. Crystal and Travis take a little while to get used to each other. Travis is raw with grief for his deceased wife for months and barely notices Crystal beyond her treating his son Jacob well. Crystal is attracted to Travis, as he is good looking and strong man but she knows he is too caught up in grief to even notice her. Plus she thinks she is very plain looking because no man ever seemed to want her.After six months of living together and Travis sleeping in the barn, Travis and Crystal have learned to co-exist fairly well. Travis suddenly sees her as a desireable woman when he accidently sees her in her bath. From then on, his eyes are opened to how attractive she is and he wants her. Crystal has been steadily falling in love with Travis but tries to hide her attraction because she knows he doesn't see her that way. Travis admires Crystal's strength of character and the wonderful mother she is to his son. When she works up the nerve to ask him for a child of her own, he is very tempted by her but is very scared to get another woman pregnant. Plus he is afraid of Crystal's unbending opinions on right and wrong because there are events in his past that could tear them apart. Can Travis take another chance on love and a baby? Can Crystal learn to bend on certain issues or will they allow these issues to tear them apart?I really enjoyed this western romance. The story was good enough to take a theme I don't usually like, a man grieving over another woman through part of the book, and make it into an entralling story that I liked. Travis is just raw with grief for the first part of the story, but his recovery was not rushed. He and Crystal don't get together for over six months afterward and he struggled with allowing himself to come back to life fully and take a chance on love again. He was terrified of coming to care for Crystal then lose her too. Crystal also overgoes a transformation in the story. She starts out a rather uptight spinster judge and learns to relax, enjoy motherhood and let her hair down sometimes. She goes from feeling very plain to feeling like a desireable woman thanks to Travis's attentions.I really liked the western frontier setting in the book, the author did a great job of bringing it to life. The romance really doesn't heat up until half way through the book due to the storyline, but I enjoyed reading about Travis and Crystal's adjustments to life together and how they got to know each other before falling in love. There were a few small annoyances, mainly Crystal's black and white views about the law and her unbending attitude. Travis did annoy me a little too, he expected Crystal to accept something that would have gone against her principles but he seemed to be choosing his brother over her at that point. Everything turns out okay and Crystal learns how to bend a little more, so I wasn't too bothered by the little things.Overall, this was a good western romance with a spinster heroine who marries a man to gain a son and a home - and manages to find love and acceptance from a good man. The hero overcomes his grief and finds life and love again through the help of the couragous heroine"},{"Title":"Las llanuras del transito","review":"All this saga is absolutely worth reading.you will not be dissapointed, I am a fan since book one.Great author"},{"Title":"Las llanuras del transito","review":"I love this book, in English or in Spanish.

The couple who adopted her were fabulous parents. They were good to her beyond all measure and loved her unconditionally. Unfortunately, Sarah has never been able to accept that love, let alone return any of it. The story she tells, however, of the search for her birth parents becomes more and more fascinating as the pages turn..... It is quite a story, and by the end of the book I felt that she had come to terms with who these people were and are, but the adoptive parents are still out there someplace, wondering what happened to the little girl they adopted and loved. Sad story."},{"Title":"The Book of Sarahs","review":"This book tells the tale of Catherine McKinley's search for her birth parents. McKinley, who is biracial, was adopted at birth. Brought up in a White family, she found herself drawn towards African American culture in her search for building her own identity. As an adult, questions about who she was and how she came to be gradually took over the focus of her life. In this book, she details how she searched for her birth parents and eventually found them, as well as other family members.From reading the blurb on the back cover of the book, I had expected the book to focus more on McKinley's experiences of growing up as an adopted biracial child. I have very little experience myself with issues relating to adoption, and I had no idea how consuming the questions of identity and family can be for an adopted child. Prospective adoptive parents might learn quite a bit from this book about how adopted children may have an unquenchable thirst for knowing their birth parents, a thirst that can taint relationships between them and their adopted family members if not handled appropriately. Adoptees, on the other hand, may be quite interested to read how McKinley proceeded in her search, and how the results of her search compared with her dreams. The emotional issues concerning adoption are never easy to reconcile; after all, every adoption starts with a tragedy that has resulted in parents having to give up their children. The children and all of their parents, both adopted and birth, must spend the remainder of their lives putting the pieces back together."},{"Title":"The Book of Sarahs","review":"I beg to differ with some of the other customer reviews posted for The Book of Sarahs. Reality is messy. Members of the adoption triad--birthparents, adoptees, and adoptive parents--share a complicated, emotionally charged relationship from the moment the adoptee is born. There are one thousand and one reasons why birthmothers feel that relinquishment is the best possible choice for their child; there are just as many reasons why adoptive parents choose to raise a non-biological child. But the adoptee has the most to gain or lose. In my twenty-six years as a birthmother, I am continually amazed by the infinite variety of paths triad members have traveled, yet we're all connected by the same feelings of uncertainty, wistfulness, and longing for what might have been. Thankfully, adoption today is much more open, kinder, gentler; many studies have documented the impact of adoption on all triad members, and there are fewer black holes than there were a generation or more ago. Catherine McKinley's personal story of life as an adopted Black child raised in a white family and predominately white community will captivate readers. One does not have to a member of the adoption community to appreciate her search for self. Ms. McKinley's prose is a pleasure to read, a beautifully, richly written story of relationships that readers will find hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Book of Sarahs","review":"Catherine McKinsley utilizes her never sentimental to write this wonderful memoir. In this book, Catherine tells her true story. As a transracial adoptee, Catherine has spent eight years to search her \\"true\\" families, including her \\" mother and father, sisters and half-sisters. It is a wonderful book. A review says that \\"Catherine takes us through the tortured labyrinth of American racial and ethnic divides and miraculously makes us glad we took the trip.\\" I disagree. I don't think it is a book about American diversity issues in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is just a book about Catherine's search of her \\"true\\" family history. I admire her persistence to search and her courage to tell the world about her experience. However I feel extremely sorry for the McKinsleys, Catherine's adopted parents and brother (William). They love her by heart, but it is so hard for them to show their love to her. Catherine refuses to accept their love. I think it is not easy to be an adopted parents, especially Catherine's adopted parents. She refuses to accept them. When I read the chapters about the confrontations and conflicts between Catherine and her adopted mother, I almost cry out and tell her, \\"Stop it! Why aren't you be nice to your mother? Why are you so hard on her? What do you want from her? It is OK for you to look for your birth mother, but you don't have to be so hard on your adopted mother.\\" It is so unfair to her adopted parents. Catherine is now a renowned writer. I hope that she feels thankful to her adopted parents. It is them who gave her a very wonderful life and chance to be an educated person."},{"Title":"The Book of Sarahs","review":"Catherine went searching for the truth and she found it. It was reality and not a made up story with a happy ending. I believe that she was very self serving in telling the story. I felt she did not really appreciate the parents who raised her, until the very end. I wondered how they felt after reading this book. She certainly laid out all her complaints about them. I personally could relate to her mother, who was doing the very best she could for a rather unappreciative daughter.On the other hand, I think I gained some insight to what it was like to grow up black in a white world, not easy at all. I'm glad she was able to tell this story with as much depth and clarity as she did.This story also brings to light the plight of the children of a middle class woman who had several children and didn't choose to acknowledge or care for them. What about birth control? Yes, she was mentally ill, but I wonder if we can excuse her for that.In the last several years I have done the research that reunited my husband (in his 60's) with the birth mother who gave him up. The search was very interesting and it was a miracle how it all came together. The story has a bittersweet ending, since his birth mother passed away within a year of their reunion.This is a great story and I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Book of Sarahs","review":"This is a very interesting, readable account of a biracial adoptee's search for her birth parents. Growing up, she fixates on the idea of an imaginary but vividly detailed African-American birth mother. Finding out that her actual birth mother is white is only the first shift she must make in her outlook. Subsequent revelations shatter some other expectations, but there are some happy surprises too. Every step of the way, though, the relatives she turns up are actual people, with histories and flaws and good points and bad points, not one-dimensional characters ecstatically welcoming the lost sheep.It wasn't a major point in the book, but I just had to laugh when the author described her lack of enthusiasm for the adoptive family's hiking and birdwatching expeditions, even though she was adopted as a baby. A very funny nature/nurture case study."},{"Title":"The Book of Sarahs","review":"I read Catherine McKinley's Indigo first and The Book of Sarahs second, again a tale of searching for her life in color and history.

Catherine's story is searingly honest, human, passionate and moving. Inspite of being extremely busy I could not put it down from the time it was delivered until 3am when I had finished it. This tour de force not only addresses issues of adoption, identity, race and prejudice but also how one's environment and circumstances affect one's own perception of events and experiences. It is the best book I have read in years!"},{"Title":"The Book of Sarahs","review":"It can be hard enough to come to terms with family and identity when one is not adopted. Imagine growing up the transracial adoptee of a white family in a tiny working class town in rural Massachusetts (read: all white). Moreover, you are biracial and subject to putdowns and jibes by &quot;full-blooded&quot; members of your race. This background makes up the first part of Catherine McKinley's compulsively readable memoir. The second part is her search for her roots, and her reckoning when she finds those roots and they are not quite what she expected.McKinley has a superb ear for dialogue and mood. Moreover, The Book of Sarahs is so full of suprises that sometimes it's like reading a thriller. McKinley starts out by giving us her fantasy of her birth mother that carried her through her youth (most adoptees have one)...and part of the fun of the book is seeing just how different reality is from her fantasy, again and again. McKinley also writes with wonderful humor and subtle characterizations that make it difficult to dislike anyone in her book despite their foibles. Finally, I can't agree with other reviewers that McKinley was cruel to her adoptive family. Her adoptive parents clearly understood her journey, and by the end of the book she intimated that she had resolved her issues with them.Don't miss this one...one of the best I've read this year!"},{"Title":"The Book of Sarahs","review":"This book works as great literature. It contains all the elements of successful literature. More than that, anyone could relate to it. I am not bi, nor bi-racial, nor adopted. However, this book invoked in me actual feelings. It is the only book that has ever caused me to physically feel what the author felt. McKinley writes in an impassioned, lyric way. I will definitely buy this book, even though I had already checked it out of the library and read it. Her language is powerful. The author has re-invigorated the memoir market. This book is memoir at its best."},{"Title":"A Photographic Guide to Trees of Britain and Europe (Photographic Guides)","review":"i would not recommend this book for anyone who is intereseted in identifying the trees in the field.

Like ours it was a time of tremendous confusion, bitter conflict, profound questioning, and the rejection of traditional values. But the values that are breaking down in our time - the belief in progress, trust in science, faith in education, commitment to tolerance, and respect for the individual - are paradoxically the very values that appeared in embryonic form during the seventeenth century. Reading about the past cannot provide solutions to present problems, but to know how human beings once lived and thought and to understand the ambitions, fears and beliefs that motivated their actions throws light on our own behavior, if only by way of contrast.These are the subjects explored in this volume. Since the unifying link between them all is Francis Mercury van Helmont, the book begins and ends with him.Additional reference:The Alphabet of Nature: By F.M.

However, it is also to be taken with a grain of salt, but I believe that anyone interested in a book of this nature already has that in mind.This book doesn't have much else to offer regarding the Zodiac other than descriptions and compatibilities. There is nothing regarding drawing up charts or the like. But again, someone interested in this book can readily see this.

Once again Sharon Gillenwater has written characters that are believable. Most secular romances these days are nothing but one sex scene after another and most of the Christian romances are too virtuous to be real. Ms. Gillenwater tells a story involving emotions and passion without all of the lewd descriptions, and God is at the center of the relationship without the characters being portrayed as near-perfect people. Both the characters of Selena and Gabriel have many faults and issues that they must work through, some of which are relevent today as well. Thank you, Ms. Gillenwater for a delightful read."},{"Title":"Highland Call","review":"Highland Call is a spectacular book filled with adventure, romance, and suspense. I have read books of all kinds and I must say this is one that I come back to time and time again. Ms. Gillenwater develops the characters in such a way that you feel like they are your good friends. You care about what happens to each and every one of them. Unlike secular romance, Highland Call enforces good morals; but unlike many other Christian novels, the relationships are not dry and boring. The characters are Christian without being unrealistically good. They struggle with right and wrong just as each of us do. The book is well written so you can follow it easily and you don't get characters mixed up. I highly recommend it for anyone and everyone looking for a great read."},{"Title":"Highland Call","review":"\\"Highland Call\\" is a magnificent improvement over Gillenwater's previous book, \\"Song of the Highlands\\"! To be honest, after reading the first novel, I would NOT have even considered reading the second, except for the fact that I had already bought the second before even reading the first (I get a little over-zealous with my book purchasing sometimes ;). Almost immediately after beginning Highland Call, I was totally amazed at what I found - Gillenwater had learned to create true depth in her characters in a way that was lacking before, causing you to really care for them! She had learned to write dialogue and details in a much more realistic and interesting way! The previous book was so cheesy I could hardly stand it, but Highland Call was a book I truly enjoyed reading, and even learning from. After finishing it I found myself thinking about the characters from time to time, and wishing that there was more to read about them - which to me is a definite sign of a good book!"},{"Title":"Highland Call","review":"Ms. Gillenwater continues to amaze me with her tales of the Highlands.

It evokes tears and soul-deep compassion for these two &quot;very real&quot; characters.Sharon's skill was really shining in this book; her logic in how the plot played out was dead-on and kept me turning those pages as if I were eating the book.The climax was full of tension and suspense, the ending beautiful and satisfying.

The storyline is different and it draws you in, and the characters are real. I loved that there were so many different characters in the book, and that we got to see into their lives and learn about them. Although, I found out there was a first book that accompanied this book, this book can definitely stand alone.One thing I did not like about this book, was how much background was given in the beginning. At times I felt that book was slowed down because of all the details, but as I kept reading it definitely picked up a bit, and I see that the author was just setting the scene. I also wished the author wrote a little bit more about the character's relationship with Christ, there were some references to it, but not as much as I would have liked.Storyline:Selena Delaroe is a spy for Napoleon, but not by choice she is being forced to spy for him and against England because they are holding her twin brother Nicholas in prison. When Gabriel Macpherson, a Scot sees Selena for the first time, he falls in love.

But what Gabriel discovers is not what he wanted to find, now he must decide to help Selena or be called a traitor to his country as well.

Lori Foster's Some Like It Hot has Dr. Cary Rupert trying to prove to Nora Chilton that he is the perfect man for her. Cary is very convincing to the reluctant widow Nora of how the two of them are perfect for each other. There's no way she could resist. In One Wilde Weekend, Janelle Denison brings us Alex Wilde, of the infamous Wilde family, who wants a permanent commitment from girlfriend Dana Reed. A hot read in which Alex is very creative in proving his love to Dana. Blue Crush by Erin McCarthy has a topless Dr. Sara Davis saved by lifeguard Kyle Vanderhoff. The steam rises quickly between these two. MaryJanice Davidson's contribution is My Thief, wherein Robin Filkins and responsible accountant John Crusher are brought together under unusual circumstances and with lots of humor; in the process they fall in love. This was my first story by Ms. Davidson, but it won't be my last. Another first for me was author Kayla Perrin whose Hot and Bothered has Trey Arnold trying to save his marriage to estranged wife Jenna Maxwell. Jenna is hesitant to try again with Trey, but he is very willing to please! Very well done. Morgan Leigh completes the book with Murphy's Law. Kat Murphy is in love with her boss, Sam Parrish, and quits her job after deciding that he will never get over his deceased wife. Sam will do whatever it takes to prove to Kat that he wants her in his life permanently. A heartwarming story. This was a very enjoyable book by some of my favorite authors and two that were new to me. My only complaint would be that the stories weren't long enough - I wasn't ready for any of them to end.

I was looking for the perfect no-fuss book with some soft erotica to take with me for a sunbathing session, and this one satisfied me to no end (so to speak). I have read almost every Bad Boy offering, so I knew what to expect. I loved it! My favorite stories are the ones by Janelle Denison, MaryJanice Davidson and Erin McCarthy. Janice Denison's One Wilde Weekend has the yummiest scenes in the book. Even though the whole sexual escapade inside an airplane bathroom thing has been done numerous times before, the aforementioned scene is nevertheless hot. Denison's descriptions are quite palpable. And I love the fact that Dana Reed, the novella's heroine, is strong and independent, albeit vulnerable about trusting Alex Wilde with her heart. The aforementioned dilemma is one that Denison has written about many times before, but I loved the way she's addressed it this time. My second favorite is MaryJanice Davidson's My Thief. This story is full of Davidson's signature bantering and low-brow humor. The story isn't as creative as her other stuff, but it's nonetheless fun. The conclusion is a bit abrupt though. Erin McCarthy's Blue Crush and Kayla Perrin's Hot and Bothered sizzled in their own right, as had Morgan Leigh's Murphy's Law. The only disappointment here is Lori Foster's Some Like it Hot. This story is a revised version of every other Foster offering. The story isn't bad -- just too similar to her other stuff. You read one Lori Foster book or story and you've read them all.

Other stories, like Lori Foster's SOME LIKE IT HOT, had the perfect mix of sensual love scenes, emotions and very likable characters. Mary Janice Davidson's story, MY THEIF, had her trademark quirky, offbeat characters that you can't help but fall in love with. Kayla Perrin's story, HOT AND BOTHERED was a wonderfully heartwarming story that reunited two characters that had never stopped loving each other. Janelle Denison's story, ONE WILDE WEEKEND, adds new meaning to the mile-high club! What a hot and sensual story with wonderful characters. I highly recommend reading Morgan Leigh's story, MURPHY'S LAW. I fell in love with the hero from this story.There is something for everyone in this anthology. It would be hard for me to pick just one favorite out of all six stories, but I guarantee you won't be disappointed with this collection of fun, steamy and heartwarming love stories that are all perfect!"},{"Title":"Perfect for the Beach (Dean Brothers)","review":"\\"Some Like It Hot\\" were scorching. I thought Nora was just plain adorable, and who wouldn't want a sexy guy like Cary pursuing her?! I enjoyed how the hero's friends got involved when feelings were revealed. It adds a wonderful mixture of humor to an intense romance. Loved it!Janelle Denison's \\"Wilde Weekend\\" was a wonderful, refreshing story in that the heroine was a bit older and it was already an established romance. I really liked how Janelle didn't create unnecessary, lame conflict but rather had the h/h deal with their feelings upfront, which made it more rewarding. Plus, it was another story about those sexy Wilde men, and who doesn't enjoy them?!If ever I'm at the beach and suffer from a similar dilemma, I hope that a hottie lifeguard like Kyle is there to rescue me! ;) Very hot, and Sara was a very lucky woman. Plus, smart is very sexy. \\"Blue Crush\\" was a decadent, wonderful treat, and perfect for the beach.\\"My Thief\\" was funny and romantic and charming - and of course hot! - and reinforces my admiration of Mary Janice Davidson's writing. Robin was a firecracker, and Johnny Crusher was irresistible from their first encounter. And I can't forget to mention Uncle Rich - what a hoot!\\"Hot and Bothered\\" is the first story I've read by Kayla Perrin, but it won't be my last. I really liked Trey from the first moment I \\"met\\" him, and I thought Jenna was a sensitive, lovely woman with a passionate heart that truly belonged to Trey. Their story was sexy and sweet, and I breathed a sigh of happiness at their HEA. I hope Ruby gets her own story!I forgot how much I wanted to read about Kat & Sam, secondary characters from your Wild Dreams anthology, until I started reading their story. Wow, Sam was devastating (in a sexy, intense way, of course), and I felt for Kat as a caring woman who didn't want to cause the man she loved emotional pain. \\"Murphy's Law\\" was a little bittersweet, but that enhanced their romance, and I was eagerly anticipating the moment they would finally give into their feelings. It was well worth it.I loved this anthology, and each story was a gem."},{"Title":"Perfect for the Beach (Dean Brothers)","review":"Okay girls, hold onto your seats you're in for a fun ride!!!! First off if the cover has \\"Lori Foster\\" or \\"Janelle Denison\\" or \\"Erin McCarthy\\" on it you're in for a good read! Add \\"Mary Janice Davidson\\", \\"Morgan Leigh\\", and Kayla Perrin and you're automatically looking at a fun, hot, sexy read! My only complaint? The stories aren't long enough!!!! I want more! I know when will my greed end?!I really can't pick a favorite story from the seven offered, all were great in their individual way. This was the first time I've ever read multi-cultural Kayla Perrin so she was a treat for me. I look forward to picking her up again.Otherwise Ms. Davidson keeps up her tradition of quirky charactes and fast-paced dialouge. Ms. Foster...what can you say about Lori except it's Lori!! No summer would be complete without adding her to your reading list. Ms. Denison gives us another Wilde brother and one hot read, and Ms. McCarthy adds her two cents worth of steam and summer fun with the antics of Dr. Sara Davis. Ms. Leigh continues her series she started in the \\"Wildest Dreams\\" anthology (fear not although I have that book in my 'must read' pile out on the sun porch I haven't made it that far yet. So if you haven't read it yet like me you won't be lost) and it's great. I can hardly wait to read the first in the series. Something would be wrong if I read a series in order!This book as stated earlier offers seven very fast reads. Don't look for indepth storylines...there's not enough time. Despite this or maybe because of this it's easy to put down and pick up again. I highly recommend this read to anyone who likes their stories short and steamy...I mean sweet...okay I mean both!

Nora has worked for fellow Dr and friend Axel Dean for almost a year. Cary overhears Nora's reasons for not dating him and this gives him a plan to win her. Some like it hot has everything you look for in a Foster book, passion, family, friends and laughter.One Wilde Weekend brings another member of the infamous Wilde family by Janelle Denison. Alex Wilde takes his girlfriend of a year, Dana Reed away for the weekend. Alex is ready for a commitment but needs to find out what is holding Dana back. This Wilde tale makes you want for more.Erin McCarthy's Blue Crush has Dr. Sara Davis looking to change her save image with a day at the beach. She doesn't plan on losing her bikini top in the surf and being rescued by hunky lifeguard Kyle Vanderhoff. Their attraction to each other is off the charts and their conversations will make you laugh and blush.

Robin Filkins has been playing a game of cat and mouse with her uncle for years. But now she is the one who gets caught by sexy John.

Kate is a sassy woman and has met her match in Sam. Morgan Leigh brings out all the works to make this story grab your heart and your funny bon."},{"Title":"Perfect for the Beach (Dean Brothers)","review":"\\"Some Like It Hot\\" Lori Foster - Okay, personal gripe here; do all fictional Noras have to be so plain? I mean I'm an almost six foot tall redheaded Amazon and most Noras I know are just as off beat as I. Yet Nora Chilton is a BORINGLY shy sexually repressed widow who is seduced by the Doctor next door. Weak plot, no steam, but the romance is believable.\\"One Wilde Weekend\\" Janelle Dennison - This is the (excuse me while I laugh myself to death) story of a man who wants commitment and the woman who only wants hot wild-weasel sex from him. Pardon me again while I bust a gut. Dana and Alex work up some really hot sex but the romance is DOA, probably because this set up wouldn't even happen in Bizarro-land.\\"Blue Crush\\" Erin McCarthy - A really imaginative tale that stands out in the genre for our hero Kyle is a lowly lifeguard and Sara, his fantasy woman trapped with him at the station during a storm is a heroic ER doctor. I defy anyone to NOT enjoy this, the romance is great, the sex is great and I would actually love to see this story fleshed out into a full romance novel some day.\\"My Thief\\" MaryJanice Davidson - This story is missing the mark on humor, though it tries. It's still an enjoyably, if dis-jointed, a tale about a master thief Robin in a screwball dare game with her uncle that leads her to break into John's room for a little light-hearted intrigue and some hot sex. Still, it is so dis-jointed (scenery is never described, the motivations for characters other than \\"me horny\\" are never discussed) that I'd recommend some Tylenol before reading it, even if the characters carry off the plot without benefit of emotions or setting.\\"Hot and Bothered\\" Kayla Perrin - Like many authors of the Essence and related \\"minority\\" driven lines there's too much focus on culture. Okay, so most romances are about white people but is there long dwelling on Anglo-Saxon traditions, wondering if you're Irish and he's Italian could it work out? Yeah, right. So if you're Cuban and he's Puerto Rican just chill out and enjoy the romance. Cultural issues sort of cloud the steam here and the romance is very slow to start between Trey and Jenna, soon-to-be ex spouses who fall in love over divorce papers.\\"Murphy's Law\\" Morgan Leigh - Kat Murphy, too meek to confess her love to her boss, quits her job and to console herself goes to the beach. Her boss Sam Parrish follows and there on the beach they shed their buttoned-up personas for summer lover identities. The sex is mostly predictable but the plot is intriguing, the romance I would have to rate as \\"Meh\\" - neither good nor bad."},{"Title":"Perfect for the Beach (Dean Brothers)","review":"This anthology was unlike any I'd read before. There are 6 authors, and at first I wasn't certain I'd feel fulfilled. However, it turned out to be a fun book. The stories are quick and if you are like me, sometimes it's nice to take a break from the long, intense romance stories and read something you can finish in one sitting. As a mom, I don't have loads of time to read, so this was a nice change of pace for me.The most exciting stories were Foster's, McCarthy's, and Denison's. Those women know how to write a quick romance and leave you with a feeling of contentment.Fast Fun Stories For The Road!!"},{"Title":"Perfect for the Beach (Dean Brothers)","review":"With a book like this with six authors presenting short stories, they are going to not only be short on written pages, but also on either (or both) plot and character development. You have that here with some of the stories. The first is \\"Some Like It Hot\\" by Lori Foster. It is about a hot, hunky doctor who falls for a plain Jane type, but in this case, it is a plain Nora (do things like this really happen, I don't think so). Sure, it is sweet, but not believable.\\"One Wilde Weekend\\" by Janelle Denison is the second story. It is about Alex Wilde who wants to commit to his commitment-phobic girlfriend, Dana Reed. Does the girl usually not want the commitment? Again, not very believable. Especially when the guy is a hunk and he has a good job to boot. Just an ok read.\\"Blue Crush\\" by Erin McCarthy is the third story. Can Erin McCarthy write a terrible story? No, I don't think so and this one just proves it again. She has a winning combination of humor, romance, and plot. Dr. Sara Davis wants to lose her reputation as boring by having a wild fling with a stranger that she meets at the beach. Instead, she finds herself being rescued by lifeguard Kyle Vanderhoof with nothing more than her bikini bottoms on. Very cute and humorous story. The best of the bunch!\\"My Thief\\" by MaryJanice Davidson was another so-so read. It is about Robin, a female thief, and John Crusher, an accountant who meet when Robin hides out in his hotel room to escape hotel management after she robs her uncle. MaryJanice does a great job with humor and very few do popular culture references better, but this story falls flat. There is little character development, setting background, nothing.\\"Hot and Bothered\\" by Kayla Perrin was the most unbelievable of them all. Jenna Maxwell comes back to Florida two years later to get a divorce from her husband, Trey Arnold. Both of them have not been with another person for two years. Enough said, very unbelievable plot!\\"Murphy's Law\\" by Morgan Leigh was a better story. Kat Murphy is in love with her lawyer boss, Sam Parrish, but the handsome widower may never be able to get over the tragic death of his wife. Kat decides that she needs to get over Sam instead so she quits her job and goes on vacation to a friend's beach house. But she never expects Sam to follow her. Not much on character development, but it was a very sensual read."},{"Title":"Perfect for the Beach (Dean Brothers)","review":"These stories entertained, satisfied and kept me coming back for the next one.

They're sort of like a snickers bar for your libido -a little guilty pleasure. Some are laugh out loud funny and some will make wish the book was water-proof for a cold shower.

I love reading anthologies because you get to meet new authors. All of these ladies did a wonderful job and I would recommend this book for everyone. 'Some Like It Hot' is another great story of from Lori. I enjoyed watching their relationship unfold and the way Carey did not give up on his love for Nora. In Janelle Denison's 'One Wilde Weekend', we get to read Alex Wilde's story. Alex and Dana go away on a weekend vacation and Alex wants to convince Dana to take the next step in their relationship. I loved reading how Sara and Kyle met in Erin's 'Blue Crush'. This story has one funny thing after another happening to her hero and heroine. I have not read anything before by MaryJanice Davidson or Kayla Perrin, but I will now. In 'My Thief' by MaryJanice Davidson we get to meet John, a law-abiding citizen, minding his own business when he was dragged into his own hotel room by Robin, whom is being hunted for by hotel security. It was fun to watch the story unfold. In 'Hot and Bothered' by Kayla Perrin, I enjoyed reading what lengths Trey goes through to get his wife back. 'Murphy's Law' by Morgan Leigh was great.

(Manga University Presents)","review":"Ok to start off this book is simply awesome. It teaches you about 80 kanji (almost enough for JLPT 4 [see back of the book])and gives you about 2 or 3 compunds per page. Now like many people i was turned off by the slightly kiddy way this book is laid out (this and kana de manga get you strange looks in 8th grade). But nonetheless it is a great book. It teaches you some interesting ways of using the language, it's less like the phrase book for a trip and more like something to help you read overpriced untranslated manga. It's odd look gives it a feel not quite unlike less serious anime (cough FLCL cough). As many people will tell you this book is for the purists (no romaji , just an english translation) This book uses entirely Kana, which is good if you want to improve your vocabualary and reading skills. Which brings us to one flaw i must simply adress: NO GLOSSARY! there is nothing to help people who don't have a dictionary (you should but then again this book should have a glossary or atleast an appendix of translated words). Also without a dictionary you won't get some of the compunds. For example on page 77 there is no indication that ki o tsukeru would mean be careful, Since ki is the Kanji (spirit/gas) most people would be confused since there is nothing about this in the compund section. Still those are only minor gripes wich can be soulved with the purchase of a fairly inexpensive dictionary."},{"Title":"Kanji De Manga Volume 1: The Comic Book That Teaches You How To Read And Write Japanese! (Manga University Presents)","review":"A good workbook for learning Kanji. It shows each character, what it means, and how to draw it. I wish it would have the meaning of each character written in Romagi as well, I found myself adding that myself, but that's not a big deal. My only serious complaint is regarding the last half of the book which is for practicing drawing the characters. There is no suggestion as to how this section should be used. A character or two to copy from on each page would have helped tremendously. As it is there isn't even a single line suggesting how to use the section effectively, just 50 pages of graph paper. You can flip back and fourth between the page in the front displaying the character you want to learn and the back where you try to draw it, but this is extremely awkward. Especially for someone who is left handed such as myself. I ended up practicing each character on the page describing it."},{"Title":"Kanji De Manga Volume 1: The Comic Book That Teaches You How To Read And Write Japanese! (Manga University Presents)","review":"While I do like these books, and I have found them to be useful in my and my families learning of kanji, they are organized in a completely non-sensical way. At the back of each book, they proclaim that they are useful in studying for the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficieny Test) exams. They are useful.. just not comprehensive.For example, Volume 1, which has 80 kanji in it to learn, (despite what the paragraph at the back of the book says) is NOT the full list of kanji you would need to learn to pass the first level exam (JLPT4). The JLPT4 test requires 103 kanji at the current time, as well as like 700 vocab words, and basic grammar and listening skills. If you were to just study this book, and nothing else, you would surely fail.At first I thought maybe the authors had just made an error and meant to say that the books were organized loosely based on the elementary school grade level. However, this is also not true. An example of this is &#33457;&#12288;(&#12399;&#12394;&#12288;\\"hana\\") which is a grade level 1 kanji taught to first graders, but is in fact in Volume 2.The only other glaring problem I've found with these books is the lack of any sort of English definition lookup or table of contents. While you can look the kanji up if you know the spelling in kana, being able to look it up in English would've been really nice. However, the books are cheap and fun and pretty easy to use."},{"Title":"Kanji De Manga Volume 1: The Comic Book That Teaches You How To Read And Write Japanese! (Manga University Presents)","review":"Let me be clear, this manga, along with all other graphic novels is useless on the regular 6\\" kindle! Books in comic format cannot have text enlarged, to make matters worse, the way each page displays, it leaves an inch of blank border around each page to accomodate the page counter. This is a great book, but be sure to buy it in paperback format.

I have the book in one window and an online dictionary in the other (www.jisho.org). Add a piece of scrap paper to practice writing and you're ready to learn some kanji, AND, if you're up for it, a lot of interesting little tidbits of vocabulary and colloquial speech from the manga panels if you're willing to parse them out on your own with the online dictionary.I agree with others that it would be great if they used previously learned kanji in the context of subsequent chapters, but they don't and that's the way it is. This is not a deeply thought-out system of integrated learning by any means, but as one resource among many, it's a lot of fun and very helpful. 'Yes' to needing other books as well, 'yes' to using flashcards, online resources of all types, speaking with natives and other students, listening to Pimsleur on the way to work and so on and so on. This book should in no way be considered your one stop solution for learning Japanese!Learning is pro-active, and something we have to persue for ourselves, as doggedly as we can. There is really no simple or effortless way to learn Japanese.

They allow for quick learning and show stroke order in detail for everyone of the characters. The problem is that they do not give enough information, like how use verbs in sentences when they have been conjugated. Also, they are not very good for people who aren't very fluent in the language because of the Japanese used in the examples. I do appreciate that all of it is in Hiragana and Katakana, which provides good practice, but would pose a problem for people who do not now kana. This is good book for people who are interesting in Japanese, but I would not recommend it for people who intend on becoming fluent in the language, not to mention as of now there is only 4 volumes, and a fifth one on the way.

Of course, you learn 80 kanji and 160 combination kanji, but it's hard for beginners to read the manga inputs because it contains each one drawn out scene that contains the newly learned kanji. But, in there... it's written in hiragana and katakana along with the kanji. Of course, there's an english translation. But, it's written at teh buttom of teh page and doesn't pacifiy each hiragana and katakana combination's meaning.Though, if you know your katakana and hiragana already it's fun to write out what everything says and figure out the english meaning later, or maybe you already know it. So, it's also good to work around with if you're not a complete beginner.Kanji De Manga is good to follow for those who are determinded to learn kanji, you can practice your kanji and make little flash cards. (like I did.. and it's REALLY helpful for memorization and in my opnion, quite fun.)And for those who don't know their hiragana nor katakana I only knows 1 or the other, I suggest \\"Kana de Manga\\", it's a REALLY good book to learn your hiragana and katakana, along with their meanings.

Luckily I realized that being so obviously disgusting a style it took not so much effort to ignore that part and focus only on the information about her experiences as journalist, in the same way that you get accustomed to the noise of cars in the street.Anita Pratap has interviewed on several occasions to Prabhakaran, leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and has lived from close range the anti-Tamil incidents happened in Colombo in July 1983 and the situation in Jaffna during the late 80s. Her experiences are valid and provide interesting information to understand the evolution of the Singhalese-Tamil conflict.The same as you remove the stylistic noise you must read it carefully since she is far from objective when it comes to Prabhakaran and the conflict. In my case, my previous information was strongly biased to the Singhalese side, and therefore I thanked the opposite view, though I absolutely don't agree with her fan-like attitude towards the guerrilla leader. She describes the fight for Tamil Eelam as a romantic fight for freedom and justice. Unfortunately reality is different, and although I don't know enough about the origins of the conflict, its costs for innocent Singhalese and Tamil citizens are unjustifiable. It seems to me more an excessive obsession of a visionary than the real wish of the Tamil minority in Sri Lanka.I recommend reading this book, in a critical mode and without great expectations. Unfortunately there are not as many books about this conflict and the Sri Lankan history of the 80s and 90s as there are for other conflicts."},{"Title":"Island of Blood","review":"Ms. Pratap's intimate knowledge of the conflicts in Sri Lanka and Afghanistan are instrumental in the success of Island of Blood. Filled with intimate details of the LTTE, Island of Blood provides a great deal of insight into the conflict battered nation of Sri Lanka. Whether or not you are familiar with the situation in Sri Lanka, Ms. Pratrap does a wonderful job of presenting an easy to read version of the story. I highly recommend this book because of the intimate details that aren't available anywhere else."},{"Title":"Island of Blood","review":"Anita Pratap is a highly respected journalist in India, and this book details much of her experience covering the conflict in Sri Lanka, and also Afghanistan; she also covers Hindu-Muslim rioting in India, natural disasters, and in a more broad way, problems of women and children in South Asia. First, the positives - this is a very readable book, and has some of the best accounts of the Sri Lankan conflict that I've read so far (although short of critical analysis and historical perspective). She is an intrepid and incredibly brave journalist, and she goes to great lengths to get the story and in several cases, help her subjects. Now, the negatives: she tells us over and over again how lucky she is, what a charmed life she enjoys when she's not on the battlefield. Get over yourself, I wanted to say. It's a bit self-centered, when you compare it to the grimness of what she's reporting about. Needless to say, her transitions from her life to wars, etc are jarring. 'I was strolling along, smelling flowers. How unlike the smell of burning human flesh in Colombo.\\" (This is a parody of her prose, but not far off.) Ugh. She repeats this kind of phrasing many times. I almost tossed the book aside in the first 50 or so pages, when she goes on and on about traveling with her son and being beset by leeches. Who cares? She makes up for it with the war reportage, though. My last quibble about that reportage was that she does almost no analysis, and seems to come to no conclusions. I find that a bit dishonest, given everything she's seen. Overall, an excellent read, particularly if you're interested in the Sri Lankan civil war, and you can overlook the author's self-centered prose, and often mangled constructions. One example (a quote): \\"Like her husband's corpse, bits and pieces of Rahima's hopes lay strewn all around her.\\" Omigod, that is soooooooooo bad."},{"Title":"Island of Blood","review":"Anita Pratap gives an exclusive view of LTTE and its leader, Mr.Prabhakaran. There is no journalist other than Anita that has so much access to LTTE and have given an inside look into the mind of world's most elusive man, Prabhakarn. She has taken extreme step to visit all the hot spots of the Indian Subcontinent. Her instincts about LTTE were correct when she met them in 1986."},{"Title":"Island of Blood","review":"I have to admit that as a student of history and political science, who is quite familiar with the sri lanka question, this book thoroughly disappointed me. Let me argue why.First, there is a stylistic problem. I am familar with a number of journalists who write autobiographical-political works- Fergal Keane, Kate Adie, John Simpson and so on. Their work is imbued with both a sense of humility and an understanding of the larger context within which they've reported. Pratap is hugely self centred- her journalistic endeavours centre around her, and her alone; her subjects are there to make her sense of empathy evident, and to remind her how important her son is.That's the other problem with this book: her son. He's everywhere. And there's a hint of family politics where she constantly degrades her husband's son Marcus as a boorish sulking 18 year old whereas her boy is bright, sparkling and witty. It's dirty linen that need not have been washed in public.Third, each of the chapters have the same setting. She begins by describing something totally out of context, like a luxurious holiday or a car drive, and then something triggers off a memory of Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Bangladesh..wherever, and she plunges into that story. Such a device used in one chapter is fine, but used repeatedly sounds like a lack of imagination.Now to her content: deeply flawed in it. She seems utterly enamoured of Prabhakaran and devotes most of the book to him. Those who suffered under him, including LTTE leader like Mahatiya, or under Tamilians or Sinhalese are given no agency. While her hair raising attempts to interview Prabhakaran make for interesting reading, she's hardly ruthless or even unbiased in questioning him. One leaves with the sense of Prabhakaran as the 'messiah of Sri Lankan Tamils' whereas in reality, while he was once a true hero, much of that aura has faded- he's now merely a terrorist who can't come to term with democratic politics and whose bloody politics only shames and demeans the cause he tries to promote. Pratap's inability to see through Prabhakaran makes this book less than balanced.The bits on dowry, the Latur quake and the flood in Bangladesh are well written. But the idea of such a book is to leave it humbled, to feel that one's own problems are superficial in the face of so much plight. This book doesn't let you do that, simply because Pratap, instead of subtly presenting this argument, or letting the reader absorb the horrors of what she is saying, just keeps hammering this message in, thereby detracting from it.My advice: go read Letter to Daniel, and Letters Home by Fergal Keane or John Simpson's three part autobiography if you want magnificient journalistic accounts from some of the world's most troubled regions."},{"Title":"Island of Blood","review":"I picked up this book not realizing the impact it contained. Anita Pratap is a journalist who relentlessly pursues her stories throughout war torn areas. As a woman she is inspirational and as a fact finder a bull-dog who gets her story done. She writes with great impact telling horror stories but still managing to find a fleck of beauty that emerges in her own life from the experience.Pratap writes about dowry killings, Taliban rule and abuse, tribal wars and atrocites, class prejudices, poor people and abused children in areas like Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and India. These stories are courageous and bold and horribly real at the same time. Your heart will ache for the families that witness the horror of war killings and the pain of losing all that they own.

The sacrifice, persecution, and exhausting , demanding life of the traditional Lakota healer are fully portrayed. But the beauty that sings through in Price of a Gift is undeniable. Just to read such a book, just to know such a person lived and touched others, is profound and impacting in itself. An awareness of the core value of our lives radiates through the stories of the life of Eagle Elk. It is impossible to avoid the basic message of this book, with all its humble compassion. Without distortion, greed, evil, or pettiness, the matter of spiritual healing both as duty and joy is its glorious burden. Black Elk's vision included an awareness that the Lakota legacy would include an intrument of healing. The Price Of A Gift is evidence of that legacy. What a gift it is, to us all.Nancy Lorraine, Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Price of a Gift: A Lakota Healer's Story","review":"This is a remarkable work that honors the true voice of a Lakota medicine man and the voices of his people. Mohatt's labor is not to analyze or interpret so much as present an experience which can only begin to be appreciated or understood when the suffering, missteps, fears, and clowning of the healer are shown along with their transcendence. Eagle Elk was an ordinary man who resisted but finally gave himself over to his calling. There are many books that romanticize tokens of Native cultures or presume to make use of them; this is not that sort of book.

Mohatt's text is so close to the actual truth of the conditions on the reservation it literally scared me. That's why I had to stop reading from time to time.

The pilots who served in the RAF, and the challenge they faced, aren't covered in much detail. Rather, we're given statistics about how many were shot down during such and such a time and how many planes Britain was able to produce during the conflict.The author, Richard Overy, makes it quite clear, however, that he's not attempting to tell the comprehensive story of the Battle. Rather, he simply wants to dispel the myths surrounding this battle. &quot;The few&quot; to whom Winston Churchill attributed so much national gratitude, were actually fairly evenly matched with their enemy, the Nazi Luftwaffe. Overy doesn't dispel the notion that the British defense of their homeland was any less valiant, but he does make certain to point out discrepancies between the reality and the mythical proportions that the Battle of Britain have acquired in the years since the Blitz.In summary, if you're looking for a good, honest description of the Battle of Britain, this book will meet your needs. For a more detailed description of the events and people involved, you will have to find a more comprehensive book."},{"Title":"The Battle of Britain: The Myth and the Reality","review":"In \\"The Battle of Britain, the Myth and the Reality\\", historian Richard Overy analyzes the battle, digging deeper than the by-now traditional telling of the fighting, while discarding cherished myths and long-believed bits of propaganda, and attempting to describe what really happened in the skys of Great Britain during the late summer and fall of 1940.This is a short book, and is a high level analysis of the two sets of combatants ... the aircraft, the tactics used, the defenses on the British side, and the leaders and people on both sides, rather than a tactical, day-by-day account of the battle. While most of the \\"myths\\" Mr Overy exposes are known to serious students of the war ... such as far from being outnumbered, the British had about the same number of single engined fighters as the Germans, and had a much higher production of replacement fighters and pilots than the Germans so that they could more easily replace their losses... he presents a complete, complex strategic overview that does a far better job of showing how and why the battle was fought as it was than most longer and more tactically detailed accounts of the battle.Given the circumstances as they were in 1940, the British advantages (such as having radar and better aircraft production), and the German shortcomings (such as increasingly poor tactics as the Battle went on and the fact that every German pilot downed over Britain was lost to the war effort while the British pilots similarly shot down were often back in the air in hours), it appears very unlikely that the Germans could have won the Battle of Britain in any case. However, this was not clear to the combantants at the time, nor does this diminish the courage and sacrifices made by either side, or lessen the impact of the defensive strategic victory won by the British.I would have liked the book to have been a bit longer and perhaps have more tactical details, but these are minor nits. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to look past the popular history of the Battle of Britain and see how the fight really played out."},{"Title":"The Battle of Britain: The Myth and the Reality","review":"Well written and cohesive, but it's a scholarly analysis, lacking in emotional appeal, and a brief one at that. I'm not an exceptionally fast reader, but I finished it in less than two hours (and it put me to sleep once for about 15 minutes during that time). Almost a third of the book is references and tables.On the plus side, I agree with the conclusions drawn by Professor Overy and find no flaw in his logic or in his analysis of a very well studied subject. Words like succinct and concise come to mind."},{"Title":"The Battle of Britain: The Myth and the Reality","review":"Let me say that I believe Mr. Overy is a fine historian. His book Why the Allies Won was a solid read for why the Allies won World War II. I rate his present book as only an average read. Overy details the reality of the Battle of Britain. This is good info, if of a short duration. The reality is that this vaulted battle was a series of short campaigns which had no regular start date. Other pertinent information was that the British pilots outnumbered the Germans. The British Spitfire had more crashes than the Hurricane. Both sides (Germans and English) did not willingly target civilian targets. Hitler even forbade terror bombing. However collateral damage was very high. The British always had superiority in numbers. This is all good information for the World War II historian. This shows how people have made myths of certain historical events, when in fact the reality is different.This is a nice little book which shows reality versus myth. I wish it were longer and more detailed, but the book shows the reality of the Battle of Britain."},{"Title":"The Battle of Britain: The Myth and the Reality","review":"One of the most controversial and yet simply disarming facts about the short-lived but furiously fought air battle over the skies of England in the summer and early fall of 1940 , according to famed British historian Richard Overy in this diverting and captivating study of the now-fabled Battle Of Britain is that it was in reality not so much the marvelous and unequivocal victory as it is now regarded much as it was a stalemate. A wondrous, unlikely and fateful stalemate, to be sure, one on which the future of the so-called free world hung in the balance, but in reality it was also much more a war of perceptions and brinksmanship than has been commonly acknowledged or understood.In matter of fact, according to Overy, the air battle over Britain was never likely to have been followed by a Nazi invasion force, for the German forces lacked all the necessary marine transportation and logistics support to prosecute such an attempt to invade Britain. As William Shirer pointed out long ago in \\"The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich\\", Hitler never had much stomach for a cross-channel invasion, and the German General Staff never ordered all the necessary shipbuilding needed to mount a serious invasion attempt. In addition, the forces of the British realm were never so badly outnumbered as was previously believed, and the Royal Air Force (RAF) in fact had superior fighters and better logistics support that did their German opponents, not to mention the limited battle time for German pilots who had to ferry themselves back over the channel after doing battle, which provided the RAF with a key tactical advantage.Yet Overy's purpose here is clearly not intended to denigrate or downplay the outright heroism, courage, and sacrifice of the RAF in its service to the English people over the skies of Britain that fateful year, but rather to celebrate the actual, fact-based history of those fateful events. Here in the Battle of Britain we find the first signs that the famed \\"unstoppable\\" Nazi juggernaut was not infallible, that it could be met on its own terms and defeated, plane by plane, raid by raid, and campaign by campaign, and denied its aggressive objectives by a determined and resourceful opponent. Also, by denying the Nazis the complete victory over its western European rivals it desired, the British forced Hitler into making a fatal blunder by opening up a two-front war with the invasion of the Soviet Union the next spring, forcing him to leave millions of troops along the western wall he could have otherwise used against the Russians in Operation Barbarossa.Also, as Overy illustrates so convincingly, the British actions in the skies over their homeland convinced many in the American Government to take up Britain's cause, and this too had fateful consequences for the eventual outcome of the war. Finally, he argues that the consequences of turning back the attempts by the Nazis to gain air superiority over the skies of Britain galvanized and energized the British people with a new sense of vigor and purpose, and this was tremendously important in helping them to stay the course during a very difficult and trying period of time following the end of the battle of Britain itself. This is a great addition to the volumes of material already available on the Battle Of Britain, and presents the facts in a new and interesting way that makes it an important work which acts to clarify and modify what we already know about the events of 1940. I recommend this book, and hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Battle of Britain: The Myth and the Reality","review":"Richard Overy's &quot;The Battle of Britain: The Myth and the Reality&quot; is a truly outstanding and supremely laconic volume. In a mere 177 pages, Overy examines the image of the Battle of Britain as it has been passed down to us today and compares that image to long-available, but commonly widely-scattered facts.One of Overy's major points centers on the perception of the battle and British public reaction to it. We have been handed down an image of a unified, defiant Britain standing firm before the onslaught. Overy reveals a divided, in some senses baffled and relatively numb British public which gave its Government cause for concern (and not a few flights of irrational fancy).Of Churchill's famous speech about &quot;The Few&quot; Overy points out the reference was a small and offhand portion of a speech largely devoted to other matters which was not regarded as one of Churchill's better oratories at the time.Overy also shows how selection of the parameters of the battle in terms of time and geography distort historical perception to reinforce the myth of Fighter Command being severely outnumbered. He shows the British and German single-engine fighter counts (twin-engine fighters having been rapidly proven outclassed and irrelevant to the air superiority battle) started roughly even and subsequently diverged steadily in favor of the British.Overy illustrates &quot;The Few&quot; were not so few in comparison to their equally few German opponents, and that the numbers of the British &quot;Few&quot; steadily rose through the battle, while those of the Luftwaffe steadily fell.The idea that Fighter Command was nearly knocked about by attacks on its bases, is dispelled by the revelation of just how few British aircraft were destroyed on the ground, how light casualties on the ground were, and how quickly fields were restored to operation. Overy also reveals that the hardest hit bases were actually forward bases to support the Battle of France, not bases integral to Fighter Command's Air Defense of Great Britain.Overy also acknowledges the role of ULTRA in the Battle of Britain alongside that of radar, the Observer Corps and radio listening posts in the background of which it is often lost.As for the role of the battle in preventing an invasion (Operation Sea Lion) Overy raises the important point that even had the Luftwaffe forced Fighter Command back from SE England, it lacked the range to keep pushing it back or to stop the Royal Navy from fatally interfering with any landing attempt. Too many analyses of Sea Lion assume control of the air meant ipso facto control of the sea and forget that control of the air was merely a prelude to contesting control of the sea by air or surface forces. The Luftwaffe's ability to stop a Royal Navy intervention against a German cross-Channel landing attempt was by no means certain, particularly after failing to stop the more-vulnerable Dunkirk exodus.Overy's book is a quick, five-star, one-afternoon primer for serious students of the Battle of Britain's import. It is not a detailed tactical description of dogfights. Nor is it an effort at debunking everything known about the Battle of Britain. Rather, it is a consolidation of facts usually brought out in isolation into a single coherent tapestry that reveals a somewhat different picture than we're used to seeing.And despite substantial myth-busting, Overy's conclusion is that the Battle of Britain was a seminal moment in the war...if not in the way and for the reasons we have commonly believed. I highly recommend this very mature and realistic look at the Battle of Britain."},{"Title":"The Battle of Britain: The Myth and the Reality","review":"Movies, books and articles have narrated the Battle of Britain. Most limited their narrative to theheroic efforts of the RAF pilots, crews and commanders. Richard Overy gives the &#65533;rest of thestory&#65533; in this book providing insight into the total picture. He notes that for the British people&#65533;The Battle&#65533; meant one thing, the Battle of Britain which was the epic contest between the Britishand German air forces in the late summer and autumn of 1940.Chapter 1 observes that during the 1930s, Britain envisioned Germany delivering an airborne &#65533;knock-out blow&#65533; for which there was no defense. In response, between 1937 through 1939,millions were spent on an airborne defensive shield and an expanded Bomber Command if required for retaliation. The German strategy was to use air power in combined operations with the army to impose a decisive defeat of enemy ground forces. Britain was unprepared to meet this type of warfare. Therefore when France was attacked, Britain could supply little effective air support to aid the French. At this point, the British were not united. The author narrates the policy debates over whether toappease or fight Germany. However, the fall of France and Dunkirk shocked the country and British morale was revived to fight on. Hitler, the author notes, regarded invasion as &#65533;veryhazardous&#65533; and hoped for a political settlement. Hitler made a peace offer in a July 1940 speech which Britain promptly rejected in a radio address. Britain now faced the air power type of conflict it had been preparing for since the 1930s.Chapter 2 evaluates the two forces noting that &#65533;The military confrontation in the autumn of 1940 became a test of strength between two rival air forces.&#65533; The text notes both armies trained for the coming battle; but &#65533;....none of this mattered as long as the German air Force had not won mastery of the air over southern Britain.&#65533; Command structures are described noting that Herman Goering was both air minister and air force commander while the British had an Air Minister, Sir Archibald Sinclair, with separate commanders for fighters and for bombers. To Sir Hugh Dowding, of Fighter Command, fell the task of creating an effective defense shield. The author writes &#65533;Sinclair epitomized that British elite of dignified public servants so much despised and ridiculed in German propaganda. Goering, on the hand, was everything Sinclair was not.&#65533; The text notes that &#65533;on 10 August 1940, The German single-engine fighters assigned to the battle over Britain was 1011, slightly fewer than Fighter Command&#65533; thus destroying an enduring myth of the few against the many. The book compares fighter production, performance and armament noting that early in the battle there was rough parity in fighter number, but in the last weeks the British had the edge. Another myth is the shortage of trained RAF fighter pilots. The number of RAF pilots increased by one third between June and August 1940. The Germans could cope with pilot shortages because of a lower loss rate. The author writes &#65533;If Fighter command were the &#65533;few&#65533;, German pilots were fewer.&#65533; The British air defense system, set up to counter the enemy bombing offensive, is described and it was adjusted in the summer of 1940 to meet an invasion threat.Coastal Command played a difficult, costly and critical role twice daily conducting reconnaissance of German controlled ports. Bomber Commands role was to wear down German resistance bybombardment of vital objectives. The author notes that &#65533;The one field of battle where British preparations proved at least equal to the task in 1940 was fighter defense and it was for thatreason alone that German air fleets concentrated on destroying Fighter Command&#65533; using fighter sweeps in a war of attrition. German daylight bombing of London began on 7 September when350 bombers raided the east dock area and the text notes &#65533;The air battles in the week between 7 September and 15 September were decisive in turning the tide of the battle. During that week the German Air force lost 298 aircraft. Fighter Command lost 120, against 99 enemy fighters.&#65533; Another myth that Richard Overy debunks is that Hitler never seriously planned an invasion,writing that &#65533;There need be no doubt that under the right circumstances Hitler was serious aboutinvading Britain in 1940....&#65533; but that by the end of September Hitler concluded that air superiority had not been achieved and indefinitely postponed an invasion. Lacking daylight bombing success, the Germans shifted to night bombing thereby creating a problem as aircraft were very difficult to shoot down at night from the air or from the ground until new detection equipment wasdeveloped. Overy states that though the Germans never formally adopted terror bombing, the tactics they employed caused widespread civilian casualties resulting in the death of 40,000 people during the Battle of Britain and the Blitz.The Battle of Britain did not seriously weaken Germany and her allies, but the contest was not a draw. German air fleets did not gain air supremacy over southern Britain. The author observesthat &#65533;In a great many respects, however, the two forces were remarkably matched. Both commanded a small group of committed, highly trained and courageous pilots, both forces responded with considerable tactical ingenuity to sudden changes of direction in the course of the battle; both exploited fighter aircraft at the cutting edge of aviation technology; both forces foughtthe battle with operations commanders of real distinction.&#65533;Finally, this was not a traditional battle in that it did not have a clear-cut beginning nor a defined ending. However, the author concludes that like Trafalgar, the Battle of Britain was critical to the British people in that an invasion scare subsided and the nation could now get on with the task ofwinning the war."},{"Title":"The Battle of Britain: The Myth and the Reality","review":"This is an interesting essay by Richard Overy, the author of a number of excellent books on WWII, notably the outstanding Why the Allies Won. In this book, Overy provides an insightful analysis of The Battle of Britain. Overy provides a dispassionate view of the Battle of Britain, dispelling many of the common myths surrounding the Battle of Britain and also rebutting recent revisionist attempts to downgrade the importance of the Battle of Britain. Overy places the Battle of Britain in the context of the entire war and pre-war policy choices made by the British government.Potential readers should be aware that is an analytical essay, not a narrative. This book presupposes familiarity with the history of WWII. This book is also very short, some 135 pages with relatively large font and wide line spacing. While very good, this brief book is not worth the retail price. The introduction mentions that this book was prepared for Penguin books in Britain. I suspect it was issued as a short paperback and not designed as a conventional monograph. This pricy hardcover version is an attempt to take advantage of readers."},{"Title":"The Battle of Britain: The Myth and the Reality","review":"This little -- less than 140 pages of large type and wide margins -- book is less 'revisionist' than its subtitle might lead you to expect. Based largely, it seems, on reports and statistics from government archives, Overy in fact deflates many of the recent revisionist interpretations of the Battle of Britain. At the same time, arguing as Thomas Fleming does in 'The New Dealers' War' that 'memory is not history,' Overy also challenges the rose-colored conventional wisdom that has accreted around the Battle in the years and decades since.The Battle of Britain, Overy argues, had no clear beginning and no clear end; the dates chosen by the government seem purely arbitrary. By and large, neither the British public nor the British leadership was aware they were fighting an epic battle while it was going on. There was no clear winner, and it was not in any sense a turning point in the war. '[T]he Battle of Britain did not seriously weaken Germany and her allies, nor did it much reduce the scale of the threat facing Britain (and the Commonwealth) in 1940/41 ...' (p. 113). At the same time, however, the battle was not a draw: the failure of the German air force to knock out the RAF or terror-bomb the population into capitulation directly deterred or prevented Hitler's planned Operation Sealion, the invasion of southern England.Countering the 'revisionists,' Overy argues that Sealion was a real strategic plan, not a diversion to cover for the invasion of the Soviet Union. Similarly, he shows that the Nazi shift from targeting RAF bases and personnel to deliberate bombing of civilian targets was not Hitler's vengeance-crazed demand following the Allied bombing of Berlin, but was actually part of the Sealion strategic plan, and happened well *before* bombs fell on the German capital.One of the most interesting aspects of this study is Overy's discussion, not only of the myths that have grown up since the end of the Battle of Britain, but also the myths that both sides were laboring under while the Battle was being fought. The RAF, for example, consistently overestimated -- in a huge way -- the number of enemy pilots and planes they faced (contrary to the modern myth of 'the Few,' RAF fighter pilots outnumbered their German counterparts throughout the Battle). For their part, German planners grossly exaggerated the RAF's losses of planes and pilots, and overestimated the damage they had caused to Britain's airfields and industrial production.In all, Overy rejects modern arguments that Britain would have been better off had she negotiated peace before the Battle and the Blitz began. Overy's short essay demonstrates that Churchill was right when he stated that although it might not always have been clear what Britain was fighting for, if the British were to stop fighting, they (and the world) would soon find out."},{"Title":"The Battle of Britain: The Myth and the Reality","review":"This is a high-level study of the Battle of Britain, told in just over 120 pages, with a few notes and appendices. It is a study, not a story: while other authors tell the story of the battle, this is far more hands-off and clinical. For instance, there are no extracts from pilot's diaries (or anyone else's for that matter) and anecdotes are few and far between.It's a good starting point for reading about the battle, but never seeks to emotionally involve you. There are lots of facts, and some short perceptive analysis: little that is not in other, much longer works, but brevity in a book is its own strength too. I think this is the fourth book of this title (all by separate authors mind you!) of this title on my shelf, so I am not the average reader here, but still was able to learn something from it. There is a lot of fine detail left out of this book, but if you want more its not hard to find other relevant titles to fill in those gaps.It is clear that the result of the Battle was not that WWII was won; but if Germany had won the battle - either by invasion (which was problematic) or British surrender then they had also won the War, and history would be very different indeed."},{"Title":"The Battle of Britain: The Myth and the Reality","review":"Richard Overy is a very clear thinkng and well organized writer. This book is easy to read. It explains many of the tensions among british commanders about organizing the defense. Most of the battle took place over south eastern England. All the sector commanders wanted a full complement of fighters and pilots.British aircraft were being built rapidly and reserves were available. The notion that Britain was down to a handful of pilots was untrue.The Nazis ran low on aircraft and pilots. Hitler had other projects in mind and didn't stick with the strategy of destroying the RAF."},{"Title":"The Battle of Britain: The Myth and the Reality","review":"This is the first book by Ricard Overy I read and I was really impressed! If you belong to the kind of people that are looking for small books full of excellent analysis and myth debunking facts, then this is one of the best choices you can make. I have read quite a number of books on the Battle of Britain but I can recall none which has the same clarity of arguments, strong background on knowledge and superb writing style. Many of the facts you think you knew about this episode of World War II will be proved wrong and you will find another proof that History is not black or white but moves among endless shades of grey. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Battle of Britain: The Myth and the Reality","review":"Anyone interested in the Battle of Britain in the summer and fall of1940 should start with this book, probably the best concise analysis of an event that rankshigh in legend but low in real meaning.It would be nice if all history could be introduced in this short but beautifulmanner. Only a master of a subject knows enough about it to be concise and relevant, andOvery has studiously earned his credentials. Without slighting events or participants, heexplains how the \\"Battle\\" was more of a public relations triumph than a decisive victory. In1940, the focus was on surviving the \\"Blitz\\" which claimed the lives of 40,000 Londoners,not \\"the few\\" who fought in the air and lost 443 pilots in combat.Unfortunately, he overlooks two significant factors. First was Dunkirk; theRAF lost heavily but the Luftwaffe was unable to stop the evacuation. The RAF fighterswere operating at the limits of its effective range, the same problem that defeated theLuftwaffe over England. Also, the evacuation showed the inherent weakness of theLuftwaffe as a stand-alone weapon. The second factor is the 1941 nvasion of Crete, withthe loss of 147 Ju 52 transports and severe damage to 150 others despite minimal RAFopposition. It indicates the likely fate of any attempt to invade England.In brief, if the Battle of Britain is a legend, then the German military in WorldWar II was a giant bluff backed by terror and uncertainty. As Overy points out in his otherbooks, the Germany military was driven to exhaustion after which it used a World War Idefense. Victories were less the quality of troops than the panic of enemies; Overy dealswell with the incipient panic in Britain in the summer of 1940, plus the growing confidenceas the \\"We can take it\\" theme turned into \\"We can dish it out, too.\\"In brief, this is a masterful account of an era still deeply shrouded by the fog ofpropaganda and the legends of war. To cite one very relevant example; to this day, PrimeMinister Neville Chamberlain is vilified by the legend of appeasement due to the Munichconference of 1938. Instead, Overy credits him for launching the fighter productionprogram that saved Great Britain from defeat in World War II.In conclusion, this is the best introduction yet to a complex but fascinatingperiod of history. It's a perfect start to Overy's other books on World War II."},{"Title":"The Battle of Britain: The Myth and the Reality","review":"This book is not a dramatic retelling of the battle. It is concerned with what went on behind the scenes. It discusses the reasoning of the German commanders concerning an invasion of England and their plans behind the air attack. It's pretty enlightening to see how each side was pretty mistaken about what the other side thought or would do. There are quite a bit of authorities quoted for the author's premises. The newest thing to me was the fact that not all Brits pulled together about resisting the German aggression. The documentation about that reads about like the way people do now in both Britain and the U.S. This is an inside look at the entire campaign of the Battle of Britain and the events leading up to it. There are some things that were new to me and I think would be new to most readers. It's a good writing job and a good research job."},{"Title":"The Mystic Art of Written Forms: An Illustrated Handbook for Lettering","review":"excellent book by one of the masters of hand calligraphy - wonderful images and text - a different dimension of the lost art - brings it back into focus -"},{"Title":"Bondi Classic","review":"In the January 2004 issue of &quot;Blue&quot;, the Australian magazine where Paul Freeman is decribed as the magazine's &quot;most featured&quot; photographer, the artist says that he has always wanted to keep some link with classical art. &quot;Sort of like a meat pie inside the Sistine Chapel.&quot; Most of these models Michelangelo would have loved, and they to a man are meat pies. There is not a wimp or effeminate-- and it's okay if one is-- man in this collection of over 200 photographs. These men are rugged, hairy, beefy, muscular, tattooed, pierced, sweaty, wet and muddy. Some of them are a bit stylized and wearing gladiator garb. Many of them are at the beach-- Bondi perhaps--there are some beautiful portraits here. And no model has his genitalia airbrushed.In his brief introduction Mr. Freeman says that as a youngster he was taken by the image of the suffering Saint Sebastian (check out the portrait on page 174 of Garth Elliot 2) and that present day influences are Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts (speaking of airbrushing photographs). I think many of his models look more like some of the work of Jim French as well as Caravaggio-- whom he acknowledges as an inspiration-- and Michelangelo.Many of these men are photographed as many as 6, 7 or 8 times so you will probably get to see a lot of your favorites. Where to begin-- the man on page 11 (beautiful shadows), the outrageous Grant Perry (page 24 and 7 more photos), the hairy barrel chested Igor Praporshchikov on page 55, Black Angel No. 4 on page 73, Mat Obelisk on pages 76 and 77-- perfect exposure and lighting--the Gladiator on page 103 that, thank goodness, shows up again and again-- Gladiator 4 on page 126-- this is an unusal and most flattering pose-- the portrait of Ryan Kwanten on page 154, Kane 1 and 1 (pages 158 and 159-- the list goes on and on. The only photographs I don't care for are the ones with a snake wrapped around the model. Perhaps it's the Garden of Eden story that turns most of us off to these kinds of photographs. Richard Avedon did the snake photographs better years ago anyway.If the test for a book of photographs is whether or not you return to it again and again, then BONDI CLASSIC gets an A+. In its own way this book is just as hot as Tom Bianchi's ON THE COUCH series. If you can only buy one book of this kind this year, this one's the one. Oh, go ahead; treat yourself and buy Bianchi's also."},{"Title":"Bondi Classic","review":"For those looking for the best of the books of male photography, this portfolio by Paul Freeman deserves a place high on the list. Different photographers approach the male nude with different agendas: some try for classic poses, some go for spontaneous moods, some keep the 'privates' in the shadows while others place the focus there, some costume, some try for natural effects. Freeman searches (and definitely finds!) subjects who are quintessentially masculine Men. And this collection should equally engage the interest of women as of the ready-made male population.Freeman uses his fellow countrymen (Australia) to show us the virile attitude of the untamed. These 'models' are buff, have body decor from piercing or ink, know how to make the partially clothed form even more sensuous that the fully nude form (although there is a lot of that, too), and in general creates photographs that are well conceived and executed and presented in a superb format. There are portraits solo and in tandem. This is a collection that will find a wide audience. Recommended for the novice and the connoisseur collector alike!

All of his photos features manly men in various states of nudity. The lighting and posing of the model captures the man and celebrates his physique and its symmetry of form. The photos that feature frontally nude or bare-ass guys are all delicious, but I find the ones where there's almost nudity are the sexiest. Photos where the just the top of the pubes are featured, or the man is captured where you think that you can see \\"something,\\" but you're not quite sure, are so feaking hot! Men's bodies are muscular and sensuous. I thank Paul Freeman for his talents and for sharing his photos of bare-balled men. Paul is an artist -- and he's incredibly hot, too!"},{"Title":"Bondi Classic","review":"Bondi Classic marked the first in a series of outstanding male nude photographic books Paul Freeman has produced during the past decade. The cover portrait of the stunning George Moneta sets the tone - a handsome, rugged, athletic Australian male photographed simply and naturally. Mr Freeman's subjects are truthfully captured - no airbrushed, shaved and waxed 'perfect' models found in other photographic books, but real men with real bodies, many of which are revealed in their entirety.In addition to the fantastic diversity of subjects contained, some whom like Ryan Kwanten have gone on to considerable popularity, what is especially notable about this first work is that photographs capture only one model per shot and all are beautifully lit - Paul's later works are characterised by a more subdued lighting and photographs are sometimes more abstract or contain several models which, although fascinating, can make identifying individual models difficult at times. The inclusion of an index is also extremely helpful if, like me, the reader is keen to appreciate fully the subject captured within each photograph.This really is a superb collection of photographs, and people interested in appreciating the beauty of the Australian male, could not do better than obtaining a copy of this outstanding book."},{"Title":"RAGGEDY ANDY STORIES: Introducing the Little Rag Brother of Raggedy Ann","review":"I remember these stories being read to me as a little girl and I still find inspiration in them today!

A second scipture inevitably arose: the Talmud for Jews. It was less more systematic and pedantic, less evocative and poetic than the original and intended to justify the ideas of those in power. The history of scripture depended on who controlled the apparatus of interpretation and what readings they authorized.

A lot of devoted and respectful people in the world gave much of their precious time, in order to contribute to the cause of Spiritualism. Reading this book, one finds a great amount of reference to these people and their performance in this field. Needless to mention, they all became famous people, not through the work that they did to the Spiritualism's cause, but because they were bright and enlightened men and women and some of them were great names into the scientific world. Actually, on the opposite, their names were subjected to a lot of disdain and their lives were thrown into the anonimity to the majority of the mortal people who came after them, just because they were at a certain part of their lives involved with the spiritualist phenomena. In fact they are all very known people to the general public, who don't know anything about their activities in the Spiritualism matter.Names such as Franz Antone Mesmer, Alfred Russel Wallace, Sir William Crookes, Charles Richet, Camille Flammarion, Frederick Meyers along with the others members of the SPR, William James, Sir Olive Lodge, Arthur Conan Doyle, Cesare Lombroso and many others, are mentioned in this book. They struggled in their searching for enlightenment, which they tried through a media which they had reasons to believe in, the mediums. Therefore, the book aligns a long list of the most known mediums throughout the world, whose work served to the scientific establishment as the base for their investigative work, for they are the ones who make the link between our world and the world beyond. Notwithstnding, the book yet gives us a lot of information on the New Age Channeling matter.It is true that the book is a very informative one, and it brought up a lot of interesting information on the Spiritualism subject. If it would stand for that only, I would have a different approach in my review. Anyhow, my dissappointment with the book stands for the way it treated the researchers and especially the medims involved in the struggle to understand and to bring out more light into the phenomena. Trying to deny the existence of the spiritual phenomena nowadays is nonsense. Nevertheless, that's what the authors tried to do from page one to the end of the book. But what amazed me the most was the author's permanent attitude in trying to throw doubt on the researchers and mediums' honorability. This was done in a very effective way and at certain moments with a very unfair and dishonest approach.I wonder why nothing was mentioned in this book about the work of Allan Kardec. Actually he was the only one who after a long investigative work on the spiritual phenomena, built a very rational Doctrine known as Spiritism. This work answers the basic known questions raised by mankind upon its origins and destiny.Through the study of this enlightened Doctrine, one will find the answers that always concerned men in their quest for self-knowledge. The Spiritist Doctrine is based upon the Spirits' Teachings and the knowledge of an interdisciplinary context that comprises philosophy, science and religion. This Doctrine was born in 1857 with Allan Kardec's &quot;The Spirits' Book&quot;, and then developed through the following ones: &quot;The Mediums' Book&quot;, The Gospel According to Spiritism&quot;, &quot;The Genesis&quot;, and &quot;The Heaven and Hell&quot;. You can find the two books first mentioned above on the Amazon.com site. They are books that should be read by anyone interested in knowing better about the spiritualistic phenomenology.Although I don't agree with the authors' approach to the spiritualism phenomenon, yet I highly recommend this book for the great abount of information it comprises in the matter. Nevertheless, one should not read only this book and take for granted whatever was said by its authors about the existence or the merit of the phenomenon itself, but one should rather go looking for more information on the field,in which there are many.To finish my review I would like to quote Allan Karde's statement in one of his books (WHAT IS SPIRITISM, translated by Allan Kardec Educational Society, PA) when he said:&quot;When the enlightened proclaim from their seats of knowledge the existence of the spiritual world and its participation in life's phenomena, they will infuse the world's youth with the antidote to materialistic ideas, instead of reinforcing the negation of the future.&quot;"},{"Title":"Spirit Summonings (Mysteries of the Unknown)","review":"Time life books are super informative without being overwhelming.

In Iceland, of all places.Two men were the center of this event, hunched over a chessboard, each trying to prove the superiority of -- well, of what?To the political leaders on each side, the winner of this grueling contest would prove that their political, social and philosophical system was somehow superior. That may seem silly today, but there were a lot of silly ideas about politics in 1972 (unlike today, ha ha ha).Bobby Fischer Goes To War is an entertaining account of a match where for many the chess was almost incidental. Who could have imagined, back in that summer of '72, that a dull game only vaguely understood by most Americans would have captured the imagination? But capture it it did: the event was broadcast on TV. Bars showed the match rather than baseball, and got flack from customers if they changed the channel. Chess club memberships went through the roof. Stores could not keep chess sets and chess books in stock. Grandmasters were treated like rock stars. They arrived in limosines. Strangers begged for their autographs. They had groupies! Chess was sexy!It was a surreal time. And this book profiles it all rather flatly, missing the zeitgeist. The writing is relatively bland and matter-of-fact. (Where is Tom Wolfe when you need him?) The authors could have really had fun with this story. Instead we get what is sometimes an overload of facts, given in a newspaper-style dryness. This is one of those rare times when I wished for more sizzle and less steak.Still, though the book could have been more lively, this is a very thoroughly-researched chronicle of a unique event in U.S. history.As for the match itself, I found myself, to my surprise, actually rooting for--and somewhat feeling sorry for--Spassky. Fischer lost my sympathy after his 80th or so temper tantrum over the lights. Or was it the chairs? Or the stage? Or the noise? Or the squares on the board? Or the TV cameras? Or the prize-money? Or the hotel? Or the limo? Or the lack of bowling alleys in Iceland? At some point you just want the match organizers to pull the plug and send Fischer back home in disgrace, because that is truly what he deserved. The Russians hurled accusations that Bobby was using psychological warfare to make Spassky crack, which was mostly dismissed at the time as sour grapes. Today it's easier to see that their claims had some merit. Even though Fischer may have been a more brilliant player, I doubt he would have won in a straight match without all the off-stage melodrama. Unquestionably supremely gifted, he was nonetheless simply too scared. I think he fould it hard to live up to all his own bravado--who wouldn't?--and his last weapon against his opponent was his endless, unpredictable melodramas.Spassky comes across as harder to peg. Hardly a model Soviet, but definitely a loyal Russian, he seemed interested in playing Fischer for the joy of playing Fischer, rather than to prove anything about the \\"great Soviet Chess Machine.\\" (Inexplicably he agreed to changes in match conditions in the third game that may have led to his very downfall.) He apparently still hasn't lost his Fischer fascination. He played another match against the American in 1992 in Yugoslavia, and more recently, when Fischer was arrested in Japan (he is wanted by the U.S. Department of State) Spassky reportedly said, \\"Arrest me too, put me in a cell with Fischer and give us a chess set.\\" Whatever his motivation in Iceland, he clearly was not a loyal Soviet, and his handlers knew this. Some feared he would defect. Others put up with his comments against the system that would have landed most others in jail. There was almost relief that another Russian would challenge Fischer in 1975--a challenge the champion never met, forfeiting his title--even though Spassky was a stronger player than Anatoly Karpov.Despite not winning the title, Spassky's life turned out a lot better than Fischer's. Boris ended up abroad, still a Russian citizen, but married to a French woman and living the life of a country gentleman. Fischer wound up living the life of a derelict, abandoned by his country, fighting demons in his head that are telling him everything is a Jewish conspiracy. (Ironically, it turns out that Fischer is fully Jewish, and not half-German like he had always believed.) It's hard not to conclude his was a wasted life, at least after 1972.

Yes, it provides a wonderful description of every single detail related to the match itself, including personal accounts that allows the reader to understand how the events outside the chess board influenced the result of the the match. However, perhaps the most interesting part is the story of both Fischer and Spassky since they were born, how they grew up, the exposure to political, economic and social influences in their respective lands, how they developed as chess players and how they developed their own personalities that, to our advantage and delight, contributed to making that chess match what it was, a piece of history."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"David Edmonds is and John Eidinow was with the BBC; both are award-winning journalists. Their previous work, Wittgenstein's Poker: The Story of a Ten-Minute Argument Between Two Great Philosophers (2001) was a national bestseller.Edmonds and Eidinow have now published a second work that chronicles a confrontation between two antagonists: the celebrated \\"Cold War struggle\\" between the Russian world chess champion and a brilliant American challenger.Reykjavik, Iceland. July 11, 1972. At precisely 5 p.m., Lothar Schmidt, a German grandmaster and chief arbiter (referee) starts the clock for \\"The Chess Match of the Century.\\"Boris Spassky, 35, the champion, awaits the arrival of Bobby Fischer, 29, the \\"bad boy\\" of chess. Six minutes after the scheduled start of the first game, Bobby charges in like a bull in a china shop.Spassky was born in Leningrad in 1937, during \\"The Great Terror,\\" Stalin's liquidation of a wholly fantastic conspiracy against the Soviet state. Educated and cultured, Spassky was in all respects a gentleman and at the top of the chess world. He sincerely believed he would defeat the arrogant American.Fischer, born in Chicago in 1943, grew up in Brooklyn. At age six he obtained his first chess set, thus beginning his obsessive-compulsive immersion in \\"the Royal Game.\\" He would become of the greatest chess players of all time, ranking with grandmasters such as Steinitz, Lasker, Capablanca, and Alekhine.Like his chess hero, Paul Morphy (1837-1884) of New Orleans, Fischer was like a predatory beast on the prowl, going for the jugular in blitzkrieg-like attacks. One hopes, by the way, that Fischer's end is more felicitous than Morphy's, a chess genius who was found dead in a bathtub, surrounded by women's shoes.Spitting out vituperations against communism, Fischer was determined to break the Soviet hegemony. (The Soviets had held the world championship since World War II.)In Moscow, the KGB analyzed Fischer's eccentric behavior and concluded that he was a psychopath, a person for whom the norm was a conflict situation. Actually, say Edmonds and Eidinow, chess was Fischer's neurosis, a crutch that prevented him from stumbling into psychosis.\\"In the media,\\" write the authors, \\"Fischer was routinely portrayed with a range of derogatory adjectives. He was insolent, arrogant, rude, uncouth, spoiled, self-centered, abusive, offensive, vain, greedy, vulgar, disrespectful, boastful, cocky, bigoted, fanatical, cruel, paranoid, obsessive, and monomaniacal.\\" Picky! Picky! Picky! After all, Fischer was indeed, as the match soon proved, the best chess player in the world.Fischer defeated Spassky by a score of 12 1/2 to 8 1/2. There were 11 draws (a draw counts as a half point for each player). Spassky won only three games (and one of these was a gift, because a disgrunted Fischer failed to show up for Game #2, thus causing a forfeit). Fischer won seven games.The most intriguing information in this book is the startling revelation of a long-buried secret at the heart of the Fischer family. The FBI closely monitored Regina Fischer (Bobby's mother), amassing a nine-hundred page file on her.Now declassified, these FBI files reveal that Gerhardt Fischer was not Bobby's biological father. Apparently, Bobby was conceived when Regina Fischer traveled to Washington, D.C., in 1942 to visit a \\"close friend,\\" the Hungarian-born physicist, Dr. Paul Felix Nemenyi, who is described in the FBI files \\"as having a large nose, large knobby fingers, and an awkward, slovenly walk and dress.\\"\\"For several years,\\" write the authors, \\"[Fisher] lived in the bosom of the Worldwide Church of God in Pasadena. ... [However] In 1977 Fisher broke with the church, accusing it of being 'satanic.' ... From this point on, the subject of so much chess acclaim became a near total recluse,\\"At the point, things really get bizarre. \\"Fischer descended into an abyss of unreality, the world of Holocaust denial, persecution complexes, and conspiracy theories. . . . He became fixated on the study of anti-Semitic tracts, such as the Tsarist forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and Hitler's manifesto, Mein Kampf.\\" He railed against the Jews, calling them foul names unprintable in a family newspaper.\\"Given Bobby's anti-Semitic and anticommunist obsessions,\\" write the authors, \\"there is a poignant irony to the fact that his parents were communist sympathizers and that he is ethnically Jewish on both sides of his true parentage.\\"A glaring weakness of this book is the absence of the chess moves of the match's twenty games. Not to worry! Bobby Fischer Goes to War should appeal not only to chess buffs, but to anyone interested in a fascinating story that is well told.Roy E.

In Iceland, of all places.Two men were the center of this event, hunched over a chessboard, each trying to prove the superiority of -- well, of what?To the political leaders on each side, the winner of this grueling contest would prove that their political, social and philosophical system was somehow superior. That may seem silly today, but there were a lot of silly ideas about politics in 1972 (unlike today, ha ha ha).Bobby Fischer Goes To War is an entertaining account of a match where for many the chess was almost incidental. Who could have imagined, back in that summer of '72, that a dull game only vaguely understood by most Americans would have captured the imagination? But capture it it did: the event was broadcast on TV. Bars showed the match rather than baseball, and got flack from customers if they changed the channel. Chess club memberships went through the roof. Stores could not keep chess sets and chess books in stock. Grandmasters were treated like rock stars. They arrived in limosines. Strangers begged for their autographs. They had groupies! Chess was sexy!It was a surreal time. And this book profiles it all rather flatly, missing the zeitgeist. The writing is relatively bland and matter-of-fact. (Where is Tom Wolfe when you need him?) The authors could have really had fun with this story. Instead we get what is sometimes an overload of facts, given in a newspaper-style dryness. This is one of those rare times when I wished for more sizzle and less steak.Still, though the book could have been more lively, this is a very thoroughly-researched chronicle of a unique event in U.S. history.As for the match itself, I found myself, to my surprise, actually rooting for--and somewhat feeling sorry for--Spassky. Fischer lost my sympathy after his 80th or so temper tantrum over the lights. Or was it the chairs? Or the stage? Or the noise? Or the squares on the board? Or the TV cameras? Or the prize-money? Or the hotel? Or the limo? Or the lack of bowling alleys in Iceland? At some point you just want the match organizers to pull the plug and send Fischer back home in disgrace, because that is truly what he deserved. The Russians hurled accusations that Bobby was using psychological warfare to make Spassky crack, which was mostly dismissed at the time as sour grapes. Today it's easier to see that their claims had some merit. Even though Fischer may have been a more brilliant player, I doubt he would have won in a straight match without all the off-stage melodrama. Unquestionably supremely gifted, he was nonetheless simply too scared. I think he fould it hard to live up to all his own bravado--who wouldn't?--and his last weapon against his opponent was his endless, unpredictable melodramas.Spassky comes across as harder to peg. Hardly a model Soviet, but definitely a loyal Russian, he seemed interested in playing Fischer for the joy of playing Fischer, rather than to prove anything about the \\"great Soviet Chess Machine.\\" (Inexplicably he agreed to changes in match conditions in the third game that may have led to his very downfall.) He apparently still hasn't lost his Fischer fascination. He played another match against the American in 1992 in Yugoslavia, and more recently, when Fischer was arrested in Japan (he is wanted by the U.S. Department of State) Spassky reportedly said, \\"Arrest me too, put me in a cell with Fischer and give us a chess set.\\" Whatever his motivation in Iceland, he clearly was not a loyal Soviet, and his handlers knew this. Some feared he would defect. Others put up with his comments against the system that would have landed most others in jail. There was almost relief that another Russian would challenge Fischer in 1975--a challenge the champion never met, forfeiting his title--even though Spassky was a stronger player than Anatoly Karpov.Despite not winning the title, Spassky's life turned out a lot better than Fischer's. Boris ended up abroad, still a Russian citizen, but married to a French woman and living the life of a country gentleman. Fischer wound up living the life of a derelict, abandoned by his country, fighting demons in his head that are telling him everything is a Jewish conspiracy. (Ironically, it turns out that Fischer is fully Jewish, and not half-German like he had always believed.) It's hard not to conclude his was a wasted life, at least after 1972. It's sad to think how much chess could have benefitted if the first and only U.S. champion had been wrapped a little more tightly."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"Prior to the match Boris Spassky said that regardless of the results the events in Reykjavik would be a \\"celebration of chess\\". Bobby Fischer on the other hand, was going to war and wanted \\"to crush the Soviets\\". Two thoughts on Fischer come to mind after reading this book: What a jerk, and what a shame. He pretty much flushed his career down the toilet after this match by refusing to defend his title against Karpov in 1974, and for the most selfish of reasons - he couldn't handle losing - and he went out on top. How convenient. While his chess games are incredible to follow (and I highly recommend you take the time to do so) the fact is that he lost in life; while Spassky, whom he beat over the board, won (some observers even say that Spassky should've won the match based on pure chess skill and preparation; regardless of the results, his best games are as well worth studying as Fischer's). Fischer's absence throughout much of the 70s and all of the 1980s is lamentable, and like so many of his acquaintances, the more I find myself making excuses for his ridiculous behavior. \\"Bobby Fischer Goes to War\\" depicts this paradox and phenomenon pretty well and anyone interested in Cold War history might really enjoy the bizarre and intriguing events in this little corner of the wider, global show-down between communism and capitalism. Nevertheless, I have a few reservations about this book.Despite its being a well-researched, compelling and easy-to-read account of the off-board, behind the scenes battles between Fischer & the Russians, it has several short-comings, the foremost of which is a lack of chess. Sure, the authors make some token efforts to summarize certain highlights of a few games, but the focus is on Fischer's antics rather than his moves (or, if you're a Fischer apologist, his \\"off the board brinksmanship\\") and this seems unfortunate to me. By having the games interwoven into the main storyline the peripheral hoopla of the match would have its proper context. Not only this, but it would relieve the tedium of some 300 pages of some rather petty and exasperating behavior, and ultimately, would redeem the man himself. Reading about Bobby Fischer without his chess games is like, well, try imagining Mike Tyson without boxing. Additionally, I'm not sure how this book is any different from \\"The Russians vs. Fischer\\" (D. Plisetsky & S. Voronkov, Everyman, 1994, 2005 2nd ed.)? Not having been able to read it I can't say for sure, but from what I can tell it contains more interviews from the Russian side (the authors apparently utilized the same \\"unpublished U.S. & Soviet records\\" so prominently advertised on this book's jacket) and the games themselves. These two factors alone make me suspect that I bought the inferior product, and so I recommend you compare the two.Other criticisms:A complete absence of reference notes for any of the some 150+ sources for this book make it difficult, if not impossible to locate the sources for a large amount of curious material. Have these guys ever heard of plagiarism?The authors, who are journalists, write in the typical \\"play by play\\" style of their profession, which works well in pithy newspaper or magazine columns (or for John Krakauer & Mark Bowden), but wears thin in a full-length narrative about a chess match without any real chess.The coverage of the 1992 re-match is given short-shrift and conveniently written off a \\"a bad sequel\\".In the end I wanted to hear more from Spassky and Fischer themselves. There are a lot of secondary viewpoints and great sources of information here, but how much better could the text have been had the authors solicited or used more direct quotes from the participants themselves - especially Spassky since he seemed most willing to talk? Recently I discovered \\"B. Fischer: The Wandering King\\" by H. Bohm & K. Jongkind (Batsford, 2005) which looks to be fill this gap.The one thing that redeems the author's decision to focus on the non-chess related action in my mind is that it does illuminate something important that I don't believe they intended; namely that, despite their extreme differences, both chess masters managed not only to play some great chess, but refused to be manipulated by their respective political systems. That is, regardless of Fischer's obsession with control and the fiasco he made of this match - not to mention the ass he made of himself - it seems to me that the \\"celebration of chess\\" Spassky envisioned came about in-spite of all this, and in no small part due to his own tolerance, patience and ability to challenge Fischer on the chess board. For it was these two individual chess-artists who not only enriched and popularized the game worldwide through their immortal play, greatly benefiting their fellow players through larger purses future tournaments, but most importantly, their outmaneuvering of systemic powers that sought to constrain them for narrow-minded political propaganda."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I thought I had read all there was to know regarding the 1972 Fischer vs. Spassky match. So I was presently surprised by the new information I gleaned from this book. If you love reading about chess history, you'll love this book!"},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"\\"Bobby Fischer Goes to War\\" revisits the Cold War showdown between Soviet World Chess Champion Boris Spassky and American enfant terrible Bobby Fischer in Reykjavik, Iceland in the summer of 1972. Billed by the press as an ideological duel between Western individualism and the Soviet chess machine, the match inspired an unprecedented interest in the game in the U.S. and ultimately rejuvenated the Soviet chess program as well. BBC journalists David Edmonds and John Eidinow propose that the greatest battle was not on the chessboard. This is a chronicle of the drama behind the scenes, among the American and Soviet teams and their Icelandic hosts, that makes the battle on the board look tame.Background information about the two competitors, their personalities, how they got to this point, and an attempt by the authors to explain how a chess player's mind works bring us up to the negotiations for the World Championship match. If it seemed that getting everyone there was a feat, matters only got worse once the match started. It was to be two months in constant crisis, due mostly to Fischer's unrelenting, bizarre demands. The authors provide a blow-by-blow account of the confrontations on and off the chessboard, as the organizers tried to deal with Fischer, Spassky dealt with the stress, the Soviets with the prospect of losing, and paranoia on both sides that the players were victims of espionage.\\"Bobby Fischer Goes to War\\" is a snapshot of a symbolic event in a particular political climate which, not surprisingly, does not seem to symbolize what it was made to at the time. Boris Spassky was hardly a Soviet loyalist, and Bobby Fischer was a poor representative of the Free World, hated by the U.S. State Department. Yet, these two men at this juncture in the Cold War fought \\"the most notorious chess duel in history\\". This is a very readable, engaging account of that event and its cast. I am puzzled, however, that no one suggests that Bobby Fischer suffered from some degree of autism, which, combined with a domineering and self-important personality, explains his behavior. He is demonized a bit too much considering that he clearly had a neurological disorder."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"Fischer/Spassky was a seminal event of my childhood. I was 10 going on 11 at the time. It's tough to explain to people today how the whole event held everyone in its spell. This retrospective look at the event and its implications is a great piece of journalism by writers David Edmonds and John Eidinow. Of course, they had no cooperation from the famously vituperative Fischer. Spassky - the perfect gentleman as always - was obviously inordinately helpful in piecing together the story.I think the best line summing up the tenor of the book is by lyricist Tim Rice, who based his muscial 'Chess' partly on Fischer/Spassky. Rice says \\"The good guy was the Russian who was meant to be the bad guy, and the bad guy was the American, who was meant to be the good guy. It was all very confusing and a perfect illustration of how politics creeps into everything.\\"Edmonds and Eidinow summarize things perfectly: \\"Boris Spassky went to Reykjavik to celebrate chess. Bobby Fischer went to fight. His version of the match triumphed.\\" For this reason, the authors declare that \\"our story is in essence a tragedy.\\" Read their fine work, and you'll surely agree with this assessment."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"This book is brimming with details about the chess match of the century.

Due to dominance of Russians in chess circles for years, it was a big deal then and captured imaginations of country and world as Spassky and Fischer geared up for big confrontation.This story is so well done, as it digs into all corners of background of two individuals and chess and world events leading up to the confrontation in Iceland.Even to those of us who are chess illiterate, they make this read entertaining and captivating with their tentilating and informing and amusing tidbits of info about this worldstage event.One is caught up in the negotiations for the event and some insight into the mind and world and prep of these grandmaster chess competitors. Mind and life absorbing permeatations calculating, posturing of the environment of the room and board and seats, etc. It's all fascinating reading.The controversy around Fischer's chair and his dormancy after the championship were intriguing and make this sought after work which will be truly a good read for those in and out of the chess world.These authors as demonstrated in this and previous great read: Wittgenstein's Poker are astute at researching every angle and then presenting it in engaging and captivating style.Well worth the time."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I bought this book having always been interested in the general story of Bobby Fisher and his eccentric character. I was not disappointed. The book is very readable, especially for an occasional chess player like myself. While another commentator (above) is right in saying that there was very little by way of match detail, it does make the story of that summer in Reykjevik all the more tangible. I think a move-by-move account would have lost Edmonds and Eidinow a lot of readers. More interesting of all were the background explanations. Why was Fisher so problematic? What made, or at least molded, the personalities of the two grandmasters? what were the cultural and political going-on at the time? These are vital for one to appreciate the events, as nothing happens in isolation. A very well written book, indeed."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I was fifteen years old at the time. I just learned chess the year before. This book does a very good job of explaining the craziness, the excitement, and the drama of the match. The book covers the major and minor characters well. The book uses the match as a microcosm to illumine the political environment at the time. The writing is crisp and thoughtful. The explanation of the individual games was kept to a minimum. I enjoyed the authors' other works, so I had high expectations and the book met them. I strongly recommend the book."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"Its a really interesting clash of cultures. Here you have Boris Spassky, from the more structured USSR, being the more cultured and open person. On the other side you have Fischer, the brash spoiled egotist coming from the USA making ultimatums and demands that threaten the very championships he wanted to attain. You would think it would be the other way around, but once you get into reading the book, you realize that this was about so much more than just a couple of chess games in Reykjavik.A very enlightening, quick read. For those who don't know much about chess or even want to know, the authors to an exceptional job at downplaying the actual games and making important points only when necessary--and when they do they describe it in such terms anyone could understand."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"As an enthusiastic but less-than-expert chess player, I was grateful to Eidinow and Edmonds for a book that is serious about chess at the same time that it is both accessible and engrossing. Similarly, I admired the way that they treated the cold war resonances that for many make this &quot;the match of all time,&quot; exploring its impact without letting it obscure the real, human drama that they lay before us. A great book-- as enlightening as it is entertaining."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"This book has garnered almost universal praise, from newspapers like the Washington Post to internet sites like the Chess Cafe. Quite frankly, I don't get it. I found the book disjointed, historically misleading, and unoriginal.First, the good points. As other reviewers have noted, the book spends a lot of its focus on the Soviet side of the match, in part, based on extensive interview conducted with Boris Spassky and others. I don't think that Spassky's view of the match has ever been presented before in this much detail. Additionally, the book does provide a narrative of the events surrounding a signicant cultural event that took place over 35 years ago - those who were not alive at that time will probably appreciate this book more.Now, the bad points. There is very little in this book that is new. The vast majority of the book appears to be derived from 2 prior works - \\"Bobby Fischer Versus The Rest of the World\\" by Brad Darrach, and \\"Russians Versus Fischer\\" by Dmitry Plisetsky and Sewrgey Voronkov. Both of those books are far superior to this one, and Darrach's book has the virtue of being extremely funny as well.This book is historically misleading. It implies that the disputes surrounding this match were unprecendented. That simply isn't true. The history of the World Chess Championship is littered with such disputes (examples include the Alekhine - Capablanca feud; the negotiations for the 1948 World Chess Championship Tournament, inculding the exclusion of the #2 player in the world and Botvinnik nemesis, Miguel Najdorf; Botvinnik's insistence that the 1961 Tal rematch be played in Moscow and that \\"Moscow Doctor's\\" verify Tal's kidney condition before he would agree to a postponement, etc.). The book states that Fischer's charge that the Russians colluded to fix the 1962 Curacao Candidates Tournament was \\"sour grapes.\\" Maybe it was, but it also happened to be true. Not only is it true, this wasn't the first time (or last time) that the Russians would do this. In his postumous memoirs, David Bronstein admitted to being forced to throw matches in the 1953 Candidates Tournament to thwart American Samuel Reshevsky and ensure Vasily Smyslov's victory. This was standard operating procedure for the Soviets - it is likely the Keres was forced to throw his games in the 1948 World Championship tournament to help Botvinnik win and David Bronstein was forced to throw game 23 of the 1951 match with Botvinnik. The Soviet era of chess is littered with instances of these type of matches, and most of the chess players of the time, including Americans Reuben Fine and Reshevesky, knew this. Fischer was just the first player to make it public with his 1962 Sports Illustrated article. By the way, it apparently did not end there - according to Karpov, Victor Korchnoi was ordered to throw the final game of his 1971 Candidates match aginst Petrosian, as it was thought that Petrosian would have a better chance of stopping Fischer. Unfortunately, you would not know this by reading \\"Bobby Fischer Goes to War\\" because it isn't in the book. In my view, Curacao was a major event in Fischer's life that contributed to his growing paranoia. The fact that he was right and it was dismissed by so many people as \\"sour grapes\\" didn't help either.It is clear that the authors view Spassky as the hero of their book and Fischer as the villian. I don't have a problem with their view of Spassky as a hero - Spassky was a class act and may have been the greatest sportsman to hold the World Title. However, the authors take him to task for not pressing harder for a forfeit of the match. They just don't get it - the match had to go on. Spassky understood that. One of the greatest moments in chess history is when Boris Spasky, under pressure form the Soviet regime, refused to press for a match forfeit, even if it would cost him his crown. He understood the importance of the match to chess - that chess would never be the same after the match. Spassky was a visionary and chess fans owe him a debt of gratitude that can never be paid. It is too bad that the authors don't seem to understand this.As for Fischer, well, I think that they get him completely wrong. The Chess Cafe review compares this book to Brad Darrach's and notes that while Darrach believes that Fischer was a jerk, the authors of this book believe that Fischer's actions were all planned to rattle Spassky (they ramble on about nonsense like physchological operations and game theory, etc). I think that they are both wrong. The problem with Bobby Fischer was that he was mentally unstable. Early in the book, the authors cite a great quote about chess players that I think applies to Fischer - \\"Chess is not a game that makes sane people crazy, it is a game that keeps crazy people sane.\\" Unfortunately, for the rest of the book, the author's ignore the implication of this. Fischer was ALWAYS unstable. It was chess that kept him civilized. Once he abandoned chess, he became the crazy old man in the back of the bus shouting conspiracy theories. The paranoia, the outbursts, the self destructive behavior - those signs were always there. I don't understand why some many people refuse to admit that he had serious mental problems or why so many people hate Fischer - I can only conclude that they have never dealt with someone who suffers from mental illness (Note: I have). Fischer could not help himself, he was mentally ill, and the vile things that he said pales in comparision to the harm that he did to himself. He could have been hero, instead he became a crazy old man without a country. He is a tragic figure, not a villian."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I think it is a fair assessment of Edmonds' and Eidinow's thesis that the 1972 World Chess Championship was not a Cold War event- per se. These authors undoubtedly when to great lengths to research this book and provide conclusive evidence the match in Reykjavik held a unique niche as a &quot;somewhat&quot; Cold War event. However, this text presents itself to a scholarly community of historians who are interested in this topic with a dreadful lack of footnotes, references and source-guides. Simply put, the extensive bibliographic section of this text is useless because we (as readers) can never be sure where each important fact came from. We also don't know how many of the bibliographic sources were actually consulted. I get the impression (as a historian) that these authors padded their bibliography with any source they could find that might be relevant in an attempt to add validity to their research. Further, I feel that their often long and irrelevant digressions detract from the histiography they are trying to produce. Lastly, their thesis is unclear. At one point they tell us the 1972 match was NOT a Cold War event- but then they give us information (such as Nixon's letters and the importance of the match to Russian culture) that prove otherwise. Much later they tell us that the match did have *some* Cold War analogs and that Fischer and Spassky (and even their delegation) &quot;dramatized&quot; many of the dichotomies of the east and the west in the Cold War. They tell us this after having assaulted us with facts and anecdotes that they hope will show that nether Fischer nor Spassky accurately represented the values of their respective countries, and for that reason they conclude that this match was not a Cold War struggle. Generally, these authors contend that that match was *somewhat* Cold War-ish, but then prove to us through their argumentation that is was VERY Cold War oriented. Confusing argumentation and a lack of citations make this useless as a historical account or a political study- however it is an interesting read."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"The focus of this book would appear, upon first glance, to chronicle Fischer's staggering rise from young prodigy to become the first (and only) American world chess champion, but what you get instead is a fascinating look behind the Iron Curtain of the Soviet chess machine and how it churned out an army of players that held the world title for almost three decades. Fascinating mini-biographies of Petrosian, Spassky, Tal, Taimanov and countless other Russians grandmasters (and their various interactions) are laid bare by the authors' tireless research of cold war documents that bring to life the time in which these remarkable figures lived. The prose is both urgent and vivid, and early on you find yourself standing on the street corners of Leningrad watching a young Spassky wander the ruins searching out fellow chess players in the aftermath of World War II.The Soviet obsession with chess, the way it became one of its chief cold-war weapons, and how the players were ultimately pawns themselves in a fascinating period of political theater is perhaps the most compelling aspect of this book. I could easily see teachers who want to convey a vivid picture of Cold War diplomacy assigning this book to the students of their political-science/history courses."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"Bobby Fischer was a genius. Bobby Fischer was to a genius, what he was to a chess grandmaster: better than the average. Bobby Fischer genius marries chess at an early age, and is determined to be the best husband ever. He lives in chess just about as much as humanly possible, everything else about him seems second rate. His suits perhaps, as well, were just for chess.He becames determined to become world champion. That was all he cared about. He utterly destroyed his chess opponents to reach the world championship. He would have been too confident and not made it to Iceland, it seems, without the self-interest of a generous millionaire. Did his eyebrows raise when Henry Kissinger called him? Who knows?Spassky meanwhile is the natural athlete. He lives a comparatively balanced, comparatively happy life with a number of interests. Fischer versus Spassky it is rather obvious to me which one knew how to live life better.Fischer did everything in his power could to win the world championship. He makes a chess blunder but psychological brilliancy by capturing a pawn in the end game and succeeds in fooling most of the world. He tops that psychological brilliancy by refusing to show up for the 2nd game, or he was just a little nuts. Who can say for sure?He won the world championship match by being better prepared, better at psychology, and simply played better chess than Spassky did. I doubt he raged about the cameras and size of the chess set just because he was a little picky. He certainly didn't care much about improving his bowling skills while in Iceland. For some time after he is the king of the world. He certainly earned it.People were not so kind towards his extreme and ridiculous social aggressivity the next time around. He loses the title, he becomes a nutty recluse.Or did he? I might be quite wrong but part of me suspects Bobby Fischer had such a near lightspeed intelligence that he was able to fool the world. Part of me suspects that after he won his war he calmly retired and decided to devote the rest of his life to intellectual philanthropy: to raising awareness of anti-semitism (or anti-antisemitism, or anti-anti-antisemitism, who can say for sure? Or insanity?) and to warn the wider world of the dangers of too narrowly focusing on single interests.I think Bobby Fischer Goes To War is a great book, but it is sometimes not very exciting to read. As in chess as in life. In their ambition to be as comprehensive as can be, Eidnow and Edmonds sometimes comes close to writing in a dry and prosaic style. But I think they made the correct choice, as it is unlikely that anyone will do a good a job as they did in telling this story."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"Although I found this to be a good account of the Fischer-Spassky clash, as well as the two chess champions themselves, I thought there was too much factual information around the chess match. At times, this made for difficult reading. I would have preferred to read more about the chess than the political aspects, although I guess the focus of the book was the political impact that this particular chess match had on the USA and the USSR.For me, it was still a fascinating account of the minds of world class chess players, their fickleness, their child-like behaviour, their paranoia, but above all, their genius. It was amazing to see how the political element bowed to Fischer.It was sad to read that Fischer never really defended his World Championship title officially, as he is arguably regarded as the greatest chess genius of all."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I do not think that I have ever read an account of a person more deranged than Bobby Fischer. Mind you, I have not read too much about deranged persons, but to date, for my part, based on this book, Fischer clearly deserves the prize for most insane genius.I was quite young when the Spassky-Fischer match took place, but I vividly remember that, all over the campus of UNC, and on all available flat surfaces atop the old stone wall that runs beside the Franklin Street sidewalk in Chapel Hill, chess boards suddenly sprang up...all flanked by thoughtful, bearded young men. It was all very inspirational for novice chess players, and the book brought some of that excitement back to me as I read it. (I even found the heart once more to begin repeatedly losing scores of consecutive matches to my computer.) The newspapers made Fischer out to be a veritable hero and dedicated athlete (swimmer) hell-bent on defending the honor of America against the commies; however, I do remember some of the older generation complaining that Fischer's behavior reflected very badly on the U.S., and the book makes clear that his motives were purely cynical.The entire political and cultural drama of the period is in this book, along with some quite detailed play-by-play of specific matches leading up to the Fischer-Spassky affair. This book tells it like it was: at the height of his powers, almost no one was a match for Bobby...and it certainly begs the question, how much of Fischer's insane antics were deliberately designed to unnerve his opponents in efforts to gain that all-important psychological edge?"},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I was eleven when Fischer won the world championship. It was electrifying, he was a hero to many of us. Fischer had an aura, a mystique that enhanced American chess. After winning the championship, within three years he was gone. Dozens of stories about him floated around the world. This book effectively and comprehensively answers all the questions so many of us had for decades regarding Bobby Fischer.The authors have completely researched his life from birth to today. Almost as exhaustive is their history on Spassky. The ins and outs of the championship tournament in Iceland are fascinating, but the high level of chronological research, the interplay between the players and those around them make this book unforgettable."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I did enjoy reading this book, and would recommend it to anyone interested in either chess or history (particularly Cold War American-Soviet relations). One problem I have with the book is that there wasn't enough detail in the descriptions of the games themselves. I know detailed anaysis of chess moves or strategy could slow the book down (to non-chess lovers), but the competition between these two men are at the heart of the text.The real problem may be that the authors sell the book as \\"Bobby Fischer\\" going to war, but we are unable to get any insight into Fischer's motivations or true feelings because of his insane behavior. I use the word insane intentionally.As I stated before, read this book. You will enjoy it because it is well written and entertaining. I just wanted a little more chess."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"Okay, IF YOU ARE A CHESS ENTHUSIAST, and you already have read everything about Bobby Fischer, but you still need a Bobby Fischer fix, then maybe you'll want to read this book. However, for the most part, Frank Brady's excellent biography does an adequate job of covering this match, and many others, and it provides annotated games that will allow you to replay, and better comprehend the nature of Bobby's brilliance.Also, IF YOU ARE A CHESS ENTHUSIAST, then you already understand something about the sad and troubled character that Bobby was, and continues to be. So, the sordid details of Bobby's interactions with all of the major and minor players in this drama really are kind of pointless. Well, actually &quot;depressing&quot; would be a better word. Nonetheless, this book does provide insight into the character of Boris Spasky that I have not seen elsewhere, but in truth, I haven't searched. It also provides a brief post-match summary that covers developments to date. Lastly, it drops hints that maybe Bobby is out there on the internet waiting to play any one of us. Do you really think that is likely? Hmmm, well maybe.IF YOU ARE NOT A CHESS ENTHUSIAST then I'm not sure why you'd want to read this book. If you are seriously interested in &quot;cold war&quot; related histories, there have got to be better references than this one."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"This book is coming out at the right time. With the success of the movie \\"Aviator\\" about Howard Hughes this book gives you further insight into another quirky character in Bobby Fisher. It isn't just a rehash of other books but gives depth to both Fisher and Spassky. The book describes both their lives and how who they were effected the most publicized chess match in history. The match took place in 1972 so the book has the perspective of time to really look into things outside the current hype of the event. This book would be enjoyed by chess buffs but also people who enjoy contemporary history as well."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I am a chess player and as a kid I remember this event vividly (I was 10 at the time), this lone american with attitude (although more of a brat than swagger) taking on the Soviet grandmaster. The only thing that come close to this battle in chess culture since then is Kasparov's battles with Deep Blue (and Kasparov-Karpov's games). This book is thankfully not another analysis of the games which has been done ad naseum, but a well told story of two men, one a Russian gentleman backed by the State and the other, an eccentric and socially retarded master of the game who never defended the title and virtually disappeared from the world. This is one of those stories that is so strange you think it's fiction, when you realize these events really happened, it makes for compelling reading"},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I can remember the Summer of 1972 and Fischer was a major hero. Little did we know at the time that he was a lunatic. I've read a fair amount about Fischer and his life. At a young age, he discovered chess and it consumed him right up to his winning of the world championship. His activities varied from reading chess books, to playing in chess tournaments, to giving simultaneous chess exhibitions, to practicing chess on his own, to discussing chess. To say that he was a one-dimensional person would be a gross understatement. He had the emotional maturity of about a 5 year old. In letters that he wrote, his grammar and spelling were atrocious. To hear him later in life, he sounded like a deranged mental patient off of his meds. As other reviewers have said, his chess acumen was fantastic. The sad, bigger story, however, is that he was a very flawed human being."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"Boris Spassky said before the historical meeting between him and Bobby Fischer in 1972 in Reykjavik, Iceland, that chess was a metaphor for life. Bobby Fischer always one-upping his opponent said: \\"Chess is life.\\" Chess was life for Bobby Fischer and death for Spassky after this tournament. The book chronicles the two men's lives before and after the World Championship. Both lives took dark turns afterward, but all of the international intrigue is caught in this book. No book will every capture the essence of Bobby Fischer. There are no words to describe how difficult, how stubborn, and insane he was. This book does show some of the complexities that governed Fischer's personality; for example, meters brought in to record sound, because of Fischer's complaints about the noise. Whatever a flake he was away from the chessboard doesn't take away his genius at the board. Right after the Miracle on Ice in the 1980 Olympics, Fischer's defeat of Spassky is the greatest slap in the face the Americans ever handed the Russians in the realm of sports. The book does a competent job of the game and after effects of the game. You don't have to be a chess fan in order to love this book."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"This is a fascinating look into the Fischer-Spassky chess match in Iceland in 1972. One thing I really liked about it is it showed what a narcistic kook Fischer was but used his real life antics as an example as opposed to the usual \\"he was crazy because he said mean things about Jews\\" nonsense. To be honest the fact that he was willing to say non pc things was about all there was to like about Bobby Fischer. Its virtually unbelievable the hoops that were jumped through to accomodate Fischer in order to make this match happen. Whether he meant it to work out this way or not his antics also served as psychological warfare that completely drained Spassky of his energy and focus.This is not a conspiracy related book but there is also a whole chapter that looks into whether the CIA was somehow poisoning Spasskys food or using some sort of radio wave type secret weaponry to disrupt his thought patterns during the course of the chess match. Spassky himself brushes it aside but to this day many people who were there, including Spasskys wife, believe that this was the case. This is the best book I have run across pertaining to Bobby Fischer."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"A few quick facts: in 1972 there were only 90 GM's, and according to the book there are now about 550. The world championship order is: Steinitz 1886-1894, Lasker 1894-1921, Capablanca 1921-1927, Alekhine 1927-1935, Euwe 1935-1937, Alekhine 1937-1946, 1947 there was no living champion, Botvinnik 1948-1957, Smyslov 1957-1958, Botvinnik 1958-1960, Tal 1960-1961, Botvinnik 1961-1963, Petrosian 1963-1969, Spassky 1969-1972, Fischer 1972-1975, Karpov 1975- (I believe Kasparov took the title in 1985, and Kramnik in 2000). There are over 300 billion legal ways to make the first four moves in chess. There are more variations in a typical game of chess (1080) than there are atoms in the universe. And there are even more ways for the game to turn out (10117).Bobby Fischer was born in 1943 in Chicago. He was not raised by his biological father, a Hungarian. His mother was very intelligent, receiving multiple degrees and learning several languages. Bobby learned chess at age 6. He joined the Manhattan chess club at age 12, and a year later met future Grandmasters William Lombardy and Robert Byrne. He won the US Junior Chess Championship at age 13. He became the US chess champion the next year at age 14! That year he traveled to the Soviet Union for the first time to play chess, but did not do well, and was supposedly rude, and was asked to leave. He did, however, play in the 1958 Interzonal tournament, scoring 6-2-0, and became the youngest International Grandmaster ever. He later met Danish GM Bent Larsen, who helped him with his preparation. At this time he often cried after losing games.Fischer met Boris Spassky for the first time in 1960, and ironically they shared first place at the tournament. Two years later, Fischer won the next interzonal, the first non-Soviet to ever win it (the interzonals started after 1945). However, he lost in the zonal tournament, and accused the Soviets of cheating by pre-arranged draws (which later turned out to be true). Fischer was such a talented player, not to mention coming from a capitalist country, his complaints were heeded, and the round-robin system was scrapped in favor of knockout matches. It was about this time that many players started saying that Fischer had a strange effect on them, draining their power of concentration and stamina. Maybe it was his IQ---estimated as a teen to be 180.Three years later, in 1963, Fischer qualified again for the Interzonal, winning all 11 games against his American opponents. But he complained even more about the tournament system, and voluntarily sat out of the interzonal. Three years later, he easily won the US title again, and did play in the 1967 interzonal. He played Spassky twice in that tournament, losing one game and drawing one. In two other separate tournaments, Spassky also won one game and drew one. During this time, Fischer was a member of a Jewish sect called the Worldwide Church of God (he later vehemently rejected Judaism). He was not supposed to \\"work\\" during the weekends, and that made tournaments very hard to attend. The constant rescheduling of his games put him under a lot of stress, to the point that he completely dropped out of the interzonal tournament. He did not play tournament chess again for two years. Although Fischer by now had a terrible reputation in the greater chess community, he was known to always be a gentleman over the board.The Leningrad-born Boris Spassky also became a Grandmaster at a very young age. In 1966, at the age of 29, he challenged the world champion, Tigran Petrosian, for the title, and lost. Two years later, he defeated Efim Geller, Bent Larsen, and Viktor Korchnoi, losing only 2 of 26 games. In 1969 he faced Petrosian for the second time for the world champion title, and this time Spassky won, 6-13-4. Spassky was well-known to be anti-Soviet, but since he was the world champion, the authorities more often than not turned the other cheek when he made anti-communist statements. Many of his chessmates were not so fortunate. Spassky became world champion by intense concentration and suppression of emotion---however the stresses of the tournaments often made him physically ill afterwards.The next time Fischer and Spassky met to play, it was in the 1970 Olympiad. Spassky had white and played 1 d4. Fischer responded with the Grunfeld defense, but lost again. Later that year, both players of course competed in the interzonal. Both made the cut, and in the candidates matches there were eight players left to see who would face Spassky: Fischer, Taimanov, Hubner, Korchnoi, Uhlmann, Geller, Larsen, and Petrosian. Not an easy crowd to beat! The Soviets tried to study Fischer's style, and found out that he preferred a knight to a bishop in the endgame. That is strange, since in another book it claims that Fischer went out of his way to preserve his bishops. No one could successfully study Fischer's style. He crushed Taimanov, 6-0, Larsen 6-0, and Petrosian, 6.5 to 2.5. Fischer finally made it to the world championship in 1972.Of course, the Soviets still tried to study Fischer's tendencies, and focused on his relatively narrow opening repertoire. Unfortunately for them, Spassky was now the defending world champion, and often refused the advice of his trainer and helpers. Later, this attitude cascaded into a blame game and finger-pointing by his entourage to avoid being punished by the KGB. Spassky also made enemies with former champion Mikahail Botvinnik. Supposedly Viktor Korchnoi had studied Fischer's play the most, but he also did not get along with Spassky. While Spassky was studying, an agreement was made for the championship to be in Iceland (which was initially chosen by the Soviets, even though it had an American military base there). The prize fund was a total of $125,000, which quickly doubled to $250,000, thanks to an English businessman.Fischer quickly began complaining about the tournament conditions, even before he arrived. In fact it took a call from the US Secretary of State to motivate Fischer to even go to play! For those interested, Spassky's rating before the tournament was 2660; Fischer's was a whopping 2785. By the way, 90% of the commentary on the actual games is from Chessbase, not the book. The first game was a Nimzo-Indian with 3 ...d5, and was basically uneventful until Fischer blundered on move 29, losing his last piece (a bishop) for two pawns. It was a mistake that even a 1500-rated player would probably not have made.Was it a psychological ploy? Spassky won a somewhat boring technical game thereafter. After the game, Fischer began to complain more and more about the playing conditions, to the point that he didn't even show up for the second game. It's inconceivable to me that he would not play the second game, which Spassky won by forfeit. Some speculate that it was a psychological ploy to make Spassky feel guilty about an empty win. Later, Anatoly Karpov said that Spassky didn't recognize the psychology behind Fisher's absence, and added that had Petrosian been the defending champion, he would have \`licked his chops and gobbled up that second point'. Fischer had already booked a flight back to New York. The only way he would play is if it was in a back room, away from the several-hundred member audience. He got his wish---Spassky conceded this request.Game three was pivotal: Spassky was the defending champion, was up two games to none, and had the White pieces. Fischer played a Benoni defense and made an interesting, if not dubious move 11, ...Nh5. Spassky's bishop was on e2 and quickly took the knight after Fischer had casted kingside, thus ruining the pawn structure in front of his king. But Spassky could not take advantage of this and was slowly, methodically crushed. The match was on. Game four had Spassky playing a Sicilian defense and resulted in a draw. In Game five, Fischer played a true Nimzo-Indian defense and defeated Spassky in 27 moves, after a blunder on move 26. Game six had Fischer play a rare opening for him---the English. Fischer played a great tactical game, utilizing several pins, and won. The seventh game featured Fischer playing a Najdorf Sicilian, successfully taking a pawn on b2 with his queen. Spassky actually played a great tactical game, but could only manage a draw.Game eight had Fischer playing another English opening. Spassky blundered on move 15, moving a pawn protecting one of his rooks and losing the exchange to a bishop. Fischer's tactics in this game were much better than his opponent's, and he won in less than 40 moves. Spassky became physically ill after this game. In game nine, Spassky decided to play 3 Nf3 instead of 3 Nc3, to avoid the Nimzo-Indian defense. He could only manage a draw with this variation. Game ten had Spassky playing a Ruy Lopez. Fischer sacrificed a pawn on move 26, to set up a very impressive 7-move combination, and ended up an exchange ahead for a pawn, winning the endgame later.Game 11 saw the frustrated Spassky switch plans and start playing 1 e4 again. The game turned into another Najdorf Sicilian, with Fischer again taking the supposedly poisoned b2 pawn. But this time Spassky and his team prepared well for this pawn grab by the Black Queen. Spassky played the game brilliantly; it was probably his best game of the championship. It took him 17 more moves to win Fischer's queen, but in the meantime Spassky created all kinds of pins and forks. Fischer resigned on move 31. Game 12 had Fischer play the English opening AGAIN (he hadn't played the English opening 3 times in any tournament before this). The interesting thing about his choice of the variation of the English is that it basically transposed into a typical Queen pawn game---the opening that Spassky played the most. It was almost as if Fischer was taunting Spassky by trying to outplay him with his own expertise. This game ended in a draw.Game 13 saw Spassky again play 1 e4, and this time Fischer responded with Alekhine's defense---Nf6. Spassky advanced his e-pawn, and the battle was on. This game was absolutely fantastic. The maneuvering and intermezzos by both sides was spectacular. Fischer allowed his bishop to be taken, in exchange for what turned out to be a four-pawn advantage for black. Spassky desparately tried to save the game, but Fischer had three connected passed pawns and won in 74 moves. It was one of the best games I've ever seen. Game 14 had Fischer again playing the English! For the second straight time, he could only manage a draw, probably because he had so much less experience with this opening. Game 15 was a Sicilian that resulted in Fischer drawing by repetition. Game 16 was a drawn Ruy Lopez. Game 17 was again a Ruy Lopez that was fairly boring. Game 18 had Spassky playing 1 e4, with Fischer countering with the Pirc defense. For some strange reason, Fischer voluntarily gave up the exchange, and looked like he was losing, but managed to draw the game. Game 19 was a drawn Sicilian. Game 20 had Fischer again playing Alekhine's defense. Spassky give up two minor pieces for a Rook and pawn, but could only manage a draw. Game 21 was again a drawn Sicilian. This was the seventh draw in a row.Game 22 was the final game of the match. Another Sicilian, but this time Spassky took too many chances with white. In the middlegame, Spassky probably blundered by allowing a combination in which he won a pawn, but lost the exchange to a bishop sacrifice, then rook capture by Fischer. Fischer played the endgame perfectly and won. There are many people who wonder why Spassky played the championship so badly, but in reality he only blundered away a few games. There are many games that Fischer played where he would have beaten ANYONE across the board.The Soviets accused Fischer of playing mind games, hypnotizing Spassky, etc. (even thinking that there was some cheating device in his chair). Spassky's opening advisor Efim Geller was convinced that their opening preparation was leaked to Fischer. Whatever really happened, the bottom line is that Spassky was not prepared for Fischer's opening deviations, and could not come back from an early deficit. Looking at their FIDE ratings, it's not a shock to think that Fischer, rated 125 points higher, would have ended up with a plus 4 score. Spassky only won 3 games, and none after game 11. 2785 vs. 2660 for 22 games will in all probability result in a match win for the higher-rated player. Spassky was not crushed by Fischer---he was simply outplayed."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I first noticed this book on a stand at a bookstore because of its bright red cover. When I walked up to the stand and read the title I was surprised and excited to see that the book was about the famous Fischer-Spassky chess match held in Reykjavik, Iceland in the summer of 1972. I lived in New York City and was 14 years old then and I didn't know who Bobby Fischer was, neither did I know anything about chess, which goes for everyone I knew at the time also. I was aware of a cold war between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R though. The hype in the media is what got me and my friends interested in the match and chess, especially since Bobby Fischer was a New Yorker from Brooklyn. Before the Fischer-Spassky match I didn't know anyone that played chess except the elderly men I would see playing chess on stone tables in the neighborhood park. The serious expressions on the elderly men's faces as they played made me think chess was a boring game that lacked any fun. But, the same way that Tiger Woods got younger people and minorities interested in golf so did the match with Fischer and Spassky got me and some of my friends to learn to play chess and a good thing that was because it was a long, hot, boring summer and learning chess along with the Fischer and Spassky match kept us out of mischief.I had often wondered how this historic chess match came to be played in Iceland of all places and this book tells you how that happened along with the whirlwind of behind the scenes preparations, accommodations, negotiations and drama regarding Fischer's demands and the demands of other parties involved with this match. I felt sorry for the Icelandic people because the Fischer-Spassky match disrupted their obscure peaceful lives but they adapted gracefully.Even though this book is mostly about the people, events and issues surrounding the famous chess match it also provides some general background information about Fischer, Spassky and the chess world leading up to the match. There is more information concerning the Russian side than Fischer's side but that's only because Russian chess was a well-organized government funded sport that involved several committees, trainers, doctors and other Russian chess grandmasters. Bobby Fischer on the other hand was a loner who took up chess at the age of six and got deeply and passionately involved with the game and who mostly studied and taught himself chess. At a young age Bobby set the chess world championship title as his goal and he relentlessly pursued the title with intensity. Besides Bobby's passion and talent for chess I don't believe Bobby's life was interesting or special in any way. In fact, he grew up relatively poor with no father and dropped out of school to devote as much time as possible to the pursuit of excellence in chess. This is a guy that always carried a pocket chess set with him and he would pull it out anywhere and anytime he was bored or uninterested with his surroundings. One of Bobby's famous quotes is \\"Chess is life\\" at least chess was Bobby's life.The Russians knew years before the famous match that they would have to contend with Bobby Fischer for the world chess championship title and when he finally did achieve the right to challenge the Russians for the chess championship at the relatively young age of 29 he had become a juggernaut, mowing down all of the grandmasters in the candidates round, a feat without precedence in the history of chessWere the Russians concerned? You better believe it. But, since Fischer had never defeated Spassky in the past Spassky wasn't that concerned and that was part of his undoing. As we all know Bobby Fischer won the match convincingly and the repercussions were felt everywhere because the media had hyped this event as an east vs. west cold war showdown. The Soviet chess machine was dethroned and shaken to it's foundation, Bobby Fischer went from unknown to an instant heroe and international superstar celebrity overnight in a way that hadn't been seen since unknown pilot Charles Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic ocean from New York to Paris non-stop to win the Ortieg prize in May 1927. The big difference is that Lindbergh basked in his new found celebrity status and prospered well and went on to promote aviation for many years. Bobby Fischer disappeared and forfeited his title to Karpov in 1975 when he refused to defend his title because the FIDE agreed to only 178 of his 179 demands thus adding more mystery and confusion to the enigma that was Bobby Fischer. Some people say Bobby didn't defend his title because he was afraid of losing, I don't believe that for a minute because as I wrote before Bobby had become a juggernaut and was in his chess playing prime. I will add another Fischer quote \\"The Russians have held my title for ten years and they're going to be in for it when I win the Championship. They're going to have to wait and play under my conditions.\\" Besides Bobby's intense animosity towards the Soviet commies, and his desire to be in control due to his distrust of chess organizers, Bobby knew that the Russians were masters at drawing games and the one demand that the FIDE would not agree to was for draws not to count for half a point that way there would be more pressure to win a game than draw a game also Bobby believed it would truly decide the superior player and matches wouldn't last as long due to more decisive games and fewer draws. The FIDE thought the opposite way; they believed that with draws not being awarded half a point could cause matches to last indefinitely. I believe Bobby was right, thus Bobby's attempt to change some tournament and match game rules for the better was negated and he truly withdrew from chess competition.No one in history has done more for chess than Bobby Fischer. Even today using Bobby Fischer's name will sell books, DVD's and magazines. For the first time since the Fischer-Spassky match people were able to make a living from chess because of its increased popularity. It took someone like Bobby Fischer with his antics, demands, brashness and genius to get the chess world noticed in this country. Bobby Fischer was the perfect person to take on the Soviet chess machine because he was totally unpredictable. Even the Russian psychologists after studying the profile they had on him came to the conclusion that he was a psychopath.How do you play against a psychopath? to quote Spassky, \\"When you play Bobby, it isn't a matter of win or lose, it's a matter of if you survive\\" Spassky claims it took him a year to recover from the match with Fischer.The losers to Bobby's withdrawing from chess competition is all of us who enjoy playing and love the game of chess because one can only imagine the wonderful games and brilliancies he would've performed had he continued to engage in chess competitions. Thus, when Bobby stopped playing chess, I stopped playing chess also but, I started to have another interest and my new interest was girls. Since no girls played chess and no girls were interested in chess and no girls were interested in guys that played chess, I stopped playing chess completely until I bought and read this book two years ago and started to take up the game of chess again and it was such a joy to relive the summer of 72 again. Thank you Bobby Fischer, you are the immortal king of the immortal game. RIP"},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"Fischer's arrogant, insane, unrelenting rudeness really makes this an enjoyable story. If the book had been about two rational chess players facing each other over a board, it would have put me to sleep. Fischer is a weird creature who invokes both admiration and derision; but by the end of the book I almost felt sorry for him.The huge amount of cold-war political tension upped the stakes to this series of chess games tremendously, involving President Nixon and Henry Kissinger as well as the Soviet Bureau of Agitation and Propaganda. The global attention is what allowed Fischer to get away with his unceasing demands: The white and black squares on the chessboard have too much contrast -- change them. Now not enough contrast -- change them or Fischer quits. The lights are too bright, now too dim. Fischer needs more money. Too many people in the first seven rows of seats -- move them back. Too much noise in this room, move to another one. All of this clearly rattled Spassky.The book describes how the match crippled Spassky psychologically for years, but it also makes clear that he didn't disintegrate to the extent Fischer ultimately did. The authors submit several theories explaining Fischer's personality and problems; also a revealing section on Fischer's parents.I heard this on unabridged audio tape."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I am not going to take a long time and provide quotes out of the book as some reviewers have.First , if you want a chess book about chess analysis, skip this book. It essentially has no chess analysis. If you want to re-live the summer of 1972 when Fischer stunned the world by beating Spasski, this book is for you. I was 16 in 1972 and was aware of the match, all games back then were printed in the local newspaper. Unless you lived it, it's hard to explain the excitement this match created in the US. Perhaps the closest comparison is US Gold winning hockey team in 1980. In both cases, we were going against the &quot;bad guys&quot; (not really &quot;bad guys&quot; - but there was great fear in the US about Russians back then and the press always played these US vs. USSR confrontations to the max. A victory for us, was a victory for democracy, a victory for them was a victory for communism. Communism was viewed as much greater threat back to our national security interests. The &quot;falling domino&quot; theory was why we went to war in Vietnam.Anyway, I picked up book and could not put it down. I thought it was well written it covered a lot of ground regarding the match, Fischer and Spasski. If you read this book in conjunction with the &quot;Fischer vs. Russians&quot; book, which has the Soviet perspective, you will have great insight in to the times and the paranoia (existing on both sides) of the match. The \\"Fischer vs. Russians&quot; book also had some real chess analysis of the match which I suggest reading first before this book. Another excellent book on this match is &quot;Fischer vs. Spassky; World Chess Championship match, 1972&quot; by Svetozar Gligoric.As an aside, in my opinion, Mr. Gligoric is the best writer that ever played chess at high level. I highly recommend all his books."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"The Fischer-Spasky world chess championship was a cultural phenomenon in the United States perhaps difficult to imagine for those now under the age of 45 and thus unlikely to remember. It was big. For chess, amazingly big. The cold war overlay, the never-done-before, and the cold war overtones: think U.S. Olympic Hockey medal as a parallel.It has faded from memory in part because of the embarrassment and subsequent decline of the American hero: Bobby Fischer. His anti-social, narcissistic personality problems made his actions at the championship difficult to be proud of and, as his mental health patently declined, left this as the final shining moment of his career.This book does a very good job telling the story (for better or worse, without much chess; one's experience of the book would differ little even if one didn't know how to play). We follow the lives of Fischer and Spasky leading up to the match in great detail, but not so much as to be dull. The result is a better understanding of the entire event, with heightened interest resulting from the story's presentation by two Brits--a different perspective on America during the cold war. I did think the book perspective (compared to my own) cast Fischer's mental problems more as gamesmanship than as the onset of a serious disorder and would have liked a bit more explanation of Fischer's genius (there are plenty of adjectives offered but not as much analytical explanation, compare for example,Einstein: His Life and Universe, which gives even a physics ignoramus some understanding of his genius). The book is also to be lauded for research from FBI files that seem to show Fischer had a different biological father than he (or the world) had believed. This is a big deal, and I do wish this had been developed more, but it is a step forward for which these authors deserve credit.If this subject interests you, this is a very good treatment."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"really wondeful. the appendix chapter his mother is, in my opinion,even more interesting than the book. book, of course, is a fantastic read."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"Good.

The reality is that this is simply a story retold with nothing of significance that I did not already know from memory and other sources. That does not make it a bad story for those who are not familiar with the match, but it does make it less than advertised for those who are. Even if some details were presented for the first time, I would not have much faith in their accuracy given the book's plethora of factual errors. (Palma de Mallorca is referred to as a \\"walled city, a decisive game of less than 20 moves between GMs is said to be so rare as to be \\"historic,\\" etc.) It is clear that the authors know little or nothing about chess, so chess players in particular can be safely warned away from this book.

It is a well written &quot;newspaperlike&quot; account of perhaps the most famous chess match of all time. I confess that like most chess fans from the USA I was a huge Fischer fan as a child and teen. I figured he stopped playing professionally because he was afraid of losing. This book posits the same theory.I lived through the match, following it very closely, but didn't realise the Soviet side until reading this book. The authors have done an excellent job bringing that to life.A few things I did wonder about: there was no mention of the strange re-match Fischer had with Spassky in the 90's, nor much elaboration of matches he played in the 80's with a friend who had been interviewed by the author.But those are minor issues.If you are interested in chess and Bobby Fischer, this is the definitive work to read."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"This is an interesting book.

Bobby Fischer came face to face with Boris Spassky in Iceland, and the world took delight in a simple morality play. Fischer was depicted as the lone American hero gunning to win the title from the Soviets who had held it for decades. The Cold War was reduced to the free world's champion versus the apparatchiks spawned by the Soviet socialist chess machine. It was fun to watch the battle in such black and white terms, but in _Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match of All Time_ (Ecco), David Edmonds and John Eidinow show that the true story was much more complicated although just as exciting. For instance, Spassky may have been a Russian patriot, but he was not a Soviet patriot and he was not a member of the Communist Party. Fischer was eccentric and asocial, and his bratty behavior seemed un-American to many of his fellow Americans. But both their governments had a stake in the match, and people all over the world who knew nothing about chess watched the contest carefully, and many took up the game. It was quite truly the most extraordinary chess match of all time, just as the book's subtitle says, and the book makes clear in how many ways it was extraordinary.Spassky loved the game for itself, and, as a well-rounded gentleman who liked fishing and festive parties with his friends, seemed sincerely to be looking forward to what he called &quot;a feast of chess,&quot; win or lose. He admired Fischer, but the book shows that beyond a colossal talent for chess, Fischer possessed few admirable qualities. He was a morose man who one journalist said &quot;was likely to greet even an old friend as if he were expecting a subpoena&quot;. His frequent tantrums (which earned him much derision from his compatriots) did, at least, stop when he sat down to play, and he never attempted to disturb an opponent across the table. He was called by Dr. Henry Kissinger when he did not show up for the match, assured that he was &quot;our man up against the commies.&quot; Having lost the first game, he didn't even show up for the second, and thus lost it as well. But then he crushed Spassky in the third, and went on to a match full of hard-fought draws and wins, many of which are regarded as among the finest games ever played. President Nixon sent congratulations. Spassky eventually went into contented retirement in France, continuing to regard the Soviet chess administration with disdain. Fischer never defended his title, although he has played some exposition games. He went on to join a fundamentalist Christian church, then to denounce it as satanic. He may have been the American hope during the match, but he is now deeply anti-American, spouting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories (ironic, given his parentage on both sides, revealed here) to any radio station that will allow him voice.The authors have interviewed all the important officials involved who are still alive, especially Spassky; they didn't interview Fischer, and don't say why, but that was probably just not possible. _Bobby Fischer Goes to War_ is not a book for those who want to study the chess games. It has exactly one board diagram, and the games are described generally, not play by play. Chess players interested in this aspect of the match already have bought better books on the games themselves. This is a book about personalities, about the history of the times, and about the off-board gambits and counter-gambits, and you certainly don't have to know any details about chess to enjoy it. There is, to be sure, a great deal to enjoy here, in the re-creation of the match and the geopolitics of the time that lent it importance."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"If Bobby Fischer's name is affiliated with a book, it comes to reason that there is some amount of weirdness forthcoming. I am not referring to the chess books Fischer wrote, as those are guidelines to chess perfection. This refers to any discussion of his life, which this book does. The world's greatest chess player, Fischer, has lived his personal life much less logically than his life is an eight by eight square cell.To help the nonchess reader sort out the menagerie, authors David Edmonds and John Eidinow provide a \\"Dramatis Personae,\\" listing 21 Americans, 24 Soviets, six Icelanders, four match officials, and six sundry others, explaining their relationship to the Reykjavik, Iceland chess match. They also include a short glossary to educate us in the vocabulary of competitive chess.The book begins with a vital quote by Boris Spassky, \\"When you play Bobby, it is not a question of whether you win or lose. It is a question of whether you survive. This sets the tone for all that follows.Edmonds and Eidinow lay out the social mire Fischer was growing up in, and his quick rise to chess dominance.In 1954, when Fischer was 11, he was attending matches and doing well enough but not at his later prodigy level. In that year, as he is quoted, he \\"just got good.\\" Modern chess history, or at least for one its most colorful characters, begins then.1972: Boris Spassky was the champ. He deserved to be there. Bobby Fischer was the contender. He deserved to have the opportunity. Between these two men stood a world of complex politics, money, national pride, idiosyncrasies, and suitors to the game. Reykjavik, Iceland was the location of what has become one of the most legendary chess matches ever, between Spassky and Fischer.Early on during Fischer's career, he had the same impact Michael Jordan would later enjoy later enjoy as professional basketball player. \\"Fischer-fear\\" was the description of some players' psychosomatic illnesses from Fischer's intimidation. Opponents would make mistakes as a result. Fischer had the bravado of Muhammad Ali, but none of his class. He would take this personality and boorish demands to the match.Boris Spassky is painted differently. A product of the Soviet support system, he became professional about the game. Affable and popular, an opposite to in every way to Fischer, he still had what Fischer lacked -- the title \\"World Champion.\\"The bulk of the book moves on from biography and personality profiles. It follows the path the chess culture -- all chaotic in its apparent systemic approach. Going from the need to compete to the actual match turned through every convoluted corner, with Kissinger's involvement, the FBI, the KGB, and as much intrigue as a James Bond movie.The travails of the match are outlined as needed (but not heavily), highlighting the most interesting parts and never boring nonchess players. The psychology of the players and chess players in general is discussed, as is the history of modern champions, providing a field for tension and a framework for the match.This was in the midst of the Cold War, and the Soviets -- not just Spassky, owned the chess champ title. Nixon was president. Fischer, the bombastic, arrogant American who hated Russia, had a knack for successfully risking it all on the board by knowing the principles of chess as a sublime art form. Spassky, the methodical Russian, against Fischer, became a symbol of the Cold war itself. The image of the match was only half of the matter. Neither man was the caricature the press saw them as, but such are the stories of legend.I fully recommend \\"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match of All Time,\\" by David Edmonds and John Eidinow. Oh, and if you somehow missed the big news back in 1972, Fischer won the match.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I am not what you would call a chess enthusiast. Although I can play the game, I do not do so often. What I do enjoy, however, are good tales about the Cold War. It was on that basis that I purchased this book. It is also on that basis that the book succeeds very, very well.There are three themes that I thought were well illuminated by this book. First was Bobby Fischer's behavior. Of course I had heard that he was eccentric and difficult, but never did I imagine just how bizarre he really could be. His unbelievable micromanagement of every aspect of a tournament, his antisocial behavior, his forfeiting of a game in the world championship, all these are brought to life in a way that provides the reader a real taste for the character of the man that was wonderful, if frustrating, to read.Second, the book did an excellent job of detailing exactly how beneficial Fischer, and the Fischer/Spassky match, was to chess overall. Bizarre behavior or not, Fischer took chess from a poor man's game to one in which top players could demand top dollar. This was far more interesting than most people would probably imagine and more interesting than I can convey with a simple review.Third, and most fascinating, was the description of the Cold War chess match that was being played by the US and USSR on the world stage over the Fischer/Spassky match itself. Think about it - the Soviets not only dominated chess but explicitly stated that their chess superiority was evidence of the superiority of their socialist system. Then, not only are the Soviets knocked off their perch, they are utterly demolished. Even worse (from the Soviet perspective), the person doing the demolishing is not only an American, but one who is extremely arrogant, openly states that he will crush anyone the Soviets put up against him, and whose behavior is so odd and obnoxious that he would have been thrown in the Gulag if the nationalities were reversed. You could almost feel the Soviets squirm!I must admit that I did feel bad for poor Boris Spassky, a good man representing a bad system which used him for propaganda purposes. Alas, such is history, and this book serves a very delicious slice of it."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I was pleasantly surprised at this very urbane, almost panoramic, and far-sighted treatment of the clash of the two Titans of chess.The authors not only captured the essential elements of the decisive games that led to Fischer's stunning victory, but more importantly, they also did a masterful job of situating the meaning of the match in the political context of the times. Their parallel overlaying of the times with the events going on in Iceland, left us with an enduring picture of the tension of those troubled times, demonstrating how a single chess match managed to relieve much of it, if only for a brief spell.In the hands of these very skilled writers, a chess match became more than just a report on the World Championship, it became a metaphor of the Cold War: The clash in Iceland was as much a battle of ideas, political systems and ideologies as it was a parlor game waged with great skill, tension, and tenacity across a wooden board of 64 squares.Edmonds and Eidinow brought it all alive in grand, almost epic fashion -- from the humble beginnings of the players, and the idyllic surroundings in Reykjavik, to a resounding crescendo of fireworks at the last game of the grand finale in Iceland. Through this book, we are not just eye witnesses to history in the making, we are made to feel that we are a vicarious part of it!For chess lovers everywhere, this is the book to read if you want to know about the game, the particpants, the politics, the ideosyncracies and emotional ups-and-downs of the participants, as well as the events in the background in Reykjavik. A great read FIVE STARS!"},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"\\"Bobby Fischer Goes to War\\" succinctly recounts the events leading up to and surrounding the famous 1972 chess match that (briefly) wrested the world championship away from the Soviets. The story was compelling then as a surrogate battle of the Cold War. Now, however, it fascinates because of the incredible and tragic story of the American champion who was made famous by and ultimately consumed by the game of chess.The authors do a great job of telling the story, giving just enough history of the game of chess and biography of the participants to set the stage. A particularly surprising revelation is what a sympathetic character Soviet champion Boris Spassky actualy was. A poltical maveric (at least by contemporary standards) Spassky comes off as a decent guy, especially when compared to the notoriously unstable and anti-Semitic Fisher.The book climaxes with aa compelling description of the match itself, which would have been memorable even without the geopolitical implications. The authors wind down by revealing what became of the principle players in the drama, including the sad and notoriouslt paranoid state into which Fisher has descended.Overall, this is a fascinating book that will delight the chess enthusiest as well as anyone else who likes a great story."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"Authors David Edmonds and John Eidinow, responsible for the best-selling \\"Wittgenstein's Poker,\\" have now turned to the surprisingly gripping 1972 World Championship chess match between Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer in their new book, \\"Bobby Fischer Goes to War.\\"As someone who is old enough to remember the match (and who watched Shelby Lyman's engagingly dorky commentary about the matches on Channel 13), I thought I knew the outline of this story fairly well. But Edmonds and Eidinow have come up with plenty of new details about what happened in the Icelandic city of Reykjavik that Summer, and the result is a book that, oddly enough, will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering how a chess match is going to turn out. Or, given Bobby Fischer's legendary eccentricities, whether the match is going to happen at all.The book is not free from flaws. Perhaps out of a desire not to alienate the non-chess playing reader, the commentary on the individual games seldom rises above the perfunctory: in fact, they don't bother to print the moves of any given game in their entirety, not even in an appendix, which strikes me as extremely misguided.Also, the book has a few conspicuous errors of fact. On page 175 the authors mention Henry Kissinger taking Soviet Ambassador Anatoli Dobrynin and his wife to Hollywood \\"to mingle with the stars.\\" The next sentence begins, \\"There is no record of them meeting the Marx Brothers...\\" which would have been a trifle unlikely, since Harpo and Chico were both long dead by 1972. On page 228 they claim that the Metropolitan Museum is \\"just up the road from the UN...\\" which they would never have written had they ever actually walked from one building to the other, since they're more than three miles apart (and halfway across town from each other).But the heart of this book is Bobby Fischer, the brilliant but wildly unstable genius who was the most gifted (and easily the most troubled) chess player of the last century. This story is, as the authors admit towards the end, a tragedy: a perfect example of the saying \\"Be careful what you wish for: you might get it.\\" Fischer had trained almost all his life with a monomaniacal passion to be the World Chess Champion, although on more than one occasion putting self-destructive obstacles in his own way, as if he was afraid of achieving what everyone said he was destined for, and when he finally achieved his lifelong ambition, he promptly fell apart mentally, to the point where today he is a fugitive from American justice, giving insane interviews to whoever will listen to him spewing out vicious anti-Semitic and anti-American propaganda.The final part of the story, Fischer's descent into seeming madness, is a little skimped by the authors, and really deserves a book of its own (although it would be decidedly depressing reading). But with all its flaws, this is a fascinating book about a moment in history that anyone, chess player or non-chess player, can find interesting. And if it intrigues you enough to inspire you to pick up a chess set and start playing, so much the better."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I was pretty excited about buying this book, because who wouldn't want a book about how one man stood up to a Superpower at the height of the Cold War and won?But then, when you get into it, the book becomes more of a breakdown of the Fischer/Spassky match, only one written for non-chess players. Apparently most all of the story comes from interviews and the recollections and memos of the participantsThe problem with that is that they couldn't get an interview with Fischer, and the book shows it. In terms of pages, \\"Bobby Fischer Goes to War\\" is 40% about Spassky, 20% about chess, 30% about the reporters or other GMs at the match or whatever, and maybe 10% about Bobby Fischer. Which would be fine if it wasn't put out there as a book about Bobby Fischer, but it was and its not that at allWritten by 2 co-authors and apparently not edited at all, the book meanders from place to place and anecdote to anecdote, and the last 100 pages are intolerably slow. They cover the post-mortem of the match; what went wrong and where the participants ended up. The main problem with that, again, is maybe 10 of those 100 pages are about Fischer. I mean, its really great to know that some Soviet minister of whatever retired and had a good life, but to my mind the book is crippled by long detours into side characters' lives, and I think the authors only indulged in those detours because they had next to no information about Bobby, so they had to talk about something to run up the page countThe first half of the book is interesting and relatively fast-paced, and actually does illuminate the Spassky/Fischer match, even if it doesn't offer any actual insights into Bobby Fischer, beyond what some people who met him once or twice think of him. The second half is just a re-hash of things already stated, and a \\"where are they now?\\" type piece on each of the officials of the various organizations who put the match togetherSo to sum up: this book is basically just a story about that historic match up, and its more told from Spassky's side than anyone else's. If that's what you want, great. Here it is. If you wanted a book about Bobby Fischer, about any part of his life other than those few months in Iceland, you won't find it here. If you wanted his insight into the matches, or analysis of the matches, that's not here eitherAlso, you should be warned that the story is told about 75% from the Soviet side of things, so there are alot of Russian names and governmental titles. That might bother some readers; I found it difficult after awhile to differentiate between the various Russian officials, especially since some are referred to by nicknames at one point, then by their given names, then by title, etc.Hope that helps you make an informed decision on whether or not to buy the book"},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I was in a coffee shop last weekend when I noticed two men playing Chess near the cream and sugar counter. A small but intent group had huddled around their table quite captivated by the game. Memories of Bobby Fischer came to mind. I also watched the game for a while and then decided to visit my local bookstore and just by happenstance I saw \\"Bobby Fischer Goes to War\\" and picked up a copy. It is very interesting reading. Bobby Fischer's 1972 match with the Soviet Boris Spassky held in Reykjavik, Iceland is legendary. Spassky, the world chess champion, certainly seemed the gentleman and Fisher was billed as the young Chess prodigy. To me Chess was always a game played by elitists or other higher order members of the social ladder. In reality that is truly not the case. If there is anything elite about the game or those who play it, it is the social refinement that one takes away from the chess board. There is a certain amount of respect that one experiences and earns that should be used in a higher order of one's conduct as a person. From this book Spassky seems to fit that picture, but Bobby Fischer is anything but. Fischer had a deep intuitive intellect for the game but his social upbringing and behavior seemed rather crude and almost not worthy of the game. His behavior during the match seems embarrassing and nothing honorable as demonstrated by Spassky. Fischer seems to have learned none of finer aspects of being a participant and journeyman of the game. This is a good book and brings many avenues of thought ion this history making Chess match."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"A wonderfully absorbing cultural history that digs deep into the psyches of Boris and Bobby to present a Shakespearean tragedy of sorts. Superb research and access to the minor characters who probably best understood the event makes this a not to be missed chronicle of a lost age."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I'm a chess player. And just about every chess player finds themselves fascinated by the enigma that is Bobby Fischer. Possibly the strongest player ever (though many will put forth other players as possibly stronger), who almost single-handedly changed the rules (and the prize money) for tournament players everywhere, he is also the only man to ever forfeit the World Championship, the only one to earn almost universal disgust for his anti-Semite and anti-American diatribes.This book details the events and characters that led up to the 1972 World Championship match in Reykjavik, Iceland. You don't have to be a chess player to read this (almost none of the actual game details are covered here - there are many other books that perform this task). The focus is on how a lone American challenged for and finally won the world title, a title that had been held by the Soviets since the end of World War II. The Cold War between these two countries forms the backdrop for this encounter, and incredible as it may sound, diplomats, lawyers, the KGB, high political figures in both countries, and multi-millionaires helped create and shape many of the events leading to the match - for a game that had, at the time, perhaps 10,000 serious adherents in the U.S.The authors delve deeply into the characters of both Bobby and Boris Spassky, giving a large amount of biographical detail, some of which is either not widely known or newly revealed here, using as sources both FBI files and documents from the KGB and other Soviet agencies. Their assessments of the mental state of both participants will generally ring true, amply supported by documents, interview material, photos and assessments by other grandmasters, though at times I thought they may have gone a bit overboard with generalizations. Also well presented is the political and chess climate that swirled around the match itself and the InterZonal and Candidates Matches leading to it. Much of this information was originally published somewhat piecemeal by both the regular and chess press, and often left many areas of confusion and blank spots in what was really happening. Here it is well organized, rich in detail, and brought back to me the feeling of just what it was like back in '72.The fate of the participants after the match is also covered, including the 1992 re-match between Bobby and Boris, though not nearly in the level of detail of the main event. The picture painted of both players is somewhat saddening, one for his descent into near-psychosis, the other for his fall from grace in the USSR and his personal troubles.For anyone who has a passing interest in chess, or who likes to read about classic clashes between the lone hero and the staid and possibly nefarious establishment, this is an excellent book. For Americans, it will engender feelings of pride, shame, and total embarrassment at some of the inexcusably rude actions and statements by those on that side. For Russians, perhaps sadness at opportunities missed, and anger at their own bungling. For everyone, a rich historical adventure, with more twists than a James Bond movie.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I enjoyed reading the book because the prose was readable and the story is so compelling. It would take colossal ineptitude to make this story unworthy of reading. The chess match of the century, the Cold War backdrop, the drama of the proceedings, and most importantly the titanic chess struggle between two fo the unquestioned greats of the game.I am relatively knew to chess literature so I can't comment on how much of the information in this book is earth shattering. My sense from reading it is that more insight is gained on the Russian side and the dissension within Spassky's camp.The subtitle is revealing in that clearly the authors place a lot of the blame in the Russian defeat on the Spassky's genteelness with an ungentlemanly opponent.Some of the background asides seemed real basic. I don't really need speculation on the possible Freudian implications of Fischer's psychology for example.What was really lacking for me, however was depth into the chess. Many people will read this book with no exposure to chess and I don't think enough is done hear to communicate the beauty of the games which were played and how the protagonists personalities played out on the chess board. At the very least, it would have been tremendously helpful to have the moves for all the games in an appendix for those who wanted to see the chess.I enjoyed the story but felt that these were two reporters doing a job that one reporter and a thorough chess historian could have done so much better.Read it and enjoy it because it's the best material on a fascinating story, but pray that an even better history of this match comes out when Spassky releases his autobiography.3.5 stars."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"This is an interesting book.

Spassky, the reigning champion, by contrast is a more sympathetic figure, contributing to his own ultimate undoing by acquiesing too easily with the pusilamious and cowardly behaviour of the organisers.Those who do not appreciate chess may regard this story as \\"much ado about nothing\\". Those who love the game will enjoy the account and lament how an event that could have been a marvel of sportsmanship, courage and analytical thinking degenerated into such a farce."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"This is the story of the epic 1972 World Chess Championship between Bobby Fischer ( the chess genius and challenger ) and Boris Spassky ( the Champion ). The authors began with a short description of both players' childhoods, explored their respective paths to Iceland and then focus on the build-up to the match including the incessant demands of Fischer.Fischer emerged as the champion but Spassky emerged the gentleman. The writing is breezy and it is obvious the authors have done a lot of research. If you are interested in an analysis of the games this book is not for you.This book focus on the drama of the match."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"3 stars for generally decent writing. Less two stars for the generally dull subject matter. I'm not referring to chess or to Bobby Fischer's story (or Boris Spassky's). Rather, I'm referring to the subject matter that forms (seemingly at least) the greater part of the page count of this book: Bobby Fischer's endlessly annoying pathological behavior at the 1972 world chess championship. I realize that said behavior is an essential part of the story of that championship and, consequently, essential to the telling of that story. But it gets very tired very fast to read about it in its every detail. Fischer was a brilliant chess player and a lousy human being. This reader could only take so many illustrations of the latter point, and BFGTW is larded with such examples in what proved -- again, to this reader -- to be an overly exhaustive account of the championship, day to day, blow by petulant or paranoid blow. After I finished this book, I watched the companion documentary. The latter, full of unmediated footage of all the principal players, was fascinating. It was, I thought, far superior to the book."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"A quick and enjoyable read, BOBBY FISCHER GOES TO WAR is a step back in time when all eyes in the world were fixed on a chess match in Reykjavik, Iceland in the summer of 1972. The American, Bobby Fischer, represented the free world, both its virtues (independent, fighter) and its flaws (selfish). The Soviet, Boris Spassky, was an artist who did not represent the USSR its in steely coldness but the romantic, cultured Russian. The narrative is driven by Fischer, whose psychological warfare seemed as much a stragedy as the moving of pawns. The affect is exhaustive, and as reader you can only began to imagine the exhaustion that everyone at Reykjavik experienced at Fischer's expense. But exaperation is replaced by wonder at Fischer's chess genius as he does the unexpected time and again on the board and Spassky and others are left speechless.Spassky never regained his title as world champion, but he did regain his life. Fischer reigned as one of the most recognizable names in the world, but any shred of stability had been shattered. The thin line between genius and insanity was always there, and on most days the verdict was the former."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"'Bobby Fischer Goes to War' is an in-depth account of the fischer-spassky matches in Reykjavik in 1972. It starts by briefly looking at each players history and development, before looking at how the match was set up and negotiated and then how it was played. It also looks at events that have come to light since the matches took place and in light of released CIA and KGB documents. It was a touch dry in places, but not excessively so and the rest of the book was so engaging that you quickly get back into the flow and are gripped by the events that unfold. There are various photographs reproduced throughout to illustrate the various points made and characters. There is also an appendix looking at FBI investigations into Fischers mother. Overall this seems to be well researched and written and you don't need to know about chess to enjoy this book. It is a snap shot of a particular place in time, when cold war sensibilities were high and national pride was at stake. A good read, about a landmark match and intriguing protagonists. Well worth a read.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"It's a really interesting book, full of details and easy to read.The cover describes Fisher as a lone hero, but inside the description of the two competitors is much more balanced.Probably it could include some more details about the chess games: even if I'm not an expert, I was forced to find elsewhere the moves of the games which were described as particularly good or bad."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"When I read this book last year, I thought it would make a great movie. So I was not surprised at all when I recently heard that it would be made into a documentary.I highly recommend anyone interested in chess, politics or a good story to read this book."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"BOBBY FISHER GOES TO WAR is a well-researched book, using, among other sources, recently opened Soviet files on the match. The authors (Edmonds and Eidinow) fill in the background leading up to the match, including bios of the lives of Fisher and Spassky, the two combatants in \\"the chess match of all time\\". However, the story lacks for sustainable drama; things poke along, the authors obviously stretching out a long magazine piece into a book. This is fine for chess fans but the general reader may feel too bogged down. On the other hand, there is little analysis of the games played in the match, which might frustrate a chess buff who has not yet read any of the analytical books on the match. BOBBY FISHER GOES TO WAR is probably more a political book than a sports book as all the negotiations, psychology, and behind the scenes manuvering are spelled out as well as the actions of the Soviet Communist party machinery regarding the match and very little on the games itself. Fisher comes off as brilliant but insane and this reader had little sympathy for his pathological behavior or the chess authorities caving into his ridiculous and nuerotic demands. All of that is covered in detail in the book. Ultimately, this is not the story of an American hero but of a pathetic, spoiled, ungrateful boy in a man's suit."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I didn't buy the book because there is no chess game in it. I got one from a local library. The main and background stories are interesting. There were too much and too good details that made me suspicious. The progress from newborn Fischer to his trouble time in Japan are all in there. About half of the book is about the confrontation of the '72 championship match. Except the first chapter I read fully, I only scanned quickly to the part there was chess or interesting details. Then to the page 306 (5 pages before the end!), author dropped the bomb. Fischer's biological father was not his mom's ex-husband. All I knew about Fischer before were: he had a mom and a sister (who taught him chess), and his mom was a nurse and had more other skills. Here the author slightly mentioned that FBI having some investigation on Fischer's mom and suspecting her as Soviet agent! Wow, that's chess version of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code (I haven't read his book, but watched the DVD version and some documentation on History Channel.)Then the author provided an Appendix, which gave the more detail about Fischer's parents plus a photocopy of FBI document. The government suspected there was some secretive plan that was why his mom kept pursuing for Fischer to become the world champion. Now, that's The Manchurian Candidate. They could not account for all her time (and his father's) during their stay in Moscow and other countries.I don't know how much to believe, but the review title expresses how I feel.Besides the 'exotic' details, I think the chess part is good. Because there is no chess game, I am willing to settle with a used book with 1/5 of the cover price."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I must respect Bobby Fischer as a player. But I learned some stuff that doesn't make me respect him as a person. I have read more things about Fischer which this book leaves out and should have been put in."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"And some did, anyway!Learn why, in this great combination biography of Fischer, biography of Spassky, and analysis of the 1972 showdown in Iceland.To take an analogy from the same year, this was like the Soviet-US basketball showdown at the Munich Olympics.And, while the chess championship wasn't rigged, due to his own and his camp's incessant hectoring, especially in getting Game 3 moved to a back room, Fischer was probably dissuaded from walking out from the match.As it was, he lost Game 1, forfeited Game 2, then roared back to score over half the remaning points scored, losing only once, while winning 9 and drawing 7.It's probably the most impressive display of chess ever, culminating from a start of Fischer \\"sweeping\\" the first two matches in the Candidates' series to earn the right to face Spassky.Then you have Spassky, who considered himself a Russian first, a Soviet second, and wasn't on perfect terms with the Soviet sports hierarch. A Spassky who was pretty much a \\"normal\\" human compared to the average populace and definitely to Fischer.And, that's the other good part. Briefly but precisely, the authors sketch Fischer's development from childhood, and even spring new evidence about who was actually his biological father.If you want to learn more both about the contestants and the importance of this match, read this book."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"Is it possible to make a book about chess that is a gripping read? Even for a reader not that familiar with, or interested in, the game itself? This book answers with an emphatic \\"Yes\\".I was 16 in 1972, an avid (though very mediocre) chess player, and a very close observer of the events recounted in this book. The authors do not exaggerate the importance that this match took on the world stage. Fischer's victory was indeed viewed as a great triumph in the US, on a par with the 1980 Olympic hockey \\"miracle on ice\\". But it has taken the passage of time to put everything in perspective. Fischer was a brilliant player, maybe the best of all time; but his antics that were then viewed as idiosyncracies, as the spoiled behavior of the prima donna sportsman, can now -- in view of his behavior of the last 30 years -- be seen as the early signs of absolute craziness (pardon the layman's term, I'm not a psychologist). The guy was, in a word, nuts.A story of triumph and tragedy, and very well told -- it makes for a completely absorbing read."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"This book caught my eye since I used to play high school chess competitively. I'm reasonably aware of Fischer's exploits - but this book opened a whole new level of understanding of the times. The political intrigue presented in the book was, to me, more interesting than the issues surrounding the chess match.Fischer is well known as a brilliant, but troubled, American player who bullied his way to get whatever he wanted. He won the World championship, then essentially disappeared.I wonder what Fischer's life would have been like had he been born in the Soviet Union with it's emphasis on finding, developing, and celebrating chess prodigies."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"Plus: Just the facts. This is a straightforward history of the 1972 Fischer-Spassky match, told with enough context to make the story understandable, interesting, and entertaining, but without exaggeration. The story is balanced, and tells Spassky's side as well as Fischer's.Minus: It assumes the reader knows absolutely nothing about chess, and therefore loses the drama of the games themselves. The authors do describe the \\"poisoned pawn\\" of Game 1, but otherwise there's very little chess in the book. Of course, some readers may think this is a plus! I enjoyed this book and recommend it if you are interested in the match."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"As an ameteur chess player, I actually enjoy reading about the game and the people involved with it. However, after reading a book called, \\"The Chess Artist.\\" I was turned off from such works. Nevertheless, when I saw this book displayed on a front rack, I couldn't resist.I really flew through this book. Most of this size take me at least a month. This one took about 5 reading sessions. I suppose that is a credit to the authors. It held my interest long enough to be able to take out chapters at a time.Rather than go on and on about the moves made and chess strategy, it focused more on the personal lives of the characters, and everything surrounding the famous match. There were some parts that were somewhat boring, but for the most part it was entertaining. Good job!"},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I have been a chess enthusiast for over 3 years now, and (was) really fascinated by the character of Bobby Fischer and his contribution to chess. I however, was under the impression that his masterpeices were just natural free flowing energy over the chessboard, and did not know anything about his rants, raves and his outrageously ridiculous demands and skewed views of life.The book starts off by explaining the real-life political &quot;chess game&quot; between the United States and the then Soviet Union in the cold war era, and sets the stage for one of the biggest chess games of the last century - more than the championship, the pride of two nations almost at war was at stake there. The book not-so-subtly highlights the oppressive and dictatorial tactics used by the then hard-core communist Russia, even on chess players. This insight gave me the best possible grounds to judge the character and the mental state of Spassky in the match - he is human, and a very generous, calm and a gentle one at that.Fischer on the other hand was a let down. My hero, the enigma which drew me towards the game in general was exposed as a really really weak human being, falling just short of a madman. The authors probably understand the enormous number of Fischer fans who are out there (and who are likely to buy this book and read it) and hence tried to get the message across in an extremely subtle manner. The games Spassky lost are told to be lost on account of mistakes akin to those made by patzers at the club level.The book seemed daring - it touches a side of chess championship game not quite written anywhere else. The writing seems dry at times, but that is just because the authors had to include those parts to maintain the integrity of the story, and there is no way they could have made it more interesting. All in all, a great book and one of those which does not suck up to Fischer because of his greatness at the game - rather exposing him as a failed individual."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"If Bobby Fischer's name is affiliated with a book, it comes to reason that there is some amount of weirdness forthcoming. I am not referring to the chess books Fischer wrote, as those are guidelines to chess perfection. This refers to any discussion of his life, which this book does. The world's greatest chess player, Fischer, has lived his personal life much less logically than his life is an eight by eight square cell.To help the nonchess reader sort out the menagerie, authors David Edmonds and John Eidinow provide a \\"Dramatis Personae,\\" listing 21 Americans, 24 Soviets, six Icelanders, four match officials, and six sundry others, explaining their relationship to the Reykjavik, Iceland chess match. They also include a short glossary to educate us in the vocabulary of competitive chess.The book begins with a vital quote by Boris Spassky, \\"When you play Bobby, it is not a question of whether you win or lose. It is a question of whether you survive. This sets the tone for all that follows.Edmonds and Eidinow lay out the social mire Fischer was growing up in, and his quick rise to chess dominance.In 1954, when Fischer was 11, he was attending matches and doing well enough but not at his later prodigy level. In that year, as he is quoted, he \\"just got good.\\" Modern chess history, or at least for one its most colorful characters, begins then.1972: Boris Spassky was the champ. He deserved to be there. Bobby Fischer was the contender. He deserved to have the opportunity. Between these two men stood a world of complex politics, money, national pride, idiosyncrasies, and suitors to the game. Reykjavik, Iceland was the location of what has become one of the most legendary chess matches ever, between Spassky and Fischer.Early on during Fischer's career, he had the same impact Michael Jordan would later enjoy later enjoy as professional basketball player. \\"Fischer-fear\\" was the description of some players' psychosomatic illnesses from Fischer's intimidation. Opponents would make mistakes as a result. Fischer had the bravado of Muhammad Ali, but none of his class. He would take this personality and boorish demands to the match.Boris Spassky is painted differently. A product of the Soviet support system, he became professional about the game. Affable and popular, an opposite to in every way to Fischer, he still had what Fischer lacked -- the title \\"World Champion.\\"The bulk of the book moves on from biography and personality profiles. It follows the path the chess culture -- all chaotic in its apparent systemic approach. Going from the need to compete to the actual match turned through every convoluted corner, with Kissinger's involvement, the FBI, the KGB, and as much intrigue as a James Bond movie.The travails of the match are outlined as needed (but not heavily), highlighting the most interesting parts and never boring nonchess players. The psychology of the players and chess players in general is discussed, as is the history of modern champions, providing a field for tension and a framework for the match.This was in the midst of the Cold War, and the Soviets -- not just Spassky, owned the chess champ title. Nixon was president. Fischer, the bombastic, arrogant American who hated Russia, had a knack for successfully risking it all on the board by knowing the principles of chess as a sublime art form. Spassky, the methodical Russian, against Fischer, became a symbol of the Cold war itself. The image of the match was only half of the matter. Neither man was the caricature the press saw them as, but such are the stories of legend.I fully recommend \\"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match of All Time,\\" (title from the hardback edition) by David Edmonds and John Eidinow. Oh, and if you somehow missed the big news back in 1972, Fischer won the match.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I managed to get my hands on an advance copy of this book and found it an absorbing account of this historic match, and I recommend it heartily. Another imaginitive tale of chess history and the chess culture is J.C. Hallman's The Chess Artist, a narrative nonfiction tale of two friends, one a writer and the other a black chess master, and their sojurn to a wide range of chess venues, including a breathtaking trip to Kalmykia to meet FIDE's Kirsan Ilyumzhinov. These two books, Bobby Fischer Goes to War and The Chess Artist, show that the chess world is alive and vibrant, and these stories are eloquent appeals to those who love good writing and good histories."},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"This is the 2nd book I read by these 2 prize-winning journalists and authors and I praise this work once again as a brilliant tour of famous chess match between Spassky and Fischer!The book has multiple focuses. While the matches themselves are not described in stark detail, the atmosphere around is. Included in this are brief biographies of these 2 chess superstars, pre-match and post-match reactions as well as its influence and possible involvement in the Cold War.In it, one discovers the passive, gentle and cordial personality of Spassky - a gentlemanly figure, in contrast to a demanding, bad-boy personality, yet a prodigy, of Bobby Fischer. The book recounts all the relevant events prior to this championship in Iceland in 1972, as well as reactions to it afterward. While there is some allusion to the matches themselves, as well as precise moves and brief analysis, the book in no way targets chess players as their primary readers. The book is targeted for anyone interested in history, particularly one having to do with chess and Cold War.The book is a real page turner and hard to put down. The style has a fast pace to it, yet thorough enough to capture even minute details. Overall, a great read for anyone and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match","review":"I enjoy the game of chess, but I'm far from an expert or diehard enthusiast. I know of Bobby Fischer, but I'm far from informed on the subject. Despite that, this book absolutely sucked me in right from the start, and I ended up reading it all in one night. It not only gives an extraordinarily detailed, game-by-game account of Fischer's classic 1972 showdown with Boris Spassky, it also provides a fascinating sense of the political and social context and the forces that were at work on (and in) each man. The writing is fluid and intelligent, easy to read in the best sense. If you're a fan of competitive chess or a Fischer-o-phile then this is a must-have, but even those who aren't will be able to enjoy this simply as an excellent biography about a talented but deeply flawed man who loomed large over a small board at the height of the Cold War. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Belly Dance Costume Making","review":"I was very disappointed in this publication -- &quot;slim for the money&quot; is something of an understatement in my opinion.

The sketches are amateurish at best, confusing at worst.

While it doesn't go into extreme sewing detail, it's a great idea book, and it certainly expands on the repertoire of (mostly purchased) costumes I've seen.The line drawings illustrate things clearly enough, and while I question the topology of her skirt layouts as printed, they're easily fixed.

She is Polish and all of her relatives have big Polish weddings. I wanted an Irish wedding for Meghan as she was named after her Irish Grandmother. I did not want one of those greenie ones from the shops where all that is Irish is the color! We wanted a wedding like grandma used to talk about. Great food, dance, song and stories in the kitchen. I had heard about the old country weddings all my life but had never been to one. My wife agreed but didn't know where to begin. This book was the lucky charm! We had no trouble with the traditional cake and teatime. All easy to follow. We even did the wedding customs and had a special event prior to the wedding for wedding party. I had some cds but nothing for weddings. We were able to find all we needed right in the book and after a few trips to my online music suppier we were in business. My brother in law usually plays for polkas but we were able to convince him to play some of the tunes in the book. The music was right there. My cousin sang the Irish wedding song. Instead of traditional corned beef that my Americanized relatives served we prepared the spiced beef from the book- most of em spent half the afternoon writing out the recipe! Even the Polish relatives liked it. They were glad to know that some of the cds had polkas! My wife enjoyed pouring out the Irish tea and now is pestering me to go to Ireland..... The kids got off to a great start and I think all enjoyed getting back to the old vilage traditions. It was a good change from all the comercial weddings held in our town. The neighbors are still talking! A good way to start out on a new life- a return to traditions. Slante!

I purchased the book just for the music,recipes,stories, games and folklore alone. The wedding you construct from the directions provided here will be the best Irish traditional wedding ever. I have even recommended it to my friends in Ireland- sometimes modern Irish weddings like those in the US can be frightfully plastic and dependant upon business trends. You know- just another one of those packaged deals....Beware of Irish wedding books that mention one commercial establishment after the other! The tradition can do quite well enough on its own and you need to find the &quot;real tradition&quot;- your Irish relatives will know it when they see it! This is a great gift for the bride to be and for any family Irish or other which wants to have a rip-roaring traditional wedding which will live in memory forever. All of the traditions are there- just follow them to a wonderful event.Alice Riada Washington D.C."},{"Title":"Psadh and Bainis: Guide to the Traditional Irish Wedding","review":"In preparation for our wedding we must have read every Irish wedding book on the market. Most are designed for the 20th century bride and groom. This was exactly what we did not want. We wanted to go right to the traditions of our heritage. Most sources somehow somewhere served as guides to comercial outlets and stores. We were convinced that we could do our wedding as our ancestors did theirs from scratch, with their own hands- we found all we needed and more in this book. We could prepare the wedding dress, gather the ingredients for traditional foods and follow the traditional timetable of events all on our own. This for us was important. It was getting back to our heritage- our roots. This was also important for our guests- especially those who had come from Ireland in the old days. There is something about the quality of home made which can not be equaled. The real traditions. We found everything. We were particularly impressed with the music. Not just titles but actual lyrics and notation. All I had to do was give it to the band. We also found in the book ways to convert our 20th century American friends gathered together into a true Irish Festivity. The directions for preparing tea were great. Soon all were telling the stories provided in the book as if they had known them their whole lives. We even had a few strawboys- the costume directions are right there in the book. To show you how we appreciated this reference- it is now part of our wedding album and will be passed down in the family- that is if it doesnt get worn out along the way. The recipes, stories and lore are good for everyday use too! I highly recommend this book. We did a peasant wedding style but there are directions for ancient celtic weddings as well as fancy georgian lace ones. I am trying to talk my sister into going celtic! They already speak some gaelic and with this book they can throw a great festivity. All for now!

None is as complete as this one. My son's wedding was perfectly planned (according to several guests from Ireland as well as the older generation in attendance) and all we used was this one book. Where else can you learn how to dress up like a straw boy? We had a few of the local guys do it and it was spectacular. People could not believe what they were seeing- the illustrations in the book are perfect. We also wanted real music and not cds. We came up with a bluegrass fiddler and a banjo player. They did not know any of the songs until we gave them the book. In an hour or so we had a great selection of live music- the lyrics and the music are all there. Then came the food which was lovely. Compliments all around. The younger kids had a great time with the authentic games. The bride was even properly stolen away! I highly recommend this book for anyone planing an Irish Traditional wedding- start here and then go on to some of the more popular commercial style ones which seem to be nothing more than advertizing for shops.

It wasn't the type of book I was looking for in wedding planning."},{"Title":"Psadh and Bainis: Guide to the Traditional Irish Wedding","review":"Amazing how many books are coming out on Irish weddings. As a consultant specializing in Celtic celebrations, I have the dubious honor of buying or borrowing whatever books come out that focus on important events in the Celtic life. This one came to my attention while browsing the internet. It purports to be &quot;the definitive resource&quot;, but it's simply a compilation of material that anyone can get if they visit their local library. These days, engaged couples are usually so busy, they need sound, practical advice that will save them time, aggravation, and possibly a few bucks into the bargain. The idea of trying to recreate a hands-on, hand-made &quot;village/peasant style&quot; celebration that other reviewers are raving about is totally out of touch with reality. From my own experience, what engaged couples want is something that will make the planning process easier, while also incoporating appropriate ethnic details. There's lots of fun stuff to read here, but &quot;definitive&quot;, it is definitely not."},{"Title":"The Detection Collection","review":"What better way to show reverence to Britain's Detection Club than with a strong anthology for its seventy-fifth birthday though based on Simon Brett's Introduction the founding date is ironically a mystery as 1929, 1930 or 1932 are bandied about. One thing mystery fans will agree upon is that the club has always contained a who's who. The founders included Christie, Chesterton, and Sayers, etc. The contributors to this anthology consists of renowned British authors such as P.D. James, Colin Dexter, H.R.F. Keating, and one of this reviewer's favorite suspense authors Robert Goddard. The eleven tales are all well written with three extraordinary standouts: James' \\"The Part-time Job\\", Dexter's \\"Between the Lines\\" and \\"Toupee for a Bald Tyre\\" by Goddard. Mr. Brett adds an essay \\"The Detection Club, A Brief History\\" that adds to the fun of a fine compilation that whether it is anniversary 73. 75 or 76, still pays homage to the founding parents through a solid short story collection.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Detection Collection","review":"Good book of short story mind teasers to keep you occupied when you find yourself with dead time on your hands with nothing to do."},{"Title":"The Detection Collection","review":"Great to have this as part of The Detection Club issuances for anyone's library.

Before I said I would read all of his book but this is the sixth one I've read and I've only liked two. It's like the same character on a different day: they all have prostitutes, young girls with pert breasts, pimps, and drugs. Blah blah blah.

A great book overall. Definitely enjoyable."},{"Title":"CSS Cookbook","review":"I think I'd generally agree with the previous positive reviews. You should already be familiar with CSS, JavaScript and HTML - this is not a CSS starter book. It's more geared toward start to finish answers for common CSS questions, most of which I found I could easily adapt to my level of understanding. There is an in-depth description about how to create a very nice looking calendar with CSS (using HTML tables) which I liked a lot. However, for me personally, I will probably stick with O'Reilly's CSS: The Definitive Guide.I'm sure it was done for monetary reasons, but it would have been nice if the figures were in color - or at least the figures supporting the elements that deal with color. It was tough to distinguish between shades of grey or follow the arrows with the words \\"blue\\" or \\"green\\" on one end pointing to an area. I know, I know, picky picky. :) So - while I'm being picky... :) The foreward mentions \\"...compiling hundreds of CSS recipes into this single book\\" - but by my count, there are only 89 Problem/Solution/Discussion sections (aka recipes). I would like to have seen \\"hundreds of CSS recipes\\", which would have provided greater variety to the solutions."},{"Title":"CSS Cookbook","review":"O'Reilly's other books on CSS tend to be more for reference and learning, but this book, by Christopher Schmitt, contains good, practical advice for putting CSS to use. And as a bonus, this book covers the brand-new CSS 2.1 conventions. Like other \\"Cookbook\\" tech books, there are plenty of real-world cases and blocks of code that designers and developers can use or adapt in their own situations. There are plenty of \\"Hello World\\" examples that will be useful to those new to CSS, but there is some advanced material, too, for those at intermediate levels looking to spread their wings a bit. This volume bookends quite nicely with the \\"Eric Meyer on CSS\\" books."},{"Title":"CSS Cookbook","review":"Of the various recipe-style books about CSS that have appeared in recent times, this one is probably the best. It covers a variety of realistic requirements, from \\"web typography\\" (large first letters, highlighted first lines, fancy pull quotes etc) to several different kinds of menus and multi-column page layouts. Most of the recipes are short but they are also largely self-contained, making them very quick and easy to use. This format makes me prefer Schmitt's effort to some comparable works, such as Eric Meyer's two colorful volumes, Eric Meyer on CSS and More Eric Meyer on CSS.That said, however, potential buyers of the book should be warned that it has some glaring omissions. While Explorer-like collapsible menus and tab-style horizontal menus are explained, there is no recipe for drop-down or \\"fly-out\\" menus. The chapters on table styling and print stylesheets are rather thin, and the chapter on Hacks and Workarounds makes no mention of Internet Explorer's conditional comments, which, being deliberately-designed browser features, seem like more durable tools than the parsing bugs on which most hacks are based.These omissions might be understandable if space was at a premium, but at 252 pages, the book is short compared with most other titles from O'Reilly's cookbook series. And one wonders why, if useful things had to be left out, the author could still find room for a Javascript-based technique for producing that most annoying of web phenomena, blinking text.In the end, I would still recommend the book for people who find that they have to use CSS occasionally, rather than on a daily basis. But the buyer should still be prepared to spend time trawling the web in search of solutions to many problems."},{"Title":"CSS Cookbook","review":"I've recently had the pleasure of reading CSS Cookbook by Christopher Schmitt, published by O'Reilly (the people who put animal pictures on their tech books - seems silly, but now you know exactly who I mean, don't you?). While I do not recommend it as a beginner's guide to CSS, I recommend it for the bookshelf of current CSS developers, or perhaps if you have a basic knowledge of CSS (maybe you use it control fonts and colors, and that's about it) and would like to implement even more of your design with CSS.The book is meant to be a reference book, but I read it straight through for the purposes of a review. It's one of the thinner reference books you can buy - weighing in at a little over 250 pages - but it is packed; no long-winded opining, no lengthy sidebars, just a raw: problem - solution - explanation - see also format. This format makes it very easy to look up the specific CSS issue you need insight on and get it.The book is divided into various categories of CSS, beginning with typography and other elements, moving along to links, lists, forms, tables, all the way up to a page layout section (if you've never used CSS to lay out an entire page, this section alone is worth the cost of the book), then addressing print CSS, browser hacks and workarounds, and then finishing with a brief section of raising various design possibilities that CSS makes possible.Each section begins with beginner-level problems, such as how to justify text. The section then gets into mid-level problems, such as CSS rollovers and various uses of background images. Finally, each category will tackle big-boy problems, like how to make a CSS-based splash screen that converts to main content, creating variable-length folder tabbed menu items, and centering fixed-width items in a variable-width area. I feel like I have a fairly good grasp of CSS - I do almost all my pages in Strict XHTML and use CSS for my layout, formatting, the works, and I still learned plenty from this book. If nothing else, it will give you other ideas on how to solve common problems.One unexpected value of this book were all the hacks and tricks. As many developers know that peruse various web development blogs, websites, and mailing lists - there are scads of CSS tips, tricks, hacks, and workarounds posted out there, but finding the one you need when you need it can be a challenge. This book contains all the main ones, dealing with Fahrner Image Replacement and its alternatives, CSS \\"Sliding Doors,\\" various box-model hacks to deal with Internet Explorer, Netscape 4 hacks and reminders, etc. It's like someone took all the standard \\"fixes\\" for common CSS issues from all the blogs, websites, and mailing lists and put them in this book. For me, that was worth the price of admission.I'm not always this laudatory about all tech books. In fact, I'm reading a CSS book right now that has loads of problems. The CSS Cookbook, however, is one I would recommend without reservation or a single \\"yeah, but...\\" to my colleagues in web development or students in the field."},{"Title":"CSS Cookbook","review":"I am becoming a serious fan of the Cookbooks from O'Reilly. They are well-organized, have lots of great tips and recipes, and don't get bogged down in detail, but still give enough insight to be useful when expanding the ideas.The CSS Cookbook from Christopher Schmitt is no exception. It is aimed at developers who know a bit about CSS, but need some reference to solve specific problems, and who wish to view alternate methods to common situations. While this book will not teach you CSS, it is a great desk reference to jog your memory, or reveal some new trick.Overall, the CSS Cookbook starts with some basic ideas about typography on the web, something that every designer should be aware of, if not devoted to. It then hits all the usual suspects, including page elements, links and navigation, tables, etc (all listed on the back cover). They way this book is broken down may take a little getting used to, since the focus is more on individual approaches to design ideas, rather than a master list of common complete page layouts. However, the last 3rd of the book gives some great overall information about complete designs, compatibility considerations, and some bit of theory about using CSS effectively.Language in this book is neutral, but conversational. It may not have you curled up by a fire on a chilly evening, but it gets the points across very well. Schmitt seems to hit a nice stride with giving you useful information without making it dry or giving in to bad jokes and punch-in-the-arm commentary. Not that these last things are necessarily bad, they just aren't in Schmitt's book. That helps make it a great tool to keep close by.Something that's near and dear to my heart is replacing tables with appropriate CSS-Positioning elements. Schmitt does a good job balancing the argument about when to use tables versus divs. While I prefer to use tables for banging my shin against, they are still quite widely used, and merit consideration in certain circumstances. One highlight is his elegant use of styled tables to build a nice-looking calendar. This is something many people will find very useful.Other highlights include a great section on column layouts. Not only are the recipes given, but time is also allowed for consideration of challenges with each style, and why some workarounds may be necessary. Another favourite is making print-friendly pages, including forms. Resumes, help files, and reference material could all benefit from such a treatment when presented online.I think a pretty good middle range of designers would greatly benefit from the CSS Cookbook, and some advanced people who just need a new idea or refresher now and then. Certainly, one could find more technical or theoretical books on CSS, such as in the Definitive Guide series from O'Reilly, or the W3C-endorsed 'Cascading Style Sheets: Designing for the Web' by Lie and Bos. But for practicality, quick solutions, and some great ideas, the CSS Cookbook is a great tool for any designer's collection.I'd say run down to your local bookstore, or check out some of the sample text on O'Reilly's site and consider putting this one on your shelf."},{"Title":"CSS Cookbook","review":"The CSS Cookbook is a nice reference for seeing CSS in action. This book focuses on examples grouped by Typography, Page Elements, Navigation, Lists, Forms, Tables, Page Layouts, Printing layout, CSS workarounds, and design tips.Christopher Schmitt writes in a clear, concise manner. Tips and information are presented in a \\"no nonsense\\" way, getting straight to the point. I just wish there were more points made. For a 250 page book, this is a nice manual of solutions to common problems that CSS can solve, but I feel like more could have been added to bring the page count somewhere around 350-400. One of the main things that CSS can do is address the need for \\"tableless\\" web pages and while Mr. Schmitt discusses this topic in his chapter relating to page layout, I feel more examples should have been provided for a book which calls itself a \\"cookbook\\".Having said that, the calendar example in Chapter 6 is worth the price of admission alone, and the samples provided relating to font typography are well written. The thing I like about Oreilly's \\"Cookbook\\" series is the fact that these books get right to the point. Too many times authors spice up their books with humor-filled writing and for a reference guide you just want to be able to open up a book and find relevant examples. The author does a nice job of providing an excellent companion to \\"Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide\\" and it would benefit any CSS developer to have a copy of \\"CSS Cookbook\\" next to their computer.**** RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"CSS Cookbook","review":"If you do any programming at all you soon learn of the immense value of programming cookbooks. This particular one came at a good time for me as I was trying to figure out how to create a particular effect for a web page and knew that it could be done with a cascading style sheet. A quick turn to the correct page and the code was right there along with an explanation of how it works. Twenty minutes later it was completely coded and working correctly.The author lists many common problems and for each of them provides a problem definition, a solution, and a discussion. For many of the problems the author also includes a \\"See Also\\" section that points you to further reading. With so many problems and solutions it is important to organize them in a way so they can be located quickly. To achieve this goal the book is divided into ten distinct sections. These sections are: Web Typography, Page Elements, Links and Navigation, Lists, Forms, Tables, Page Layouts, Print, Hacks and Workarounds, and Designing with CSS. A top quality cookbook title from O'Reilly Media, CSS Cookbook is a highly recommended read for anyone working with web pages and cascading style sheets."},{"Title":"CSS Cookbook","review":"If you're not familiar with O'Reilly's cookbook series (...), they're books with a basic formula: Problem, Solution, and Discussion sections for every 'recipe.' The link takes you to an image showing how the format looks. Each recipe is a script, program, command, or piece of code for implementing within a large part of a whole.In CSS Cookbook, get recipes for using CSS to create pull quotes, to add a background image, to build various types of layouts, and to manage forms. It is not about building a Web site from scratch, but getting bite-sized markup for implementing pieces of the site.This book is for those who know HTML and have a basic understanding of CSS. Like any food cookbook, the recipes are there when you're ready for them. It's not for reading from cover to cover. When you get stuck on a problem or want to know how to create a printer-friendly page, refer to the recipe.The main issue with the book is its use of tables in some of the recipes. With the growing number of Web sites moving towards Web standards compliance, tables are finally going away as a layout tool. Their only purpose is for organizing data.Don't expect recipes on fly-out or drop down menus. This is not a bad thing as CSS is not the ideal way to create such menus as there are many problems with implementing them. So it is understandable why they were not included. If you want to learn how to do these menus, there are many resources on the Internet showing how.The book could use more recipes as others in the Cookbook series have 400, 500, and even 700 pages. This one is just 270 pages.As in his other books, Schmitt does an excellent job of explaining each problem and solution with his minimal jargon and easy writing style. The table of contents (...) provides the list of the types of problems covered in this book.

Major topics are Web Typography, Page Elements, Links and Navigation, Lists, Forms, Tables, Page Layouts, Print-Friendly functions, Hacks/Workarounds and miscellaneous designing issues.Each chapter is divided into subsections, and they are patterned as follows:- Statement of the \\"Problem\\" (as the book puts it), or what it is that you want to do.- \\"Solution\\": first gives the HTML (if relevant), and then the CSS for modifying the HTML to get what you want.- \\"Discussion\\": explains in plain English what you just saw in the \\"Solution\\" section.- \\"See also\\": suggests other resources.Some of the examples require some knowledge of JavaScript, and in those cases I simply had to note that fact and move on.

I know that there are large benefits with using CSS, and it makes your life eaiser, but I found learning CSS from scratch to be somewhat daunting. From the novice perspective I found this book to be exactly what I needed. There are larger books out there, but I really needed just the basics.This isn't a large book, I found it to be concise, and helpful in understanding CSS. I haven't always found the largest book to be the most helpful. I liked that I could read this book, understand its explanations and then immediately impliment the code. If you are looking for the end all be all in books, this may not be the book you are looking for.

I'm an experienced web developer and already know how style sheets work and how to use them - I just wanted a book where I could quickly look up specific syntax, etc.This book definitely doesn't work for that - the index is sorely lacking and the information isn't well-organized at all. So, since a lot of the other reviewers wrote that this book isn't for beginners (I agree) and, since I'm an experienced developer and it's not working for me, I'm not sure who would find this book useful. Especially when there are so many other CSS books to choose from.....Normally O'Reilly books are really good, so I'm a little bit surprised that they published this book without having an editor clean it up and organize it. In any case, I would not recommend this book, period. I'm glad that my employer paid for it and not me. ;-)"},{"Title":"CSS Cookbook","review":"Beware, the author warns. This is not a book to learn CSS from scratch. Its premise is that you already have a basic understanding of CSS and of the rudiments of JavaScript. But given that, Schmitt offers a handy grab bag of time saving hacks, that others have found useful when struggling with CSS.Some of the problems and solutions do seem really basic. Like the very first one, about setting the typeface of some text in a page. You'd expect any book teaching CSS to cover this, or, if not, that a user who read that book could quickly find this solution. A few other problems are like this.But the majority of problems presented here are not so trivial. That, combined with a succinct set of one liners that describe each problem in the contents, should give the book some appeal to you."},{"Title":"CSS Cookbook","review":"This book can save you a lot of pain in developing CSS on multiple browsers.

This is a book for those that have worked with CSS and been stung either by browser incompatibilities or the inability to find the right CSS syntax for tricky jobs. Non-Javascript menus, the box model hack, three column CSS layouts, hanging list indents, it's all in here.The great part about the cookbook series is that it not only shows you how to fix the problem in front of you, it also has enough discussion to get you around related issues and maybe teach you a thing or to.I highly recommend this book to any serious CSS user."},{"Title":"CSS Cookbook","review":"A very good book, targeted to the web developer, who knows his bit of CSS, and wants to get his CSS development to a higher level.

This, in my opinion, is very important in getting your foundation straight & solid, so it can safely be built upon.The book is written well, without bogging you down with excess theory or pages of boring information, yet neatly introducing useful concepts. The author goes into great detail in explaining how to correctly do a certain pose, and points out common mistakes. I have found it very helpful. The brief real-life examples of balances and imbalances in chakras are also quite interesting.Lastly, the spiritual part of the book: meditation. I was quite a novice to the whole practice of meditation prior to reading this book. So no surprise, as I tried, I did not always feel like I was entering \\"the state of oneness, yoga\\", and at times I couldn't even let go of restless thoughts. But it improves with time and practice. And Alan Finger emphasizes it - practice consistently, in order to get results. I would probably also play some quiet meditation music while listening to the book's audio, as it comes without background music.I do recommend this book to all who are seeking another dimension in their lives. It will not only help you become better at your yoga practice, but may as well help you make a shift towards a better life and being a better person."},{"Title":"Chakra Yoga: Balancing Energy for Physical, Spiritual, and Mental Well-being","review":"I have been doing yoga for many years before it became well known and supposedly popular. (Although every other commercial these days has some woman doing yoga in order to attach their product to this symbol of a healthy lifestyle (even a house paint commercial!), I wonder how many folks actually practice for more than a little while...) At any rate, the feature that made this book better than all the rest was the CD which introduced me to the chakra mantras which allowed me to actually feel the chakras in my body on my very first attempt using the mantras! And this author is offering his wisdom at a very reasonable price! Buy this one new!"},{"Title":"Chakra Yoga: Balancing Energy for Physical, Spiritual, and Mental Well-being","review":"I practice and teach chakra meditation separate from a physical yoga practice, and I found this book to be an excellent introduction to the chakras for anyone. Because the author's focus is chakra meditation as a complement to physical hatha-based yoga, it is probably most helpful for those who do practice yoga, and will help deepen your practice. However, it is also great for those just interested in learning more about the 7 core chakras of the Indian/Hindu-based traditions, even if you don't practice yoga.The author starts with an overview of his background, and then briefly covers the history of yoga. He then devotes one chapter to each of the core 7 chakras, describing the energies associated with each, and listing questions for identifying whether you potentially have an imbalance or block within that chakra. Then, because his focus is physical yoga, he depicts (with pictures and explanation) basic physical hatha yoga positions that can help address this imbalance. There is not a lot of information on other ways to work with the chakras, but you can get that from other sources.The included meditation CD is also very helpful and direct. He walks you through the classic yogic breathing technique Nadi Shodhana Pranayama, and then guides you through a mantra (sound) based meditation on each of the 7 chakras. He includes some mudras, or sacred hand movements, associated with each, and in the book he also discusses the yantras, or visual images sometimes used in chakra meditation as well. The meditation techniques he features are safe and easy for anyone to follow.It should be noted that the chakra system, and corresponding mantras, mudras and yantras that he features are specific to the Indian Hatha-based systems. Tibetan and Sufi chakra systems, and others less well-known, actually differ from these. But this system is certainly the one that most Westerners will be the most familiar with, since hatha-based yoga is the most popular form taught here.Overall, a great introductory book and CD for anyone interested in the chakras, and especially for those also interested in physical yoga."},{"Title":"Chakra Yoga: Balancing Energy for Physical, Spiritual, and Mental Well-being","review":"I ordered this item for the CD, which was highly recommended to me.

Some of the contributors give really useful advice. Others still are responding to a specific cartoon.

Then Snoopy's Guide to the Writing Life is the ideal book to give your writer, on birthdays, on holidays, at graduation.This is as much a book about life as it is a book about writing. This isn't a book about \\"the process.\\" The book won't help you put words on the page, or help you fix your grammar, or describe the best ways of building air-tight plots. What Snoopy's Guide does is far more interesting and far more important--it takes twenty-odd writers and has them talk about about their writing processes, their wins and their losses, and each writer relates their experiences in some way back to Peanuts, which puts their experiences on terms everyone can relate to. Every writer has faced the terror of the blank page, or the title that won't come, or the vagaries of the market. Rather than discuss writing, Snoopy's Guide discusses the writing life, and that makes it a valuable resource to treasure.If you need a gift, Snoopy's Guide would be ideal. I should know--I gave one as a gift, and it was perfect."},{"Title":"Snoopy's Guide to the Writing Life","review":"&quot;Snoopy's Guide to the Writing Life&quot; is a tribute to Charles Schulz, the late great creator of the Peanuts comic strip and its famous beagle-with-a-typewriter, Snoopy. The book is filled with various strips lampooning all sorts of aspects of writing, and tiny snippets of advice from famous authors.The strips in this book are so funny that I had to share many of them with my husband as I read. Particularly all the ones that have within them some variation of the line: &quot;It was a dark and stormy night.&quot; Snoopy seemed fixated on that idea, unable to get past it to anything more original than &quot;it was a dark and stormy noon,&quot; or perhaps, &quot;he was a dark and stormy knight.&quot;And in between all of these stormy nights we get to see Snoopy's clashes with editors and publishers of all kinds: &quot;Dear Contributor, We are returning your dumb story. Note that we have not included our return address. We have moved to a new office, and we don't want you to know where we are.&quot; Ouch! All writers can identify with some part of the poor beagle's struggles for fame, recognition, and a fifty thousand dollar check!I was a bit surprised to find out just how short most of these little essays are--a few paragraphs, generally. On the other hand, it meant there was more room for comic strips, so how can I complain? This book isn't meant to be an exhaustive textbook or guide to the writing life. It's a joyful riff on the pain, excitement, and perspiration that is writing. You're bound to find something in here by a writer you love, and it's neat just to see what these preeminent folks have to say. Each essay is preceded by a related comic strip, and many of the essays address Snoopy or one of his friends directly, or mention poor Snoopy's latest plight--it's an endearing conceit. Each is then followed by several more strips just to keep us laughing.This is a wonderful coffee table book. It's a great gift for your favorite struggling, would-be, or even successful writer. All of us can relate to Snoopy's trials and tribulations. All of us can enjoy seeing these brief words of wisdom from such accomplished authors. And all of us could use a good laugh at ourselves and the &quot;hardships&quot; we endure in the writing life!"},{"Title":"Snoopy's Guide to the Writing Life","review":"Collaboratively compiled and edited by award winning short story writer Barnaby Conrad and novelist Monte Schulz (who is also the son of the \\"Peanuts\\" comic strip creator Charles M. Schulz), Snoopy's Guide To The Writing Life is an engaging collection of writing anecdotes and insights drawn from over thirty of the world's most popular writers, including Danielle Steel, Ray Bradbury, and William F. Buckley Jr. But perhaps the real star of the book is Snoopy and the Peanuts gang, featured in timeless comic strips about Snoopy's struggle to write the Great American (Dog's) Novel, as well as the other kids' attempts to construct literate book reports. Replete with a wealth of humorous, insightful, and filled with practical tips, Snoopy's Guide To The Writing Life is highly recommended reading for both aspiring writers and \\"Peanuts\\" fans."},{"Title":"Snoopy's Guide to the Writing Life","review":"No cartoon series is followed more closely by writers than Peanuts and no dog understands writers better than Snoopy.

Charles Schulz drew huge crowds each time he spoke there.As an author, I will treasure this very special book.Dan Poynter, ParaPublishing.com"},{"Title":"Snoopy's Guide to the Writing Life","review":"In this book's prologue, we are given a heartwarming view of Snoopy's creator, Charles Schulz, which heightens the effect of the following comic strips on the writing life. I could not stop laughing. Schulz knew what he was talking about and put into Snoopy's head all the thoughts of us aspiring and expiring writers. The accompanying text to the cartoons, contributed by well known writers, was not nearly as good, but there were some interesting facts. In any case, Snoopy didn't need any help. He makes this book all on his adorable lonesome.Hilarious and right on point!"},{"Title":"Snoopy's Guide to the Writing Life","review":"On page 153, in an effort to encourage writers who might be dismayed by rejection slips, Jack Canfield writes, \\"Margaret Mitchell's classic GONE WITH THE WIND was turned down by more than twenty five publishers.\\" To my knowledge, this is completely untrue. The story I've heard (from more than one source) goes something like this: Margaret Mitchell wrote the book while recovering from a leg injury. She considered writing as simply a hobby, and she wasn't even thinking of publishing the book. She figured she was only writing it for her and her husband. But then one day a publisher came to Atlanta and some of Margaret's friends told him that she was working on a book. Margaret had once worked for a brief period on the local newspaper and she had some connections in the city. The publisher was eager to see the manuscript, but Margaret didn't have much confidence in it and she refused to show it to him. But he worked on her and finally wore her down. She showed up at the train station just before he was leaving with a pile of envelopes that contained different portions of the novel, all out of order. The book was hardly a rough draft at this stage, but the publisher liked what he read and he signed the book and Margaret went to work cleaning it up and polishing it into the book we know today. I've never heard anything about these other twenty five publishers. People should check their facts before they print things in a twenty dollar book."},{"Title":"Snoopy's Guide to the Writing Life","review":"As a lifelong Peanuts fan and a writer, when I learned of this book I was immediately excited. I got it from Amazon.com and read the whole thing in about two hours. It's a good, satisfying book, but not quite what I expected. I never thought I'd say this, but probably the best thing about the book is the introduction.Monte Schulz, son of the great Charles, uses the introduction to cast his father as a lover of books and as someone who always thought of his work as low art. (Personally, I consider \\"Peanuts\\" to be among the highest art there is). The stories Monte tells about his father are wonderful and made me feel a bit closer to one of my heroes.The strips collected here, most of which feature Snoopy pounding away at his infamous typewriter or getting a rejection slip (sometimes tied to a rock) are excellent. I've always said that anybody can find his or herself in a Peanuts [comic] strip -- I'm in MOST of the strips about Snoopy.Where the book falls somewhat short is in the essays collected from some really great writers. Rather than being anything really groundbreaking or informative, most of them are little more than pep talks. The one from Julia Child is completely superfluous unless you're out to write the world's greatest cookbook.It's a worthwhile book, especially if you're a writer who loves Peanuts. Just don't expect too much from it."},{"Title":"Snoopy's Guide to the Writing Life","review":"Even Snoopy has publishing woes. And this book contains close to 200 pages of the beloved Peanuts comic strips, all related to writing and getting published.But this book is more than just a new decoration for your coffee table. Some of the most successful authors today have written essays tied into the comics.For example, several strips illustrate Snoopy's trouble with Lucy, super critic. Author Sue Grafton's essay addresses the issue writers face when having outsiders take a look at your work in progress.Over 30 authors offer their advice in a humorous, yet very informative essay. Some of those authors include Clive Cussler, Danielle Steel, Ed McBain, Fannie Flagg, Ray Bradbury, William F. Buckley, Jr. and more.No matter what your writing experience, even if you're not a writer, you can take something away from this humorous look at the writing life. The authors lend a nice touch to the book, launching it into a writing reference tool as well as an entertaining one."},{"Title":"Snoopy's Guide to the Writing Life","review":"I luved this book.

But for those writers who are looking for a laugh and a breezy escape featuring personal writing tales from the likes of William F. Buckley, Ed McBain, Danielle Steel, Julia Child, Ray Bradbury and Elmore Leonard, this book fills the bill as well as anything out there.A handsome book with a clean layout, quality semigloss stock, and a good binding, the showpieces are the delightful Charles Schultz &quot;Peanuts&quot; strips featuring Snoopy in his hopeless Writer persona. Each one is funnier than the next, and as brought together in one place provide an overview of Snoopy's writing strips that I have not found in any other collection. (The strips span the latter half of the comic's run as Snoopy's Writer didn't show up until the Seventies.)Schultz skewers just about every genre of writing, nails the agonies and ecstasies of rejection and acceptance, and does more with &quot;It was a dark and stormy night&quot; than seems humanly possible. If you are a writer and can't laugh at Snoopy's pathetic talents, you need to get out of the profession! Nonwriters might find the author anecdotes just a distraction from the humor in the strips, but what a wonderful distraction.So sure, it fails to be a writer's workshop, sacrificing technical knowhow for mirth, but still, how can you lose? I can think of far worse ways for a writer to spend a few hours than reading this little piece of escapism.A three star book with a four star soul thanks to Schultz's keen eye and Snoopy's aplomb."},{"Title":"Snoopy's Guide to the Writing Life","review":"At first glance, this book seemed to me to be just another one of the many Peanuts books that have been published since Charles Schulz's death, which after reading it, my suspicions were confirmed.It has about a page or two from each of many famous authors, each giving some pointers on writing. These are separated by 2-4 Peanuts comic strips.It is an excellent book for someone who wants a few pointers on writing from famous authors. It gets its classic Peanuts touch by having lots of strips from the comic every few pages. Virtually all of the comics are the ones with Snoopy writingn on his typewriter, so if you like Snoopy's attempts at writing, this book may be worth it just to get all of these strips in one place.It is a good book, but nothing amazingly new. I give it a 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"Snoopy's Guide to the Writing Life","review":"It was a dark and stormy night when this book arrived in the mail. Ok, it could have been a late afternoon, but it was indeed dark and stormy. At least the UPS driver had his raincoat with hood to keep himself dry.My thoughts for getting the book were just to have a relaxing look at how Snoopy got into writing, how he worked at it, was frustrated by it, received harsh reviews from friends and the like. He kept at it. Submitted things, kept getting rejections.What I didn't expect was to be inspired to actually get back to writing myself. Like Snoopy, writing is something I have \\"wanted\\" to do. Unlike Snoopy, I didn't sit at the typewriter or computer and do it nearly as often as he did. That began to change with this book. How, I don't exactly know. Maybe because it was simple and not filled with directions on how to write and all of that. What can I say, I like short simple bits at a time.The short pieces from writers which are shown through the book provide their own insights to the writing life. Since it's Snoopy's book, most begin offering advice to Snoopy and his writing career.The writers include Sue Grafton, Sol Stein, Jack Canfield, Sidney Sheldon, Danielle Steel, Ray Bradbury and others.In the end, it's a great book if you are not expecting to be told how to write, what to write, when to write, how to feel after your are done writing and the like. It isn't that serious, nor should it be.Finally, I guess it is only fitting that Snoopy gets to show us what the writing life is sorta kinda maybe like.

Illustrated liberally with Charles M.

Whether you feel the calling to write non-fiction, general fiction, Sci-Fi, cookbooks, biographies, or short stories, there is a word of advice pertinent to your chosen genre. This book isn't really a \\"how to\\" book but rather motivation and encouragement from authors who've paid their debts. One of my favorite pieces was Jack Canfield's, on accumulating rejection slips. He points out many famous authors and pieces of literature that were rejected many times over before being accepted. Just don't give up.This lighthearted book should be included in every writer's bookshelf. Next time you're stuck, lighten up, take it off the shelf, and help yourself to some inspiration. There is also a lovely foreword by Monte Schulz, Charles's son, in which he remembers his father, and a great introduction by Charles's long time friend Barnaby Conrad, with remembrances of one of the greatest cartoonists of all time.

It doesn't provide much practical advice on writing, but it does contend with the psychological hurdles of writing, from struggling to get words on the page to dealing with rejection and bad critics.

Snoopy, the Literary Ace, is a favorite of mine, but I limited the stars due to the lack of substance in the text, particularly for the price! I read it twice, and the book is so unfocused, minimalistic, and generic in its approach as to be useless. The writers represent everything from sci-fi to self-help yet there is suprisingly little writing advice or even reminiscences an aspiring writer might relate to or learn from. It's more like snippets collected at a literary cocktail party.For HUMOR about writing, I'd recommend this book.

Philip \\"the Bold\\" was shrewd and a patron of the arts, John \\"the Fearless\\" was almost too ambitious for his own good, Philip \\"the Good\\" almost took the throne of France, and Charles \\"the Rash\\" went toe-to-toe with Louis XI, the first modern ruler in terms of cold-blooded nationalism. Calmette was a leading authority on this period and he spends some time specifically on the evolution of Burgundy from a weak kingdom to a more powerful duchy and on the problems of dynastic succession. This is arguably the best general study of ducal Burgundy available in English. Be aware, though, that several egregious errors were made in drawing the genealogical charts."},{"Title":"The Golden Age of Burgundy: The magnificent dukes and their courts","review":"Despite being fifty years old, Calmette's short study of the four great Dukes of Burgundy remains the best overall introduction in English to this rich and fascinating subject. His approach is largely narrative and political/dynastic in focus, but cultural and other matters are not ignored.Calmette's patriotic French stance on the perfidy of the Burgundian alliance with England seems somewhat surprising until one remembers he was writing very shortly after the War.One subject that does show the book's age is 15th century music. Our appreciation of Early Music has grown so much since Calmette's day that we now account the music of Binchois, Dufay, Busnois, Ockeghem and so on as among the greatest ever written and one of the glories of the Burgundian court. In Calmette's book, this topic rates but a solitary footnote.On final and small point, the back cover translates Charles le T&eacute;m&eacute;raire as 'Charles the Rash', while the text calls him 'Charles the Bold'. Calmette unflinchingly documents the last Duke's repeated blunders which destroyed the superb creation assembled by his three predecessors. Charles the Rash is by far the better description. Let us all vow to use that name in everyday speech until the unmerited title of Charles the Bold fades from our language."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"My book was Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass.

Lewis Carroll has an unique writing style; it is unlike anything that I have read before. His use of words give a sharp image in the reader's head, just like as if they were actually there. He uses excellent imagery. His descriptions on every single character were great,and that was one thing that I enjoyed. An example of his descriptions is in the beginning of chapter six, when Alice sees a footman in front of a house. Carroll describes the footman &quot;with a found face, and large eyes like a frog&quot;. He is one of the few authors that take the time to describe the supplementary characters. The main character is , of course, Alice. She is very adventurous, and this is seen throughout the book. Anything that she sees that is new, she will try it. In the very beginning of her adventures, she sees a potion that is laying around, and in hopes of getting into the garden that she saw earlier, she drank some of it, just because it said &quot;drink me&quot;. The potion made her very small, which eventually became an adventure within itself. Another example was when she went to play croquet with the queen. They played croquet with hedgehogs as balls and flamingoes as sticks. Alice didn't care what the adventure was, as long as she was a part of it.She also didn't hesitate to express her opinions. When the queen was executing everyone in her path, Alice spoke up about what she was doing. People who like adventurous characters would like Alice. The theme of this book to me is if you see something new, you should try it just for the fun of doing something new. It is shown by Alice's different adventures, like what I mentioned in the previous paragraphs. I didn't really get the plot of this story. I thought that it was to get to the garden that she saw in the beginning of the book. I think that I didn't get it because Carroll jumped from one adventure without finishing the previous one. That is one of the reasons why I gave this book three stars out of five. I didn't like this story, partially because it was fantasy. I just read it to try something different. I would recommend this book to readers who like reading fantasy and who like to use their imaginations while reading. I don't know why it is a big children's classic, but I didn't like when I was in elementary school and I still don't like it in high school. This book will most likely never become one of my favorite classics. Overall, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; wasn't very effective to me."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"It's amazing that many people have never read this book. After all, it's virtually impossible to find an American unfamiliar with the story, the characters, and the instantly recognizable illustrations. Yet, in truth, plenty of adults have never plowed through the brilliant but dated prose contained within the pages of Alice In Wonderland. And most of those never will because it is perceived as a children's tale and a book that they needn't bother with since they already know the basic story. This is a mistake.Alice In Wonderland is a unique and clever book. The fact that interest in it has survived so long is testament to its quality. The bizarre characters, which visually and playfully appeal to children, converse in clever riddles and political subtext that go over their heads and talk directly to more intellectual adults. This is a ground-breaking work, so completely off-the-wall that it's hard to imagine it having been published so many decades ago.Through The Looking Glass is Carroll's return to Wonderland, a special treat for readers disappointed by Alice In Wonderland's premature ending. The fun and mystery continue and improve in this second volume with the classic and irony-filled chess game.Chess-playing cards, hookah-smoking mushroom dwellers, shape-changing elixirs, and disappearing cats.

He wrote this book for his niece (?) but he still weaved in some of his own political beliefs.

In fact, I once tried to read a copy from the 1980's but I couldn't go on with it because the pictures were bothering me. Luckily, there's really only one freaky illustration in the original version, and that's the picture where Alice's neck is very long. It's a bit disturbing.But the book is well written and a good adventure story, too.I love the characters. They're very interesting.\\"'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'\\"- \\"The Chesire Cat\\", Alice In Wonderland, by Lewis CarrollCome to think of it, the Chesire cat illustration is actually quite creepy as well. But it's not a big deal or anything.The whole book's just weird fun. Where in the world did Mr. Carroll think of all this? The Mad Hatter? The Queen of Hearts? The Duchess and her pig baby?Alice herself is a considerably strange character.All in all, aside from a couple of creepy illustrations, the book is wonderful. Everyone should read it once in their lifetime---it's worth it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some ways, then dipped down so suddenly that Alice had no time to think what's was going on before she had founden herself falling down a very deep hole (Pg 2). Have you ever imagined crawling through a rabbit hole, falling down a well, and ending up in, well... Wonderland. You portably haven't, but now you are. If you now want to know, then you should read Alice in wonderland by Louise Carroll.Alice lets her curiosity get the best of her so she finds herself falling down a long, black hole. She follows the rabbit because she heard it say \\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\" After she hits the bottom of the well she finds all of these doors that she soon finds out are all locked. After she went around trying all of the doors she found a three-legged table in the middle of the floor with a small gold key on it. The key was to small to fit any of the doors and she starts to wonder how she is going to get out of her. She then finds a curtain, that's where she finds the door that the key fits. Once she opens the door she sees a beautiful garden but she is too large to fit in the door. Alice then finds a bottle marked \\"Drink Me\\" and when she drink it she shrinks. When she shrinks she noticed that she left the key on the table, which now she is too small to get. Then she finds cookies that says, \\"Eat Me\\" so of course Alice being as curiosity that she is she ate it. The cookie made her larger then what she was before. It made her so large that she got stuck. She started to cry, which made her shrink once again. She cried so much that it caused a river of tears. Then she is able to go into the small door, which then starts the whole adventure.Alice meets a lot of wonderful creatures and people during her adventure. She meets a caterpillar that gives her advice. She also meets the Duchess who has the Cheshire cat. The Cheshire cat told Alice to go visit the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse. Alice also meets the Queen of Hearts.

It has adventure, love, fantasy, and a lot of fantastic nonsense. Every page is exciting and mysterious with a bewildering twist. Lewis Carrol exceeds on making a childerns story into a fantastic novel for all ages. He has great imagination that he uses in his puns, riddles, and characters to make nonsense into complete thoughts and morals. Alice is a creative little girl who seems to find adventure around every corner. Everybody in Wonderland is just as creative as Alice; they all seem to be intelligent and fully spirited. This novel is something no one wants to pass by. Personally, I suggest this book becomes a classic everyone should have to read. Many things in this book capture a moment, like this qoute,&quot;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the Hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &quot;I-I hardly know, sir, just at present - at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times sice then.&quot; Another quote that stood out and will help choose this as your next book to read is from the cat. &quot;In that directoin,&quot; The Cat said, waving its paw around, &quot;lives a Hatter: and THAT direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives teh March Hare. Visit either you like: They're both mad.&quot; &quot;But I dont want to go amoung mad people,&quot; Alice replied. &quot;oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat.&quot;we're all mad here. I am mad, You are mad.&quot;"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice in Wonderland is very creative, it has talking rabbits and every animal is talking and talking objects to like flowers and checkerboard pieces. Alice thinks this a dream but it is actually happening. She sees a talking white rabbit and follows it because it looked like it was in a hurry, was wearing clothes and was holding a watch. The white rabbit falls in a whole which takes them into wonderland where everything is alive and talking. Alice is amazed of what she sees and is still following the white rabbit. The white rabbit takes her in an adventure and she meets strange things and at the end realizes she misses her home.What I liked about the book was that I watched the movie and the book and they are very similar to each other. What really interested me the most is that how Lewis Carroll came up with all of this. I liked how everything talks and that wonderland is very colorful and living. I also liked how much detail it gave to really make you imagine how it looked it kind of made me feel like if I was really there. There was really nothing that I did not like about it.Through the looking glass is book two that explains how Alice goes into another universe by walking into a mirror and is her second time in wonderland but she thinks it's all a dream. But in Through the Looking-Glass she fins out that this is real and that she is not dreaming. In this part of the book she is playing a game of chess and is trying to get to the eighth square. Through the Looking-Glass was my favorite part of the book because it has so many details. I also like that they included little children's stories like Humpty Dumpty. What I did not like was that when Alice was talking to the White and Red Queen about adding and subtracting. I really got lost in that chapter."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"All in all the recording was good and entertaining, but, the end of both stories were cut off and this was very disapointing. A great product until the end."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice's adventures in Wonderland, the classic, thrilling fiction book, by Lewis Carroll, is a story that has intrigued and captivated readers for more than a hundred years. In this book, Carroll writes about a seven year old English girl named, Alice, Who has stumbled into this insane and curious world. In her confusion to find reasonable explanations for this precarious adventure, Alice comes across quite a few unusual characters, including a White Rabbit, whom Alive had followed down the rabbit hole in her curiosity and a shy mouse whom she almost drowned with her tears. As Alice struggles with her internal conflicts of who she is and what has become of her, she came across a blue caterpillar sitting atop a mushroom, languidly puffing on a hookah and after an infuriatingly absurd conversation, Alice continued her journey onward. At last, Alice parades strait into the presence of the demanding Red King and Queen, and finds herself in very unique situations.In, Alice's adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, I occasionally found it hard to follow the sequence of events in which the story is laid out on account of my confusion at weather Alice was speaking dialogue or internal monologue. Although, Lewis Carroll includes in his stories, fictional characters from children books, which gives it a sense of adolescence; he also includes an Extensive, complex and chaotic game of chess, giving the book a more sophisticated feel. In Lewis Carroll's stories, I admire his creativity and originality with using fictional characters, but dislike the stories' structure and format. Considering everything, I would recommend this book to anybody because it meets the expectations of a classic, a fantasy fiction, and a children's novel."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Charles Dodgson and the British Imperial ImaginationLewis Carroll (real name Charles Dodgson) was a clergyman and mathematician. His delightful Alice In Wonderland is a feat of mythic imagination and fantasy that conjures an absurd vision of an alternate possible world, while also providing a biting satire of British culture, in the tradition of Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.Alice's tumble down the rabbit hole is the trigger for an imaginative flight of fancy about the structure of the world. Alice fears that she may fall through the middle of the planet to Australia, where people walk on their heads. This spatial referencing for Wonderland is important as a link to the colonial and imperial imagination of Victorian England. The pace of change and development of empire is such that traditional verities are thrown into radical doubt, and the possibility can be entertained of a journey through the looking glass to a land of wonder down under (like the journey from Kansas to Oz).Each of the characters in Alice in Wonderland can be assessed as social satire. Old Father William references the imaginary Australian spatial framework by standing on his head to guarantee his health. The impotent bullying by the Queen, the languid dream of the caterpillar, the madness of the hatter and hare, the card soldiers, and Alice as a quizzical rational person who takes all at face value, each is amusing because it touches a cultural nerve.The British Empire in its age of confidence almost thought that all things might be possible through science and industry and military might. Dodgson takes this cultural pride to an absurd logical conclusion, where chemical potions can rapidly change the size of objects and where the treasures of nature, such as flamingos and hedgehogs, are instruments for pleasure in an absurd game of croquet, like indulgent ancient Romans collecting rarities from the far corners of the earth.Humpty Dumpty is perhaps the most imperial satirical fool of all. His assertion that words mean what he wants them to mean is rather like the colonial settler, seeking to construct a new world in ignorance and defiance of established reality. Dodgson uses this parable as the occasion for wry logical observations about the absurdity of popular psychology.The popularity of Alice in Wonderland reflects the power of the vivid imaginative fantasy world of whimsy that Dodgson created, as an alternate myth to the orthodox imperial pride in British accomplishment. There is a self-deprecation, deflating the imperial orthodoxy with its surface blindness to the stupidity and confusion of Britain's growth. Looking back to Swift, and forward to the Goons and Monty Python, Dodgson voices a British self-doubt which was actually rather prophetic, in that the house of cards of empire eventually proved highly vulnerable."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is a fun read you can see where they get the ideas for all the movies from.

The way Lewis Carrol wrote it has to do a lot about politics and the way of reality. Alice always thinks what's the point of a book that shows nothing interesting whatsoever? Well later on she discovers that there are a few reasons why s some things are not nonsense. These are some of the nonesense things; Drinks make you shrink, cakes make you grow, cats can dissapear, and flowers can sing. Some of the things Alice does can be thought as lessons, the sentence \\"Curiosity killed that cat\\" is used in other ways in the story, starting with chasing a rabbit down a tunnle.

What's interesting about this book is that there are several smaller stories strewn throughout. The Mock Turle's Story and The Walrus and The Carpenter are two examples. But, behind this book, there are also elements from Carroll's personal life. It has recently become known about this man that he did indeed dabble with opium from time to time, and that he did fancy the company of young girls, which all conveniently fit into this masterpiece of his. I'm not attacking Lewis Carroll's credibility as an author, I'm merely pointing out how an author's personal life can have a strong influence on his/her work. These factors have not hindered Carroll's work, but in a striking way have perhaps helped to make his work that much more realistic. He incorporated elements of which he was very familiar, and it made this book all the better. On a different subject, the illustrations by Tenniel are simply astounding! His use of light and shadow seem to make these characters come to life! I strongly recommend getting this version of Carroll's classic story."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass hold a special place in my heart.

She cried then, but for the first time since his death, she cried tears of joy. It was a special moment in my life, and I have Carroll to thank for that.It's a story that should be read to or by everyone at some point. With the film adaptations that are coming out recently, it's sad to think that most people who see them have only seen other film or cartoon adaptations. Always go back to the source.

Being that as it is, I will attempt to do this work justice. Lewis Carroll wrote this book for young adults, though it is familiar to young children because of the Disney movie. In actuality, the book may be too scary or difficult to understand for small children.This particular edition contains Alice's \\"Adventures in Wonderland\\" and its sequel \\"Through the Looking Glass\\". These stranges worlds reveal a somewhat spoiled young girl in her explorations of a strange world. Yet Alice might not appear so strange if the characters of these worlds were not so strange. Wonderland being the better of the two stories shows slightly more direction. But like any dream, the story often digresses into the bizarre. As Alice meets each new character, many having no apparent relation to the previous, readers can be frustrated by the lack of cohesiveness. Nothing really ties either story together aside from the return to reality in both stories.Carroll referred to this as a \\"book of nonsense\\". By his own admission, he seems to imply that there is nothing profound about this book. It is merely the musings of a sleeping child.

Once there she comes across a myriad of different characters, all of them anthropomorphic creatures.The tale plays with logic and for this reason has been considered an adult book just as much as a child's book. It's considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre (literature that uses sensical and nonsensical elements to defy language conventions or logical reasoning). Pink Floyd (one of my favourite bands) also famously uses literary nonsense in their song lyrics. The effect of nonsense is often caused by an excess of meaning, rather than a lack of it. Words are left for interpretation and there are usually little messages and meanings hidden and buried within cryptic sentences and paragraphs.For these reasons, the novel has been enormously influential in the creation of the fantasy genre which is known for its use of literary nonsense in the narrative course and structure of those books.The novel is broken up into 12 chapters and each focuses on a different adventure that Alice stumbles upon. Among them is the actual falling down into the rabbit hole and coming across various objects such as a bottle with the words \`drink me' written on it.Alice goes through many body transformations - she shrinks, she grows tall, and she shrinks again. She meets a white rabbit (the one she was chasing to end up in the hole), a lizard, a caterpillar and a frog (all with reminiscent human traits). She also meets a grinning Cheshire Cat before becoming a guest at a mad tea party where she becomes insulted by the Hatter who keeps throwing rhymes and riddles at her that she can't interpret or understand. This causes her to leave in a huff exclaiming that it's the stupidest tea party she had ever been to.After leaving the tea party she comes across a garden where she finds three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because the Queen of Hearts hates white roses. Alice meets the King and Queen (with the Queen screeching \\"Off with your head!\\") to Alice's amusement and is ordered to play a game of croquet with them. The game quickly descends into chaos and Alice meets the Cheshire Cat once again. The Queen wants the cat beheaded but because his whole body basically is his head, this proves impossible.The cat's owner is a duchess and at Alice's request she is brought to the garden party. After this, Alice attends a trial whereby the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals and throughout the proceedings Alice starts to grow larger. The Queen orders that she must leave and Alice starts to dispute with her causing a commotion which has all the cards tumbling in and around her face.The novel ends with Alice's sister waking her up on the riverbank for tea and brushing leaves from her face (instead of cards). Alice jumps up and wanders off leaving her sister sitting there to imagine all the things that had happened.The novel is famous for its many character allusions. Alice is based on a real girl called Alice Liddell whom Lewis met during a summer when he was rowing in a boat with his friend and his three young daughters. He told them a story that featured a girl called Alice who goes looking for an adventure. The members of the boating party show up in Chapter 3 where the Dormouse tells a story about three little sisters named Elsie, Lacie and Tillie. These are meant to be the Liddell sisters and it's interesting to note that Lacie is actually an anagram of Alice...The relationship between Alice Liddell and Lewis Carroll has caused much sinister controversy over the years. Many biographers have thought that perhaps Lewis was romantically or sexually attracted to the young girl. There has never been any direct proof though and many have also just put it down to a mere fondness for the child. So fond were Carroll's affections for the girl that he even gave Alice the original handwritten manuscript of the story with the inscription \\"A Christmas gift to a dear child in memory of a summer's day\\".Some say he may have even bordered on obsession with her, particularly with his excessive references to her in his later story Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There where there were several direct links between the two girls. There is also an acrostic poem at the end of the novel which spells out Liddell's full name when reading downwards. Although a little strange, it is hard to judge what Carroll's thinking was at the time and without reading between the lines, it truly is a beautiful poem. I'll record it in a separate post after I complete this one.As well as a paradox take on words, Carroll was also a genius with numbers and many mathematical references and concepts were portrayed within the story. In various chapters Alice uses multiplication and subtraction to try to analyse her situations and make sense of her surroundings. It is suggested that in logic and mathematics there is an inverse relationship, and this is something for which Carroll had an in depth knowledge of.Reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland for what it is makes for great reading. But it's only when you start delving deeper and recognising the hidden clues and mysteries that the story contains that the meaning of the novel will take on a whole new form and lead you to explore the story's deeper context.Read more of my book reviews at Storybook Love Affair - [...]"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I am extremely disappointed in online version of this book.

I'm going to order a different one right now."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"In my english class we had to pick a foreign author and a book to read. I choose this book because I'd never read it before, I've seen the Disney version of this story but never got around to reading the actual book. I've since finished the book and found that I really enjoyed reading it. I find that the book makes way more sense than the movie, considering that alice's adventures and wonderland itself don't walk in a straight line, but that's what imagination is all about, there is no set direction. I believe Carroll described the childs imagination perfectly.Although I will admit I was alittle lost and confused sometimes. I also enjoyed the poems throughout the story and when characters speak in riddles and ryhmes. The Cheshire Cat and Mad Hatter would have to be my favorite characters in this whole story (besides Alice herself). Its a great book and I'd be happy to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I love the Alice books, but this was the first time I read all of them. I paid full price at a retail store and I felt it was a fair price because it is the whole collection. The book is a great cloth bound hardcover. Honestly, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the pink flamingo's paint faded off when I touched it and that bothered me because I like to keep my books in pristine condition. Especially if I have only read them once. However, it was a great buy."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This was an amazing book! The author's colorful ideas and characters give the reader a sense of wonder as he takes the reader through the many wild adventures of Alice. Lewis Carrol writes in great detail as he describes how Alice jumped down the rabbit hole, struggled with her ever changing size, took care of a baby that turned into a pig, had tea with a mad hatter, and played croquet with a queen. It was easy to relate to Alice and her curiosity and imagination. She longed for an adventure, and that longing is inside of all of us somewhere. It's nice to read a story about someone who actually dares to take the steps into potential danger that we all turn away from daily for fear of the unknown. I am a victim of this fear, but this book made me want to take hold of that childish curiosity and jump into some crazy adventure. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is one of the most beloved children's classics. It has been adapted into numerous cartoons, films and plays over the years, and it has become an important backdrop of the World culture. It is a brilliant and zany fairy tale that remains fresh and engaging well over a century after it had been written. This is in large part thanks to the unforgettable and unique characters that are as famous (if not more) as Alice herself: the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the \\"Mad\\" Hatter, the Queen of Hearts and many more. They are among the most idiosyncratic characters in all of literature. However, the aspects of the book that I found the most fascinating were the clever use of language, the numerous puns, and the plays on the difference between the literal and actual meanings of different expressions and saying. It was very amusing to read these, and realize how clever and verbal this book actually is. The book made me reflect again on so many aspects of the world that I take for granted, and it made me feel like a child exploring and learning about various objects, ideas and relations for the first time. This alone makes this book worth reading and rereading, and I expect to come to it many times again."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Obviously Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are 2 literary classics, so I'm not reviewing those...But this particular book has put EVERYTHING having to do with Alice and her adventures under 1 cover. Not only do you get both the beloved stories, you also get the ORIGINAL \\"Alice's Adventures Underground\\" which Alice in Wonderland was based on. It is also notated throughout the book, with the explanations of each notation categorized in the back by Book:Chapter:Notation #.The thing that, for me, makes this particular pressing stand out, is not just that everything is all neatly bound together, but I absolutely ADORE the stylish new COVER! In fact, I love ALL the new Penguin Classics series of re-bound classic novels."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The Modern Library edition is a nice choice for the adult reader, featuring all the wonderful original illustrations (by British political cartoonist John Tenniel), a thoughtful forward by A.S. Byatt, and just enough notes and commentary to provide some additional historical and cultural context.Lewis Carroll was an imaginitive genius and has created some of the most unforgettable and timeless characters with this work - the Mad Hatter, Tweedledee & Tweedledum, the hookah-smoking Caterpiller, the perpetually late White Rabbit - and the absurd situations Alice finds herself in are poignant and amusing at the same time.However, one thing I did not realize coming back to these stories for the first time as an adult was just how largely character and situation-driven these stories are. Carroll moves rather disjointedly from one nonsensical scenario to the next, paying very little attention to a cohesive narrative thread. Indeed the world of Alice is best experienced as a whole, when the menagerie of characters can come to life, but these stories could just as easily be read out of order or taken out piece by piece. The creative work doesn't suffer a bit because of this, but readers should not come to these books expecting a novelistic experience.These are creatures to love, lines to savor, and the most curious things to consider."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I couldn't put it down, man. I checked this book out at the local library and read through the opening 130 pages in one sitting until I was falling asleep at three in the morning. Lewis Carroll's classic tale of adventure and fantasy \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is one of the best books I've ever read.The story is about a little girl, Alice, who falls into a very deep rabbit hole, seemingly straight to the middle of the earth! Her adventures once she lands are as wonderfully imagined as any in the history of literature. Her encounters with the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the King and Queen of Hearts, the Duchess, The Mock Turtle, The Gryphon, and The Wise Old Caterpillar are as fun and as pure and as well intended as any characters I've ever read a writer write.The story behind how Alice in Wonderland came to be is equally interesting, and one worth reading up on. That Carroll wrote it without any pretension to selling it, or for money, or even to publish it, is truly one of the remarkable stories of world literature. His motives were pure, and (at least to me) this is one of the reasons why this book is so dear and so readable.I highly recommend \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" to readers young and old and can only say that I look forward to reading \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" next! A marvelous, wonderful book, as fun as any book I've ever read.Yours,Stacey"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"My mom first read this book to me when I was seven years old. Because I was only in first or second grade, Alice in Wonderland scared the heck out of me. I remember parts were pretty horrific and confusing. I kind of hated it. It was like Stephen King for a first grader- which, if you ever go to a website on Lewis Carroll, shouldn't surprise anyone because Carroll had loads of problems and was pretty much tripped out while writing this (I think).Now that I'm older, I decided to re-read Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. While reading it, it's hard to decide whether this is just a load of imaginative creativity, or a metaphor of something deeper that is true in society today, or true in the 1800's. Well, I guess you can read it either way- but there is definitely some deep stuff in here. Many poems will stop and make you think, and as the story progresses you can't help but feel like you are Alice (which is pretty amazing, because this isn't like Lord of the Rings or anything, it's basically a fairy tale on drugs).Definitely, definitely, definitely do not hesitate to pick this book up and read. Another review said it was disturbing- well, in some ways it really is. But the characters and the plot line (or lack of!) keep you interested and keeps you reading. AIW and TTLG are must-haves in anyone interested in fantasy/sci-fi, along with Chronicles of Narnia and other great classics."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is a review of the physical book published by Tribeca Books, not the stories about Alice written by Lewis Carroll.

My review is about this specific Hallmark Edition book.It's difficult to find a nice hardcover version of both stories complete with the original illustrations. the illustrations are either poor quality, or are reduced in number. This book doesn't use them at all, so if that's important to you, look elsewhere. Instead it includes beautiful photographs of the scenes from the NBC TV movie. In my opinion this is better than the original, but it lacks the historical signifigance.In my opinion, get this book. It has the stories you want and the photos are very pleasing to look at. This book is bound nicely and will make a great addition to any library or collection."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are probably some of the most famous children's books in the English anguage. There are two ends to the spectrum of interpreting them.On the one end, the books are seen as wonderful and innocent entertainment mainly for kids but also suitable for adults. It is innovative and chaotic and performs puns and wordplay on the English language as well as concepts. They are accompanied by great quality illustrations and have a sense of fun and adventure about them.On the other end, the books are seen as elaborate allegories. Everything is symbolic. The tales are reminiscent of an LSD induced fantasy. Everything is Freudian and academic and open to postmodern interpretation and of course there's the disturbing question of Carrol's supposed obsession with little girls.Having read - and loved - the books, I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Yes, they seem to be oriented primarily for children but that doesn't mean adults can't get anything more than nostalgia out of them. Yes they are rich in some symbolism but it is unwise to overanalyse and read too much extraneous ideas into them.Highly recommended to be read as what they are - the product of an amazing mind, which saw the world of children as the ground in which to sow ideas both fun and profound. All the semi-philosophical talks, nonsense poems, fantastical creatures combine to make an unforgettable work."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I am a teenager, but I live in France and am not completely fluent in English yet.

Carroll puts them all to shame. Both books are filled with puns, absurd comedy, and rhymes and riddles. The first book is more constantly interesting than the second, which slows down at parts (such as during Alice's long conversation with the White Knight).In Alice in Wonderland, I loved the exposition of logical relationships during the tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. Her exchange with the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle is also fun. Although I didn't enjoy Through the Looking Glass quite as much, Alice's interaction with Tweedledum and Tweedledee and then later with Humpty Dumpty are great. (Humpty Dumpty illuminates the poem \\"Jabberwocky\\" by providing his own definitions of all the nonsense words.)I listened to an unabridged audio version performed by Donada Peters (published by Books on Tape, Inc.): Peters was Excellent.

Though it is a shortened phrase from the original, I was intrigued at the message that this book gives to a grownup. There are some books that was clever satires of their times, which has been 'downgraded' to the level of children's books like &quot;Gulliver's Travel' or 'The Little Prince.&quot; Clearly, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; also has some of it. Although Lewis Carroll may not have thought of it, what he told the three girls on that fateful day is for also all past-children who are now grownups. Actually, it seems that it was an interpretation of the grown-ups world for the children through the eyes of this little girl, Alice, who also happens to be the person who insisted that this Oxford-Mathematician publish the story that he told her.

The characters are mostly animals with different personalities and can talk, so the characters were okay, but to me they could have been improved on. By this I mean they could have come to life more. Some animals were the white rabbit and the cat like in the disney movie. The overall theme of the book is for Alice(the main character)to get out of Wonderland. On her way home, she meets very strange characters and gets into trouble. One event I found interesting is when she meets the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. Their first encounter was interesting but it was when they met again that I thought was good. Another event is near the end with the Queen of Hearts.

If it's true that you can't go home again, it's even more true that some books will never let you back in. This is one of them.I'm not sure if the fantastic lives of fantasy and fiction that play out daily as hard news have diluted our ability to plunge unrestrained into a book like Alice in Wonderland, or if the book refuses to give up its virtues a second time for a plainer reason: despite its monolithic stature in the pantheon of classics, it was originally written, and still remains, a children's story. Pick it up and expect something more, and you may be disappointed.The prose still snaps and crackles like a bowl of fresh cereal, and the imaginary images still effortlessly dance across your mind's eye, but something's missing, whether in the book or the reader you'll have to judge for yourself.

I just LOVED the characters that Alice encounters on her adventures and I also loved the story's word-play and witticism.Out of the two stories, Through the Looking Glass, although less famous, is the more linear and I think entertaining but both are amazingly creative and bizarre stories and are both short enough so that they should be read together."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I really like Alice in Wonderland and its sequel because it is so whimsical. The way Dodgson made fun of Alice so much makes one laugh until tears come pouring down. He based the character Alice, on his friend; a real life Alice. Throughout the book, he constantly makes references to her, or something related to her. For example, when a character asks her the exact day Alice replies May 4th. May 4th is the real life Alice's birthday. Alice walks through Wonderland, and she sees many strange things, but thinks otherwise. If you like poems, you will certainly like Alice in Wonderland and its sequel, for both books contain numerous poems. However, in the book Carroll takes the original poems and creates a parody out of them. Something interesting to know is that all the poems relate to the chapters. These are all minor details, but something to muse over. On the surface, Alice in Wonderland is a book where she meets weird creatures and walks away from them always feeling humiliated, as she thinks she is smarter than she really is. That is most of Alice in Wonderland.Alice through the Looking Glass is similar to the prequel, yet glaringly different. The whole book revolves around a chess game, and so the character's actions correspond to moves on the chessboard. Alice joins in the game, starts out as a white pawn, and proceeds to move until she becomes a queen. At each square, she meets a new character, but in one chapter, characters from the previous book are in this one too. An important thing to know in this famous classic is that everything is backwards. It makes sense since Alice is on the other side of a mirror, yet she encounters difficulty sometimes in understanding this. But in the end, she manages to become a queen and to checkmate the red king. Both books are very enjoyable, and I strongly advocate both children and adults to read it. Enjoy!!

In &quot;Wonderland&quot;, Lewis Carroll questions everything about life that is normal, and gives us a picture of a world where everything that we accept as normal is turned upside down. With Alice, you'll fall into a rabbit hole and enter an imaginary and wacky world where nothing is at it seems. Here's a small taste:&quot;By-the-bye, what became of the baby?&quot; said the Cat. &quot;I'd nearly forgotten to ask.&quot; &quot;It turned into a pig,' Alice answered very quietly, just as if the Cat had come back in a natural way. &quot;I thought it would,&quot; said the Cat, and vanished again.&quot;they drew all manner of things - everything that begins with an M - &quot; &quot;Why with an M?&quot; said Alice. &quot;Why not?&quot; said the March Hare.If you find this kind of surreal world even remotely attractive, then you're sure to love Alice's &quot;Wonderland&quot;. You'll be amazed by the cat-less grin of the Cheshire-Cat, amused by the absurd logic of the mad Hatter, and in hysterics over the antics of the murderous Queen of Hearts with her constant refrain of &quot;Off with his head.&quot; &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is full to the brim with wild humour, farcical fantasy, witty wisecracks, and slapstick comedy. What I especially enjoyed were the abundance of delightful puns, paradoxes, and parodies. Much of the deeper significance will escape young children, but they will enjoy it as a fantastic story, and rediscover it with even greater pleasure as adults. A &quot;classic&quot; is a book that appeals to people of all times and ages, and that's certainly the case with &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot;Is &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; all nonsense? I don't think so. Behind the outer layer of nonsense Carroll conveys a great deal of sense. He allows you to return to reality with a renewed appreciation for everything that is normal and accepted. Yet this fantasy world is at the same time so nonsensical and enjoyable, that you'll want to return there many a time. Don't be satisfied with a movie edition or simplified version of Alice - nothing is as enjoyable as the original! Truly a classic for the child in all of us!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I would argue that this text offers more than WONDERLAND.

To begin with, I hated the illustrations. They were ugly and gave me the creeps. Although my language was English it was very different from the English that Carroll wrote. I didn't understand half the words. I didn't know what a hedgehog or a dormouse was. Nor was I familiar with mock turtle soup. But its major crime was that it was static. Nothing really happened. She just met a lot of unpleasant individuals and finally woke up. Fast forward sixty years and I have just read it for a class and found it quite enjoyable! First of all, I love the Tenniel illustrations. Yes, they are ugly, but that's what makes them unforgettable. Carroll is not Disney. His little animals are not cuddly and don't whistle happy tunes and are rarely, if ever, helpful. Tenniel makes that clear. Second, I had no idea as a child that it was funny. I did not get any of the jokes or understand any of the riddles. This time I laughed out loud several times. The poems that I could not abide as a child I now find fascinating and rather beautiful, especially the White Knight's verse. Alice STILL has no plot, however, which is why it's not very compelling reading. However, both these books are mercifully brief.Whether one actually likes these books or not, they are important to English literature and are referred to and referenced constantly in other works. So ALICE is essential reading if one wants to be considered an educated English speaker. It's open to many interpretations and many people find it a profound work. The Signet paperback contains all the Tenniel illustrations."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I bought this volume because several of the reviews mentioned that there were illustrations by John Tenniel.

I reread this with some trepidation as I remembered reading and enjoying it several times as a child, but was pleasantly surprised to find it just as magical as I did then.I won't bore anyone with the details of the story as I'm sure that most who are reading this review are familiar with it. Suffice it to say that Alice's journey into Wonderland is still rather wonderful.Alice still comes off as a bratty know-it-all, but I thought that when I was younger, so it did not change my feelings towards the book. The humor is well thought out, reading through it as an adult, I caught many more of the clever puns than I did before, so that made for some refreshing new discoveries.I would reccommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it or at least hasn't read it since their childhood. It is a quick, enjoyable read that takes ones mind into a magical land of wonder.Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found ThereThrough the Looking Glass continues Alice's adventures. This time, as Alice is playing with Dyna's new kittens, she takes to wondering what is beyond the room that she sees on the other side of the looking glass. Before she knows it, Alice has pushed her way through the looking glass and is in the backwards world on the other side!The faniciful creatures that Alice runs into here are as colorful, and in some cases even more so, as the characters from Wonderland. There's the talking flower garden, a run-in with the Tweedles, a host of chess pieces of varying ranks, a unicorn, a lion and many, many more. Along with the Tweedles, my personal favorite is a white knight who can barely stay mounted upon his steed.The magic and wonder from the first of Alice's adventures is still very present and, although the book sometimes gets confusing because things come and go so rapidly, I believe that I actually found it to be more enjoyable than the first. I highly reccommend it to children of ALL ages. If you feel like some simple fun and joy, settle back in a comfy chair with a nice cup of cocoa and let your mind journey Through the Looking Glass with Alice and discover all of the wonders that she finds there."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice in Wonderland is one of those books you can still enjoy as an adult even though it was written for children. The story is completely nonsensical and at times humorous. In fact I think some of the jokes can only be understood as an adult so it is worth reading again.I have a yellowed copy of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, which was given to me on my seventh birthday. It has the original artwork on the cover. My grandmother gave me a copy along with a harmonica. The harmonica was lost long ago, the book remains and has always had a place in my heart. I was too young to read the entire book, so my father started reading this book to me. Perhaps still having this book has given me a connection to the past.I laugh when I reminisce about my father singing \\"Beautiful Soup,\\" most beautifully I must add. He also recited \\"Jabberwocky\\" and I can still hear his voice as I read the tale of the Walrus:\\"The time has come,' the Walrus said,\\"To talk of many things:Of shoes - and ships - and sealing wax -of cabbages - and kings -and why the sea is boiling hotand whether pigs have wings.\\"Alice spends a great deal of time either shrinking or growing taller, depending on what she eats in Wonderland. There are talking chess pieces and flowers. Everything in the looking glass world is backwards so it is fun to think about how life would be on the other side of a mirror.The Mad Tea Party is also very memorable. There is all kinds of nonsense conversation children will love to try to figure out, and as adults still might be trying to figure out! They will love the riddles and beautiful illustrations. The mouse, the chess pieces and the Cheshire cat talk most intelligently about various concerns in Wonderland. Just as everything in a child's world is sometimes alive to them, so Alice's world is filled with things that are alive and most interesting to children.Alice never seems to run out of adventures. The Looking Glass House is amusing to me as it has a cute black kitten who is quite mischievous. I quote:\\"Oh, you wicked, wicked little thing!\\" cried Alice catching up the kitten and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. \\"Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! ...Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help if it might.John Tenniel's illustrations make the book and together he and Lewis Carroll created a magical world for children to explore.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Those who pick up ALICE IN WONDERLAND seeking to read a book mirroring the Disney movie version will be sorely disappointed.

As a kid, I was actually pretty terrified of the idea of falling through a rabbit hole, and getting lost all by myself, in a strange land. Add in the scary character of the Queen of Hearts, and I swore to myself, never to wander off around alone, as a strange rabbit might appear and force me to follow him! I had a pretty wild imagination when I was a child. It's bad, because this often is the cause of my nightmares.I decided to lay off the whole \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" scene, and promised never to read the book. I didn't break this promise for years! Until now. In fact, I have only read Lewis Carroll's until just about a month ago. I know, it's a bit disappointing in my part that I have never read this, but what can I say.. a promise is a promise, right?Review: First of all, I have to say, this is still one of those stories that have the most unforgettable characters ever made. Lewis Carroll created such whimsical characters such as the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, the Caterpillar, the Queen of Hearts, the talking flowers, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, and so many more. It's kind of amazing to say the least that all these unique characters all come from one story!The best part though, in my opinion, coming from an adult reader, is the symbolism of this story. Almost all the characters play a part of something in real life -- a metaphor, in a way. The wordplay as well, are witty and clever. Both are done in an extremely subtle way, that most would overlook them. That is probably one of the reasons why this is a classic, and has been around for so long. I feel as though children, as this book was intended for, would see this as a fun book with fun characters. Adults, on the other hand, while they will still appreciate it for the same reasons, would also love this as it will challenge them, and teach them subtle messages, while bringing them back to their childhood all at once.I highly recommend this novel to any reader, no matter how old or young they are. Do not miss it, as this is a timeless piece of literature that everyone should definitely read at least once."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The book I received was in great condition and arrived in a timely fashion.

Lewis Carroll creates a wonderful fantasy world for young children but the appeal was not there for me. The separate worlds of both stories are chaotic but they pave a way of mystery and suspense. The characters Carroll creates are great and each one is different from the next and you are never sure what or whom Alice will meet next. The downfall for me in these two stories was that neither one had a well thought out plot. For I could tell Alice was wondering to two different worlds not knowing where she was going or why she was there. Some people may find this type of writing great but I find it almost pointless. There is a good twist to the ending of Through the Looking Glass that leaves the reader somewhat puzzled. Although this book had little point to me, I could read it without getting bored, for something strange or absurd happened every other page.

Well if you haven't, &quot;Don't&quot;. Overall it wasn't that bad of a book, but it was extremely confusing. In my opinion this book could have been written a lot better. For example, it could have been alot less confusing and more realistic. The main reason I didn't exactly enjoy Alice in Wonderland was because it needed to be more happy,then unhappy. Here are some more reasons why you should not read this boring book. Alice in Wonderland could have been written a lot better. The author's language usage was a bit hard to comprehend,like when the caterpillar was talking to Alice about a crocodile and when the cat was giving Alice directions. Also, the scenes were short and they jumped right into each other too quickly. Most of the animals were rude and mean to Alice. The flowers shooed her away, the queen tried to cut off her head and the cat was always making her angry by lying. Another part that didn't make any sense was the tea party,there's no such thing aa a &quot;Very Merry Unbirthday&quot;. Also the Mad Hatter and the Hare wouldn't listen to Alice when she was trying to tell her story. All the creatures and animals kept Alice from what she was trying to do which was to follow the white rabbit. Alice met many,many creatures such as Tweedle Dee,Tweedle Dum,Do Do,Bill, Rabbit,Cat,Queen of Hearts,Caterpillar,Playing cards,Mad Hatter,Hare,Flowers,Pig and the Door Knob. This book made me just as frustrated and upset as it made Alice.I felt like I was in the book and I could feel all the confusion and nonsense going on. If I had to give my overall opinion of how good the book was I would give it 2 stars.So, in conclusion I would like to let everyone know that Alice in Wonderland was not worth reading, so don't waste your time! Go get yourself an interesting book to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was an extremely ridiculous and confusing book. The characters were mis leading and Alice was very annoying (from the little details I read throughout the book). This book would be a good for fantasy lovers, but to me it was unrealistic and childish. Some of the things the characters said and did in the story were confusing and somewhat complicated. I don't know if I would recommend this book to younger children because of its wording, but it was a child-like book and would attract young readers in a way. The writer writes in a unusual, seemingly &quot;old fashioned&quot; way. You could tell the book wasn't written recently by the language usage. Alice is a young girl who is very bright and adventurous. On her way down to Wonderland, she meets alot of new characters. Some are decieving like the treaser cat but all of the very intresting and USUAL, such as the Mad Hater, The Queen of Hearts, etc. The way the author worded things in the book, made me get confused and unintrested. I had no desire in reading it after the first few pages. I thought the book was far fetched, and seriously i wouldn't recommend this book to teens or children."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The first thing that must be said for anyone who's seen Disney's Alice in Wonderland and wants to read the book because they loved it so much is beware. The book and the movie, while following the same story line, are nothing alike, and if you expect them to be you'll most likely end up as disappointed as I was.Perhaps it's because I grew up with the fluidly poetic Dr Zeus, or perhaps I just expected something that the book simply was not, but I found Carroll's tale bland and void of the essential, natural art to story-telling that all \\"absurd\\" imaginative pieces need to be enjoyable.Though I must give credit to Carroll for what I feel he deserves- in his time, this was a wildly fantastic book with a plethora of crazy characters, riddles, poetry and inspired plot twists that carry the reader around Wonderland with the famous protagonist.The Characters however, were truly brought to life by Disney to a degree unrealizable within the written format. I don't fault Carroll for this, but when you've seen the movie first...I also found the transitions between scenery and scenes to be lacking in impact because there is little distinction made between one place and the next. I realize that Carroll was describing a dream (which is vague by nature), but I feel that his writing could have accentuated the transitions to give the reader more involvement in the fading between one land and the next- what we have instead is something close to \\"Alice was walking in a forest and now she's crossing a river.\\" Call me picky, but such a lackluster transition is bound to bore.Most agitating were Penguin Classic's annotations that literally littered the text with information completely irrelevant to the story. Boasting on the back that my copy is \\"the most comprehensively annotated edition available\\", they weren't lying. To get this title though, they stuck an annotation into every nook and cranny manageable. By the end of the fifth chapter I almost threw the book out of the bus window because I had read more about Lewis Carroll's diary entries and queer habit of wearing gloves everywhere than of Alice herself. At that point I more or less stopped regarding the annotations at all- content instead to deny their existence rather than try my patience at reading them. I was upset at this because there were several places where an explanation, allusion or elaboration was truly helpful, but they were one in stack of fifty and the remaining forty-nine were just too painfully superfluous to sift throughThrough The Looking Glass also failed to leave an impression on me. It was a very simple extension of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but in the same exact format, with the same trite transitions and utterly lackluster performances.I thought it was a painful struggle to finish Through The Looking Glass, and then found myself face to face with Carroll's original short story Alice's Adventures Underground- the original short story that he had written for the young daughter of a close friend which his friends had urged him to elaborate upon. Following that, I found an essay written by Carroll, Alice On Stage, about his thoughts on the cinematic production of his tale. I'm sorry; I just couldn't bring myself to bother. That was enough of Lewis Carroll for me.As I implied at the start, stick to Disney's movie. I love to read, but Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a story meant to be seen and heard, not read about."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I truly feel sorry for any child forced to read this book in school. Reading it as an adult was no better. It was possibly the most warped and perverse story I have ever read in my life. Most passages were pure nonsense while others lead the reader to wonder if Lewis Carroll had possibly tasted some of the mushrooms Alice came upon in her adventure. There are many other \\"classics\\" out there more enjoyable and logical than this one."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is my fifth tarot deck and I have to say that I just love it. It's quite clever to design a deck based on the classic &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot; Would have rated this deck higher except that it does NOT comes with an instruction book, but rather a quick-and-to-the-point pamphlet that truly simplifies the meanings of the cards. If, however, you are versed in the traditional Ryder-Waite deck then you should have no trouble skipping the pamphlet and using your own intuition. The suits have been reconfigured into flamingoes, oysters, hats, and peppermills, which can be quite confusing. Due to the whimsical nature of the card, you might want to use it for more whimsical readings. But, like I said, if you ARE a fan of tarot decks with unusual design you should DEFINITELY get this deck and use it for those &quot;special&quot; occasions."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I first read Alice's Adventures when I was about nine or ten years old, and you know what? I didn't really like it. It didn't make any sense, I told my mother. It's not serious enough for me.But years later, at age twenty, I acted on a whim and read it a second time. And I was captivated. No other book matches Alice in humor, oddness, or bizarre characters. All the imitators (and there have been many) have failed because they couldn't manage to hold together their story's oddness with such a strong, flowing narrative or protaganist as lovable as Alice. Lewis Carroll's plot drifts effortlessly from one bizarre situation to another with sublime grace. His genius was that he went into the bizarre without going too far; his creativity never turned cheap.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is an adult's children book. I doubt that children will, or even can, enjoy it to the extent that adults will. When I read it at age nine I wanted it to have some kind of meaning, some raison d'etre--how ironic that now I'm an adult and its dreamlike feel is just the kind of break from reality I could use. Of course children can love these stories too, and I don't want to give anyone the idea that Alice and Looking Glass are stories only for adults. Your kids probably don't read anything other than the Harry Potter books, over and over, so why not give them something else?Some other things about Alice in Wonderland make it such a classic. It was unique in its time (and still so) for its complete lack of moralizing. It doesn't tell you how good boys and girls should act, or turn into a good-vs-evil tale. Its protaganist, Alice, has to be one of the greatest characters, female or otherwise, in all literature. Her cleverness and logic are Wonderful.So buy the book. The edition to get is one with the original illustrations."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"'The Annotated Alice' with annotations done by Math and Games writer, Martin Gardiner may be the first, and is certainly the best known annotated edition of a popular classic, followed by annotations of other major popular classics such as the complete Sherlock Holmes and 'The Hobbit'.It is especially interesting to compare the Alice stories with Tolkien's novels, as both series of works are enhanced by their authors' love and professional involvement with language studies. The difference is that while Tolkien was a philologist, Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) was a logician, so their slant on words and wordplay are a lot different. Tolkien is the poet of names and Carroll is the weaver of paradoxes and nonsense. Both, however, benefit from exegesis for those of us who are neither philologists nor logicians.Carroll's works also need heavy annotation for his references to people and events of his day as they are masked by metaphorical references in the Alice books.Reading these stories with Gardiner's annotations is virtually the only way to fully appreciate these works. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"If you long to be carried away to a world of nonsense and magic, talking beasts and flowers then Alice is the best tour guide you can employ. This is a book that will find a place close to the heart of a reader of any age that has a place inside reserved for whimsy and childlike wonder. As Alice travels through Wonderland and meets many unexpected characters your imagination will soar. Run a race with a dodo bird. Have tea with the doremouse and his friends the mad hatter and the march hare. Thrill at the &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;. Alice proves to be a very level headed young lady indeed as she encounters things that become &quot;curiouser and curiouser!&quot; The story meanders through forests and chessboards that are life size never ceasing to amaze the reader with charm and wit. Lewis Carroll completed a masterpiece of fantasy and social comentary in this classic tale. The book is truly a gift to any one who hopes to hold onto childhoods magic."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I should have looked at the size of this book in making the selection. Although this book is beautiful, lovely dust jacket, interesting illustrations, it is almost too big to casually read and is more of a coffee table book. It was bought as a companion to a collectable given as a Christmas present. The entire gift was precious though and the book really made it special."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I have grown up watching Disney's Alice in Wonderland, and knowing what liberties Disney is known to take in their movies, I wanted to read the original story for myself.And I'm glad I did. Lewis Carol was such a wonderful storyteller, full of imagination and creative use of the English language.This was two stories in one. The first, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, I thought had more imagination and he action seemed to flow faster with more scenes and challenges for Alice to deal with. The characters are fantastic and highly imaginative.The second story, Through the Looking Glass, also had a lot of imagination, but it didn't seem to have as fast a pace as the first book. Still, I found it fascinating as the story was done as if Alice were a chess piece moving across a chess board to reach the other side as a pawn to become a queen. As she moved up the chess board, she encountered different characters and situations.Highly recommended, even if it was written as a child's book."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"When I was assigned Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass to read for my Victorian Literature class, I was excited. Even though I had heard Alice's Adventures in Wonderland referred to countless times throughout my youth, I had never read the story or seen the movie. I had never heard of Through the Looking Glass, but while reading, I realized that many people who think they are talking about AAIW are actually referring to TTLG. The two texts seem to be conflated in a way that makes them indistinguishable from each other. It is for this reason that I enjoyed reading this edition of the texts. There is only a page separating the two stories, which allows the reader to easily make the transition between them. This small separation also allows the reader to recognize the undeniable connection between the texts and to understand why many people combine them in their minds.AAIW is about a young girl named Alice whose boring day with her sister is interrupted when a white rabbit runs by her saying, \\"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!\\" Alice's curiosity is aroused, but surprisingly not to a great degree. This is the first hint to the reader that Alice is not an average child, as she seems to believe that a talking rabbit is quite normal. She does become intrigued, though, when the rabbit produces a clock from his pocket, so she follows it down its hole and enters a world of wonder. I loved the story from this point on. It is filled with such unbelievable creatures and situations, but Carroll's writing style made me want to believe in a world that could be filled with so much magic and splendor. There was never a dull moment in the story, and each page was filled with more excitement. I will offer a warning, though. This story is not for those who like a neatly packaged plotline. It is written in a somewhat discontinuous nature and seems to follow some sort of dream logic where there are no rules. However, I enjoyed the nonsensical pattern. Without it, a dimension of the story would be lost. It offers some insight into the mind of a young, adventurous, fearless girl, and Carroll seems to be challenging his readers to be more like Alice.The second text in this book, TTLG, is again a story about Alice. In this adventure, Alice travels through a wondrous world on the other side of her looking glass. As in AAIW, Alice again encounters absurd creatures, such as live chess pieces and talking flowers. The land she travels through is an oversized chessboard, which gives this story a more structured plot than AAIW. The chess theme provides Alice with sense of what she must accomplish in the looking- glass world, and it provides the reader with a sense of direction throughout the story. Alice's goal is to become a chess queen, so the reader knows that when she becomes queen, the story will be over. However, just because the story has some structure does not mean that it is not just as wild and marvelous as its predecessor. I enjoyed all of the characters. They seem to have an endless supply of advice that people in the 21st century can still learn from. My favorite example is when the Red Queen says, \\"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\\" Maybe what Carroll is suggesting is that if we read more nonsensical, unbelievable stories like his, we won't be so afraid to be adventurous and fearless like Alice; so that the next time a white rabbit runs by us, we might just see where it leads us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Long time ago, I should have read this story as a child, but I don't remember how come I didn't, but I don't remember either how I came to know Alice so intimately, as if this was a legend that had leaked out to me and never to be forgotten. No doubt, this is one hell of a legend.The title itself belies it to be just a fantastical childhood tale but it is actually a book that will get adults curiouser and curiouser until all the puns that are intended to taunt the deluded adult world will boil down to giving you a crazy smile. I swear by a mouse's tail- these two Alice books are charming, and so full of funny, far-out characters. I cant resist being crazy with the mad tea-party, and the wacky game-story of cards and chess, of the chesire cat that is actually more charming than eerie, and of course, Alice who is smart, proud and always snappy. Although my favorite of all is the wise caterpillar who smokes a hookah and sits on a mushroom.And I love the drawing given by John Tenniel, and some text's visual presentation are supercool.Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass&quot; is actually a story of growing up, or more like a child's discovery of wisdom, or maybe an exploration of wisdom in a child's perspective. The setting of cards and chess is an allegory of the world of chance and determinism, and the pervasive foreshadowing of death seems silly but anyway childish. Sometimes I don't understand why the book is one of the most quoted. Perhaps because aside from being popular, I am sure this tale really brings out the child in anyone.Lewis Carroll might have only told this story to put a loquacious girl in silence but fortunately, he has not made a very simple fantasy. He has invented an Alice in a lot of us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"It's a fantastic book, of course, and it certainly doesn't need me to praise it as millions have done before. It's probably one of the most unique things ever written: the only book that could be considered both completely a children's story and completely a book for adults. The only problem with the Penguin edition is that it's grossly over-annotated. For scholars this may be very helpful, but sadly enough a lot of the notes are either irrelevant to non-professors or provide critical instead of historical or biographical commentary which, in my opinion, ruins the greatest delight of the book: AAIW/TLG are highly interpretable and symbolic stories, but unfortunately the commentator is always interrupting like a nagging pedant before the reader has a chance to reflect. Once again, both stories well deserve their status as true English classics but another edition might be a better choice."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"How is a raven like a writing desk? Because it can produce a few notes, though they are very flat; and it is never put with the wrong end in front. That is an example of the witty offbeat humor in \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\".Alice is sitting bored when her attention is captured by a talking white rabbit. She follows it down a rabbit hole into a world full of strange creatures, curious happenings, and mysterious pastries. At first she marvels at all the oddities, but soon she wants to get home, only to discover that she doesn't know how.By far my favorite parts of this book are when Alice encounters the Cheshire Cat. He is very witty, and adds something special to the story. Also his grin is phenomonal.I think the theme of this book is really about using your imagination and letting your creative side get the best of you once in a while, not letting other things like television and the media do the imagining for you. That's also why the movie is totally hypocritical.The whole point of the book is using your imagination, and the \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" movie did the opposite of that. Despite it being created by the godfather of the animated film industry (Disney) it really sucked. They took out too much of the story just to squeeze it into 1 and a half hours and a G-rating. \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\" wasn't made for the big screen, considering its length and semi-annoying characters that if animated and given the life of Disney turn them into monsters that are enough to make even the most devout Catholic contemplate suicide. And the songs! Don't even get me started on those. Disney has to pump every movie it pushes out full of annoying constant 5-minute \\"songs\\" that give you ear worms for a month! They ruin everything they get their greasy little fingers on. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland used to be original and interesting and Disney went ahead, squeezed out all the creativity, shoved some songs into it, stamped their trademark on it, and shipped it out. They are sick, sick little people.Most of this book is quite entertaining, though there are a few parts that just seem stuck in there and were quite dull. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is a very original and interesting story, and if you've never read the book, do so. It is entirely worth it. If you haven't seen the movie, stay far, far away. For those of you who have, good luck with the nightmares. And those monstrous ear worms.-carli"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Find some children anywhere you can and read this book to them! I say this for your pleasure at least as much as theirs. Reading it out loud will be one of the delightful experiences of your life. Did I say \\"reading?\\" I should have said \\"performing,\\" because you will not be able to resist acting it out. Let yourself go--you will be a child again, yet still appreciate the book's adult insights.There is so much to say about this classic. It captures the psychology of a girl on the verge of growing up; it is full of jokes that appear absurd, but are fiendishly clever; it somehow avoids anything old-fashioned or politically incorrect; and absolutely all the characters are loveable, no matter how hard they try not to be.Carroll was an unhappy, aging man, yet he understood children to a spooky degree. While I smiled mildly at some of the humor, my children rolled around on the floor laughing.Here is an interesting phenomenon: When I read it as a child, I didn't particularly warm to it. When my children tried to read it on their own, they gave up. But the group experience of reading it out loud was a joy for all.Do I need to describe the plot? Could I if I tried? Alice may or may not be dreaming when she follows a rabbit down into his hole and enters a world where the simplest actions are strange and complicated. In her effort to explore this world and ultimately return home, nothing fits right, nothing seems to follow through properly, and no one she meets is sane. Alice, though a little girl, is given plenty of opportunities to be the rational, mature, assertive person of action.Everyone I discuss this book with, and I mean everyone, shudders and raises the issue of Carroll's alleged improprieties. They are invisible in the book, but to put your mind at ease, you may want to check out the judicious biography by Morton N. Cohen.The particular edition of Alice in Wonderland that I am reviewing, published by Grosset, is especially pleasant for reading out loud, with comfortable print, and Tenniel's essential illustrations."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"When I was younger, I watched the Disney version of this book and was left absolutely horrified by what I had seen. I was about four years old and the constant visions of strange and horrid looking creatures flashing on the screen made me want to leave the room. Because of this, I was not so sure how much I wanted to read this story. Actually, even now, I'm not all together convinced that I really like this story. I feel that it is somewhat sacrilegious to say so but I just don't enjoy this story all that much. As read through the first few pages I could still see the strange and haunting images from the twisted children's movie. Maybe that's what has ruined this tale for me, but I do sincerely feel that it is more than that. When I am reading, I begin to feel hopeless, lost and somewhat confused. I don't really feel happy about saying this since I'm a high school boy, but I feel that you should know how strange the concepts are in this book. Honestly, I must say that reading this book made me feel as though I were on a drug trip. This book has the strangest and most disturbing elements such as drinks that reduce your size and cakes that re-enlarge you. Not to mention that creepy, talking cat in the tree, the Cheshire Cat.From a thematic point of view, I suppose you could say that one theme from this story is the frustrations that come with the loss of one's childhood. What I mean by this is that when a person gets older, they encounter physical changes that radically change they way that a child views the world and may even frustrate them. Across the entirety of Alice's adventures, she runs into a series of absolutely ridiculous changes. While these changes are much more absurd than real changes we incur growing up, they cause Alice to become traumatized, frustrated, and even change her perspective of the world. Although she is forced to go through these changes, she continues to struggle to maintain a comfortable physical size. In chapter one, she tries to follow a rabbit into a garden and is unable to fit through the entrance because she is too large. She takes a drink that shrinks her to the appropriate size but then realizes that she left the key to the entrance on the above table. She then eats a cake that grows her to the size at which she can retrieve the key but is then once again too large to enter the garden, which is very frustrating to her. Again in chapter five, she looses control over her physical build and gets an irregularly long neck.As for the characters in this book, I find all of them one hundred percent unbelievable and terrifying. The characters are all introduced abruptly and are completely beyond reason. For example, the Mad Hatter and his fellow creatures are constantly making insane remarks about class and the state of things. There is also a strange creature named the Cheshire Cat who is unaffected by all that goes on in Wonderland and merely observes all that goes on, somewhat like a stocker.This story is told through the perspective of a narrative view through Alice's eyes and conclusions of the new world she has entered. This view gives a good perspective of how crazy the world can be. I mean, Wonderland may seem like and absolutely mashed land of turmoil but through the eyes of Wonderland, Alice is absolutely mad. I suppose this could be compared with the difference in views in today's society and other countries.Again, I must say that I don't really like this book personally simply because it disturbs me so much, but I would still recommend it to others as they may not feel the same way. It really is a well written story, even if I don't like the general plot. I give this book a three out of five star rating."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is about the font size, NOT the content.

I didn't really like the end of 'Through the Looking Glass' since it was about the same as the end of 'Alice's Adventure's In Wonderland'.

It details a little girl's wild adventure through a make believe world. The writing was clever. And so were the characters and situations created by Carroll. Everyone is familiar with the principal idea of the book, but reading the book forces you to remember all the particulars. It it clear why children love this book, which it's fantastic situations.Being a software developer and a computer science major, it was also interesting to pick up on concepts such as reasoning and logic skattered within the book (Carroll was a mathematician). Of course these concepts are skewed in Wonderland.If you've never read this book before, put it on your \\"must read\\" list. It's a short book and a fast read.

My youngest child says she likes them because they are the only books that really give a feeling of how life is to children. Even though they are 150 years old they still seem relevant. (I think maybe that means that Lewis Carroll did not fancy little girls, instead he IDENTIFIED with them). I could keep reading these books through my childhood and teenage and adult years and always find something new. I learned the poetry off by heart and so did my partner (before we met each other) (Lewis Carroll also wrote many more poems and the funny ones are just as good as the ones in these books) The puzzles and contradictions in Alice are fun. And there is a magical feeling of &quot;anything could happen&quot;. To me that never got scary because Alice always coped fine. I too prefer Through the Looking Glss(like another reviewer did) not just for the poems but the whole idea of everything being back to front. These are tremendous books! If you like formal logic then L. Carroll's &quot;Symbolic Logic&quot; is crazy and amusing but also interesting and so are his Tangled Tales about maths.

Whether you're a young child or an experienced reader, you can't help but marvel at the charm that Lewis Carrol creates. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (The Alice books as they are often collectively referred to as) are two of the most enduring children's stories of all time. However, at the same time, they both are considered to be literary achievements in the adult crowd, due to the many societal critiques hidden withing the text.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland begins with the classic scene of young Alice falling down the rabbit hole. Soon she finds herself lost in an insane world. Drinking things make her grow into a giant or shrink to the size of a mouse. Best of all, are Alice's conversations with the many eclectic characters that inhabit Wonderland. Unfortunately, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland comes to an end within the one hundred page mark (it is a children's story, after all). Fortunately, this collection holds the book's sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass. In this Alice stumbles through a looking glass and finds herself in Wonderland again. This time around she becomes a pawn in a giant game of chess. The reader follows her adventures as he tries to become a queen by making it to the eighth square. This chessboard element proves a very intersting way of advancing the storyline.What truly gives this book its lasting charm is its characters. Whether its the Mad Hatter telling Alice about his friend Time, or the disappearing Cheshire Cat, every character is impossible to forget. Many such as the White Rabbit, remain popular icons today, well over a century later. Conversations held with these characters often prove laugh out loud funny, as Alice tries to make sense of and explain herself to these characters. From beginning to end, the reader will have a goofy grin plastered across his or her face.Behind all these fun adventures, Carroll manages to slip in a large amount of social commentary. Some characters represent types of people, such as the overzealous monarch, to display in an exaggerated sense the foolishness of such extremes. His many poems throughout the book often have larger meanings as well: The Walrus and the Carpenter are clearly a condemnation of modern religion. Even the wild effects of drinking and eating can be interpreted as a moral on temperence. As the Duchess in the Wonderland said \\"Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it.\\" Likewise, Alice is rife with various morals.So what makes this book a classic? Reading through other people's comments, its hard to find a single person that didn't give it five stars, much less didn't like it. However, it was hard to find a definite consensus on what made it so good. Some stated its entertainment value, other enjoyed the commentary. Perhaps what makes this book so brilliant is that it has whatever you're looking for. If you want escape and adventure, it has it. If you want to laugh, there's humor. If you want intellectual thought and prose thats there too. What will the reader take away from reading is whatever they are looking for. Definitely a book that deserves its recognition as a classic of English literature."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book was great for children and adults alike!

I could read it many more times because the author paints a vivid picture in your mind that places you in Wonderland along with all of the delightful characters including Alice. The description in the book starts out strong and ends up even stronger. The author's ability to describe both the characters and the setting is amazing.I could just imagine being at the tea party with Alice or pondering whether or not i should drink out of the little bottle labeled drink me. The book takes place with Alice being bored out of her mind which most kids can relate to. Then, her curiosity about a little white rabbit with a pocket watch gets her in trouble when she ends up in a whole other world of queens, kings, talking animals and insane people.All of the characters are interesting and humorous, but often make you frustrated along with Alice because of their crazy antics and utter annoyance. This book is a classic that everyone should read at one point in their life whether they are young or old. This is a story that will surely be remembered . It beats the Disney movie by far. (The movie leaves out alot of the best parts.)I suggest you pick up a copy. It is definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a classic that all young spirited people should read. It has adventure, love, fantasy, and a lot of fantastic nonsense. Every page is exciting and mysterious with a bewildering twist. Lewis Carrol exceeds on making a childerns story into a fantastic novel for all ages. He has great imagination that he uses in his puns, riddles, and characters to make nonsense into complete thoughts and morals. Alice is a creative little girl who seems to find adventure around every corner. Everybody in Wonderland is just as creative as Alice; they all seem to be intelligent and fully spirited. This novel is something no one wants to pass by. Personally, I suggest this book becomes a classic everyone should have to read. Many things in this book capture a moment, like this qoute,&quot;The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the Hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, &quot;I-I hardly know, sir, just at present - at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times sice then.&quot; Another quote that stood out and will help choose this as your next book to read is from the cat. &quot;In that directoin,&quot; The Cat said, waving its paw around, &quot;lives a Hatter: and THAT direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives teh March Hare. Visit either you like: They're both mad.&quot; &quot;But I dont want to go amoung mad people,&quot; Alice replied. &quot;oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat.&quot;we're all mad here.

This book is certainly not just for children and better than the bible."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll was a creative trip into the world of dreams. Lewis Carroll is most famous as an author, particularly for writing Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. He was also a mathematician, Angelical deacon, and photographer. Carroll originally created the story for Alice Liddell, a child he befriended while he was a deacon at a local church. She loved the tale and asked him to write the story down on paper. At first he hesitated. Two years later, Carroll agreed, and the classic story was born. Carroll's main goal for writing the book was to get children interested in reading.Lewis Carroll was actually a pen name for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. His work was mostly considered to be literary nonsense, and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a classic example. Many people, ranging in all ages, have enjoyed Carroll's fantasy and word play writings. Carroll's way of writing has influenced many authors all over the world.Although Carroll's writings are very creative and imaginative, Carroll wrote a book with too many hidden meanings in it. For instance, the references to drug use are too prevalent. The first run-in Alice has with drugs is with the caterpillar. She stumbles across him sitting on a mushroom. He is smoking hookah and blowing rings of smoke toward Alice. Shortly after Alice leaves the caterpillar, she meets the Mad Hatter. He was a hatter, which means that he would inhale some of the mercury fumes that were used to cure felt in some of his hats. Mercury poisoning results in brain damage and confused speech. The last drug reference occurs when Alice eats and drinks the substances that make her grow or shrink. Alice did not know what she was consuming. She ate and drank it anyway and she ended up growing or shrinking. Carroll intended that children read the book. He might have sent the wrong messages. Children might think that Alice has fun eating and drinking mysterious substances and they would too. Also, Carroll actually wrote a very complicated book that most young children probably could not understand. He used a lot of literary techniques like reversals, puns, and mirror writings. These could easily be overlooked and misunderstood by children.Lewis Carroll tried to write the book from Alice Liddell's point of view to make reading enjoyable for children. He wanted to prove that children could have thoughts that were as complicated as or more complicated than adults. If the reader will not try to dissect the meaning of each word and wants to feel like a child again, then this book would be a good choice."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"My nephew loved this book and had me read it to him.

There is madness here and method in the madness. There is a story, a heroine, and her meeting with zany characters and a zany world whose rules seem to change with each person she meets. There is wordplay, and there is logical laughter and conundrum. There is seemingly something for everyone.It is possible to be frightened to near death by the Queen of Hearts or to become broken and wise like Humpty Dumpty .\\" Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall/ Humpty Dumpty had a great fall/ All the kings' horses/ and all the Kings' men/ could not put Humpty Dumpty / together again.The weird wonderland Alice meets is filled with games and play. It is fantasy and fear, it is fun and fright. There is at one point no way out of it and yet there is miraculous transformation which takes you somewhere else completely.The logic of this world seems at time too sophisticated for children, and yet childlike . Paradox is contradiction with the pain taken out.There are so many memorable lines and situations here, so much to mean in each sentence , that the work is a wholesale factory for epigraphs and epigrams.As one who never followed the story very well I nonetheless could see that in this work poetry and logic meet and mix each other up for the general benefit and pleasure of the reader.This is a book to be read line by favorite line, character by favorite character, incident by favorite incident with amusement and pleasure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Do you want to get away from the hassles of reality, the stresses of everyday life? Then Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is the book for you. After reading it, I found that it can be entertaining for a reader of any age. Children can enjoy an outrageous character in the story, such as the Cheshire Cat. Kids like the sly, disappearing cat with the everlasting smile because he's unusual. Adults can also enjoy the story by examining the meaning of the seemingly shallow plot, a girl lost in a dreamworld, a wonderland. I myself enjoyed the book because it gave me a break from reality. It made me feel like all that I needed was to enter into a wonderland of my own. Is this &quot;wonderland&quot; really safe for kids though? Some people question whether this story is appropriate for children because of the unusual characters, but what is the real meaning? Is the Mad Hatter, with his neverending tea party and his bumbling speech, a portrayal of the mentally unstable? Is the Catapillar sitting on top of a magical mushroom, blowing smoke through a hookah, an emblem for drugs? Children would not see these things in the story, or would they? I think children could enjoy the story for its simplicity, not for hidden meanings. How can the story be taken further though? Adults should be asking questions about the book. For example, when first read, the plot seems simple, a young girl falls asleep and in her dream she tumbles down a rabbit hole into a backwards world where she grows to her liking, watches cats disappear into thin air, and gets crazy advice from a catapillar on a magic mushroom. One second Alice is reading with her sister and the next second sne is floating down a rabbit hole. Adults can examine twists like this and wonder what it means for the entire storyline. Does it foreshadow events to come? Older people would be more likely to think about the storyline and can have more fun trying to find hidden meanings. So this story is very appropriate for adults. The reason why I enjoyed the story was the break from reality. Obviously the story of Alice and her adventures is fantasy, but when I read it, it makes me feel like I can take a break from the world. This is because the characters and plot are so unreal, that they make me feel unreal, too. So this story, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, can be simple for children, complex for adults, and is a break from life for me. Overall, it is a very satisfying story. Are you willing to go tumbling down the rabbit hole?"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Everyone has been rating this book as a children's book...

But that is not the case here. The Disney movie version is based on a combination of both books. I think this is important to mention, as it will hardly be like the movie version we all know.I love the movie (both the 1951 Disney classic and the new Tim Burton version) and figured I would love the book as well, but this book screwed with me. I have always had a vivid imagination, but never non-sensical imagination. That is exactly what Mr. Carroll had when he wrote this book. The book does, however, contain many of the beloved movie characters- the caterpillar, the white rabbit, Queen of Hearts, Mad Hatter, Dormouse, and of course, the Cheshire cat.Overall, the two stories amused me and kept me entertained, but I would not read them again.

I have always heard about all the underlying and hidden things within the story but I guess I am a surface reader. Either that or all of the underlying things were topical and with the book being written in the late 1800's most of those things would have been lost on me.The Good: It was an easy read the characters were quite unusual and Carroll definitely had an imagination.The Bad: besides my thinking it was going to be better than it was not much.

I realize that may be the author's intention, but it left me searching for meaning where there was none. Everyone is mad in wonderland, or they wouldn't be there. It's hard to call it an adventure, since nothing really happens. The characters are all mean, and at times unlikable. I get the pun, I can see the satire, but I just didn't find it funny. I have two daughter's who are 4 and 5, and I tried reading it to them as well to see if it might be a generational thing, but since most of the book is a play on words, they did not understand it, and they did not like it any better. I'm sorry. I'll admit Carroll has quite an imagination, and created quite a unique world, but he didn't do anything with it. I feel bad for having seen Disney's classic animation adaptation of this story first, and for hoping to gain some added insight by reading the actual book, but there is nothing more here to be gained.

Don't get me wrong, Because it did have some exciting parts in it though, like when Alice first entered the wonderland. Everything was like a fairy tale with talking rabbits and shrinking/growing juice. Alice would walk into a room, drink the juice, and if she was small, she'd grow into a giant, and if she was a giant, she'd shrink. It gets pretty confusing.

I admit this story has good points as well as bad; it would not have survived nearly so long if it did not. In my opinion, however, the good did not outweigh the bad.One of the strong points of this story is familiarity; the vast majority of us have had some experience with this book, usually as a child; we have heard the story, read a condensed version or seen a film or television portrayal. We have seen little girls dress up like Alice on Halloween; and who doesn't personally know The White Rabbit, The Cheshire Cat or the Queen of Hearts? Perhaps there's a degree of nostalgia that comes from revisiting these old childhood friends.In addition to being familiar, this story also has the charming quality of feeling as if it had been pulled directly out of a child's imagination. By that, I mean it doesn't follow the rules that have been set up by adults, either scientific or social. So, if you fall down a well shaft in Wonderland, not only are you likely to live, you may also be able to examine the trinkets placed on the shelves, perhaps even get in a few winks as you fall.In this book, nothing is what it seems (unless you are familiar enough with the story); a baby may mutate into a pig and run off snorting; a couple of card soldiers may spend an afternoon painting white roses red in order to avoid losing their heads, this is all perfectly normal in Wonderland. Perhaps it is even this strange quality that has made this story so popular. It wasn't enough for me however, to make up for what it lacks. This book didn't move along purposefully enough for me to enjoy it or care what happened next. It also had a strange dream-like quality and I don't mean surreal or day-dreamy. It was dream-like because it was a jumble of random scenes that didn't really interrelate. We often fill in the gaps when we retell our dreams so in that they make sense to us and frankly so that they are worth telling to someone else. This is the impression that I had of Alice in Wonderland; unstructured and random. The only real goal of the main character was to follow the white rabbit and even that failed as a motive fifty percent of the time. Alice is simply moved haphazardly through a sequence of strange encounters and then wakes up. Because of this, I didn't feel anticipation, I didn't hope for anything, and I didn't have any sense of closure when the story ended; which are the elements that I feel make a story worth reading."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This Kindle editionAlice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glassis a FAIR choice - 3 stars.

The sample has a Rackham illustration (and there may be more) as well as the many Tenniel, though, which is a plus.The free Gutenberg org versions - lacked the improved linking and formatting, but there are various illustrated editions; may be worth it to you if .99 is too much or you are looking for something other than Tenniel.I did see a kindle version of an 'Original First Edition' Alice which appears to be illustrated by Arthur Rackham - in case you are looking for that one instead of the better known John Tenniel version.Alice In Wonderland - Original First Edition Version Published For Kindle - Lewis CarrollThat edition has no Tenniel illustrations in the sample; also the text seems to be abridged (or just maybe an earlier version?) and the formatting is poor. Note that the picture of Alice looking at the Cheshire Cat in a tree that appears on this linked product page is not the cover that appears on the downloaded sample; the cover that does appear is of Alice walking with the Duchess and looks like this kindle book:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass- now for more typical Amazon mis-linked craziness, this latter edition has Tenniel illustrations, but beware that they are very small thumbnails and enlarge to very poor quality. I do not recommend either of these editions. The Rackham is available at Gutenberg for free.Today I discovered the Master EditionThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions)which I missed before (likely because I was concentrating on Through the Looking Glass, which has far fewer editions, and then pursuing the 'matching' Alice in Wonderlands). Today the price is .89 and I am going to buy it. It is at least as well formatted as the BLTC (based on the sample) and has even more Alice writings (beyond Wonderland and Looking Glass) as well as essays and historical info and other 'add-ons'. He has all the illustrations from Tenniel and additional ones from Holliday and Carroll (I think he should add Rackham's, too).As many others have said, the basic Kindle edition is a very poor choice, and most others also lack the illustrations. Thank goodness for samples.Re Through the Looking Glass, it was the chess board appearing in the BLTC sample (and not in the BompaCrazy sample) that finalized my choice in their favor (before finding the Master). Here are the BLTC and BompaCrazy links:Through the Looking Glass- BLTCThrough the Looking Glass (Illustrated)- BompaCrazyI hope this review helps you find your best choice far more quickly than I did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I love Alice in Wonderland. I've been reading it since I was a small child, hence I can honestly say that whoever retyped this for the Kindle did a shoddy (my peers would say \\"half-assed\\") job. Oh, it's readable, don't get me wrong. But if we'd bought this as a paperback, there would be an outcry, so why not shout out one for the eBook crowd? Shame on you!There are tons of typos. The quotation marks are in that cheap ASCII nearly-sideways type that makes you blink more than once until your eyes adjust. Italicized words jumped between actual italics to underscores before italicized words (e.g., I will prosecute _you_). John Tenniel's illustrations are non-existent (oh, the horror!!). But my biggest complaint, though, is the presentation of the poetry. In fully-justified, unpunctuated paragraphs. Are you serious, Kindle publishers?!?I got my first taste of things to come with \\"The Mouse's Tale\\" (Fury said to a mouse that he met in the house...), usually written in a fun, swirly format with decreasing font size. (You can see the original at [...]). I realize this would have been difficult to redo in the Kindle format, especially when the user is given the option to make the font bigger or smaller at will. But at least put it in stanza format! I tried to reproduce the result of the attempt, but Amazon's comment box reformats everything, so I'll try to demonstrate:Fury (huge gap) said (huge gap) to a mouse That he(huge gap) met (huge gap) in the (huge gap)house Let us bothgo to (huge gap) law, I will (huge gap) prosecute you.It's the worst example of full-justification allowable - the humongous gaps between words, no punctuation, three or four words per line...and so forth. Making the text bigger or smaller made it worse.The rest of the poetry is in plain old paragraph format, with punctuation thrown in haphazardly or missing altogether. In \\"Through the Looking Glass,\\" consider the presentation of \\"The Walrus and The Carpenter.\\"The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so, And then they rested on a rock Conveniently low; And all the little Oysters stood And waited in a row.\\"The time has come,\\" the Walrus said To talk of many things Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--Of cabbages--and kings--And why the sea is boiling hot--And whether pigs have wings.Readers might find this a little thing, but I'm sorry, this just bothered the hell out of me.I guess I should have expected it. I only paid 99 cents for this version, and you get what you pay for. And for God's sake, don't fall for the \\"free full versions\\" out there that were typed by \\"scholars\\" and available on the web for nothing - they're worse yet! So I give this 3 stars - a wonderful story brought low by lazy copy-editing.Honestly, publishers, if you're going to redo a classic for the Kindle: (1) Include the original artwork, (2) format it correctly so it resembles the original hard copy as much as possible, and (3) spell-check it, for crying out loud. Don't make Kindle owners wonder what other crap is in store that will make us sorry we bought the thing and just reach for our old paperbacks instead."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"After more than a century, young Alice's adventures in Wonderland are still fun. True, there are a good many dated notions and difficult puns. But, even so, my six year old and I had good fun with the tale. That said, I think our success with the book depends a good deal on the edition we choose. By luck we stumbled upon Peter Weevers' illustrated version (Alices Adventures In Wonderland). Sadly it's out of print. Such marvelous pictures! Mr. Weevers really brought Wonderland to life for us.By contrast, most editions contain JOHN TENNIEL's classic/original drawings. Frankly, I think they're a bit dated and dreary. Purists will certainly adhere to them, but other illustrators have done far better. My suggestion is that you search for Alice and find one with another illustrator! One option is the unique artwork of Alison Jay (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland). Not to everyone's taste, but more alive and child-friendly than Tenniel. Another option is the Cooper Edens' edition (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland -A Classic Illustrated Edition). A new edition that looks quite promising is illustrated by Helen Oxenbury (Alice Through the Looking-glass: Walker Illustrated Classics.In another episode, my first experience with Alice was a very bad one. I made the mistake of buying an annotated version. I'm not sure which one. Perhaps:The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition. I got so completely tripped up, looking up 19th century references to English politics and what not. I'm sure that aficionados can appreciate Carroll's deeper humor, but for most of us this is just a kids' tale. Don't buy an annotated version unless you're already hooked on Alice.All things considered, here is my advice. DO buy the original Lewis Carroll text (unabridged, not rewritten). It's lively and fun. Especially if you are reading to a young one: DO NOT buy a Tenniel illustrated edition. Try to find a used copy of Weevers' version or take a chance on the an Oxenbury edition, such asAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. And lastly DO read Alice. Her travels through Wonderland are still lots of fun."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"My son stayed at home \\"sick\\" and I said he couldn't watch TV or play computer but he could listen to this audio book.

The books are elegantly presented: Alice with a gold color cover and gold gilt edges on all three sides, Looking-Glass with a silver cover and silver gilt edges on all three sides, and the box being in gold color and looking almost identical to the Alice volume. The books are printed on fairly thin, very smooth, and somewhat off-white paper -- the color of which I personally find detracts a little from the books. The books are identical in layout, typeface and illustrations to the original 1865 &amp; 1872 Macmillan editions: the type has been reset and is thus perfectly crisp, the typeface (De Vinne) is a perfect match to the original typeface except the quote marks are a bit more spaced out than is usual. The text is otherwise a perfect match, with line breaks in identical places, etc. The speciality of these Books of Wonder editions is that the illustrations have been printed from the original woodblocks which had been sitting forgotten in a bank vault for many years. The books claim that &quot;details never seen before are now visible&quot;, but I haven't been able to see evidence of this myself: the illustrations _are_ considerably cleaner and crisper, but I've not seen any extra details. On the down side, a number of the woodblocks had editing done on them when they were made, and over time these edited portions have clearly shrunk or no longer fit perfectly into the surrounding wood, so that the editing is much more clearly visible than on facsimiles of editions from 100 years ago.

I can't tell if the entertainment came from familiarity or not - so much of Alice is simply part of cultural memory that I knew it without ever having read the book. It was silly, but for a time, it progressed. Alice was trying to get into the garden and was exploring the nonsense world as she went along.Through the Looking Glass was different. I had a hard time reading it. I didn't find it entertaining. The pieces made no sense together, and the goal of becoming a queen by making it to the eighth square seemed an afterthought. It may be that Through the Looking Glass was a better dream narrative (it certainly seemed a good example of the kind of play young children engage in), but I still had a hard time reading it."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I have an avid young reader in my family and it is not always easy to guess what kind of book she may enjoy.

Originally published under the titles Alice's Adventures Underground and Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There, these books were the work of an Oxford mathematician named Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, using the pen-name of Lewis Carroll. According to Charles H. Sylvester (editor of Journeys through Bookland): \\"One day . . . he took three of his little friends, Alice and Edith and Lorina Liddell, for a trip up the river, and on that afternoon he began telling them about Alice and her Wonderland, continuing the story on other occasions. He had no intention of making a book, but the story pleased little Alice and her sisters so well that they talked about it at home and among their grown-up friends, who finally persuaded the author to have it printed.\\" Note: Songs are composed by Field, although the opening poem \\"All in the Golden Afternoon\\" is missing from this recording.

It's sadly missing a good part of the charm of the other editions I read and have owned. I currently have a lovely complete works of Lewis Carroll leather bound which includes Alice in Wonderland and Alice through the Looking Glass, with the original drawings which I've had in every edition I've ever had including other paperback versions, but sadly not this one, if I'd realized that this one was missing such an essential ingredient as the drawings, I wouldn't have bought this particular edition. I bought it with the assumption that it had the usual charming Victorian drawings that every other edition hardback or paperback has it, but as my other copies of Alice have disappeared, and the leather bound edition is too frail to sit down and read, I'll make do with this one, but I'm not happy with it.I think may well send it back, and get another with the drawings."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a fun and pleasant reading. The book allows the reader to enter into Alice's mind and travel along with her through the worderful and mysterious Wonderland. Alice is a curious and questioning little girl traversing a land where nonsense is the common-sense, where right is wrong and where wrong is not always right (but can be sometimes!). This causes a surprise in every page you turn. The characters Alice meets usually produce the most unexpected replies which always leave Alice and the reader in a troubled state-of-mind. However amazing it can be, we are sometimes a little puzzled by noticing there is some logic in the nonsense world of Wonderland and I personally think this is the true beauty of the book. Moreover, all this is presented by the most unusual characters in a rich text, often mixing prose and verse and sometimes toying with typography in a e. e. cummings-like nature, which makes the book quite unique."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The book Alice in wonderland starts when Alice finds a white rabbit.

Alice finds herself in world of cards, bottles or cakes of magical liquids that changes her size, and a vast array of dizzying characters. Alice plays a croquet game with the Queen of Hearts in her garden, all the while the Queen ordering her guards to chop off peoples heads. She also encounters a Mad Hatter at his teatime, which is all the time because he angered time once, so tea time is always for him! In Through the Looking Glass, Alice travels to a backwards world through her mirror in her living room, playing her way through the world in a chess game, meeting various characters in her quest to become a Queen. Here, is Lewis Carrols famous poem, Jabberwocky: \`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves' did gyre and gimble in the wabe:' All mimsy were the borogoves,' and the mome raths outgrabe.I found this book to be not what I expect. It was entertaining, exciting, but quite a bit confusing. Overall, I believe it would be better suited for free reading than a report for a class. A part I found especially confusing was in Alice in Wonderland when Alice visits the house of the Duchess and the Duchess sing to her baby, \\"Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to annoy, Because he know it teases.\\" This part I found to be confusing, since beating of a baby is never allowed in any society, past or present.Many of the themes in Alice in Wonderland are told through poems or songs that the characters sing. Sometimes the message is hard to clearly express because of the way words are used and the long list of characters. I would recommend this book to adults more, because of the writing styles Carrol used, more because the book was written in 1872, but also some teenagers for a look at how developed the movie became for children but because some of the confusion is hard to determine, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I am fonder of Through the Looking Glass than Alice in Wonderland, perhaps because of less exposure (e.g., Disney and other commercial venues). The drawings by Tenniel are brilliant and add the right flavor to the story. The book is well-written, surreal with bizarre, fascinating characters (whom a little girl has to figure out), unique situations, word play, puzzles and a mocking irreverent tone towards high society. Whenever as an adult I'd hit a snag and couldn't read, I would always pull out this one and it would put me back on track again. Another I will treasure for the memories of sharing it with my kid."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book was an interest in my eyes. It took fantasy and brought it to life in my mind. Through my imagination, I was practically in the body of Alice, experiencing everything she did. Lewis Carroll is an excellent author, depicting excellent pictures, thoughts, and questions in the reader's mind. His style and technique of writing put amazing imagery and specific descriptions through my imagination. &quot;A found face, and large eyes like a frog, &quot; was an example of a piece of his work that depicts a good sense of imagery. The main idea of this story is for the main character, Alice, to find her way out of Wonderland. Some examples of some of the characters were: Queen of Hearts, Alice, the Mad Hatter, and the March Hare. Lewis Carroll uses descriptive words and phrases to describe the many different characters in this fiction book. In this book, Alice goes from being in the middle of the woods to a large hallway, into a big pool of water, to a house in which she grows larger, and finally she meets a weird looking caterpillar resting upon a mushroom. She adventured from place to place, seeking help from many different creatures. Lewis Carroll has a very unique way of describing different events and is also very creative while doing so. For example, when Alice was playing a relaxing game with the Queen of Hearts, the author describes the ball as a hedgehog, and the stick as a skinny, pink flamingo, which puts a very creative picture in the reader's mind. In the process of this story, Alice drinks and eats things, even though she doesn't know what she was ingesting, she did it anyway. Every event in which happened, went with the pattern of the events in the story. Every event was important and was needed to make sense out of the wild story. In &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, Lewis Carroll uses his imagination to create a story full of memorable and fantastic events, used to put a smile on the reader's face and a strong grip on the reader's hand. Overall, I would recommend this book to readers 13 and older. This book will put a sparkle in the reader's eye, and a mind full of memories for a lifetime to remember. So if you have a chance, pick up the book and start an adventurous fantasy through Wonderland!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I just read this book for an Honors English class, and I got exactly what I expected. Lewis Carroll has an unique writing style;it is unlike anything that I have read before. His use of words give a sharp image in the reader's head, just like as if they were actually there. He uses excellent imagery. His descriptions on every single character was great,and that was one thing that I enjoyed. An example of his descriptions is in the beginning of chapter six, when Alice sees a footman in front of a house. Carroll describes the footman &quot;with a found face,and large eyes like a frog&quot;. He is one of the few authors that take the time to describe the supplementary characters. The main character is , of course, Alice. She is very adventurous, and this is seen throughout the book. Anyting that she sees that is new, she will try it. In the very beginning of her adventures, she sees a potion that is laying around, and in hopes of getting into the garden that she saw earlier, she drank some of it, just because it said &quot;drink me&quot;. The potion made her very small, which eventually became an adventure within itself. Another example was when she went to play croquet with the queen. They played croquet with hedgehogs as balls and flamingoes has sticks. Alice didn't care what the adventure was, as long as she was a part of it.She also didn't hesistate to express her opinions. When the queen was executing everyone in her path, Alice spoke up about what she was doing. People who like adventuruous characters would like Alice. The theme of this book to me is if you see something new, you should try it just for the fun of doing something new. It is shown by Alice's different adventures, like what I mentioned in the previous paragraphs. I didn't really get the plot of this story. I thought that it was to get to the garden that she saw in the beginning of the book. I think that I didn't get it because Carroll jumped from one adventure without finishing the previous one. That is one of the reasons why I gave this book three stars out of five. I didn't like this story, partially because it was fantasy. I just read it to try something different.I would recommend this book to readers who like reading fantasy and who like to use their imaginations while reading. I don't know why it is a big children's classic, but I didn't like when I was in elementary school and I still don't like it in high school. This book will most likely never become one of my favorite classics. Overall, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; wasn't very effective to me."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I read the book, \\"Alice In Wonderland.\\" This is a very good book to read but it can also get very confusing if you don't read it thoroughly. The author of this book has a very unique way of writing. The author thinks back as a child and put down everything that happened and then exaggerates it so much that it is a totally fiction book. \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" is not the type of book where you could skip over sentences, because you would get completely lost. This book is a magical book. It takes you into a world you never knew was there. The main character in this book is Alice. She takes many trips, not knowing that in her imagination she is making it all up. She goes from the woods, to a big hallway, into water, then into a house in which she grows larger than wanted, and then she meets a caterpillar on a mushroom. There are many other places she went and met other creatures that helped her along the way. There are many things you can learn from this book. For example Alice wanted to change her size (she wanted to be different than she was before) but then things went terribly wrong. She never went to the size she wanted to be... she either went too short or too tall. This teaches you that you should accept the way you are, because you will thank yourself in the end. You are perfect the way you are you never need to change unless you are bad and need to change into good. You could really learn a whole lot from this book but it is going to be hard for younger kids to understand. I personally recommend this book for 12 year olds and up. This book is really good, give it a try it will take you into a magnificent world and you will never want to come back!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"THE ULTIMATE FAIRYTAIL.

When I thought a Transformers movie would be a great idea; when I truly believed that Buffy and Angel could be together someday; when I could rely on \\"Heroes\\" to be, oh, at least kinda interesting. And a big part of my naivet&eacute; had to do with the Disney Studio. See, as a youngster, they taught me that Snow White had an evil sorceress for a step-mother, that Cinderella had a fairy Godmother for a, uh, godmother, and that a young lady called Alice went to Wonderland in her dreams one day, and met there the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, with whom she celebrated her un-birthday.Disney lied! About that last part, at any rate. Gasp!I can't quite understand why I never knew this, or why this never even occurred to me. I mean, I had read the fairy tale behind \\"The Little Mermaid\\", so I knew that the whole Ariel-Prince Eric hook up was something of an artistic liberty. I'd read \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", and a host of other stories about beauties whose princes someday came. And since they were all old, old tales, ripe for revision and, let's face it, not exactly offering endings to make you go \\"ahhh\\", it didn't occur to me to argue with the happy-ever-afters being assisted by singing mice and the occasional dancing cavalcade of cutlery.But for some reason, despite the voraciousness of my reading habits throughout what I like to pretend is a life, I didn't get around to reading the original, non-Golden Book version of Carroll's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" till I was well past the age where perhaps I should have. I've now read it several times, and all I can say is... cool.We all know the basic story (if not, as I have recently discovered, the entirety of it). Little blonde girl is dozing in a meadow with her cat Dinah when she sees a waistcoat-clad White Rabbit rush past exclaiming that he is late. She, naturally enough, follows the tardy bunny down a very, very deep whole, at the bottom of which she discovers a little door. Through that door is Wonderland, which she can only reach by shrinking herself with the assistance of convenient shrinking refreshments. And later, she gets larger again. Then there's this whole thing about a mystic caterpillar, a tea party, the Queen of Hearts, a croquet match using flamingos (animal rights activists, unite against Flamingo Croquet!) and a trial... and that's not even mentioning that enigmatic Cheshire Cat, who can materialize anywhere at will. What an elegantly contrived, wondrously chaotic, perfectly lovely story it is, too.The first thing I thought upon concluding it, however, was that I had accidentally bought the abridged version. So much Alice that I remembered seemed to be missing, and I knew my imagination wasn't good enough to have conjured up that stuff. But then I read \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\", Alice's continued adventures, and it was all explained.Through the Looking-Glass finds our Alice being all other-worldly again, but instead of down a hole she goes through a mirror into a slightly askew locale in which the lion and the unicorn fight for the crown, Humpty Dumpty falls from his wall, and we hear of the Jabberwocky and the Walrus, cabbages and kings. There's also a giant, and inexplicable, chess game afoot. It's witty and suspenseful, surreal and yet actual, well-crafted melodrama blended perfectly with satire... so very entertaining.Ah! I exclaimed. I see! Those clever, sneaky fellows at Mouse Central had combined elements from the two books to create their little gem that they, regardless, called \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", even though Alice was clearly *through the looking-glass* when she, as for example, learned of un-birthdays.This got me to thinking. Does this mean that Disney has lied about other things, as well? Is there no Bambi, no Davy Crockett, no kids from Witch Mountain? What about Herbie, did he really go bananas, and did that guy turn into a shaggy dog, or were those shameless untruths as well? Sure, I knew they'd let the fact-checking go a little in their more recent endeavors, what with Pocahontas not having a talking willow in her circle of friends, Hercules not really being all that good of a guy, and there actually being a proper Princess in \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" (who was emphatically not from New Orleans). But those cherished memories of my childhood I had held as sacred, and they are now tarnished forever.But that's okay. More than okay, really. It's a joy to discover that a story I had thought so familiar can be all shiny and new again. It was a revelation to dive into Carroll's simple, yet complex prose... even the academic-y footnotes are interesting here, as so many of Carroll's characters, metaphors and poems are parodies, references and allusions to persons living and dead. (Well, okay, mostly dead.) The in-jokes are more prevalent than in your average Supernatural episode. Dated it may be, but out-dated, never, and the fact that I can continue to discover the pleasures of this ostensibly child's tale at my advanced age actually makes me grateful for a childhood deprived of it.So, I guess, thanks for lying to me, Disney. I appreciate it. Really.

One can easily see where satiric writers, like Jasper Fforde, get their notion of twisting literary and familiar characters to suit their own purposes. This Wordsworth Classics edition contains \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and its sequel, \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", which is the lesser of the two stories.Most everyone (including those who have not read the book) are familiar with the plot line. Alice follows the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole and finds herself in the strange and exotic world of Wonderland where nothing seems to make sense. As she continues in her journey, she meets a wide variety of characters - some familiar (like Humpty Dumpty) and some specific to Carroll (the Mad Hatter and the March Hare). Because Alice's adventure is truly a dream, what happens in Wonderland does not need to make sense or follow any logical pattern of time or plot. \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" finds Alice back in Wonderland, this time with the promise of becoming a queen if she can make it across the chess board. The concept of chess ties this story together, but there are few strong elements which make this sequel difficult to stand on its own. It would work better if some of its stories had been incorporated into the original.All in all, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" are unique escapes into one writer's dreamy imagination. In a way, the oddities wind up making sense, allowing readers to philosophize with Carroll along the way. And for any lover of the English language, some of Carroll's creations (especially the Jabberwocky) are astounding and wonderful plays on words. Sir John Tenniel's classic illustrations help further the story, truly capturing the weirdness of Wonderland and Alice's adventures there."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Of course the story is fun but I don't like the way the ebook is formatted and there's no Table of Contents."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is a book that seems to stay with what Lewis Carroll wanted these books to be.

While it is often labeled a children's novel, it takes the understanding of an adult to grasp the richness of symbolism contained in each page. We get a front row seat as Alice journeys through a myriad of characters that range from the bizarre to the down right funny. Alice is the wiser for each encounter, but what makes the book so charming is that she manages to retain her child-like wonder.I must admit that this novel would not be complete without the illustrations from Punch cartoonist John Tenniel. Tenniel gives the characters a richness and exaggerated life that is unmatched. The book is incomplete without those drawings.Lastly, there is little bit of Alice in all of us. Who among us has not wanted to walk in the forest, open a closed door, or peek behind a curtain. The thought of escaping and exploring the unknown without the fear of harm is almost intoxicating.

Sure, her adventures--first in Wonderland, then in the world behind the Looking-Glass--will appeal to all children; the characters are whimsical and delightful, the dangers tantalizing (at least to young minds), and the endings ever-so-happy. Plus, there are kittens, butterflies, and talking goats...what child can resist talking goats, I ask you?But for those of us over the age of 8...we need something else. As for myself, I got lost in the brilliantly clever humor that was strewn throughout the tales; the wit is quick, and Carroll's enjoyment of wordplay is apparent on every page. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass\\" contain some of the most memorable dialogue you will ever encounter.

I feel that it is just like you are in a dream and the author does a very good job at writing the book so it seems like that. I think it is a good book because it really keeps you focused on what is happening because it is a complicated story. There are a lot of twists and turns in the book, especially in the beginning. I think that it is also a good book because the author, Lewis Carroll, includes things that you would never even think about until you read to book. I also like the book because it is very entertaining to understand how Alice (the main character) tries to deal with and interoperate all of the strange circumstances that happen in wonderland. All of the characters that are in the book are very strange and tell very bizarre stories. The stories have no point what so ever and it gets quite frustrating to Alice because she really wants to know what happens, but they just wont say it and go on and on. All of the events that happen in the book that need trial do not seem very savvy and are unjust and unfair which is quite interesting to read about because Alice gets accused of a lot of things and it is very gallant of her to stand up for herself.

It was during the industrial age of the 1800s and the mechanic way of life was in. As such, art and fantasy were seen by a lot of people in England as ridiculous, nonsensical, and tolerable at best. But Lewis Carroll didn't think so. There are always a few people who won't give up common sense for the sake of public opinion. Writing for a little girl named Alice Liddell, Lewis Carroll told of the adventures of another girl named Alice who, after a tumble down a very strange rabbit hole, found herself in a place where fantasy and nonsense reigned supreme. Countering the status quo of the era in England, \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" bursts with eccentric characters and unsuspecting twists and turns.

As an adult, though, I found the two books to be quite charming and fun to read. Alice's Adventures In Wonderland is the much more enjoyable tale of the two, perhaps because so much of it was already familiar to me as a part of popular culture. Through the Looking Glass seemed to me to be much more contrived and less magical. I found myself trying to puzzle out hidden messages and motifs in the latter work, while I basically just read the Wonderland story for pure enjoyment. The latter tale also seemed to fall apart at the seams as it began to approach its conclusion. Without rereading the books, I have trouble seeing all of the complex and satirical things mentioned by academic types (such as a critique of Victorian society and contemporary educational methods), nor does the whole chess game motif make complete sense to me, although the workings of the game apparently pleased the mathematician in Carroll's alter-ego enough that he attempts to explain it at the start of Through the Looking Glass.It was a treat to see the original illustrations of John Tenniel interspersed throughout both stories, despite the fact that Alice appears a good bit more sullen than I envision her in my own mind. It was also good to be formally introduced to such well-known entities as the Cheshire Cat, although Humpty Dumpty certainly comes across as a rather taciturn figure. For those of you who love puns, Lewis Carroll offers you a gold mine of them, although I doubt that many children will actually understand very many of them until they reach an age in which they will probably reject a reading of Carroll as \\"baby stuff.\\" I'm no expert on children's literature (or on children, for that matter), but the story of Alice's adventures would seem to offer a free ticket to an enticing fantasy world for youngsters and a delightfully quaint vacation spot for adult readers."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I purchased this book because I was specifically lo0king for the sequel, Through the Looking-Glass.

They are both unalterable masterpieces.As beautiful as the Disney movie is, the two books have so much more. More off-the-wall characters, more extremely witty dialogue, and more imaginative scenarios to ponder, these books go above and beyond any creative work I have ever seen.Carroll's works have changed my life more than any self-help book ever could. Through them I can ponder about so much more than only the things I can see. I am able to look inside of my imagination, and be unafraid to push its limits.I was around 20 years old when I read the Alice books for the first time. They seem a bit complex for children's books. I believe Carroll intended the books to be for an 8 year old child, and to be honest, I'd be impressed if I saw someone that age reading this material. The vocabulary and sentence structure involved looks more suited to someone the age of 12 I believe, but perhaps children know more than I am aware of.Also, Pig and Pepper (one of my favorite chapters), has a scene that's quite disturbing. I don't know if a first time novelist in this day and age could get away with including such content in a children's title. It's nice to take a look at though, since the chapter contains the very first appearance of the Cheshire Cat. I personally like the sheep from the Wool and Water chapter of \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" a little bit better than the Cheshire Cat, so try looking into that chapter also if you can."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This has to be two of my favorite books of all time. Carroll has managed to create memorable characters, the mad-hatter, Humpty Dumpty and many others. This is not merely a well-written children's story but a piece of biting satire and a violent attack on the norms, morals and ethics that were prevalent at the time. For instance when Humpty Dumpty shakes hands with Alice he only offers one finer. This was an extreme version of the upper class only offering two fingers to shake to anyone below their stature and he takes this nasty habit to its ugly extreme. The pictures are tremendously well done. I can not praise Caroll enough since he is one of the best writers of children's stories ever and the way he paints the landscape and his usage of the words is truly stupendous. Every time I read it there is something new I pick up and that I have not thought about before.

Throughout that experience, I was simply delighted by the wonderfully colorful illustrations and the fanciful tales. There was no issue of digging for deeper implications, puns, or wordplay. I still recall my fascination with the nonsensical creatures, as well as with Alice's adventurous dreamland.As an adult, one can choose to delight in the obvious fantasy adventures or search for hidden meanings. Therefore, for the purpose of this exercise in which I foray into a reading challenge that will encompass these books and others that can be considered \\"retellings and sequels\\" or \\"literature with allusions and influences,\\" I am choosing to simply enjoy revisiting a childhood treasure.In any case, the most important aspects of these books are the creatively developed characters, especially the portrayal of Alice as a curious child who is obviously intelligent with layers of common-sense and creativity. Just following the characters in their upside-down or backwards adventures can be enough to intrigue the reader. All the reader must do is suspend disbelief for the purpose of the reading experience, which is not such a departure from many reading or movie-going encounters.I plan to reserve my searching for hidden meanings for the other books that I will be exploring in the upcoming weeks.This book is obviously a classic that has stood up to the test of time--it should be no surprise that I am giving it five stars."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This book is very much worth reading for anyone who would like to know the story before some ells changed it around.

Known best both in his lifetime and even more afterwards for his three GORMENGHAST novels (TITUS GROAN, GORMENGHAST, and TITUS ALONE), he was equally adept as a poet and as an illustrator and painter. He illustrated many of his own works as well as those of contemporaries such as Quentin Crisp, and on occasion provided new illustrations for classics from the past, such as this wonderful edition of ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS, first published in a rare and obscure edition in 1946 but republished many times since and still readily available.My copy is the Shocken (USA) hardcover edition from 1979, and I can recommend it strongly to anyone interested in a decent copy of the work but not necessarily prepared to look for an earlier edition. The binding is nice, the paper acid-free, the illustrations well reproduced. Peake is closer in style at first glance to Tenniel than most other 20th century artists who have interpreted the work; his finely detailed pen-and-ink work and heavy crosshatching bear the hallmarks of the classically trained illustrator in line with the earlier Victorian draughstmen who set the stage for much children's book illustration in England for a century or more. But there is a weirdness and grotesquerie - a creepiness - to this artist's work that is much more unnerving than Tenniel's and that, in my opinion, does a better job of reflecting the genuinely disturbing elements in the text, the madness and terrors that lie on the edges of the story in such violent characters as the Queen of Hearts and Tweedledum and Tweedledee. There are also pictures that edge close to a surrealism that Carroll was approaching, but that Tenniel I think didn't really understand.A magical interpretation then, and one that any collector of either artist or editions of the work (I am both) should make a top priority."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"In my retirement, I've taken up creative writing and enjoy it very much. In the last five years, I've written over 150 short stories. Had a few published and others read on our local PBS station. The teacher suggested we read \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" as a good example of imaginative story writing. I don't remember reading it as a child, and it was fun delving into Lewis Carroll's mind as he dreamt this up for Alice, his young friend. The introduction to the book, about Carroll, did a good job of setting the story up as well as provide biographical information about the author."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"this classic story is totally worth the read. if you love fantasy this is the book to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Is it a children's story or a primer on logic or even a work of wit and wisdom?Maybe it's all three.Alice in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass make up the two Alice books by Lewis Carroll. And in these books, Carroll paints a strange world in which logic has a strange way about it, mostly consisting of folk who interpret things quite literally.This, being a classic of children's literature, has been mimicked by many, and by many, unsuccessfully. Though, I will admit that many adaptations of this work have been made satisfactorily.The first book takes Alice down a rabbit hole and into wonderland. There, she meets all sorts of strange characters and discovers the queen of hearts, as well as other card-themed characters. The queen, it seems, is obsessed with displacing people's heads, and Alice must take every precaution to not upset her majesty.The second book takes Alice through a looking glass into a chess-themed world. Here the cruel magnate is the red queen. Alice learns many new poems and logical quirks before returning back through the looking glass.This book is sure to be enjoyed by bright children as well as adults who are kids at heart."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I have always loved the classic Disney movie of Alice in Wonderland.

In rereading the book, I laughted loudly at times of the cleverness with which it was constructed. As a very 'mature' reader I had remembered such from my youthful reading of it. Then I realized the movie makers had indeed 'Hollywoodized'-- that enchanting story -- making it violent and very Harry Potterish in its 'dragon chases' Of course the British actors were superb, as well as the American, but what a corruption of its dreamy innocence with such nightmareish malevolence!

The original book was an immediate classic success for people young and old to read.Carroll's sense of absurdity in his humour and his amazing gift for games of logic and language have made this book an enduring dream legacy of what is possible to happen in a persons mind. This is a story about Alice and growing up and what is lost for her in doing so. Alice dreams of a world where she doesn't belong to and where what is true in her real life isn't necessarily true anymore. The story begins when Alice follows the frantically delayed white rabbit down a black hole into the magical world of wonderland, where she meets a variety of some bizarre creatures some mythical creatures and some downright illogically wrong creatures. There is no linear path to life in wonderland where one event will lead seamlessly to another adding meaningful experience upon experience, instead life for her is made up of series of oftentimes unrelated events, by conversations you never fully understand while others you can't reason with at all in a completely upside down unpredictable world,that is always ever changing. Carroll's way with words has stood the test of time. His use of characters such as the mad hatter and the jabberwocky all have added to the simplistic colorful nature of his story in its a true grandeaur of a masterpiece that will live on for generations to come for readers reading it. Characters that keep you wondering for days on what they exactly are ? Do they belong in our world truly or are they a instead a collection of mixed creatures that are taken from mythological creatures of times a gone by who knows? If you haven't read this book yet then pick it up and read it no matter how young or old you are in age."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"My first exposure to Lewis Carroll's classic children's story was through the 1951 Disney film adaptation \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" which I watched repeatedly as a child. The creative quality of the story never failed to fascinate me, and I kept going back despite my deep-rooted terror of the frightful Queen of Hearts, who always gave me nightmares! However, it was not until recently, as an adult, that I ever picked up the book/s upon which that film was based. In some ways I wish I had read it when I was younger, as the book certainly makes a great deal more sense than the movie does (as much sense as a story of this sort can, anyhow), but thankfully this book is unique in that it is just as enjoyable for adults as for children.The story is actually spread across two books, here contained in a single volume. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was first published in 1865 and relates the events that take place after young Alice falls asleep during her lessons and dreams of following a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. Alice encounters all manner of strange creatures in her dream, and finds herself in all sorts of curious predicaments where common sense fails and the nonsensical comes to be expected. There is no central, concrete storyline, but rather Alice moves rapidly from one bizarre situation to the next before waking once more and relating the whole adventure to her sister.The second of the two books, \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There,\\" appeared in 1871 and is very similar in nature to the first, though having a slightly different plot. Here Alice steps through an ordinary looking-glass one day, only to find herself in a world where, if you wish to get anywhere, you must walk in the opposite direction! Walking toward your desired destination only gets you further and further away. Also, interestingly, the land which Alice has entered is essentially a giant chessboard, and she must move through the different squares to reach the other side if she wishes to become a queen (which she does).The characters Carroll created in these two stories are some of the most strikingly unique and unforgettable in the world of literature. Alice herself, based largely on Alice Liddell, a real-life child of whom Carroll was very fond, is a wonderful heroine that you can't help admiring. Throughout all of her backwards and upside-down adventures, she remains ever sensible and analytical, always trying to reason her way out of the most unreasonable situations. Other characters a reader won't soon forget include the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Cheshire Cat, Bill the Lizard, the Caterpillar, the Duchess and her peppery cook, the aforementioned Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, the Gryphon, the Red and White Queens, the talking flowers, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Sheep, Humpty Dumpty, and the Red and White Knights. Carroll also created many fascinating new creatures in his stories, including bread-and-butterflies, rocking-horseflies, \\"slithy toves,\\" \\"mome raths\\" and more.What I find most intriguing, as an adult reader of these books, is Carroll's brilliant use of wordplay and symbolism throughout the stories. Nearly everything has some sort of double meaning. There are hidden messags and subtle witticisms on every page. Carroll also includes several parodies of what were well-known songs and rhymes in England at the time. Young children will love the books for their fantastic qualities and imaginative inspiration, but most readers will not pick up on the many puns and jokes until they are a little older, so these stories really do have something to offer to anyone, no matter what age. I'd highly recommend the book to any reader - and be sure to get an edition that includes the original illustrations.This review refers to the 2004 Barnes & Noble Classics printing, with introduction and notes by Tan Lin."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This is not a review of the book, you can refer to the printed (or many of the Kindle versions) for that. Rather this is a comment on the Kindle file. I was specifically looking for a version that included the illustrations, and as this version listed John Tenniel under author information I hoped these would be included... they aren't. It does look like a well formatted version of the book, with an introduction by the editor, the original poetry from the beginning of the story (which some public domain versions lack), the original italicized text rather than CAPITAL letters as in some public domain versions, and a good approximation of the unique text formatting as seen in the printed book. It does not have a table of contents."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"There is one thing that all potential customers must keep in mind when buying any Alice book: Do not purchase one that does not include the illustrations of John Tenniel! This edition includes all of them and the quality of the reproductions on the pages are excellent. Tenniel's illustrations help add to the childish excitement of Carroll's stories and will be especially invaluable to teenagers and adults, having just by nature of growing up lost some of the imaginative innocence, that ability to stretch reality, that we all possessed as kids.Of course, the illustrations wouldn't mean jack if they didn't have a captivating story to work with. Carroll's amusing tale of nonsense is targeted as a kid's book, and that is always where many of our fondest memories of it will remain, but as a college student reading it I was amazed by its power to suspend reality and return me to a level of imagination that I had simply thought I lost somewhere along the way. The trip down the rabbit hole can be quite a different experience from a different point of view.This particular edition also includes a good introduction and very helpful explanatory notes organized chapter by chapter. The introduction and notes offer insights to Carroll's life and his relations with the real life Alice and her family that, from a student viewpoint, reveal an interesting and more personal side of the Alice tales."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"This threadbare bargain-priced edition may seem like a deal, but consider before purchasing that it has no table of contents, no introduction, no forward, no illustrations, and no bibliography. Adding insult to injury, the layout of this edition is easily one the worst ever for a reprint, with all words that originally appeared in italics for emphasis printed here in big block caps, as if the typesetting was done by an abrasive kid trying to get attention in an on line chat...IF YOU GET WHAT I MEAN.If you really want to explore and experience Lewis Carroll's classic, getThe Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition-- for the price on Amazon, it's the real bargain.

I found Alice's Adventures in Wonderland kind of boring but still good. Then I read Through the Looking Glass, and I loved it! I memorized all of the poems (jabberwocky being my favorite poem in the world), read it about a million times, and recomended it to people. Between Tweedledum and Tweedledee and Humpty Dumpty and all the reat of them, I had a lot of pleasant laughs and thoughts and dreams. Unfortunately, I read that Alice is losing popularity because people aren't at the reading level to read it before they outgrow fairy tales. This is a shame. people should preserve their imaginations just to read an excellent book like this and dream about it for a while. Now I am 13, and I stll treaasure this book.

Is there a person alive in Western civilization that *doesn't* know of Alice, the Mad Hatter, the Queen of Hearts, the White Rabbit and the Cheshire Cat? I seriously doubt it. Writing under the pen name of Lewis Carroll, Dodgson's quirky fairytale soon became a publishing sensation in Victorian England, quite an unusual feat for a dour mathematician who had no interest whatsoever in boys, women or most other human beings, and instead lavishing his attention on little girls - particularly one Alice Liddell, to whom he presented the original manuscript to. The story of Lewis Carroll is just as fascinating as his fictional Alice, so I would suggest following up the \\"Alice\\" books with a good Carroll biography.In a story that is so random (basically made up of one little girl wandering about in a dream) there is plenty of room for all sorts of crazy theories as to exactly what everything means. Does \\"Alice\\" have a deep subtext, filled with hidden meaning and messages? Is it Freudian? Elaborate satire? Does it reflect the deep internal frustrations, anxieties and wish-fulfillment of a slightly-disturbed mathematician obsessed with little girls? Or is it simply a series of weird and wonderful events dreamed up for the enjoyment of children? The fact that nobody is really sure *what* to make of this story is probably the reason why it's still published, read and discussed today.The other reason is its historical value. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was the first book designed for children that was entirely void of any sort of moral, and instead written solely for pure entertainment purposes. Before \\"Alice\\", children were stuck with stories that preached goodliness and virtue, something that Carroll himself pokes fun at during the course of the story, when he refers to \\"several nice little stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had told them.\\" His stories came like an unexpected breath of fresh air amongst Victorian society, and it was little wonder that adults as well as children helped to make \\"Alice\\" a bestseller during its day.Another crucial feature to the tale is Alice herself, often considered the first realistic representation of a child in literature. She's curious, but sometimes a little shy. She's polite, but manners often give way to frustration and temper tantrums. She's intelligent, but not as intelligent as she would like to think she is (relying heavily on an education that often fails her). She often holds her own against the contradictory natures of the people she meets, but more often than not is baffled and belittled by them. She possesses some degree of common sense, but often does some remarkably stupid things. She's likeable, but she's also a bit of a show-off and a snob. In other words, she's the first (and perhaps the best) example of a three-dimensional child character in literature geared toward either children *or* adults.\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" begins with the infamous sight of a white rabbit with a waistcoat and pocket-watch muttering to himself: \\"I'm late! I'm late!\\" Abandoning her sister and the dull book that she's reading, Alice follows the rabbit down a rabbit hole and unexpectedly finds herself drifting deep down underground. What follows is a series of weird and wonderful meetings with the likes of the Queen of Hearts, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Cheshire Cat and the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle, as poor Alice - the only sane person in the madhouse - struggles to make herself heard against this twisted parody of the adult world.Nearly every page contains a clever pun, nonsensical poem or mathematical puzzle, and there's plenty here to keep you fascinated, whether it be Alice's abrupt shrinking and growing (brought on by eating Wonderland food, and perhaps reflecting Carroll's desire to control the growth of his young protagonist), the beautiful garden that Alice cannot seem to reach (and when she does, she finds it not quite to her liking, perhaps suggesting a reverse-Eden, in which children desiring adulthood soon realize that it's not quite what they expected it to be) or Alice's internal crisis in which she debates whether the surreal circumstances she's found herself in have resulted in her loosing her own identity (I won't even try to open the jar on *that* one!) No wonder scholars can go mad trying to untangle this tale! Even the fact that the story succumbs to the ultimate clich&eacute; in fantasy-fiction, the ending that will reward you with an F if you use it in a creative-writing exercise at school (I am of course, referring to the fact that Alice wakes up at the conclusion of the story to find that it was just a dream), doesn't damage the power of Carroll's imaginative force.\\"Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There\\" is a little more structured in terms of its storyline, perhaps because Carroll was not simply making most of it up on the spot, as he had done with its predecessor. This time, when Alice falls asleep, she crawls through the mirror on the top of the mantelpiece and into the room on the other side. There she finds a land organized into the shape of a giant chessboard, in which Alice herself is a little pawn that must journey to the end of the board if she wishes to become a Queen. On the way she meets several chess pieces, including the Red and White Queen, and the White Knight (widely believed to represent Carroll himself), as well as Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, a garden of living flowers, and the Lion and the Unicorn, the latter of whom famously tells Alice: \\"If you'll believe in me, I'll believe in you.\\" My favourite chapter would have to be the one that involves the ludicrously pompous Humpty Dumpty (who is really the one who coined the term \\"un-birthday\\", not the Mad Hatter and the March Hare as the Disney version would have you believe), though equally memorable is the intriguing episode when Alice happens upon the sleeping Red King, and is told that he's dreaming of her. Is Alice in the Red King's dream, or is the Red King in Alice's dream? What should happen if one of them should wake up before the other? It's a disturbing metaphysical conundrum, and hints at the depths with which a scholar (or deep-thinking child) could delve into these stories.Of course, not every child will enjoy the \\"Alice\\" stories. What was once vividly imaginative and innovative for a stifled Victorian audience has long since become commonplace in children's fiction, and the randomness with which the adventures take place can often unsettle young listeners (as they certainly did me, as I always felt that Alice was caught inside a nightmare). However, others will delight in the madness that abounds throughout the story, and others still will learn to appreciate the work as they get older. There are hundreds of editions out there, most probably quite as good as the next, but I would encourage buyers to track down an edition with John Tenniel's famous illustrations - you simply cannot read the \\"Alice\\" books when they are not accompanied by Tenniel's portrayal of his demure little Alice, with her hooded eyes and large forehead. It would be like reading C. S. Lewis without Pauline Baynes, or Roald Dahl without Quentin Blake. Unthinkable!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I had not read these books since I was probably seven or eight, and I am glad that I finally got around to reading them again. These are some of the most fun childrens books (or any books for that matter) ever written. A previous reviewer gave this book a poor rating because it was only a childrens book. I fail to understand how being a childrens book means that a book is bad. Many childrens book are among the best books that I have ever read. Just because a book is a childrens book does not mean that it is a book just for children. Lewis Carroll wrote this for children, but it is probably even more enjoyable for me to read now than it was when I was a child, for now I understand many of the double meanings and world plays that you would never understand as a child. Carroll is better with word plays than any other author that I can recall reading. He is a master of molding sentences that simply slide right off of your tongue because they flow so smoothly. This is definitely one of the best childrens books ever written.Overall grade: A+"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, was a shy, eccentric bachelor who taught mathematics at Christ Church, Oxford. He had a great fondness of playing with mathematics, logic, words, for writing nonsense, and for the company of little girls, especially a little girl called Alice Liddell (rhymes with fiddle), the daughter of Christ Church's Dean. Dodgson's passions somehow fused into two great masterpieces of English literature, the Alice Books, immortal fantasies whose fame surpassed that of all of Carroll's collegues at Oxford put together. If the Alice books had any &quot;purpoise&quot; other than to entertain little girls, it is to send you, the reader, to the pleasures of logic and philosophy and, as Carroll says in the introduction to Learners (1897) &quot;to give a chance of adding a very large item to your stock of mental delights.&quot; Carroll's special genius lies in his ability to disguise charmingly the seriousness of his concerns and to make the most playful quality of his work at the same time its didactic crux. In the case of Alice, we are dealing with a very curious, complicated kind of nonsense, which explores the possibilities of the use and abuse of language and is actually based on a profound knowledge of the rules of clear thinging and logical thought. In fact, most of Carroll's apercus and all his jokes are inversions of the rules. Reason is here in service to the imagination, not vice versa. And oh my! Those interesting characters! I like to think that most of the characters that Alice meets are Oxford Dons that the real Alice knew. They sound like Dons with their fine mastery of Socratic logic, their crushing repartee, and the disconcerting and totally unself-conscious eccentricity of their conduct. The wealth of material which Carroll presents for the illumination of his subjects is almost without end. The more I read it, the more I think about it, the more I find. In fact, I have reached the conclusion that AAW is in actual fact a story so deep as to yield results in exegesis almost beyond belief. Also consider purchasing The Annotated Alice by Gardiner. It will help increase your reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"People tend to lump \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking-Glass (and What Alice Found There)\\" into one collection which has taken on the new title of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". This is probably a product of the movies, which took bits and pieces from each and made a composite adventure. This was possible, because Lewis Carroll (a.k.a. Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) managed to make the stories so even in quality that they can be put together seamlessly. He also managed to keep the stories enough different, that one can still enjoy reading both of them one after the other, without the feeling that the second is just a retelling of the first.To be sure, there are several ways in which the stories are similar, but not to the point where it detracts from the reader's enjoyment of the story. There are only three characters which appear in both books, one of which is Alice. The other notable characters (the Cheshire Cat, the Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, etc.) are well distributed between the two books. Thus there is a looking-glass between the two, just as the looking-glass plays such a key role in the second book.The Penguin Classics edition of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass\\" includes both books including the illustrations by John Tenniel. It also includes the original \\"Alice's Adventures under Ground\\" which includes Lewis Carroll's artwork. For additional features, it includes \`\\"Alice\\" on the Stage' an article which Lewis Carroll wrote after seeing a production of the stage version, and it includes preface's to the books which Lewis Carroll wrote in 1896 for the 1897 editions. There are wonderful notes for both books, and a very informative introduction by Hugh Haughton. There is other supporting material as well. To sum up, this edition has pretty much anything one could want, other than a complete collection of Carroll's work.A last comment on the introduction, it covers the biographical information for Reverend Dodgson, and the information on how the stories came about. Some of this information may detract from one's enjoyment of the story, but one can certainly understand the decision to include it for those who are interested in Reverend Dodgson and his life. All in all, this edition is packed with everything and will suit those who just want to read the stories as well as those who want to delve deep into their origins."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Last week I downloaded the free version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. All the poetry was missing from it. I didn't realize it right away until I got to the chapter with the Mock Turtle. So, I came across this version and it was very appealing because I thought I was getting both books for just 99 cents. At first I was mostly satisfied since I saw the poetry, but the formatting of the book was weird. There would be a line of text and then the next line would only have a couple words. Also, this download only has Alice in Wonderland.

This book is fantasy with a lot of humor in it. When I was little someone who came to our house gave the book to me. I never started reading it until I was in the 5th grade. But still I thought the book was too long so I never finished it in 5th grade. But in 6th grade I read the whole book and loved it, and I read it again this year. I think I could read this book 1 million times and still want to read it 1million times again!In the first story, Alice in Wonderland, It is about a girl named Alice. Alice is in this wonderful, magical place where creatures she never thought of come to life. It all starts with a white rabbit holding a pocket watch saying, \\"I'm late, I'm late.\\" Alice is very curious (who wouldn't be!) so she follows him and ends up falling through a hole, and it is a long, long fall. She comes to a room where strange things happen to Alice. She has a tea party with mad, crazy people, she meets the queen and finds out that the queen isn't decent at all!In the second story, Through the Looking glass, Alice meets a bunch of weird creatures. Alice steps into looking glass house where she is in a giant chess game and on her way to becoming queen Alice. And a lot of exciting and weird things happen along the way.I highly recommend this book to anyone in the 6th grade up. It is the kind of book that you can't stop reading. You get attached to the characters, and books that do that to me, I love, because you know you are enjoying the book. So if you like fantasy and like to have a few laughs, this is the book you have to read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a great book. It gets your imagination going. It all starts when Alice is sitting on a bank with her sister and falls asleep. From there it is all imagination and from there your imagination never stops. Alice lets her curiosity get the best of her so she finds herself falling down a long, black, well after following the white rabbit. She follows the rabbit because she heard it say &quot;Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!&quot; Personally, I would have followed a talking rabbit also. After she hits the bottom of the well she finds all of these doors that she soon finds out are all locked. After she went around trying all of the doors she found a three legged table in the middle of the floor with a small gold key on it. The key was to small to fit any of the doors and she starts to wonder how she is going to get out of her. She then finds a curtain and she moves it. That's where she finds the door that the key fits. Once she opens the door she sees a beautiful garden but she is to large to fit in the door. Alice then finds a bottle marked &quot;Drink Me&quot; and when she drink it she shrinks. When she shrinks she noticed that she left the key on the table which now she is to small to get. Then she finds cookies that says &quot;Eat Me&quot; so of course Alice being as curiosity that she is she ate it. The cookie made her larger then what she was before. It made her so large that she got stuck. She started to cry which made her shrink once again. She cried so much that it caused a river of tears. Alice meets a lot of wonderful creatures and people during her adventure. She meets a caterpillar who gives her advice. She also meets the Duchess who has the Cheshire cat. Alice was confused about why the cat was smiling so she asked the Duchess. The Duchess said that he was a Cheshire cat and that it was supposed to smile. The Cheshire cat told Alice to go visit the Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse. The cat told her that she would love them because they were mad. Alice did as the cat told her and visited them where she sit down and had tea with them. Alice also meets the Queen of Hearts won is an evil person. The Queens tarts get stolen and she thinks Alice stole them. Alice has to go to court over this. The Queen loved to scream &quot;Off with her head!&quot; Alice is woke from her wonderful dream by her sister. Alice then starts to think about how her sister will be when she grows older. At the beginning when she first falls asleep it is hard to tell if she is dreaming so that is kind of confusing but otherwise this book is wonderful and very easy to read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I was hoping to find a Kindle edition of both Alice books in one file with the original John Tenniel illustrations. This seemed to fit the bill and seemed to be worth the money. Overall, from my initial reading, I am mostly pleased with the formatting. The unorthodox type setups (such as the mouse's tale) are mostly preserved and the illustrations look good. One complaint is that the title very clearly says \\"with active table of contents.\\" There is no table of contents. I was disappointed in this. Also, on my K1 anyway, some of the poetry lines broke in the middle of words. This made the poetry awkward to read at some places. There also are some stray punctuation marks here and there, but this didn't really detract from the reading experience.Edit 3/19/10 - I finished reading the entire two books and found the table of contents at the back of the book.

It is a perfect example of a story written a very popular theme. It explains that in the mind of a child things are not always as they seem. Alice (the main character) is a curious youngster who follows a white rabbit, in a waist-coat, down a rabbit hole. Alice finds herself in a strange new world where nothing is what it seems. Small cakes and unmarked bottles cause her to grow to be three stories tall and pieces of mushrooms make her shrink to the height of a playing card. As the story progresses, Alice encounters many interesting characters including a very demanding queen who sentences everyone to be beheaded before the end of a crazy croquet game. The author, Lewis Carroll, used poetry and rhythm to add to the already whimsical and mysterious atmosphere. He created individuals with exaggerated character traits, so the reader can easily picture them. For example the Cheshire cat with his giant grin and disappearing body. Carroll also included illustrations of the important scenes of the story, so the reader would be able to understand them better. This story perfectly explains the racing imagination of a child in a light-hearted and imaginative way."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"The pink flamingos are adorable, which makes it all the more disappointing when they start rubbing off from the second you remove the price sticker."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I don't understand the negative reviews.Alice is an inquisitive, and very brave girl, who observes the world around her, and attempts to understand what is happening and how to handle it.

That said, I am a huge sci-fi and fantasy fan and certainly don't have a lack of imagination, even at 27. Just a couple of years ago I re-read all of the Chronicles of Narnia, and enjoyed them just as much as--if not more than--I enjoyed them as a child.All of that said, yes, Carroll did a wonderful job portraying the messiness, strangeness, and scenery switches of a dream. But as a whole...his works barely rate a 3 on a one to five scale. In fact...I'd probably go with a 2.5 at best. Although some of his Victorian satire was certainly amusing, I feel as if these books were mostly nonsense and simply didn't contain the literary merit to render it a classic with the likes of, for example, Hans Christian Anderson, J.M.

It's not cleverness - its just randomness disquised as cleverness. It just tosses a bunch of nothing together, shakes it up, mixes in a curious and rude little girl who's rudeness pales next to the characters she encounters in Wonderland. Those thousand monkeys at typewriters would produce something along these lines before getting to Shakespeare. For some reason, I never read this when I was discovering Narnia or Oz. Ormondroyd's \\"David & the Phoenix\\" has the spirit I expected to encounter in Caroll's book. Instead - this book starts nowhere and ends nowhere. And perhaps that is the nonsense that some find pleasing. For me it was simply distracting. The whole idea of the world's we create ourselves is a notion I have always been drawn to. Wonderland isn't even a world much less a persuasive daydream. Nothing there matters. And Alice just skips off at the end, leaving her sister to forecast a bit of standard drivel about the day when they will be grownups but always have their childhood inside.

When I was a child, I watched the Disney version of Alice in Wonderland and enjoyed it. I've watched it again recently and find it very strange. I came across the book, &quot;Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass&quot; in an old library at my Grandparent's house. This was an old English version, which may have made it more difficult to read and comprehend then if it was in common dialect. The first story, Alice in Wonderland, is the better of the two. It tells of a dreamland that a seven-year old Alice is visiting. This book jumps around a lot, and it is difficult to keep track of who's who by the end. The second story, &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, was worse then the first one. It is once again in a dreamland of a world seen backwards from Alice's own world in the reflection of a mirror. When Alice enters this world, there are about two chapters before they enter the difficult analagy of telling the story through a game of chess. This is extremely hard to follow, seeing as you have to visualize the chessboard in your mind. Each seperate story takes place on a different tile while Alice is a pawn waiting to be Queened. In the end of the story, she is Queened and has tea with the other two queens, that is, the white and red queens. The dissapointing conclusion was that Alice was really in her world the whole time and her kittens were the queens in the story.

The author is very creative in this novel; she uses the literary element personifications through out the whole book. She does a very good job with this by how she portrays the character in the book, (ex: the Queen as a snob). Alice (the protagonist) starts off by following a white rabbit to a hole. This late and timid creature leads her into Wonderland. Wonderland is a place of creation and imagination. The dream like setting gives her the adventure, like a labyrinth. The fairytale like mood in the story gives a sense of fantasy, adventure as she meets and encounters many creatures of the dreamland world. She finds herself lost and goes along with what ever she comes across the unknown world. She finds herself with decisions and she has to make to get to one point to the other. I think that this story has really no point, its just nonsense of fairytale she tells to little kids. She even said that she told this during a trip to entertain three little girls. To me the story was a pointless adventure. Yes, she creates a great tone and mood for the setting yet the body of the story was boring to me.

With the bossy, dominant Red Queen and the quiet, kind, messy white queen, the book is a study in contrasts.The interweaving of the Nursery Rhyme Characters and the frequent fish poetry references does provide more continuity and a sense of sequential events than Alice's first adventure.

The author's use of language is extremely appealing to the younger readers. These young readers are attracted to this book because of the author's use of many songs. For instance the lullaby sung by the duchess to her child. The Mock Turtle also sang to Alice and the Gryphon a song about the Lobster Quadrille. The author also uses poems that are entertaining and fun to listen to. &quot;You are Old Father William&quot; is one of the many poems. Not only does the author use poems but she also uses commonly known poems and changes the words to fit the character saying them. For instance the Mad-Hatter sings Twinkle Twinkle Little Star in different words saying &quot;Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky.&quot; If this isn't a unique way of writing I dont know what is. Another style of her writingthat is appealing is when she creates a picture, using words in a poem, about the poem. Yhis is used on page 37. The words in the book are nbot hard so the book can be enjoyable when it is being read, not stressful. The author brings animals to life which is an interesting style of writing. This is Lewis Carroll's style of writing. The main character in this book is a little girl with blonde hair named Alice. This child is full of fantasies and dreams, which is what the book is about. Alice is very curious and likes to know every little detail. She thinks she is very smart. For example, when Alice is listening to the Dormouse's story she asks questions like &quot;What did they live on,&quot; and makes smart comments such as &quot;They could'nt have done that you know, they'd have been ill.&quot; She is also a little bit bratty, especially to the Dormouse when she says: &quot;Nobody asked your opinion.&quot; These characteristics pull together to make an interesting main character and to create a fabulous story. The theme of the story is sometimes you need to take a break out of every day life and dream of fantasize. This makes your life more interesting even if you dream about things that will never come true. Alice does this when she dreams about changing sizes and listening to talking animals. Dreaming doesn't hurt anyone except the people who don't do it. If nobody ever had dreams life would be extremely stressful and boring. The plot of the story is all about Alice trying to find the white rabbit, which of course is in her dream. Following the white rabbit takes ALice to interesting places, such as the Courtroom filled with animals, and the Duchess' house, along with meeting interestingpeople such as the Cheshire-Cat and the Queen. This amazing cat hes the ability to disappear whenever it wants to and it always smiles. In the end Alice finds the white rabbit and then wakes up from her dream. This is the plot of the story. The story is effective to the reader. This is so because after listening to such acreative dream and fantasy, it inspires people to take a little time out of the day and be creative and dream once in a while. All the parts of this five star story; the writer's style, the main character, the theme, and the plot; come together to create the overall effectiveness of the story. This is why I rated this book five stars."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"If you've ever wondered what this story was like, I encourage you to read it for your self.

I love that they are about imagination - it reminds us that everyone should exercise their imagination from time to time, even adults. After all, if no one used their imaginations there would never be any inventions (the White Knight in Through the Looking Glass is a grand inventor) or progress in the world, although you do have to watch out for the people who use their imaginations for evil. These books are also wonderful because in today's non-stop world we all need a break from reality in a place that is ridiculously nonsensical.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass are stories of a young girl named Alice who, as we find out at the end of each story, has fallen asleep and dreamed up fabulous lands, creatures, and exceptional nonsense. Although often printed together since the main character is the same little girl, they are actually two separate books written several years apart. They are set in two very different, yet equally ridiculous, places - Wonderland and a place simply called \\"Through the Looking Glass.\\" These books are classics because they have not only stood the test of time, but also because they can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Young people can enjoy them because they are so fantastically silly, and adults can appreciate Carroll's mastery of wordplay.I can't remember if I was in junior high or high school when I first read them, but as is the case with most classics that I read back then, I did not fully understand or appreciate them the way I do now. In going back and rereading them, I found them to be much more humorous than I did the first time around. They illustrate beautifully the reason why English is one of the most difficult languages to master. Part of the charm of the Alice stories is that the characters constantly miscommunicate with each other by using different meanings of words (the Cheshire Cat telling Alice about characters who are \\"mad\\" and meaning that they are crazy while she thinks he means that they are angry), different spellings of words (the mouse saying his \\"tale\\" is long and sad and Alice thinking his \\"tail\\" is long, but she can't understand why it is sad), or by the characters taking comments literally instead of figuratively (Alice complains to a frog that no one is answering the door and he wants to know what question the door asked).Unfortunately, like many classics the language that has made the Alice stories so funny is the same language that will keep many modern readers from enjoying them. Most classics were written in different ages and people talked differently back then. Words and phrases have come to mean different things, we use different slang, and our very patterns of using language have changed. There have also been huge changes in society that affect the way we read and understand. In the 19th century when the Alice books were written, people (especially those in the higher classes) were much more \\"proper\\" than we are today. They had strict rules of conduct which we see Alice struggling with throughout the books, especially since the people and animals she encounters in her imaginary worlds don't seem to be playing by the same rules that she is used to. This again is part of what makes the Alice stories so funny, but only if you \\"get\\" the joke.Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass are truly timeless classics that should be read and reread throughout a person's lifetime. Each time I read them, I find something that I overlooked before, keeping them both comfortingly familiar and surprisingly fresh. Alice is definitely a heroine that little girls can love, but boys might be hesitant to read these stories since they are about a little girl. They should, however, find the kings, knights, creatures, and fight scenes (you know, all the \\"boy stuff\\") appealing. Children will need a pared down, edited version that they can understand, and given the differences in language, junior high and high school students may need a \\"translated\\" version as well. At any age, the Alice stories are best enjoyed when read in the spirit that they were written - with the wonder and pleasure of childish imagination. After all, \\"Life, what is it but a dream?\\""},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"From the first to the last page, Lewis Carroll displayed his unique exposition of characters in order to convey his ideas of the world he wished to create for his readers. The main characters of this wonderful tale include: Alice, the White Queen and King, the Red Queen and King, the Gnat, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, the Lion, the Unicorn, and the White Knight. Alice, the protagonist, displays a sense of determination to be liked by the people in the Looking-Glass throughout the story despite the fact that the people hardly care for her. A character that ultimately disregards Alice's every word is the Red Queen, which is a strong, organized woman that is sure she is correct over everyone else. Quite the opposite, the White Queen is an unkempt, tentative woman, but helps Alice along her journey. Alice meets the Gnat on a train ride while he is whispering ideas of jokes in her ear to say to the other riders, yet his tepid disposition betrayed his sadness. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are just an odd pair of brothers that fight over meaningless things. Humpty Dumpty is an egg- shaped man that is simply rude to Alice and changes that meaning of all the words she asks him to define. A sweet, awkward, uncoordinated man, the White Knight, leads Alice to the end of her journey. A main conflict that Alice is forced to endure is her struggle to be accepted by the other creatures and people in the Looking-Glass. Another conflict is that Alice must travel through the land alone in order to achieve the rank of Queen. One plot action that helped lead up to the climax is when the Red Queen actually describes the path Alice must follow if she wishes to become Queen alongside herself and the White Queen. She told Alice that she was a Pawn on a chess board and she was to travel through eight squares, and also explained to her who or what is in each one; for example, she told her that she will meet Tweedledum and Tweedledee in the Fourth Square and in the Sixth Square she was to meet Humpty Dumpty. Another action that gradually leads to the climax of this tale is when the White Knight rescues Alice from the Red Knight and leads her to the Eight Square. Enthusiastically, the White Knight gibbers on about the new inventions he has created, and Alice is somewhat listening but is subconsciously waiting to arrive at her desired destination to finally experience her future, whatever or wherever it takes her.\\"Through the Looking- Glass\\" has the capacity to push your imagination to the level it was when you were a child, and that's what I loved the most about it. One of my favorite chapters in the book was \\"The Garden of Live Flowers\\", for the distinct personalities Carroll portrays for each flower was quite entertaining to read and it grasped my attention as did many of the other chapters. I also admired the idea of everything being backwards in the Looking-Glass world, and this was finely displayed in this chapter. \\"Humpty Dumpty\\" was another chapter that I enjoyed because I had a slight twist from the regular story I usually heard as a child. I was able to see the alternative view of a classic tale, and that was a pleasant change of perspective. Throughout the entire story, I also appreciated the diversity of the characters because their odd personalities come together to create a pleasurable read. With the Red Queen being rude and strong and the White Queen being benevolent and hesitant, Humpty Dumpty's character is uncaring but the White Knight's character is sweet and awkward , and Alice's determined personality is different from all else, this causes the readers to get hooked and interested in learning more. I would recommend this book to all children, teenagers, adults, and seniors because imagination has no age limit."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was the first book I can remember that truly thrilled me. I was very young when I picked it off a bookshelf at my grandparents' house almost at random. I was immediately drawn in: electrified, enthralled, amazed. I wanted more and more. This most recent trip through Wonderland was perhaps the second re-reading since then, and while I cannot ever again read it with the wonder of a small boy, I can still see why it captivated me. The wordplay; the games with logic; the agreeably disagreeable characters; Alice's mixture of confusion, curiosity, and determination--it was an irresistible combination. Some might think it is silly for a grown man to read a book like this, but it is certainly no sillier than for a grown man (and an Oxford don at that) to write one. And while Carroll's obsession with little girls, including photographing them naked or near-naked, is downright creepy now to an adult (something I didn't know about when I read his stories as a child) from a literary perspective it is easy to see how this fascination was channeled into giving his young friend Alice Liddell (his boss's daughter) a story to captivate her imagination by making her the primary character. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is the more engaging story, but the chess-themed Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There has some of the passages I remember most. There is the Red Queen running so fast with Alice that their running is more like flying, and pointing out to Alice that \\"it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place.\\" Then there is the White Queen in discussion with Alice about impossible things, informing her that \\"sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.\\" There are the appearances by Humpty Dumpty and by Tweedledum and Tweedledee (characters Carroll did not invent, but who play more than cameo roles in the story and provide occasions for some of the author's trademark logic and word games). And of course, \\"Jabberwocky,\\" a poem I can still recite from heart, comes from the looking-glass world. While they are perhaps not so magical to me as they once were, it was very pleasant to read these two stories again. They are nice for a diversion, a few linguistic gymnastics, and a return visit to a land that has set more than one person on a lifetime course of reading."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"I've read this book countless times.

It can be read and enjoyed by all ages, but I think the subtleties can be best enjoyed by those who are a bit older e.g. the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, the croquet game featuring the Queen of Hearts etc. I was reminded of how much the tea party reminded me of a previous job that I had involving a variety of board members.I guess there is only only one word to describe this classic, 'timeless'."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Classic Collection (Brilliance Audio))","review":"THIS IS A BOOK WICH ONE SHOULD ANALYSE FOR ONESELF!And NO, one cannot overanalyse this book, the symbols in it are like the branches of a tree.

So, it's probably not one you'll actually read from cover to cover unless you're an Anglophile like me.This volume by Chris Davies is not very long at 194 paperbacked pages. In roughly the first third, Chris writes short commentaries on a number of topics that serve to illustrate the differences in language and life styles between the US and UK: tips for the tourist (airport, hotel), practical information (automobiles, gas/petrol), technical information (plumbing, electricity), institutions/services (postal system, banks, currency, restaurants, bars, museums, theaters, school, government, shops, food, clothing), customs and etiquette, driving terminology (roads, road terms), punctuation, spelling, and idioms and expressions. These topics are sometimes accompanied by short lists of terms, provided in US and UK equivalents, to further illustrate whatever point he's making. Within a single topic, as under \\"customs and etiquette\\", his choice of sub-topics seems rather eclectic: phone manners, common conversational courtesy, church attendance, drive-ins and drive-throughs, utility bills, valet parking, window screens, air-conditioning, soda fountains, healthcare, sports, folklore monsters, and public and legal holidays.The majority of the book's pages comprise two long lists: a British-American lexicon, and an American-British lexicon.I suppose DIVIDED BY A COMMON LANGUAGE has a practical use, especially if you're a Yank visiting England for the first time, or a Brit going the other way, and you prefer to learn from printed material. I might have used such a reference before the first of my dozen trips across The Pond. (However, I'd rather learn by just immersing myself in the experience of being there.) For me, the principal merit of this book lies in its entertainment value, and the sheer delight of having my memories of England stimulated by the words and expressions one encounters there. Some of my favorites are: catseyes (reflecting highway lane markers), ice lolly (popsicle), full stop (period), dodgy (risky), crisps (potato chips), elevenses (morning tea break), plonk (cheap wine), The Tube (London subway), have a natter (shoot the breeze), bang on (right on), pull your socks up (try harder), spend a penny (use the bathroom), and wonky (unstable).[....]So, take a recce on (check out) this book. Perhaps when you're next in some remote English village, e.g. Twitchen, Splatt, Droop, Gweek, Upper Dicker, Briantspuddle or Barton In The Beans, and someone asks if you'd like some Spotted Dick, you'll know that it's a dessert and not an S.T.D.

Some British words have an ordinary meaning in American English that is quite different from their British meaning. For example, the British \\"marrow\\" is a \\"large zucchini.\\" For decades, I have been expecting to find beef marrow on my plate in England because of that misreading. I also thought that the British \\"paraffin\\" meant a petroleum-based wax as it does in the U.S., whereas it means \\"kerosene\\" in the U.K. In reading about someone going for paraffin in novels, I have been wondering what on earth they were going to make with all that wax. If you read this book, you will probably find your own examples of where you thought you knew what was going on . . . but really didn't. I suggest that you start with the British/American Lexicon to learn the most words with the least effort.The book also has a useful section on British and American phrases, that should help you avoid inadvertently saying what will be perceived as vulgarities across the pond. For example, refer to \\"retrieving and returning baseballs\\" rather than \\"shagging flies\\" (make your own guess as to what that means, but it isn't nice).In the vein of the potential for humorous miscommunications, there are a number of cartoons that show what John Bull and Uncle Sam are thinking about when the same word or phrase is said. \\"My wife loves pot plants, Sam\\" conjures up John Bull thinking about potted flowers while Uncle Sam imagines a garden full of marijuana plants.I found four weaknesses in the book that you should be aware of. First, the food equivalents aren't really very precise in some cases. So you may get some surprises. A scone and a biscuit are described as the same, which most of us would argue they are not. A burrito is described as meat and salad in a tortilla, while most would agree that it is as likely to have beans and cheese with sauce as it is to have meat and salad. Second, the book mostly focuses on the contemporary British language so it is less helpful than it might be if you are reading older British books. Third, the U.K. words more represent the usages of English people than they do on what you will encounter in Scotland or Wales. Fourth, some U.K. terms described here are actually in common usage (at least in the northeast and in California, the areas I know best) in the United States. \\"Pins and needles\\" is the way many Americans would describe the feeling of blood circulation returning to an limb that has gone numb, but is described as a British term here.I don't feel competent to review how helpful this book would be to a British person, so I will skip that perspective.The book covers how the languages came to diverge, tips for tourists, detailed information about important daily subjects (cars, telephones, plumbing, electricity, food, shopping, schools, sights, and measurements), etiquette, driving terminology, pronunciation, spelling, \\"what not to say,\\" idioms and expressions, and a U.K.-U.S. and a U.S.-U.K. lexicon. There's also some information about Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and South African variations.Good luck in explaining yourself to those in the U.K."},{"Title":"Divided by a Common Language","review":"I stumbled upon this book by accident. I don't believe the author meant this as an entertaining book, but a serious reference source for British and American travelers. Just by scanning the pages you can see how misunderstandings can occur even though we are speaking the same language. The example of &quot;Keep your pecker up&quot; in Brit is the same as &quot;Keep smiling&quot; on this side of the pond could certainly lead to some bizarre encounters. The author limits the work to common and current phrases, which makes the book manageable. Who would have know that Americans in Britain should wear a &quot;Bum Bag&quot; instead of a &quot;Fanny Pack&quot;.

The section of this book providing most humour is where the authour offers advice to Britons in America, and what common British expressions we should not say whilst in the States.

Christopher Davies goes very in depth, and gives some helpful advice for those stumped by the not-so-subtle differences in what is supposed to be the same language. The only downside to this reference is that it's near obvious that Davies learned his American in the South. There are a few phrases brought forward that I never heard until I'd move to Florida, and have never heard anywhere outside the South. Despite this, I'd recommend this book for those curious about linguistic differences, or someone considering relocating from one side of the pond to the other.To the Author: You've done wonderful research, however there is one GLARING mistake in this book (unless you were trying to make it &quot;family friendly&quot;. To flip someone the bird is actually to give them the middle finger, not to make a V sign. V sign is thepeace sign - a definite counter-gesture to the middle finger.Thank you for all your hours of hard work.

Offers specific phrases to use as alternatives in both American and British cultures. Written by a Brit who now lives in Florida, so it's nice to see the still-British-influenced language he uses in his narrations. And it's written for use in both cultures, not just geared to travelers from Britain traveling in America or vice-versa.I do think this book is perfect in combination with the book &quot;Brit-think Ameri-think&quot; by Jane Walmsley who is (as opposed to Davies) American born but now living in Britain. In her book, she offers the necessary complement to &quot;Divided&quot; by giving her readers a less technical, more anecdotal insight into the attitudes, habits and background of the two cultures (and she's humorous as well).On its own, this book is very technically good."},{"Title":"Divided by a Common Language","review":"This book was surprisingly funny. I expected a dry dictionary for referance and got a very well organized, pithy book that I read cover to cover just for the fun of it. I also plan to keep it for referance when I travel. Delightful and educational."},{"Title":"Divided by a Common Language","review":"The study of language and usage is a constantly evolving beast. Christopher Davies has taken a slice of usage and explained it to us with this book. Some common slang and colloquialisms from both countries are included.There are brief narratives about driving, schools, dining, etiquette, pronunciation and a host of other subjects. These are followed by lists of equivalent US/UK terms. There is also an extensive lexicon, along with idioms and expressions. These are listed American to British and British to American, just like a true translation dictionary.There are also numerous cautions about the use of certain terms which may be interpreted as vulgar depending on the country they are used in. Some of the &quot;translations&quot; are a bit humorous; &quot;pissed&quot; is considered vulgar in both countries, in the US it means &quot;furious,&quot; In the UK it means &quot;drunk.&quot; I guess I'd rather be pissed in the UK!Davies also explains mechanical differences in plumbing, electricity, telephone usage, currency, banking and postal service. These sections would be of greater interest to travelers than readers.Although it is difficult to label any dictionary in any language as absolutely complete and current, this one gets very close to the mark. Even Webster's is revised every few years! This is a good place to start matriculating the usages of the opposite country, if you plan travel, correspondence, reading or just watching TV. You may find hidden humor in works you have already read. If not, I'm sure you'll find some amusement just perusing the various sections of Davies book. At the very least, you'll have no excuse if you drop a clanger and blot your copybook on you next London holiday."},{"Title":"Divided by a Common Language","review":"This book provides some good information (and some not so good, too), but the problem it that the book is so poorly organized that it is utterly useless as a reference. The words are separated into arbitrary categories, and there is no overall index, so it is impossible to find any particular term without scanning many pages. The text also suffers from badly designed tables and amateur typography; for example, the author uses ALL CAPS both for ACRONYMS as well as TRADEMARKS (instead of simply including the \\"tm\\" symbol); the overall effect is just as irritating as in this sentence."},{"Title":"Divided by a Common Language","review":"Don't drop a clanger-make a big faux pas-when traveling in the U.K!

I showed some of the British words in the book to British people, and they told me they had not heard of them. And I had never heard of many of the American words.Of course, the book wasn't perfect, but it was still very helpful. And I realize that some of the mistakes could have something to do with regional dialects."},{"Title":"Divided by a Common Language","review":"Davies has the British American differences all sewn up in &quot;Divided by a Common Language&quot;.

Lots of good information in this book."},{"Title":"Divided by a Common Language","review":"\\"England and America are two countries divided by a common language.\\"-George Bernard Shaw, quoted on the Table of ContentsChristopher Davies has written a dictionary to bridge the divide. He begins by explaining: \\"... Most English speaking people are unaware of the vast differences between British and American English. This book is designed to enlighten the reader about these differences, and briefly explain how these differences came about. ... An estimated 4,000 words in everyday use in Britain, have a different meaning or are used differently in the U.S.\\"(p.1)This reader is not a linguist nor lexicographer, but I do read a lot. I have noticed, when reading British books, that my mid-western USA mind is sometimes totally befuddled. This handy-dandy British English-American English Dictionary is a great companion and fun to read! Written with wit and humor (or is that humour?) it also illuminates how the differences came to be:\\"The early settlers in the U.S. had no verbal contact with the folk they left behind in England, and the division of the language began. Over the years many Europeans settled in the U.S., bringing their languages with them. English remained the dominant language in America, though German was widely spoken in the 1800's. There were numerous French colonies, and New York was originally a Dutch settlement, called New Amsterdam. Each language left its mark on spoken English [this reviewer would here note that Native languages also enhance American English] ...Noah Webster, the well known American lexicographer, forecast in 1789 that eventually American English would be as different from British English as Dutch, Danish and Swedish are from German, or from each other.\\" p. 1-2But with improved transportation and communication, British and American English have remained close enough to cause confusion. In addition to essential cross lexicons, \\"Rules of the Road,\\" and cartoons with Uncle Sam speak vs. John Bull speak, Mr. Davies provides useful sections on words and phrases with different connotations that can get one in big trouble on the other side of the \\"pond.\\"And, finally, God Bless the Canadians, who have their own section in the book and an absolutely charming way of pronouncing the \\"out\\" sound. Eh? Listen to Peter Jennings."},{"Title":"Divided by a Common Language","review":"The book is largely a glossary - perhaps almost half - which doesn't exactly make for Interesting reading.

Also, shame on the publisher for the crappy formatting. I finished about 60% of it before giving up, and I normally eat this stuff up."},{"Title":"Divided by a Common Language","review":"This review is for the KINDLE edition in particular.While I found the content of the book itself a lot of fun to read and very interesting. . .It was absolutely horrible on the Kindle due to the many pages that contained lists of words comparing British English to American English.The print on these lists could not be magnified in any way, thus a lot of the information simply was impossible to read!If you're going to buy this, buy the print edition."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"I, like a lot of people, read this book after seeing &quot;Stone Reader.&quot; Basically, I wanted to know what kind of book would inspire such a great movie. The answer to that is complicated, but the upshot is that I enjoyed reading this book very much.The three parts of this book have very different styles from each other. The first part reads more like poetry than prose. There are rich descriptions that leave more of an impression rather than a telling. The second part focuses on dialog with much fewer descriptions. I found the dialogs to be very real. The third part uses out-of-time-line narrative, writings (including the start of a novel) by the main character, letters from other characters, and other techniques. The overall impression is that this novel is like James Joyce's Ulysses: a massive and well-constructed work. I am amazed that a first-time writer could create this book.As to the story, there can be no doubt that the main character has few redeeming values; he is difficult to like. He and his &quot;friends&quot; (does he really form any real relationships with anyone?) do many violent and vicious things to themselves and others. How can you like that? In some ways, though, Dawes Williams reminds me of Ignatius Reilly in &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;. Both characters are quite repulsive. Ignatius has none of Dawes' violent nature. Where Ignatius' life seems to always backfire on him, Dawes' life seems to result from Dawes' explicit attack on it. Repulsive, violent, vicious--what's to like about that?For me, though, I like the book. I find the construction and prose to be incredible. There is a wit and creativity behind this book I admire even if I don't admire the characters in it."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"Let me begin by saying that, had I discovered this book on my own, without Mark Moskowittz's STONE READER documentary, I would have been recommending it to every serious reader I know. I approached it with some reservation, expecting to find an overhyped work that had gone out of print for good reason, but I was utterly captivated within the first five pages. Fifty pages in, I was saying \\"Wow!\\"Dow Mossman's THE STONES OF SUMMER seems to attract a remarkable degree of vitriol from reviewers. Readers apparently either love it or hate it, perhaps somewhat the way people respond to modern art. It is surely a far from perfect work, but rather than pick nits about individual sentences and images, I found myself reading right through them, accepting them for the atmosphere they create as if I was reading poetry. For me, at least, the story flowed into a larger societal picture that resonated with the sense of betrayal and despair generated by the antiwar, counterculture movement of the late 1960's.THE STONES OF SUMMER is a remarkable first novel, and sadly, an apparently last novel as well. As past reviews suggest, it is also not everyone's cup of tea. This book is not a mindless summer read, nor is it a page-turning thriller. But readers whose tastes run to Saramago, Pynchon, DeLillo, Faulkner, or Garcia Marquez are likely to find Dow Mossman's book intriguing and enjoyable (if less polished), a deeply felt story wrapped in prose so exuberant, so manically transcendent, it practically leaps off the page and grabs you by the throat. Unlike so many popular works (Ludlum, Grisham, King, Cussler, Clancy, etc.) whose stories are as memorable as last week's hot dog, this is a book you will never forget.On its surface, THE STONES OF SUMMER tells the coming of age story of Iowa-born Dawes Oldham Williams (D.O.W.) in three segments. The first takes place when a precocious, eight year old Dawes visits his grandfather's racing greyhound farm during summer vacation, with flashbacks to Dawes' relationship and adventures with a troublemaking friend named Ronnie Crown. The second segment occurs 7-10 years later, during Dawes' rather wild and crazy high school years, ending in tragedy on his last night at home before college. The final section takes place another ten years later and finds Dawes on his way to, and living in, Mexico, still trying to cope with personal losses, hopelessness, and borderline schizophrenia.Each section of the book speaks in its own voice. The opening, 1949-1950 segment is densely written, filled with the soaring, spiraling imagery for which the book is best known. We are introduced to Dawes' ineffectual, Donna Reed mother and nearly as bland stepfather, a dark and imposing grandfather with a hair-trigger temper and dog-eat-dog temperament reminiscent of Joe McCarthy, and a sybil-like neighbor woman named Abigail Winas who raises chickens and all but reads their entrails. The second section, 1956-1961, is more chronologically told in somewhat more straightforward prose and dialog, suggesting the sexual and cultural revolution just then beginning. The final section, 1967-1968, is almost hallucinatory, filled with journal writings, letters, a short novel by Dawes, and a story line about sanity, drugs, Vietnam, and the sexual revolution.THE STONES OF SUMMER deals with the great American awakening from 1950 to 1968, culminating with the tragedy of the Vietnam War and the death of American innocence. It is a novel about personal identity and individuality, alienation, the role of history (both personal and national), and the relativity of truth. In the end, it is also a story of rebellion against tradition and cultural mores and the burdens falling upon those who rebel. The message is classic, the execution is powerful, the story is tragic. Writing in 1972, Mossman proved prescient about the absurdity of American culture and political values, going so far as to conjecture about the ridiculous notion of Ronald Reagan as a President! Dawes Williams would have laughed until he cried if he had seen what has come to pass with the Bush Administration's manufacturing of its own history with regard to Iraq: WMD's, toppling Saddam's statue, Jessica Lynch, the Thanksgiving turkey, \\"Mission Accomplished,\\" \\"We're making good progress. They all love us,\\" and the like. He had seen the enemy, and it was us. Aaatttssssss Dawes!There is certainly room for valid criticism of this book. The female characters lack depth, the prose is sometimes just too extravagant, the literary allusions lack subtlety, some of the dialog is pretentious to the point of self-parody, and the Huck Finn references (particularly Dawes having a girlfriend named Becky Thatcher) are overplayed. Yet despite these drawbacks, Dow Mossman masterfully captures America's own coming of age story in a way few authors have."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"The main character of The Stones of Summer is an amiable genius who accepts and accommodates (and in turn is accepted and accommodated by) a group of decent friends of average abilities with nicknames like \\"Dunker.\\"The novel is divided into three books. The first is artfully written even though it has some rough edges, especially in the first few pages. It tells the story of the main character's family going back multiple generations on his mother's side. The point of this book seems to be that genius runs in families and makes life interesting but doesn't necessarily solve problems. The book evokes a sense of loss and former (or near) grandeur, and even tragedy, that one normally associates with Fitzgerald or Faulkner. Some of the metaphors misfire, but there is a lyrical quality to the book that makes you feel you're in the presence of a shaman. The main character is only eight years old but converses with his elders as an equal. There is nothing surreal about this.The second book tells the story of the main character's adolescence. This book is raucously funny and has a Mark Twain quality about it. The cameraderie of the main character and his buddies embodies the best that adolescence has to offer; their feckless and reckless boyishness embodies the worst. The treatment of the main character's genius in this book is subtle, but consistent, and I wasn't surprised when the gang is playing pool and a folded piece of paper pulled from the main character's back pocket as he makes a bank shot turns out to be a sensitive poem that his friends ridicule without mercy, to the delight of the entire poolhall. Midway through this book, the narrator says of the main character, \\"He would always live here, in this place, among these stones, this grass. And he would always be locked up within, the knots of dreams.\\" Yet this book ends with a sense that the main character's destiny will be shaped by his genius and his shamanic insights and his poetry.The meaning of the second book doesn't really sink in until you're well into the third book, which reveals that the main character was only 12 when he was \\"insane for the first time. He never talked about it. No one knew. Because, you see, that was the first time he knew, as an absolute certainty, he had a soul as big and lovely as Jesus Christ. Also for the first time, he knew and felt the heavenly damnation of that burden, like being caught in the exact center of a baroque operetta, people singing and running off with exploding harps in every direction.... He stood, not believing civilization, yet wanting to come closer, as if he had just seen the Godhead itself rise up nameless and without need of a face, as if he must run and tell us about it now, quickly, before it vanished again into wherever it goes when it isn't here.\\" The main character's genius runs amok in this book, with serious consequences.This is a big book, nearly 600 pages, and it has enough flaws that it requires a certain amount of effort to steam through. Even so, I would put it on a par with A Confederacy of Dunces as a book of ideas and as the product of a Platonist genius. I would put it on a part with Look Homeward, Angel, as the work of someone observant of and intoxicated by the life within and without him. It is one of the most remarkable and most memorable first novels that I've ever read. Dow, you're lost and by the wind grieved. Come back again!"},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"If nothing else, this book seems to be a Rorschach for online reviewers. Here's my &quot;clear-headed&quot; take on it:The book was a chore for me, which I undertook mainly because of its reportedly transcendent possibilities. I was able to grit it out, partly not to be a quitter, but also because the journey kept flinging nuggets of brilliant invention in my path, intense images and perspectives that I found resonant and moving, well above my usual reading fare. FWIW, the author did convince me of his intellect (which I believe was one of his minor aims).In this very long book, I consistently sensed the author's attentive presence in every metaphor-dense line, and never once saw him lapse into mere typing. Finally, though, I suspect that all his unique and remarkable visions (the ones that reached me, anyway) could have been delivered in half as many pages."},{"Title":"The Stones of Summer: A Yeoman's Notes 1942-1969","review":"The Stones of Summer went down like a blood transfusion; hot! hot! hot! I laughed to see that some of the reviews were porking Mossman with the name of Proust: ironically, that's just what the Dawes' childhood friends would have said, little chuckleheads--- and they'd be wrong and Dawes loves 'em for trying. No, I saw every writer in this Writer: Mossman is Virginia Woolf, Miguel Angel Asturias, James Joyce, Cervantes, Mark Twain, Keri Hume (for me). This is great Midwestern literature. I feel I've been gifted with the reprint of this book, and I hope it never goes out of print again. Through the vehicles of wit, poetry, and brainstuff, the novel becomes in the end, a soul on paper. It is a must-read for all writers and serious readers.

I used to love the second section (coming of age), the best, but the first section has definitely grown on me. The third section is still too dark for me.I have read the book many times. I loved it when I was young. The style is quite original, but reminds me the most of Kesey, I guess (in Sometimes a Great Notion). Some parts are quite funny, and some are touching or tragic.
