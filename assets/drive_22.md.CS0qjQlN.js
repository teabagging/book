She just knows that her suburbanite cousin's death is too strange to be accidental. Callahan's search takes her on a convoluted trail from Patti's priest, who may have provided more than spiritual counsel, through Atlanta's inner city and into the shady deals of her cousin's newly prosperous husband.

The author was D.G. Sanders who worked 50 years for the Pennsylvania Railroad as a telegrapher and block operator. The book is being republished by his daughter and editor, Sandra Sanders Breuer. When Mr. Sanders began working for the Pennsy in 1915 at age 16 (he lied about his age), working for the railroad was like becoming an astronaut in a later age, he said. It was the most thrilling job you could have. The flavor of the book is suggested by some of the chapter titles: \\"Breaking in,\\" \\"Long Nights, Bright Days,\\" \\"The Wally Flyer,\\" \\"A Visit into Yesterday,\\" \\"High Jinks and Humor,\\" \\"Heroes and Goats,\\" \\"Pulling the Pin.\\" One of the most gripping chapters is the one in which Sanders was called as a potential witness in a murder trial.

Angry divisions on the right itself get less attention. Conservatism fills that gap. Across Europe and the US, a liberal right is at war with an illiberal right. As the leading force in politics, it is vital to understand the roots of the right's struggle with itself, how it stands and how it is likely to come out. From its early 19th-century origins to now, conservatism never finally settled on how far to compromise with liberalism, democracy and the capitalist world out of which both grew. By the late 19th century, the mainstream right had come to terms with all three. Its reward was lasting success in the next century and beyond. On the political fringes and among ethical-cultural critics, a recalcitrant right, unreconciled to liberal democracy, never died. Resistance to liberal democracy is seen today in the hard right, a strange but potent alliance of hyper-liberal globalists and anti-liberal localists. Conservatism focuses on an exemplary core of France, Britain, Germany and the United States. It describes the parties, politicians and thinkers of the right, bringing out strengths and weaknesses in conservative thought. An appendix includes definitions of leading terms, a brief account of conservatism's philosophical origins and mini-lives of more than 200 conservatives. Historical and topical, neither celebration nor caricature, Conservatism is a unique, panoramic survey of the Western world's dominant political tradition\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TO3eDwAAQBAJ&dq=Conservatism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ultimate X-Men Vol. 6: Return of The King","description":"Humanity now faces mutants, a mysterious sub-species that is gifted with strange and frightening powers.

This discovery marked him indelibly, and he resolved to follow a monastic path in order to be free for the 'one thing needful'. The word Advaita, which designates Vedantic non-dualism, is Sanskrit for 'non-dual' or 'not two'; but the doctrine itself is by no means exclusively Hindu, being present in Buddhism, Islam, Taoism, and Judaism. In Christianity it has always been more implicit, though explicit with writers such as Dionysius the Areopagite, Eriugena, Eckhart, and even Dante. The great merit of this work by 'a Monk of the West' is that it shows that non-dualism is neither pantheism nor monism, and that there is no incompatibility between orthodox Christian doctrine and the strictest understanding of non-dualism in the Advaita Vedanta. The implication is that non-dualism can again find expression within a Christian ambiance. The cover design helps clarify this. In the background is the Omkara, the sacred monosyllable of Hinduism, considered the most funadamental of affirmations. In the foreground is the Christian symbol of the Chi-Rho, chrismon, or labarum, consisting of the first two letters-chi (X) and rho (P)-of the Greek Christos, XRISTOS. This figure is intrinsically three-dimensional but is usually projected onto a plane surface. The cruciform Greek letter chi (X) is placed horizontally within a circle; it measures the parameters of a given world. The rho intersects the chi at its center and is placed vertically to represent the axis mundi or world tree. The loop at the top of the rho represents the Supernal Sun at the summit of the world tree, from which all possibilities of creation proceed and to which they return. There can be no essential, but only an apparent, incompatibiity between the Universe and any of its constituent parts; all derive from a unique and common Principle. Similarly, there be be no essential conflict between the Chi-Rho representing a given world and the Omkara which represents all worlds, the entire Universe, notwithstanding the differing degrees of universality. Christianity and the Doctrine of Non-Dualism offers one approach to this doctrine and to the greatest possible spiritual / intellectual adventure that is implied.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xfUpTCb_drgC&dq=Christianity+and+the+Doctrine+of+Non-Dualism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Twinkies Cookbook: An Inventive and Unexpected Recipe Collection from Hostess","description":"\\"The official Twinkies cookbook, with sweet and savory recipes from fans showcasing the many ingenious ways to cook with Twinkies\\"--Provided by publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q4gLjpiIh28C&dq=The+Twinkies+Cookbook:+An+Inventive+and+Unexpected+Recipe+Collection+from+Hostess&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spread of Islam (Hardcover Edition) (Turning Points in World History)","description":"A popular history of the Arab invasions that carved out an empire from Spain to China Today's Arab world was created at breathtaking speed.

Delving far deeper than previous sociologists have into the black Brazilian experience, Elizabeth Hordge-Freeman examines the relationship between racialization and the emotional life of a family. Based on interviews and a sixteen-month ethnography of ten working-class Brazilian families, this provocative work sheds light on how families simultaneously resist and reproduce racial hierarchies. Examining race and gender, Hordge-Freeman illustrates the privileges of whiteness by revealing how those with  blacker  features often experience material and emotional hardships. From parental ties, to sibling interactions, to extended family and romantic relationships, the chapters chart new territory by revealing the connection between proximity to whiteness and the distribution of affection within families. Hordge-Freeman also explores how black Brazilian families, particularly mothers, rely on diverse strategies that reproduce, negotiate, and resist racism. She frames efforts to modify racial features as sometimes reflecting internalized racism, and at other times as responding to material and emotional considerations. Contextualizing their strategies within broader narratives of the African diaspora, she examines how Salvador s inhabitants perceive the history of the slave trade itself in a city that is referred to as the  blackest  in Brazil. She argues that racial hierarchies may orchestrate family relationships in ways that reflect and reproduce racial inequality, but black Brazilian families actively negotiate these hierarchies to assert their citizenship and humanity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kBFmCgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Color+of+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mother Said: Poems","description":"Hal Sirowitz, the Poet Laureate of Queens, offers a funny and tender portrait of his father in this follow up to his acclaimed Mother Said and My Therapist Said.

The Swords of Lankhmar finds the city characteristically plagued by rats. Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser are in the employ of Glipkerio, the overlord, to guard a grain ship on its journey. Along the way, the rats onboard stage a rebellion and threaten to take the ship until a two-headed sea monster saves the day. If only there were two-headed sea monsters everywhere, Lankhmar would be safe, too. Alas, upon returning to the city, the two discover that Lankhmar is controlled by rats. It is a city known for its thieves and swine, but even the city s muddiest bottom feeders have never seen pillaging and plundering like this. And only the sorcerers Sheelba of the Eyeless Face and Ningauble of the Seven Eyes can scare this scourge. Mouser must shrink into the rat s world and Fafhrd must unleash the feared feline War Cats. Then the fun really begins. Before The Lord of the Rings took the world by storm, Leiber s fantastic but thoroughly flawed antiheroes, Fafhrd and Gray Mouser, adventured deep within the caves of Inner Earth, albeit a different one. They wondered and wandered to the edges of the Outer Sea, across the Land of Nehwon and throughout every nook and cranny of gothic Lankhmar, Nehwon s grandest and most mystically corrupt city. Lankhmar is Leiber s fully realized, vivid incarnation of urban decay and civilization s corroding effect on the human psyche. Drawing on themes from Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, and H. P. Lovecraft, master manipulator Fritz Leiber is a worldwide legend within the fantasy genre and actually coined the term Sword and Sorcery that describes the subgenre he helped create.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kqYoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SCENTED GARDENS FOR THE BLIND a Novel","description":"\\"Scented gardens for the blind ostensibly follows the members of the fractured Glace family, suffering from different forms of sensory deprivation - the daughter mute, the mother blind, the father estranged - yet each living in a vivid world of their own making.

After the United States seized Monterey in 1846, the U.S. Army began constructing Fort Mervine, which served a number of purposes until it was abandoned in 1866. In 1902-1903, a modern cantonment was built in the area. In 1904, the new post was officially renamed the Presidio of Monterey after a nearby Spanish fort established in 1770 that had fallen into disuse. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the post was home to infantry and cavalry regiments, as well as an inductee reception center. The Military Intelligence Service Language School was moved to the Presidio of Monterey in 1946 and renamed the Army Language School in 1947; this evolved into the present-day Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HTGDiKbfM4EC&dq=Presidio+of+Monterey+(CA)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Seasons","description":"Includes an exclusive EP as a companion to the book! John Oates was born at the perfect time, paralleling the birth of rock  n roll. Raised in a small Pennsylvania town, he was exposed to folk, blues, soul, and R&B.

John uncovers the grit and struggle it took to secure a recording contract with the legendary Atlantic Records and chronicles the artistic twists and turns that resulted in a DJ discovering an obscure album track that would become their first hit record. This is not your typical rock and roll story. John was focused creating great music.

Stevenson has collected over 2,600 reported cases of past-life memories of which 65 detailed reports have been published. Specific information from the children's memories has been collected and matched with the data of their claimed former identity, family, residence, and manner of death. Birthmarks or other physiological manifestations have been found to relate to experiences of the remembered past life, particularly violent death. Writing as a specialist in psychiatry and as a world-renowned scientific investigator of reported paranormal events, Stevenson asks us to suspend our Western tendencies to disbelieve in reincarnation and consider the reality of the burgeoning record of cases now available.

But exactly what is corporate leadership? Is it a CEO with a strong personality, one with strong management skills, one who has a combination of these traits--or something else entirely? What factors, in other words, make a powerfully effective corporate leader? In this era of increasingly fierce global competition few questions spark as much controversy and debate. Thus, in the summer of 1994, the authors of this book began traveling across North America, Europe, and Asia to interview the heads of more than 160 majormultinational corporations, in industries as diverse as entertainment, banking, diamond mining, and semiconductors. Their goal was the explore the role of the CEO--to discover how the men and women at the pinnacle of some of the world's most prominent companies fulfill their role as leaders. They came away not with abstract theories about management but with real stories about how CEOs actually spend their days, whom they see, where they go, which decisions they make, which they don't, and why. In the process, the authors uncovered new and provocative evidence that there exist five distinct styles of leadership. In Maximum Leadership they illustrate those styles--or \\"approaches,\\" as they call them--with vivid examples and the candid voices of CEOs at companies such as Coca-Cola, Gillette, Nintendo, Hewlett-Packard, Goldman Sachs, and Nestle. These executives and dozens of others tell fascinating, revealing, often funny and sometimes poignant stories about the challenges they face and how they have met them. Some are \\"human assets\\" leaders, running their companies by scrupulously managing hundreds of individuals and the relationships between them. Others are \\"box\\" leaders, who define their role as building the fortress of rules, regulations, and corporate culture that will guarantee their companies success. There are also strategic leaders, expertise champions, and change agents, each with their own unique qualities, priorities, and styles of managing, both day-to-day and over the long term. With these five approaches and the authors' cogent analyses of them, Maximum Leadership introduces a new vocabulary for understanding how companies are run to achieve their greatest potential and offers important insights for those inside the corporate office--and everyone whose career is impacted by what happens there.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1AkRBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hatwearer's Lesson","description":"A fast-paced and compassionate novel from the nationally bestselling author of Bebe's By Golly Wow Terri Mills has it all: good looks, a high-powered job as an attorney, plus a sexy and successful fianc .

Reveals new details about the life of the beloved of Jesus ? Illustrated with rare and unusual imagery depicting Mary s central role in Christianity ? Includes 60-minute CD of author discussing \\"The Greatest Story Never Told\\" ? By the author of the bestselling The Woman with the Alabaster Jar The controversy surrounding Mary Magdalene and her relationship to Jesus has gained widespread international interest since the publication of Dan Brown s novel The Da Vinci Code, which specifically cites Margaret Starbird s earlier works as a significant source. In Mary Magdalene, Bride in Exile Starbird examines the many faces of Mary Magdalene, from the historical woman who walked with Jesus in the villages of Judea to the mythic and symbolic Magdalene who is the archetype of the Sacred Feminine. Starbird reveals exciting new information about the woman who was the most intimate companion of Jesus and offers historical evidence that Mary was Jesus  forgotten bride. Expanding on the discussion of medieval art and lore introduced in her bestselling book The Woman with the Alabaster Jar, Starbird sifts through the layers of misidentification under which the story of the Lost Bride of Christ has been buried to reveal the slandered woman and the  exiled  feminine principle. She establishes the identity of the historical female disciple who was the favored first witness of the Resurrection and provides an interpretation of Mary s true role based on prophecy from the Hebrew scriptures and the testimony of the canonical gospels of Christianity. Balancing scholarly research with theological reflection, she takes readers deeper into the story and mythology of how Magdalene as the Bride embodies the soul s own journey in its eternal quest for reunion with the Divine.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eUtVKgAACAAJ&dq=Mary+Magdalene,+Bride+in+Exile&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Myths To Live By","description":"\\"There is no one quite like Joseph Campbell.

In Myths to Live by, Joseph Campbell explores the enduring power of the universal myths that influence our lives daily and examines the myth-making process from the primitive past to the immediate present, retuning always to the source from which all mythology springs: the creative imagination. Campbell stresses that the borders dividing the Earth have been shattered; that myths and religions have always followed the certain basic archetypes and are no longer exclusive to a single people, region, or religion. He shows how we must recognize their common denominators and allow this knowledge to be of use in fulfilling human potential everywhere.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fedlS2alp4IC&dq=Myths+To+Live+By&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Feathers in the Fire","description":"Davie Armstrong watched as his master, Angus McBain, thrashed young Molly Geary for refusing to name the man who had dishonoured her.

Every sixty-nine seconds, someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer s disease. Of the top ten killers, it is the only disease for which there is no cure or treatment. For most people, there is nothing that they can do to fight back. But one family is doing all they can. The DeMoe family has the most devastating form of the disease that there is: early onset Alzheimer s, an inherited genetic mutation that causes the disease in one hundred percent of cases, and has a fifty percent chance of being passed onto the next generation. Of the six DeMoe children whose father had it, five have inherited the gene; the sixth, daughter Karla, has inherited responsibility for all of them. But rather than give up in the face of such news, the DeMoes have agreed to spend their precious, abbreviated years as part of a worldwide study that could utterly change the landscape of Alzheimer s research and offers the brightest hope for future treatments and possibly a cure. Drawing from several years of in-depth research with this charming and upbeat family, journalist Niki Kapsambelis tells the story of Alzheimer s through the humanizing lens of these ordinary people made extraordinary by both their terrible circumstances and their bravery.  A compelling narrative and an educational and emotional chronicle  (Kirkus Reviews, starred review), their tale is intertwined with the dramatic narrative history of the disease, the cutting-edge research that brings us ever closer to a possible cure, and the accounts of the extraordinary doctors spearheading these groundbreaking studies. From the oil fields of North Dakota to the jungles of Colombia, this inspiring race against time redefines courage in the face of this most pervasive and mysterious disease.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8CKMDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Make Money with Your Camera (The New Photo Series, No. 2)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3XproDE-hp0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mermaid's Gaze, Vol. 3 (Mermaid Series)","description":"Partake of the mermaid's flesh, the legend says, and immortality is yours!

Burckhardt, Mill, and Tocqueville define one type of liberal thought. They share an aristocratic liberalism marked by distaste for the masses and the middle class, opposition to the commercial spirit, fear and contempt of mediocrity, and suspicion of the centralized state. Their fears are combined with an elevated ideal of human personality, an ideal which affirms modernity. All see their ideals threatened in the immediate future, and all hope to save European civilization from barbarism and militarism through some form of education, although all grow more pessimistic towards the end of their lives. Aristocratic Liberalism ignores the national boundaries that so often confine the history of political thought, and uses the perspective thus gained to establish a pan-European type of political thought. Going beyond Burckhardt, Mill, and Tocqueville, Aristocratic Liberalism argues for new ways of looking at nineteenth-century liberalism. It corrects many prevalent misconceptions about liberalism, and suggests new paths for arriving at a better understanding of the leading form of nineteenth-century political thought. The new Afterword by the author presents a novel description of liberal political language as the \\"discourse of capacity,\\" and suggests that this kind of language is the common denominator of all forms of European liberalism in the nineteenth century. Aristocratic Liberalism will be valuable to students of history, political science, sociology, and political philosophy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ufhADwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LAST LEGENDS OF EARTH","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L06ZnRhcISMC&dq=LAST+LEGENDS+OF+EARTH&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson","description":"The award-winning novelist shares her insights into the life of a major American poet as she explores the relationship between James Merrill and his long-time partner, David Jackson, and its influence on Merrill's acclaimed work. 12,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-RRbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Familiar+Spirits:+A+Memoir+of+James+Merrill+and+David+Jackson&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Easter book;: Illustrated by Robert Frankenberg","description":"The history and meaning of Easter and Lenten observances and customs in this and other countries, written by a Jesuit scholar.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d7U84B1DhVMC&dq=The+Easter+book%3B:+Illustrated+by+Robert+Frankenberg&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Biblical World View: An Apologetic","description":"Syllabus for a course taught at Logos School.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U0h6AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Biblical+World+View:+An+Apologetic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"French Verb Drills","description":"Master French verb conjugation without rote memorization and develop an instinct to select the right verb form without any hesitation, just like any native speaker.

In this book the visionary director and theorist offers a lucid, comprehensive exposition of the philosophy that underlies his work. It is a philosophy of paradoxes: We come to the theatre to find life, but that life must be different from the life we find outside. Actors have to prepare painstakingly yet be willing to sacrifice the results of their preparation. The director's most reliable tool may be his capacity to be bored. Brook illustrates these principles with anecdotes that span his entire career and that demonstrate his familiarity with Shakespeare, Chekhov, and the indigenous theatres of India and Iran. The result is an unparalleled look at what happens both onstage and behind the scenes, fresh in its insights and elegant in its prose.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kEy5QgAACAAJ&dq=The+Open+Door:+Thoughts+on+Acting+and+Theatre&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mind Program","description":"This text is designed for advanced Curriculum, Methods, and Issues courses in Early Childhood Education and Child and Family Studies departments.

Part detective story, part historical epic a bold and brilliant novel that imagines a plague taking over a fictional island in the Ottoman Empire. It is April 1900, in the Levant, on the imaginary island of Mingeria the twenty-ninth state of the Ottoman Empire located in the eastern Mediterranean between Crete and Cyprus. Half the population is Muslim, the other half are Orthodox Greeks, and tension is high between the two. When a plague arrives brought either by Muslim pilgrims returning from the Mecca, or by merchant vessels coming from Alexandria the island revolts. To stop the epidemic, the Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II sends his most accomplished quarantine expert to the island an Orthodox Christian. Some of the Muslims, including followers of a popular religious sect and its leader, Sheikh H, refuse to take precautions or respect the quarantine. And the sultan s expert is murdered. As the plague continues its rapid spread, the sultan sends a second doctor to the island, this time a Muslim, and strict quarantine measures are declared. But the incompetence of the island s governor and local administration and the people s refusal to respect the bans dooms the quarantine to failure, and the death count continues to rise. Faced with the danger that the plague might spread to the West and to Istanbul, the sultan bows to international pressure and allows foreign and Ottoman warships to blockade the island. Now the people of Mingeria are on their own, and they must find a way to defeat the plague themselves. Steeped in history and rife with suspense, Nights of Plague is an epic story set more than one hundred years ago with themes that feel remarkably contemporary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KltYEAAAQBAJ&dq=NIGHT+PLAGUE.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Central Europe","description":"A daring literary masterpiece and winner of the National Book Award In this magnificent work of fiction, acclaimed author William T.

The Redemptive Work: Railway and Nation in Ecuador, 18951930 examines local, regional, and national perspectives on the building of the railway and analyzes the contradictory processes of national incorporation. The elite landowners of the highlands were concerned with the transportation of their agricultural products to the coast, while the agro-export elite of the coast were more interested in forming a labor market. Because the underlying objectives were contradictory, only a partial consensus was reached on the nature of national development. The Redemptive Work is the first text to deal with these complex issues in Ecuador's history.

His behaviour mystified his friends and other witnesses, yet he never imagined he was ill. Instead, he rationalised his behaviour as a fight for spiritual freedom and made it the cornerstone of his heroic ideal, which was central to his work and to his life and his death. This fresh biographical study aims to explore neglected or misunderstood aspects of his private life to illuminate his writing, his affairs with women, his passion for Napoleon and his conflicted friendships with Coleridge and Shelley. This in turn leads to a new understanding of his masterpiece, Don Juan. 15 July 2019 marks the 200th anniversary of its first publication. Antony Peattie situates these patterns of behaviour in a vividly rendered contemporary world, culminating in Byron s last days in Greece, where he tried to starve himself into heroic leadership but damaged his constitution, resulting in his death at the age of thirty-six.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sTmIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark Heart (Dragonlance: The Meetings Sextet, Vol. 3)","description":"Obsession At long last, the story of the beautiful dark-hearted Kitiara Uth Matar.

Guerrilla Metaphysics makes the opposite assertion, challenging the dominant \\"philosophy of access\\" (both continental and analytic) that remains quarantined in discussions of language, perception, or literary texts. Philosophy needs a fresh resurgence of the things themselves not merely the words or appearances themselves. Once these themes are adapted to the needs of an object-oriented philosophy, what emerges is a brand new type of metaphysics a \\"guerrilla metaphysics.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XSVBAoScCBUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chase Is On (Desire)","description":"WHAT CHASE WESTMORELAND WANTED...

McWilliams considers the cultural, political and literary implications of adapting Enlightenment news of republican progress to a genre that had traditionally celebrated the greatness of warriors.

Drawing on recently declassified CIA documents, Jones deftly examines the train of missteps and self-deceptions that led to the invasion of U.S.-trained exiles at the Bay of Pigs. Ignoring warnings from the ambassador to Cuba, the Eisenhower administration put in motion an operation that proved nearly unstoppable even after the inauguration of John F. Kennedy. The CIA and Pentagon, meanwhile, both voiced confidence in the outcome of the invasion, especially after coordinating previous successful coups in Guatemala and Iran. And so the Kennedy administration launched the exile force toward its doom in Cochinos Bay on April 17, 1961. Jones gives a riveting account of the battle--and the confusion in the White House--before moving on to explore its implications. The Bay of Pigs, he writes, set the course of Kennedy's foreign policy. It was a humiliation for the administration that fueled fears of Communist domination and pushed Kennedy toward a hardline \\"cold warrior\\" stance. But at the same time, the failed attack left him deeply skeptical of CIA and military advisers and influenced his later actions during the Cuban missile crisis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9fofPDp9vMoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everything and the Moon","description":"It was indisputably love at first sight.

But offstage, she has battled incredible adversity. Struggling through a childhood of harsh family secrets, the death of a young sibling, and absent emotional support, Naomi found herself reluctantly married and an expectant mother at age seventeen. Four years later, she was a single mom of two, who survived being beaten and raped, and was abandoned without any financial support and nowhere to turn in Hollywood, CA. Naomi has always been a survivor: She put herself through nursing school to support her young daughters, then took a courageous chance by moving to Nashville to pursue their fantastic dream of careers in country music. Her leap of faith paid off, and Naomi and her daughter Wynonna became The Judds, soon ranking with country music's biggest stars, selling more than 20 million records and winning six Grammys. At the height of the singing duo's popularity, Naomi was given three years to live after being diagnosed with the previously incurable Hepatitis C. Miraculously, she overcame that too and was pronounced completely cured five years later. But Naomi was still to face her most desperate fight yet. After finishing a tour with Wynonna in 2011, she began a three-year battle with Severe Treatment Resistant Depression and anxiety. She suffered through frustrating and dangerous roller-coaster effects with antidepressants and other drugs, often terrifying therapies and, at her absolute lowest points, thoughts of suicide. But Naomi persevered once again.

In the vein of The Lovely Bones, this dual narrative is told through the voices of Todd in his afterlife and Georgia as she uncovers the truth behind his death, resulting in an immersive, emotional, and provocative read.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CQUeEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death by Fire","description":"The Indian village of Deorala in Rajasthan, the northwestern Indian state that borders Pakistan, is neither remote nor feudal in the strictest sense. A tarmac road links the population of 10,000 to neighboring villages and towns, there is running water and electricity, and the villagers have had television for more than twenty years. On September 4, 1987, Deorala found itself in the center of a furor that awoke age-old conflicts in Indian society. Before a crowd of several thousand people, mostly men, a young woman dressed in her bridal finery was burned alive on her husband's funeral pyre. The apparent revival of an ancient tradition opened old wounds in Indian society and focused world attention on the status and treatment of women in modern India. The ancient practice of sati -- the self-immolation of a woman on her husband's funeral pyre -- was outlawed by the British administration in India in 1829, and sati was widely believed to have died out. The fate of 18-year-old Roop Kanwar changed that perception. Mala Sen explores the reality of life and death for women in modern India in a study that is both illuminating and terrifying. The book is part journey through the India that the author knows and loves, and part exploration of the enigma that India still remains in the minds of many. Starting with Kanwar, Sen enters the worlds of three women: a goddess, a burned bride, and a woman accused of killing her daughter, and shows how, in this society in which ancient and modern apparently co-exist comfortably, there is increasingly cause for real alarm. She creates an image of a state in which political turmoil is constantly at the surface, and in which the role of women is constantly being redefined.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aG7nntWmhpMC&dq=Death+by+Fire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best Practice, Today's Standards for Teaching and Learning in America's Schools","description":"In this extensively revised and expanded second edition, we find updated descriptions of progressive teaching in six subject areas: reading, writing, mathematics, science, social studies, and the arts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kpycAAAAMAAJ&dq=Best+Practice,+Today%27s+Standards+for+Teaching+and+Learning+in+America%27s+Schools&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Samuel Taylor Coleridge Eman Poet Lib #18 (Everyman Poetry)","description":"The best of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poems in a beautiful new gift edition Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834) was educated at Christ's Hospital, London and Jesus College, Cambridge.

In this monumental and provocative history, Patrick Buchanan makes the case that, if not for the blunders of British statesmen Winston Churchill first among themthe horrors of two world wars and the Holocaust might have been avoided and the British Empire might never have collapsed into ruins. Half a century of murderous oppression of scores of millions under the iron boot of Communist tyranny might never have happened, and Europe s central role in world affairs might have been sustained for many generations. Among the British and Churchillian errors were: ? The secret decision of a tiny cabal in the inner Cabinet in 1906 to take Britain straight to war against Germany, should she invade France ? The vengeful Treaty of Versailles that mutilated Germany, leaving her bitter, betrayed, and receptive to the appeal of Adolf Hitler ? Britain s capitulation, at Churchill s urging, to American pressure to sever the Anglo-Japanese alliance, insulting and isolating Japan, pushing her onto the path of militarism and conquest ? The greatest mistake in British history: the unsolicited war guarantee to Poland of March 1939, ensuring the Second World War Certain to create controversy and spirited argument, Churchill, Hitler, and  the Unnecessary War  is a grand and bold insight into the historic failures of judgment that ended centuries of European rule and guaranteed a future no one who lived in that vanished world could ever have envisioned.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PYESsQRyIIMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With the Flow","description":"High school students embark on a crash course of friendship, female empowerment, and women's health issues in Lily Williams and Karen Schneemann's graphic novel Go With the Flow.

Introduced in Joseph Glass's widely praised first novel, Eyes, Susan is a renowned psychiatrist and criminal profiler for the Chicago Police Department whose uncanny gift of second sight has made her a celebrity among law enforcement professionals. However, Susan is increasingly reluctant to devote her psychic powers to the cause of tracking down criminals. Last time, her efforts led to the abduction and near death of her eight-year-old son. But when a young woman is found dead in a body bag in Chicago's Lincoln Park, Detective David Gold, Susan's longtime friend at the Chicago Police Department, once again calls upon her psychic powers. Traces of foreign blood and strange markings found on the body make one thing certain: a killing this ornate could only be the work of a deranged serial killer. They call him the Undertaker. Susan is quickly drawn in by the bizarre psychology of the killer, a man who preys on, and prays over, beautiful young women like a fanatic executioner. Plagued by psychic messages that allude to abortion, virginity, and seemingly random quotations from Romeo and Juliet, Susan scrambles for answers. When the best efforts of a determined police force fail to solve the riddle, Susan Shader's controversial gift may be the only way to stop the madman. Combining the disturbing imagery and virtuosic writing of Thomas Harris and the intricate plot twists of John le Carr , Joseph Glass catapults the suspense thriller to an entirely new dimension. In Blood, he has fashioned a relentless, masterly psychological drama that leads to a most unexpected and bone-chilling climax. And he has given us Susan Shader, a hauntingly appealing heroine we've definitely not seen the last of.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hHbQy1YkWSYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bluejackets' Manual","description":"For well over a century, this venerable book has been a mandatory part of every Sailor's sea bag.

Here the witty and insightful Indian spokesman turns his penetrating vision toward the disintegrating core of American society. Written at a time when the traditions of the formerly omnipotent Anglo-Saxon male were crumbling under the pressures of a changing world, Deloria's book interprets racial conflict, inflation, the ecological crisis, and power groups as symptoms rather than causes of the American malaise: \\"The glittering generalities and mythologies of American society no longer satisfy the need and desire to belong,\\" a theory as applicable today as it was in 1970. American Indian tribalism, according to Deloria, was positioned to act as America's salvation. Deloria proposes a uniquely Indian solution to the legacy of genocide, imperialism, capitalism, feudalism, and self-defeating liberalism: group identity and real community development, a kind of neo-tribalism. He also offers a fascinating cultural critique of the nascent \\"tribes\\" of the 1970s, indicting Chicanos, blacks, hippies, feminists, and others as misguided because they lacked comprehensive strategies and were led by stereotypes rather than an understanding of their uniqueness. Vine Deloria Jr. (Standing Rock Sioux, 1933-2005) was the author of more than twenty books, including Custer Died for Your Sins, Behind the Trail of Broken Treaties, and God Is Red.

These essays, which cover a wide range of time periods and geographical areas, but are united by the common question of what it means to 'Read Iberia', offer an invigorating critique of many of the critical assumptions shaping the study of Iberian languages and literatures. This volume offers a timely intervention into the debate about the current repositioning of language/literature disciplines within the UK university. Its intellectual starting point is the need for a committed and incisive re-evaluation of the role of literature and the way we teach and research it. The contributors address this issue from a diverse range of linguistic, cultural and theoretical backgrounds, drawing on both familiar and not-so-familiar texts and authors to question common reference points and critical assumptions. The volume offers not only a new and invigorating space for reimagining Iberian Studies from within, but also - through its commitment to interdisciplinary debate - an opportunity to raise the profile of Iberian Studies outside the community of academic Hispanists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BkXd0GgPPccC&dq=Un+tranva+en+SP+(Sprako+Tranbia)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Naked Eye","description":" Tawada s slender accounts of alienation achieve a remarkable potency.  Michael Porter, The New York Times A precocious Vietnamese high school student   known as the pupil with  the iron blouse  in Ho Chi Minh City is invited to an International Youth Conference in East Berlin. But, in East Berlin, as she is preparing to present her paper in Russian on  Vietnam as a Victim of American Imperialism,  she is abruptly kidnapped and taken to a small town in West Germany. After a strange spell of domestic-sexual boredom with her lover-abductor and though  the Berlin Wall was said to be more difficult to break through than the Great Wall of China    she escapes on a train to Moscow . . . but mistakenly arrives in Paris. Alone, broke, and in a completely foreign land, Anh (her false name) loses herself in the films of Catherine Deneuve as her real adventures begin. Dreamy, meditative, and filled with the gritty everyday perils of a person living somewhere without papers (at one point Anh is subjected to some vampire-like skin experiments), The Naked Eye is a novel that is as surprising as it is delightful each of the thirteen chapters titled after and framed by one of Deneuve s films.  As far as I was concerned,  the narrator says while watching Deneuve on the screen,  the only woman in the world was you, and so I did not exist.  By the time 1989 comes along and the Iron Curtain falls, story and viewer have morphed into the dislocating beauty of both dancer and dance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TWsZAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Common Oneness (A Study in the Book of Romans)","description":"This book starts by establishing that all believers in Christ are already, in fact, one with each other in Christ.

The first section explains why living consistently with our oneness is important, including God s commands and expectations, the benefits of living in oneness and the hazards of living contrary to the truth. Part two explains what oneness is and is not, including the concepts that oneness is a harmony of diverse believers each doing their own part, not unison, unanimity or strict conformity to the same mold.

Microbes are everywhere. In the air, in soil, in water, on our skin and hair, in our mouths and intestines, on and in the food we eat. They make the soil fertile; they clean up the environment; they change, often improve, our food; they make vitamins for us inside ourselves; some protect us from less desirable microbes. As 'germs', microbes are regarded as nasty, because a few can cause disease, a few can spoil food, a few can destroy valuable materials. Only when such misfortunes occur are most people conscious of microbes at all. Yet collectively, microbes present a fascinating world of invisible, or barely visible, creatures, which together encompass all the processes of which terrestrial life is capable; creatures which have had, and continue to have, profound effects on our lives and surroundings. In this book, John Postgate explains to ordinary non-scientist readers the impact this invisible community has on our everyday lives, and conveys the excitement microbes can generate in those who study them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MhhgQgAACAAJ&dq=Microbes+and+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire MECHANICA Structure Tutorial","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ED3jQQAACAAJ&dq=Pro/ENGINEER+Wildfire+MECHANICA+Structure+Tutorial&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Authentic Metaphysics in an Age of Unreality","description":"In an age where appearances are often substituted for what really is, deception and falsity for honesty and truth, this metaphysics book takes things 'as they actually are' and discovers that reality 'is' actuality (which as subsistent is God), that philosophical knowledge in its content is caused by what is known and is objectively true.

From the discovery of the Sound in 1614, to the adventures of Captain Kidd, to the sinking of the Lexington in the sound in 1840, the Long Island Sound also holds a unique place in American history. The Long Island Sound traces the growth of fishing and shipbuilding villages along the sound to the development of major industrial ports, resort towns, and suburban communities along the sound. Marilyn Weigold discusses the subsequent overcrowding and pollution that resulted from this prosperity and expansion. Originally published in 1974 as The American Mediterranean and long out of print, The Long Island Sound has been updated by the author with a new preface and final chapter describing the Sound in the twenty-first century. In this new edition, Weigold particularly focuses on environmental concerns, and describes more current milestones, like the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, who fought and won in 1995 to set aside 100,000 acres as NY State's first forest preserve; the continuous construction of the Long Island Expressway, with its forty-one miles of HOV lanes; the attempt made by several of Connecticut's coastal cities to reinvigorate urban redevelopment; and the Long Island Sound Study's investigation of toxic substances both natural and man-made which continue to contaminate the waterway. Through over 40 stunning photographs and many fascinating stories, The Long Island Sound tells the history of a vastly populated, but underdiscussed, part of America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z6yE6mWZUcYC&dq=Where+to+go,+what+to+do,+how+to+do+it+on+Long+Island+Sound&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Routledge Dutch Dictionary (Routledge Bilingual Dictionaries)","description":"\\"This comprehensive and contemporary two-way dictionary is ideal for Dutch language learners and users at all levels.

Psychologists and neuroscientists refer to these distinctly human foibles, biases, and thinking traps as  cognitive errors.  Cognitive errors are systematic deviances from rationality, from optimized, logical, rational thinking and behavior. We make these errors all the time, in all sorts of situations, for problems big and small: whether to choose the apple or the cupcake; whether to keep retirement funds in the stock market when the Dow tanks, or whether to take the advice of a friend over a stranger. The  behavioral turn  in neuroscience and economics in the past twenty years has increased our understanding of how we think and how we make decisions. It shows how systematic errors mar our thinking and under which conditions our thought processes work best and worst. Evolutionary psychology delivers convincing theories about why our thinking is, in fact, marred. The neurosciences can pinpoint with increasing precision what exactly happens when we think clearly and when we don t. Drawing on this wide body of research, The Art of Thinking Clearly is an entertaining presentation of these known systematic thinking errors--offering guidance and insight into everything why you shouldn t accept a free drink to why you SHOULD walk out of a movie you don t like it to why it s so hard to predict the future to why shouldn t watch the news. The book is organized into 100 short chapters, each covering a single cognitive error, bias, or heuristic. Examples of these concepts include: Reciprocity, Confirmation Bias, The It-Gets-Better-Before-It-Gets-Worse Trap, and the Man-With-A-Hammer Tendency. In engaging prose and with real-world examples and anecdotes, The Art of Thinking Clearly helps solve the puzzle of human reasoning.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5VYAAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leadership on the Line: Staying Alive through the Dangers of Leading","description":"Every day, in every facet of our lives, opportunities to lead call out to us. At work and at home, in our local communities and in the global village, the chance to make a difference beckons. Yet often, we hesitate. For all its passion and promise, for all its excitement and rewards, leading is risky, dangerous work. Why? Because real leadership-the kind that surfaces conflict, challenges long-held beliefs, and demands new ways of doing things-causes pain. And when people feel threatened, they take aim at the person pushing for change. As a result, leaders often get hurt both personally and professionally. In Leadership on the Line , renowned leadership authorities Ronald A. Heifetz and Marty Linsky marshal a half century of combined teaching and consulting experience to show that it is possible to put ourselves on the line, respond effectively to the risks, and live to celebrate our efforts. With compelling examples including the presidents of countries and the presidents of organizations, everyday managers and prominent activists, politicians and parents, the authors illustrate proven strategies for surviving and thriving amidst the dangers of leading: \\"Getting on the balcony\\": stepping back to get perspective while remaining fiercely engaged \\"Thinking politically\\": keeping the opposition close, but watching your allies, too \\"Orchestrating the conflict\\": using stress productively to work the issues \\"Giving the work back\\": putting the responsibility on those who need to make the change \\"Holding steady\\": maintaining your focus while taking the heat The authors also address often-neglected aspects of leadership, such as how to manage your personal vulnerabilities, and how to anchor yourself and sustain your spirit through tough times. Both uplifting and practical, this essential book enables each of us to lead courageously and confidently-without losing ourselves. AUTHORBIO: Ronald A. Heifetz and Marty Linsky are on the faculty at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Heifetz is the author of Leadership Without Easy Answers and Co-director of the school's Center for Public Leadership. Linsky is Faculty Chair of many of the school's executive programs, including Senior Officials in State and Local Government and Leadership for the 21st Century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c3mYE7jNvn0C&dq=Leadership+on+the+Line:+Staying+Alive+through+the+Dangers+of+Leading&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mind Wizards of Callisto","description":"Jandar is taken from his airship by the cannibalistic Zarkoon bird-men while leading his aerial armada to an attack on the city of Kuur.

To shift those pounds quickly you simply need to start the day with bacon and eggs, snack on chunks of cheese and a variety of fish or meats, top coffee with cream and feast on steaks fried in butter or lobster. Not exactly the typical foods you'd find on the shopping lists of most slimmers who've grown up with the idea that a low-fat diet is the best way to lose weight. But like all things that sound too good to be true, there''s a catch. And in the case of the famous Stillman's diet, it means that filling up on high-fat foods needs to be balanced by giving up most carbs including bread, potatoes, pasta, rice, chocolate, crisps, biscuits, cake -- even fruit, milk and some veg's. But you never feel hungry and it's an enjoyable and satisfying and more importantly a safe and effective weight loss plan. ONE POUND A DAY guaranteed just follow the diet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4JX0pwAACAAJ&dq=The+doctor%27s+quick+inches-off+diet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"School Mobbing and Emotional Abuse","description":"First Published in 2003.

Davis's elegant combination of prose and verse allows the poetry of the Shahnameh to sing its own tales directly, interspersed sparingly with clearly marked explanations to ease along modern readers. Originally composed for the Samanid princes of Khorasan in the tenth century, the Shahnameh is among the greatest works of world literature. This prodigious narrative tells the story of pre-Islamic Persia, from the mythical creation of the world and the dawn of Persian civilization through the seventh-century Arab conquest. The stories of the Shahnameh are deeply embedded in Persian culture and beyond, as attested by their appearance in such works as The Kite Runner and the love poems of Rumi and Hafez.

That includes the fighters brave enough to stand alone, across the ring from the greatest heavyweight champion of all time. Ali's own story has been told again and again, but the stories of those who faced him have, by and large, been ignored. For each, the moments alone with Ali changed their careers, changed their lives, and affected them for ever. Facing Ali tells the story of fifteen men from around the world, from famous names like Joe Frazier, Joe Bugner, George Foreman and Henry Cooper to lesser lights like Tunney Hunsaker and Jurgen Blin. Each man, many for the first time, tell their stories in their own words. With an updated introduction from author Stephen Brunt following Ali's death, the resulting book offers a unique perspective on what it was really like to fight him, and gives insights into the character of the most famous man on the planet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xX8QMQAACAAJ&dq=Facing+Ali:+15+Fighters+/+15+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Working with Analogical Semantics: Disambiguation Techniques in DLT","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SUK0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Driven Patriot: The Life and Times of James Forrestal (Bluejacket Books)","description":"The World War II American secretary of the navy and later Cold War strategist is reveals as a brilliant but troubled man in this hard-hitting biography of a great American.

Brian Garfield, a novelist and screenwriter whose works have sold some 20 million copies, was searching for a new subject when he came upon the story of this \\"forgotten war\\" in Alaska. He found the history of the brave men who had served in the Aleutians so compelling and so little known that he wrote the first full-length history of the Aleutian campaign, and the book remains a favorite among Alaskans. The war in the Aleutians was fought in some of the worst climatic conditions on earth for men, ships, and airplanes. The sea was rough, the islands craggy and unwelcoming, and enemy number one was always the weather--the savage wind, fog, and rain of the Aleutian chain. The fog seemed to reach even into the minds of the military commanders on both sides, as they directed men into situations that so often had tragic results. Frustrating, befuddling, and still the subject of debate, the Aleutian campaign nevertheless marked an important turn of the war in favor of the United States. Now, half a century after the war ended, more of the fog has been lifted. In the updated University of Alaska Press edition, Garfield supplements his original account, which was drawn from statistics, personal interviews, letters, and diaries, with more recently declassified photographs and many more illustrations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qQLcwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Thousand-Mile+War+:+World+War+II+in+Alaska+and+the+Aleutians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 4-minute neurologic exam: An answer to the \\"Neuro WNL\\" problem","description":"A rapid approach to neurologic assessment when time is limited.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2-cUQAAACAAJ&dq=The+4-minute+neurologic+exam:+An+answer+to+the+%22Neuro+WNL%22+problem&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Veiled Half-Truths: Western Travelers' Perception of Middle Eastern Women","description":"This book examines the way in which Middle Eastern women were regarded by European travellers of the late-19th and early-20th centuries.

An exquisite novel... His sovereignty is over the invisible and the timeless. Mr. Shishkin traces this sad story with great beauty and finesse.\\" In The Light and the Dark Shishkin has created an evocative love story of two young lovers, Vladimir, a solider flighting the Boxer Rebellion, and Alexandra. Known fondly to each other as Vovka and Sashka, the two young lovers sustain their love by writing passionate letters to each other. But as their correspondence continues, it becomes clear that the couple's separation is chronological as well as geographical--that their extraordinary romance is actually created out of, as well as kept alive by, their yearning epistolary exchange, which defies not only space but time. With this contrapuntal literary testament to the delirious, transcendent power of love, Mikhail Shishkin--the most celebrated Russian author of his generation--has created a masterpiece of modern fiction.

Mark Abley explores what the human family stands to lose   and explains why some endangered languages continue to thrive. Within the next couple of generations, most of the world s 6000 languages will vanish, due mainly to the unstoppable tide of English. With an open mind and a well-worn passport, award-winning journalist and poet Mark Abley tells entertaining and vital stories about why languages matter. From Oklahoma to Provence, aboriginal Australia to Baffin Island, the cultures are radically different, but the problems of shrinking linguistic and cultural richness are painfully similar. Abley s investigation provides a stunning glimpse of the beauty and intricacies of languages like Yiddish and Yuchi, Mohawk and Manx, Inuktitut and Proven?al. More importantly, it offers a sympathetic and memorable portrait of the people who still speak languages under threat. When a language dies out, gone too are stories that have been told for centuries, unique ways of seeing the world, and perhaps even ways of solving problems both large and small. Abley believes we must see languages as abundant sources of richness, wonder and usefulness. And he shows that hope still exists: that the determination of even one person can revive a whole language and its culture, in the process creating something new, changing and alive   exactly what languages do best.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oyyyybR6RmwC&dq=SPOKEN+HERE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Testament in Modern English, STUDENT Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iW1r9vH9MNgC&dq=The+New+Testament+in+Modern+English,+STUDENT+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nestle 125 Years 1866 1991","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=57vVtwEACAAJ&dq=Nestle+125+Years+1866+1991&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sewing Projects in an Afternoon","description":"This book includes basic information you need to know in order to sew almost anything.

Edward White concludes his sweeping history of law in America, from the colonial era to the near-present. Picking up where his previous volume left off, at the end of the 1920s, White turns his attention to modern developments in both public and private law. One of his findings is that despite the massive changes in American society since the New Deal, some of the landmark constitutional decisions from that period remain salient today. An illustration is the Court's sweeping interpretation of the reach of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause in Wickard v. Filburn (1942), a decision that figured prominently in the Supreme Court's recent decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act. In these formative years of modern American jurisprudence, courts responded to, and affected, the emerging role of the state and federal governments as regulatory and redistributive institutions and the growing participation of the United States in world affairs. They extended their reach into domains they had mostly ignored: foreign policy, executive power, criminal procedure, and the rights of speech, sexuality, and voting. Today, the United States continues to grapple with changing legal issues in each of those domains. Law in American History, Volume III provides an authoritative introduction to how modern American jurisprudence emerged and evolved of the course of the twentieth century, and the impact of law on every major feature of American life in that century. White's two preceding volumes and this one constitute a definitive treatment of the role of law in American history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3t6RDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Indy: Seventy-Five Years of Racing's Greatest Spectacle","description":"Chronicles the complete history of the Indianapolis 500, marks its seventy-fifth anniversary in 1991, and includes information on cars, drivers, and track records","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4ANhGwAACAAJ&dq=Indy:+Seventy-Five+Years+of+Racing%27s+Greatest+Spectacle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the Black Hawk war;: A reprint of the 1st edition, 1834; with thirteen photogravure illustrations, and preface and notes,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BSJinQEACAAJ&dq=History+of+the+Black+Hawk+war%3B:+A+reprint+of+the+1st+edition,+1834%3B+with+thirteen+photogravure+illustrations,+and+preface+and+notes,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy (Human Evolution, Behavior, and Intelligence)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Second Coming of Curly Red","description":"The Liar's Club meets Fried Green Tomatoes in The Second Coming Of Curly Red, a heartwarming, feisty novel about the transformative power of love.

It is deceptively simple yet the number system which philosophers, logicians and many linguists take as the norm - namely the distinction between singular and plural (as in cat versus cats) - is only one of a wide range of possibilities to be found in languages around the world. Some languages, for instance, make more distinctions than English, having three, four or even five different values. Adopting a wide-ranging perspective, Greville Corbett draws on examples from many languages to analyse the possible systems of number. He reveals that the means for signalling number are remarkably varied and are put to a surprising range of special additional uses. By surveying some of the riches of the world s linguistic resources this book makes a major contribution to the typology of categories and demonstrates that languages are much more varied than is generally recognised.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7jc-pgAFcE0C&dq=Number+(Cambridge+Textbooks+in+Linguistics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dancing With Siva: Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism: An illustrated sourcebook, timeline and lexicon exploring how to know the Divine, honor all creation and see God everywhere, in everyone","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QLlAAQAAIAAJ&dq=Dancing+With+Siva:+Hinduism%27s+Contemporary+Catechism:+An+illustrated+sourcebook,+timeline+and+lexicon+exploring+how+to+know+the+Divine,+honor+all+creation+and+see+God+everywhere,+in+everyone&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Objection!: How High-Priced Defense Attorneys, Celebrity Defendants, and a 24/7 Media Have Hijacked Our Criminal","description":"Court TV host Nancy Grace presents her case in this behind-the-scenes look at the high-profile cases everyone is talking about ancy Grace is a name millions of Americans recognize from her regular appearances on Court TV and Larry King Live.

First, that effective preaching without a manuscript is not a matter of talent as much as it is a matter of preparation.

Throughout the book, the author offers specific examples including a transcript of a sermon preached without manuscript or notes. Second, that the payoff of learning to preach without a manuscript is nothing less than sermons that more effectively and engagingly give witness to the good news.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EBgqXrgObHMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fields of Fire","description":" Few writers since Stephen Crane have portrayed men at war with such a ring of steely truth.  The Houston Post With a new introduction by the author for the book s 40th anniversary. They each had their reasons for joining the Marines. They each had their illusions. Goodrich came from Harvard. Snake got the tattoo  Death Before Dishonor  before he got the uniform. And Hodges was haunted by the ghosts of family heroes. They were three young men from different worlds, plunged into a white-hot, murderous realm of jungle warfare as it was fought by one Marine platoon in the An Hoa Basin, 1969. They had no way of knowing what awaited them. Nothing could have prepared them for the madness to come. And in the heat and horror of battle they took on new identities, took on each other, and were each reborn in fields of fire. Fields of Fire is James Webb s classic novel of the Vietnam War, a novel of poetic power, razor-sharp observation, and agonizing human truths seen through the prism of nonstop combat. Weaving together a cast of vivid characters, Fields of Fire captures the journey of unformed men through a man-made hell until each man finds his fate. Praise for Fields of Fire  A stunner . . . Webb gives us an extraordinary range of acutely observed people, not one a stereotype, and as many different ways of looking at that miserable war.  Newsweek  A novel of such fullness and impact, one is tempted to compare it to Norman Mailer s The Naked and the Dead.  The Oregonian  Webb s book has the unmistakable sound of truth acquired the hard way. His men hate the war; it is a lethal fact cut adrift from personal sense. Yet they understand that its profound insanity, its blood and oblivion, have in some way made them fall in love with battle and with each other.

In his classic exploration of the obscurities and contradictions in the major versions of this legend, Roger Sherman Loomis shows how the Grail, once a Celtic vessel of plenty, evolved into the Christian Grail with miraculous powers. Loomis bases his argument on historical examples involving the major motifs and characters in the legends, beginning with the Arthurian legend recounted in the 1180 French poem by Chrtien de Troyes. The principal texts fall into two classes: those that relate the adventures of the knights in King Arthur's time and those that account for the Grail's removal from the Holy Land to Britain. Written with verve and wit, Loomis's book builds suspense as he proceeds from one puzzle to the next in revealing the meaning behind the Grail and its legends.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=of9ZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Summer Afternoon and Other Stories: And Other Stories","description":"A new collection of short stories by the author of Accidents in the Home explores the various undercurrents that lie hidden inside domestic relationships despite efforts to preserve the facade of a loving and stable family life.

From D-Day to the Battle of the Bulge, through reconnaissance missions and combat, fighting flying bombs and Me 262 Stormbird jets, P-51 Mustang pilots saw it all during World War II. P-51 Mustang celebrates the 75th anniversary of the most iconic American warbird written by Cory Graff, lead curator at the Flying Heritage Collection--one of the world's most important collections and sites for warbird restoration. The entire story of this plane is here, starting with the astonishing fact that the P-51 Mustang was built in less than 120 days. This first version was hardly a world-beater, and it took the addition of a Rolls-Royce-designed Merlin to make the Mustang a legend. These nimble and versatile fighters were able to escort Allied heavy bombers all the way to Berlin and back. In the Pacific, their long-range ability was pushed to its limit, with pilots flying 1,500-mile, eight-or-more-hour missions over water to attack Tokyo. On the home front, Graff profiles the impact manufacturing Mustangs had on workers in Los Angeles and Dallas. The United States wasn't finished with the P-51 Mustang after World War II. It was used in the Korean War and, afterwards, as a symbol and icon of American ingenuity. Graff explores the post-World War II history of this iconic plane, making this a book that every single World War II, history, and aviation enthusiast will want to buy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AZeOCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mad Shambles","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Two little savages: Being the adventures of two boys who lived as Indians and what they learned : with over two hundred drawings","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=orgqAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Four Comedies (A Midsummer Night's Dream; As You Like It; Twelfth Night; The Tempest)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DVoqtwAACAAJ&dq=Four+Comedies+(A+Midsummer+Night%27s+Dream%3B+As+You+Like+It%3B+Twelfth+Night%3B+The+Tempest)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the White Republic: Class Politics and Mass Culture in Nineteenth Century America (The Haymarket Series)","description":"Saxton asks why white racism remained an ideological force in America long after the need to justify slavery and Western conquest had disappeared.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GiAJEtgCQ9UC&dq=The+Rise+and+Fall+of+the+White+Republic:+Class+Politics+and+Mass+Culture+in+Nineteenth+Century+America+(The+Haymarket+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elemental Threat","description":"Robert Botkin pursues the people and motives behind a massive explosion on a Montana Indian Reservation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CSgPAAAACAAJ&dq=Elemental+Threat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Formula For Life: The Ultimate Sourcebook On Nutritional Supplements, Healthy Diet, Disease Prevention, And Longevity","description":"With all new and updated information, Formula for Life is the ultimate guide to nutrition, disease prevention, and life-extension strategies -- as well as an important companion to any traditional medical treatment.

Accordingly, debate has raged over how to rectify this situation. Should the government increase funding, encourage privatisation, some of both? Another option, though, has emerged and is seemingly gaining popularity -- home schooling. Citing both substandard education and displeasure with school environments and curricula, many parents have decided to teach their own children. Supporters say it is well within their rights to raise their children as they see fit and that at-home learning is superior to the public system. Detractors claim that home-schooled children are deprived of social interaction and the broad-based education provided by the system. Neither side wants to cede ground, making the issue of home schooling an integral part of a wider national debate on education. In this book, the specific topic of home schooling is presented from all relevant sides to give a complete picture of the present status of the issue and its potential for future resolution. Following this overview is a thorough and carefully selected bibliography of literature about home schooling from all viewpoints. Easy access to his important resource is then provided via author, title, and subject indexes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=haRAVpYjQQ8C&dq=Should+I+Home+School%3F:+How+to+Decide+What%27s+Right+for+You&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trout Streams of Northern New England: A Guide to the Best Fly-Fishing in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, First Edition","description":"Describes over 100 trout-water streams and rivers in New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine, and provides maps, access directions, and suggestions for effective trout-fishing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XUHbHAAACAAJ&dq=Trout+Streams+of+Northern+New+England:+A+Guide+to+the+Best+Fly-Fishing+in+Vermont,+New+Hampshire,+and+Maine,+First+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adobe(R) Photoshop(R) 7 One Click Wow!","description":"Explains how to use one-click techniques to enhance photographs, covering such topics as layers, scaling, frames, film grain, texture, patterns, and shadows.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XVMzDaR2fuoC&dq=Adobe(R)+Photoshop(R)+7+One+Click+Wow!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tipton's Crew","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZkHrAAAACAAJ&dq=Tipton%27s+Crew&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Look About You: a Magical Childhood in Michigan's Wild Places","description":"A portion of all sales benefit three northern Michigan land conservancies","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q0uKAAAACAAJ&dq=Look+About+You:+a+Magical+Childhood+in+Michigan%27s+Wild+Places&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Young Titan","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Someone Had Blundered: The Story of the End of the Battleship Era with the Sinking of the Replulse and the Prince of Wales","description":"In late 1941, war was looming with Japan, and Britain's empire in southeast Asia was at risk. The British government decided to send Force Z, which included the state-of-the-art battleship Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser Repulse, to bolster the naval defences of Singapore, and provide a mighty naval deterrent to Japanese aggression. These two powerful ships arrived in Singapore on 2 December - five days before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. But crucially, they lacked air cover. On 9 December Japanese scout planes detected Force Z's approach in the Gulf of Thailand. Unlike at Pearl Harbor, battleships at sea could manoeuvre, and their anti-aircraft defences were ready. But it did no good. The Japanese dive-bombers and torpedo-bombers were the most advanced in the world, and the battle was one-sided. Strategically, the loss of Force Z was a colossal disaster for the British, and one that effectively marked the end of its empire in the East. But even more importantly, the sinking marked the last time that battleships were considered to be the masters of the ocean. From that day on, air power rather than big guns would be the deciding factor in naval warfare.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P7wAEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vengeance of the Dancing Gods","description":"Master wizard Throckmorton P.

As the point of convergence of the tectonic plates, flora and fauna of three American continents, the world's two largest oceans and its most variegated mountains, it is a territory of excess. The restless lens of Aldo Brando focuses on this natural setting, furnishing us with a panoply of images that excite both the eye and the imagination. As he eminent Colombian writer German Arciniegas points out, this book is \\"a vertical exploration of a country which is the synthesis of the Americas.\\" Novel and unique, it is a summary of fifteen years work by a photojournalist whose documentation of wild life goes beyond capturing the physical contours of the seas, islands, jungles, savannahs, mountains and inhabitants of Colombia. \\"It penetrates into the beauty and soul\\" of natural wonders, as one of the world's leading professionals in the field-- the American wildlife photographer Art Wolfe-- recognizes in his prologue. The book's five chapters are accompanied by an essay written by the Colombian journalist, Arturo Guerrero, who invites us to share in the astonishment and poetry found in nature and science. The dazzling photographs of this book evoke the magic of the tropical ecosystems of the new world, and draw near to the intimacy of nature. It also allows us to reflect upon mankind's contradictory relationship with the natural world. Professor Sir Ghillean Prance, director of the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, writes in his introduction: \\"It is my hope that this book helps to encourage the conservation of Colombian ecosystems, which are a valuable resource, not only for inhabitants of that nation but also for the world.\\"The book concludes with a heartfelt message by the Colombian poet William Ospina. Aldo Brando. As a student of marine biology in the early 1980's, Brando became interested in wildlife photography and film-making, specializing in Colombia's tropical ecosystems. His work has appeared in such books as \\"Coral Reefs of the Caribbean,\\" \\"Mangroves,\\" \\"Paramos,\\" \\"Colombia from the air,\\" \\"For a Country Within the Reach of the Children,\\" all published by Villegas Editores; \\"Malpelo, Oceanic Island of Colombia,\\" published by Imprenta Mariscal/National Geographic.

Lee's Lieutenants: A Study in Command is the most colorful and popular of Douglas Southall Freeman's works. A sweeping narrative that presents a multiple biography against the flame-shot background of the American Civil War, it is the story of the great figures of the Army of Northern Virginia who fought under Robert E. Lee. Dr. Freeman describes the early rise and fall of General Beauregard, the developing friction between Jefferson Davis and Joseph E. Johnston, the emergence and failure of a number of military charlatans, and the triumphs of unlikely men at crucial times. He also describes the rise of the legendary \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson and traces his progress in the Shenandoah Valley Campaign and into Richmond amid the acclaim of the South. The Confederacy won resounding victories throughout the war, but seldom easily or without tremendous casualties. Death was always on the heels of fame, but the men who survived -- among them Jackson, Longstreet, and Ewell -- developed as commanders and men. Lee's Lieutenants follows these men to the costly battle at Gettysburg, through the deepening twilight of the South's declining military might, and finally to the collapse of Lee's command and his formal surrender in 1865.

No town or village in the British Isles escaped casualty, and the creative genius of a generation was wiped out, at an incalculable loss to society. This book looks in detail at how the British soldier lived, fought and died during the traumatic war years. Enlistment, training and all aspects of life on active service are carefully examined, including discipline, relaxation and even the type and quality of food that soldiers ate. The analysis of the British infantryman's experience is greatly aided by the memories of old soldiers, which provide an interesting and often vivid account of life on the Western Front.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n2IavgAACAAJ&dq=British+Tommy+1914-18+(Warrior)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dulcinea","description":"Dulcinea has been forbidden since she was small to enter the dangerous magic forest where the witch has her castle.

I am beginning to realize that taking the self out of our essays is a form of repression. Taking the self out feels like obeying a gag order pretending an objectivity where there is nothing objective about the experience of confronting and engaging with and swooning over literature.   from Heroines On the last day of December, 2009 Kate Zambreno began a blog called Frances Farmer Is My Sister, arising from her obsession with the female modernists and her recent transplantation to Akron, Ohio, where her husband held a university job. Widely reposted, Zambreno's blog became an outlet for her highly informed and passionate rants about the fates of the modernist  wives and mistresses.  In her blog entries, Zambreno reclaimed the traditionally pathologized biographies of Vivienne Eliot, Jane Bowles, Jean Rhys, and Zelda Fitzgerald: writers and artists themselves who served as male writers' muses only to end their lives silenced, erased, and institutionalized. Over the course of two years, Frances Farmer Is My Sister helped create a community where today's  toxic girls  could devise a new feminist discourse, writing in the margins and developing an alternative canon. In Heroines, Zambreno extends the polemic begun on her blog into a dazzling, original work of literary scholarship. Combing theories that have dictated what literature should be and who is allowed to write it from T. S. Eliot's New Criticism to the writings of such mid-century intellectuals as Elizabeth Hardwick and Mary McCarthy to the occasional  girl-on-girl crime  of the Second Wave of feminism she traces the genesis of a cultural template that consistently exiles female experience to the realm of the  minor,  and diagnoses women for transgressing social bounds.  ANXIETY: When she experiences it, it's pathological,  writes Zambreno.  When he does, it's existential.  By advancing the Girl-As-Philosopher, Zambreno reinvents feminism for her generation while providing a model for a newly subjectivized criticism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kMBNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Heroines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass","description":"All the \\"muchness\\" of Wonderland captured in one book!

Renowned thinker and business trailblazer Rosabeth Moss Kanter says answers will be found not in cyberspace but on the ground, where real people connect, collaborate, and form thriving human communities. In this eye-opening book, Kanter explores what she calls \\"e-culture\\"-a new way of living and working that will transform every aspect of today's organizations. Kanter argues that networks of relationships, not just new technologies, permit speed and seamlessness, encourage creativity and collaboration, and release energy and brainpower-the \\"soul\\" of e-business. And every organization-from dotcoms to dotcom-enablers (technology and service providers) to wannadots (traditional companies struggling to embrace the Web)- must learn to build and foster them. Based on a landmark project with rare on-site access, over 300 interviews, and a 785-company global survey, Evolve! provides a hands-on blueprint for adopting the core principles of e-culture: treat strategy as improvisational theater; nurture networks of partners; reconstruct organizations as online and offline \\"communities\\"; and attract and retain top talent. With colorful and memorable stories, Kanter illuminates vast differences between older, more conservative companies and aggressive, born-digital dotcoms. She takes us deep inside evolving organizations-including IBM, eBay, Reuters, Sun Microsystems, Razorfish, Abuzz, Barnesandnoble.com, Williams-Sonoma, and pioneering public schools-to provide best practices from e-culture pacesetters and cautionary lessons from Internet laggards. Defining the skills leaders need to master change, she reveals how dotcoms and dotcom-enablers can grow fast while crafting a great culture, and how wannadots can benefit by becoming Web-enabled. For anyone who wants to realize the potential and avoid the pitfalls of the Internet age, this pathbreaking book identifies and analyzes the emergence of e-culture-and provides a lively, roll-up-your-sleeves guide to profiting from tomorrow. Rosabeth Moss Kanter is the Ernest L. Arbuckle Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. She has been named one of the \\"50 Most Powerful Women in the World\\" by The Times of London , and is the author of several bestselling books.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t4kAwQEACAAJ&dq=Evolve!+:+Succeeding+in+the+Digital+Culture+of+Tomorrow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gladiator, Level 4, Penguin Readers (Penguin Readers, Level 4)","description":"Contemporary / American English Maximus is a general in the Roman army.

Garside, New York Times Book Review Ancient Mesopotamia the area now called Iraq has received less attention than ancient Egypt and other long-extinct and more spectacular civilizations. But numerous small clay tablets buried in the desert soil for thousands of years make it possible for us to know more about the people of ancient Mesopotamia than any other land in the early Near East. Professor Oppenheim, who studied these tablets for more than thirty years, used his intimate knowledge of long-dead languages to put together a distinctively personal picture of the Mesopotamians of some three thousand years ago. Following Oppenheim's death, Erica Reiner used the author's outline to complete the revisions he had begun. \\"To any serious student of Mesopotamian civilization, this is one of the most valuable books ever written.\\" Leonard Cottrell, Book Week \\"Leo Oppenheim has made a bold, brave, pioneering attempt to present a synthesis of the vast mass of philological and archaeological data that have accumulated over the past hundred years in the field of Assyriological research.\\" Samuel Noah Kramer, Archaeology A.

For several years prior to these lectures, Feynman thought long and hard about the fundamental problems in gravitational physics, yet he published very little. These lectures represent a useful record of his viewpoints and some of his insights into gravity and its application to cosmology, superstars, wormholes, and gravitational waves at that particular time. The lectures also contain a number of fascinating digressions and asides on the foundations of physics and other issues.Characteristically, Feynman took an untraditional non-geometric approach to gravitation and general relativity based on the underlying quantum aspects of gravity. Hence, these lectures contain a unique pedagogical account of the development of Einstein's general theory of relativity as the inevitable result of the demand for a self-consistent theory of a massless spin-2 field (the graviton) coupled to the energy-momentum tensor of matter. This approach also demonstrates the intimate and fundamental connection between gauge invariance and the principle of equivalence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=90lTswEACAAJ&dq=Feynman+Lectures+on+Gravitation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Husband Test","description":"She devised her own standards for the perfect man.

Talbert ably demonstrates that the book of Revelation was written to help the early Christians avoid assimilation into the larger pagan culture.

Doidge s book is a remarkable and hopeful portrait of the endless adaptability of the human brain.  Oliver Sacks, MD, author of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat What is neuroplasticity? Is it possible to change your brain? Norman Doidge s inspiring guide to the new brain science explains all of this and more An astonishing new science called neuroplasticity is overthrowing the centuries-old notion that the human brain is immutable, and proving that it is, in fact, possible to change your brain. Psychoanalyst, Norman Doidge, M.D., traveled the country to meet both the brilliant scientists championing neuroplasticity, its healing powers, and the people whose lives they ve transformed people whose mental limitations, brain damage or brain trauma were seen as unalterable. We see a woman born with half a brain that rewired itself to work as a whole, blind people who learn to see, learning disorders cured, IQs raised, aging brains rejuvenated, stroke patients learning to speak, children with cerebral palsy learning to move with more grace, depression and anxiety disorders successfully treated, and lifelong character traits changed. Using these marvelous stories to probe mysteries of the body, emotion, love, sex, culture, and education, Dr. Doidge has written an immensely moving, inspiring book that will permanently alter the way we look at our brains, human nature, and human potential.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qw7qj5nXSPUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Focus on Health: Laserdisc","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5v-BV-lA2GUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Start your own religion","description":"Yes, world domination and eternal adoration can be yours! \\"The way to make a million dollars is to start a religion.\\"  Attributed to L.

Coverage outlines the philosophical arguments for establishing classrooms and schools as sources of moral instruction, as well as exploring pertinent theories of how to accomplish this goal. The unique presentation of Reclaiming Our Schools: Teaching Character, Academics, and Discipline combines a comprehensive overview of theory with a complete hands-on guide to classroom techniques and schoolwide policies, thus supplying both the background and the tools needed to transform schools into sources of moral instruction. A thorough list of 100 suggestions for applying the principles within the book gives parents, teachers, and administrators a solid repertoire of ideas for use in each classroom and throughout the school. In addition, a 100-item evaluation checklist serves as a framework upon which a working character-development program may be constructed. Updated exercises within each chapter engage the reader in contemporary situations that are both plausible and realistic. Sex and character is now examined in a separate chapter.

Recent advances in biotechnology, spurred by the Human Genome Project, have resulted in the accumulation of vast amounts of new data. Ontologies--computer-readable, precise formulations of concepts (and the relationship among them) in a given field--are a critical framework for coping with the exponential growth of valuable biological data generated by high-output technologies. This book introduces the key concepts and applications of ontologies and ontology languages in bioinformatics and will be an essential guide for bioinformaticists, computer scientists, and life science researchers.The three parts of Ontologies for Bioinformatics ask, and answer, three pivotal questions: what ontologies are; how ontologies are used; and what ontologies could be (which focuses on how ontologies could be used for reasoning with uncertainty). The authors first introduce the notion of an ontology, from hierarchically organized ontologies to more general network organizations, and survey the best-known ontologies in biology and medicine. They show how to construct and use ontologies, classifying uses into three categories: querying, viewing, and transforming data to serve diverse purposes. Contrasting deductive, or Boolean, logic with inductive reasoning, they describe the goal of a synthesis that supports both styles of reasoning. They discuss Bayesian networks as a way of expressing uncertainty, describe data fusion, and propose that the World Wide Web can be extended to support reasoning with uncertainty. They call this inductive reasoning web the Bayesian web.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NpRqAAAAMAAJ&dq=Ontologies+for+Bioinformatics+(Computational+Molecular+Biology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Far Beyond Defensive Tactics: Advanced Concepts, Techniques, Drills, and Tricks for Cops on the Street","description":"This book shows cops how to use proven defensive tactics to stay alive and uninjured, including how to disarm attackers, deal with drunk or drugged subjects, protect their guns, fend off multiple attackers and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aZ0OAAAACAAJ&dq=Far+Beyond+Defensive+Tactics:+Advanced+Concepts,+Techniques,+Drills,+and+Tricks+for+Cops+on+the+Street&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Philology(Literature Primers)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yYMFGwAACAAJ&dq=Philology(Literature+Primers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Unreasonable Woman: A True Story of Shrimpers, Politicos, Polluters, and the Fight for Seadrift, Texas","description":"Relates the battle fought by a fourth-generation, Texas Gulf Coast shrimper against an anti-environmental corporation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uWHPAgAAQBAJ&dq=An+Unreasonable+Woman:+A+True+Story+of+Shrimpers,+Politicos,+Polluters,+and+the+Fight+for+Seadrift,+Texas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fiction and the Camera Eye: Visual Consciousness in Film and the Modern Novel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=95VZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Fiction+and+the+Camera+Eye:+Visual+Consciousness+in+Film+and+the+Modern+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lockheed-Martin F/A-22 Raptor: Stealth Fighter (Aerofax)","description":"Initially referred to as the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF), the F-22 was designed to meet a USAF requirement for 750 new fighters to replace the F-15 Eagle. Work began in the early 1980s, and competition selection resulted in orders for flying demonstration prototypes of the YF-22 and the Northrop YF-23. The first of two prototypes was flown on 29th September 1990, and extensive testing and evaluation took place during that decade. In 1993 an air-to-ground attack role using precision-guided munitions was added to the original air superiority role, and the designation has been changed to F/A-22 to reflect this. The F-22 is designed to supercruise at up to Mach 1.5 without use of the afterburner, and its unusual layout is designed for agility as well as to incorporate stealth characteristics. A planned two-seat trainer version, the F-22B was cancelled, but production deliveries are now taking place, with service introduction planned for 2005. Author Jay Miller has followed the program closely to produce an extensively researched and well-illustrated review of this topical new fighter in the well-established and acclaimed Aerofax style and depth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PQbBAQAACAAJ&dq=Lockheed-Martin+F/A-22+Raptor:+Stealth+Fighter+(Aerofax)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of commonly prescribed drugs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-gSyAAAACAAJ&dq=Handbook+of+commonly+prescribed+drugs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Love Ruthie: The Story of Ruth (Perfect in His sight)","description":"Retells in rhyme the story of Ruth and Naomi.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_Z2ZAAAACAAJ&dq=I+Love+Ruthie:+The+Story+of+Ruth+(Perfect+in+His+sight)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theo Kalomirakis' Private Theaters","description":"Bijou, Paramount, Loew's, Fox -- the names themselves conjure up rich carpeting, heavily curtained prosceniums, and gilded carvings.

Yet when she arrives, it seems her troubles have only just begun. Not only is the house falling apart around her, but she isn't the only inheritor: she has to share everything with Wesley Koehler, the groundskeeper who's as grouchy as he is gorgeous--and it turns out he has a very different vision for the property's future. Convincing the taciturn Wesley to stop avoiding her and compromise is a task more formidable than the other dying wishes Great-Aunt Violet left behind.

A devastatingly lucid and detailed new history of nuclear weapons in the U.S. Fascinating.   Lev Grossman, TIME Magazine  Perilous and gripping . . . Schlosser skillfully weaves together an engrossing account of both the science and the politics of nuclear weapons safety.   San Francisco Chronicle A myth-shattering expos  of America s nuclear weapons Famed investigative journalist Eric Schlosser digs deep to uncover secrets about the management of America s nuclear arsenal. A groundbreaking account of accidents, near misses, extraordinary heroism, and technological breakthroughs, Command and Control explores the dilemma that has existed since the dawn of the nuclear age: How do you deploy weapons of mass destruction without being destroyed by them? That question has never been resolved and Schlosser reveals how the combination of human fallibility and technological complexity still poses a grave risk to mankind. While the harms of global warming increasingly dominate the news, the equally dangerous yet more immediate threat of nuclear weapons has been largely forgotten. Written with the vibrancy of a first-rate thriller, Command and Control interweaves the minute-by-minute story of an accident at a nuclear missile silo in rural Arkansas with a historical narrative that spans more than fifty years. It depicts the urgent effort by American scientists, policy makers, and military officers to ensure that nuclear weapons can t be stolen, sabotaged, used without permission, or detonated inadvertently. Schlosser also looks at the Cold War from a new perspective, offering history from the ground up, telling the stories of bomber pilots, missile commanders, maintenance crews, and other ordinary servicemen who risked their lives to avert a nuclear holocaust. At the heart of the book lies the struggle, amid the rolling hills and small farms of Damascus, Arkansas, to prevent the explosion of a ballistic missile carrying the most powerful nuclear warhead ever built by the United States. Drawing on recently declassified documents and interviews with people who designed and routinely handled nuclear weapons, Command and Control takes readers into a terrifying but fascinating world that, until now, has been largely hidden from view. Through the details of a single accident, Schlosser illustrates how an unlikely event can become unavoidable, how small risks can have terrible consequences, and how the most brilliant minds in the nation can only provide us with an illusion of control. Audacious, gripping, and unforgettable, Command and Control is a tour de force of investigative journalism, an eye-opening look at the dangers of America s nuclear age.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lJ6JDQAAQBAJ&dq=Control&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reading Skills for College Students (Learningexpress Basic Skills for College Students)","description":"For Study Skills, College Survival Skills, and developmental courses.

Rashid uses humorous, feel-good stories to relate his techniques of teaching horses by examining their view of the world. These stories deal with many aspects of buying, owning, and training horses with a special focus on those that are troubled and hard-to-train. The arrested development of horses like these, Rashid shows, is often a result of their trainers  own lack of understanding of their unique psychologies. With stories that stress the importance of patience and understanding, this book is a must-have for compassionate horse trainers and owners. Tales of Arabs, appaloosas, and paints mistrusted and mistreated because of their breed will give readers a new perspective on these breeds and others. Sometimes, it s the attitude that needs to be fixed rather than the horse. Rashid s accounts of horses bound for slaughter because they were considered impossible to train will inspire you to give your own problem horse a second look.

Murphy v. Trustee of Star Financial Bank, a case discussing the unfortunate linkage of survivorship and per stirpes: \\"to their surviving children per stirpes.\\" The court held that the way in which \\"surviving\\" and \\"per stirpes\\" were linked rendered the provision itself ambiguous in that the \\"condition of survival negates the right of representation inherent in a per stirpes distribution.\\" 2020 Tax Rates for Trusts and 2021 Projected Tax Rate Schedule for Trusts Note: Online subscriptions are for three-month periods.

F. cher, dear. Sweet, indulgent love, esp. of children. Emotional equivalent of nourishment; soul food. What the world needs now. Elisabeth Young-Bruehl and Faith Bethelard give a name to the kind, warm, tender, and affectionate love that babies expect before they can speak of it and that we all desire our whole lives long. As adults, they note, we all desire our whole lives long. As adults, they note, we don't often acknowledge or even understand our need for this \\"cherishment.\\" Their book is a rare effort to explore that need, to create a \\"psychology of the heart.\\" In Cherishment, Young-Bruehl and Bethelard provide a wholly original way of thinking about familiar concepts such as love, attachment, and care, showing how deep-seated disappointments and fears of dependency keep so many of us from forming healthy relationships. Questioning the traditional, celebratory view of independence and self-reliance, they argue that cherishment is the emotional foundation, formed in childhood, that sustains all kinds of growth-promoting adult bonds. Blending the philosophical writing that has won Young-Bruehl international acclaim with Bethelard's imaginative sensibility, Cherishment is a finely balanced interplay of scholarship, dual-memoir, and intimate therapeutic tales. It draws on ancient wisdom traditions of the East and West, telling many instructive stories of men and women, young and old, who have learned to cultivate the cherishment instinct in themselves as well as in others. It helps readers attune sensitively to the ways people express their need for affection in the details of daily life and relationships. The book narrates a journey of discovery, and any reader on his or her own journey in the realm of the heart will feel cherished by it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2UIA3Uv6Fg0C&dq=Cherishment:+A+Psychology+of+the+Heart&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eclipse of Reason","description":"Horkheimer's most important work, in which he explores the rise of reason in Western philosophy and the concept's continuing use and abuse.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2UhMAQAAQBAJ&dq=Eclipse+of+Reason&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eye of the Serpent (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Module UK5)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6GIuAAAACAAJ&dq=Eye+of+the+Serpent+(Advanced+Dungeons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Penny a Copy: Readings from the Catholic Worker","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gx9YAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Penny+a+Copy:+Readings+from+the+Catholic+Worker&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Literacy for the 21st Century: A Balanced Approach (4th Edition)","description":"Teaching literacy with a balance of theory and applications.

Captured here in over 200 vintage images are the life and times of the city's earliest residents and their livelihoods. Spanning the mid-1800s through the early decades of the 20th century, this book offers a visual account of early life in San Francisco, from family outings at Golden Gate Park, to the images of San Franciscans rebuilding their city after the devastating Earthquake and Fire of 1906. Also pictured are the joyous occasions, including the Panama-Pacific Exposition of 1915, the openings of the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges, and the 1939 World's Fair. Early views of the city's landmarks capture the magic of the Bay area, such as the Ferry Depot, Nob Hill, turn of the century Chinatown, and Fisherman's Wharf.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a4Ua92ImdZMC&dq=San+Francisco%27s+Marina+District+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theory of recursive functions and effective computability (McGraw-Hill series in higher mathematics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Reversing Fibromyalgia: How to Treat and Overcome Fibromyalgia and Other Arthritis-Related Diseases","description":"Arthritis has always been considered a serious disease. Recently, various forms of the dreaded disorder have come to light -- and among them is fibromyalgia, a disease that affects connective and muscular tissue. Because this disease was not recognizable until recently, treatments have been varied and basically ineffective.

In Made in America, Bryson tells the story of how American arose out of the English language, and along the way, de-mythologizes his native land - explaining how a dusty desert hamlet with neither woods nor holly became Hollywood, how the Wild West wasn't won, why Americans say 'lootenant' and 'Toosday', how they were eating junk food long before the word itself was cooked up - as well as exposing the true origins of the words G-string, blockbuster, poker and snafu.

Time In the late 1950s, acclaimed sportswriter Pat Jordan was a young pitching phenom, blowing away opposing batters for his Fairfield, Connecticut, high school baseball team. Fifteen major league clubs offered him a contract, but it was the Milwaukee Braves who won out, signing Jordan to a $45,000 bonus one of the largest paid to any new player by the organization and shipping him off to McCook, Nebraska, to play for their Class D ball club. It did not take long, however, for Jordan to realize he was out of his depth in professional baseball s backwoods. He battled with inconsistency and a lack of control for three dismal seasons in such far-flung locales as Keokuk, Iowa, and Palatka, Florida, before the Braves released him and he gave up his dreams of big league greatness. Declared  unforgettable  by the Los Angeles Times and  a major triumph  by the Philadelphia Inquirer, A False Spring is a powerful and deeply affecting memoir about the gift of athletic talent and the heartbreak of unfulfilled promise.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z_eyCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Q's Baccarat Tie System (Q's Baccarat Winning Strategies: Vol. 2)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5LcMAAAACAAJ&dq=Q%27s+Baccarat+Tie+System+(Q%27s+Baccarat+Winning+Strategies:+Vol.+2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dreamweaver MX: A Beginner's Guide","description":"Get a solid introduction to the tools, functionality, and newly integrated features of Dreamweaver MX.

However, reading Bourdieu can be difficult for those not familiar with the French cultural context, and until now a comprehensive introduction to Bourdieu's oeuvre has not been available. David Swartz focuses on a central theme in Bourdieu's work the complex relationship between culture and power and explains that sociology for Bourdieu is a mode of political intervention. Swartz clarifies Bourdieu's difficult concepts, noting where they have been misinterpreted by critics and where they have fallen short in resolving important analytical issues. The book also shows how Bourdieu has synthesized his theory of practices and symbolic power from Durkheim, Marx, and Weber, and how his work was influenced by Sartre, Levi-Strauss, and Althusser. Culture and Power is the first book to offer both a sympathetic and critical examination of Bourdieu's work and it will be invaluable to social scientists as well as to a broader audience in the humanities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pNcnAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vandas: Their Botany, History and Culture","description":"This book presents for the first time a history of the introduction of Vanda species and an accurate modern scientific view of the genus, including exciting developments in hybridization.

With the rare ability to entice listeners on many levels, at its heart lies an engaging simplicity-one which defies traditional analysis and lends mystery to what ultimately is an extremely refined and highly personal approach to composition. Equally fascinating is Debussy's often contradictory personality--at times elusive, but always centered on his devotion to music and his ambition to create a name for himself unlike any other. Author Eric Frederick Jensen provides new insight to the man and the music in this authoritative biography. Although born into poverty, and a failure as a piano student at the Paris Conservatoire, Debussy became the most famous French composer of his day, known for his culture and refinement. His revolutionary music baffled critics but was embraced by audiences. Debussy's scandalous personal life stirred up as much controversy as his music, and his notoriety proved more harmful to his career than the unusual nature of his compositions. Jensen also explores Debussy's relationship to the arts and his career as a music critic. Debussy drew on all of the arts in his development as a composer, including poetry and painting, and his fascination with the arts has often led to his being classified as an Impressionist or Symbolist, two claims which Jensen debunks. One of the finest music critics of his time, Debussy's reviews reveal a great deal not only about his musical taste, but also about what he felt the role and function of music should be. Debussy brings together the most recent biographical research, including a revised catalogue of Debussy's compositions and the first complete edition of his correspondence. With separate, chronological sections on his life and music, Debussy is accessible to the general reader who wishes to focus on his life and personality, while providing detailed discussion of the music to musicians and students.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j68iBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Around the World Rally","description":"Around the World Rally provides a detailed analysis of how 36 different cruising boats, their equipment and crew performed during 16 months and 24,000 miles of tough ocean sailing.

Less than 250 years ago, they believed that the Universe was createdessentially in its present state about 6000 years ago. Even less than 150 years ago, the view that living species were the result of special creation by God was still dominant. The recognition by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace of the mechanism of evolution by natural selection hascompletely transformed our understanding of the living world, including our own origins. In this Very Short Introduction Brian and Deborah Charlesworth provide a clear and concise summary of the process of evolution by natural selection, and how natural selection gives rise to adaptations and eventually, over many generations, to new species. They introduce the central concepts of thefield of evolutionary biology, as they have developed since Darwin and Wallace on the subject, over 140 years ago, and discuss some of the remaining questions regarding processes. They highlight the wide range of evidence for evolution, and the importance of an evolutionary understanding forinstance in combating the rapid evolution of resistance by bacteria to antibiotics and of HIV to antiviral drugs.

Andrews wrote a number of scholarly religious books, his most famous being  The History of the Sabbath and the First Day of the Week.  During his long and illustrious career, he also served as the Adventist representative in Washington to secure recognition for the church as noncombatants, served as the third president of the General Conference, and also as editor of the Review and Herald magazine.

For readers of English, it will be an authoritative survey of four centuries of Roman history, and a unique window on the German tradition of the last century. Theodor Mommsen (d. 1903) was one of the greatest Roman historians of the nineteenth century, and the only one ever to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. His fame rests on his History of Rome as well as his work on Roman law and on the Roman provinces. But the work that would have concluded his history of Rome - which ran to the reign of Augustus - was never completed. This book represents that great lost work. In 1980 Alexander Demandt discovered in an antiquarian bookshop a full and detailed handwritten transcript of the lectures on the Roman Empire, which Mommsen gave for many years from 1863 to 1886, made by two of his students. This transcript has been edited to provide the authoritative reconstruction of the book Mommsen never wrote, A History of Rome Under the Emperors. Barbara and Alexander Demandt have carefully edited the text and provided detailed annotation and explanatory references. For the English edition, Professor Thomas Wiedemann has written an introduction which surveys Mommsen's position and influence in nineteenth century German scholarship and introduces his work for English speaking readers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ApCEAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tupolev Tu-134: The USSR's Short-Range Jetliner -Aerofax Series","description":"81/2 x 11, 260 color & b&w photos, The Tu-134, which has given sterling service for 35 years now, has played a major role in Soviet/Russian civil aviation.

For him, this work was a blessed challenge. Indeed, he was forced to relate the permanent and unchanging faith of the Church to the changing circumstances of our recent history, and to the birth of a new Orthodox Church on the American continent. The editorials reprinted in Vision of Unity ask the question: Can we survive in chaos and disunity?

This dictionary, however, is a most useful work.  Bierce s groundbreaking Devil s Dictionary had a complex publication history. Started in the mid-1800s as an irregular column in Californian newspapers under various titles, he gradually refined the new-at-the-time idea of an irreverent set of glossary-like definitions. The final name, as we see it titled in this work, did not appear until an 1881 column published in the periodical The San Francisco Illustrated Wasp. There were no publications of the complete glossary in the 1800s. Not until 1906 did a portion of Bierce s collection get published by Doubleday, under the name The Cynic s Word Book the publisher not wanting to use the word  Devil  in the title, to the great disappointment of the author. The 1906 word book only went from A to L, however, and the remainder was never released under the compromised title. In 1911 the Devil s Dictionary as we know it was published in complete form as part of Bierce s collected works (volume 7 of 12), including the remainder of the definitions from M to Z. It has been republished a number of times, including more recent efforts where older definitions from his columns that never made it into the original book were included. Due to the complex nature of copyright, some of those found definitions have unclear public domain status and were not included. This edition of the book includes, however, a set of definitions attributed to his one-and-only  Demon s Dictionary  column, including Bierce s classic definition of A:  the first letter in every properly constructed alphabet.  Bierce enjoyed  quoting  his pseudonyms in his work. Most of the poetry, dramatic scenes and stories in this book attributed to others were self-authored and do not exist outside of this work. This includes the prolific Father Gassalasca Jape, whom he thanks in the preface  jape  of course having the definition:  a practical joke.  This book is a product of its time and must be approached as such. Many of the definitions hold up well today, but some might be considered less palatable by modern readers. Regardless, the book s humorous style is a valuable snapshot of American culture from past centuries. This book is part of the Standard Ebooks project, which produces free public domain ebooks.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KLQjEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Through the looking-glass and what Alice found there","description":"In this sequel to \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" Alice goes through the mirror to find a strange world where curious adventures await her.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V94zd80Y4WIC&dq=Through+the+looking-glass+and+what+Alice+found+there&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Empirical relationships between the total industrial production index and its diffusion indexes (Finance and economics discussion series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w5mBeVCa8HAC&dq=Empirical+relationships+between+the+total+industrial+production+index+and+its+diffusion+indexes+(Finance+and+economics+discussion+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nutritional disorders of children: Prevention, screening, and followup (DHEW publication ; no)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zM9pAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lost Boys: Why Our Sons Turn Violent and How We Can Save Them","description":"The psychologist examines trends in violence by young boys, analyzing his twenty-five years of work with violent adolescents to develop recommendations for preventive measures","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=av-5uBRXleEC&dq=Lost+Boys:+Why+Our+Sons+Turn+Violent+and+How+We+Can+Save+Them&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Zenna Henderson Collection","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bC8nAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Zenna+Henderson+Collection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eagle Brand Best-Loved Desserts: 71 Treats for Year-Round Fun","description":"This major study of a Markan genre, represented in the central section 8.27-10.4, ranges through Greek, rabbinic and early Christian literature, providing detailed comparison with the anecdotes in Lucian's Demonax and the Mishnah.Moeser concludes that the Markan anecdotes clearly follow the definition of, and typologies for, the Greek chreia.

But greed and power twisted their minds and turned their ambition into madness. And so the First Gods condemned them to eternal sleep in order to preserve creation. Now, the exiled prince Calandryll, the mercenary Bracht, and the warrior woman Katya pursue Rhythamun, a powerful wizard who would wake one of the mad gods and provoke apocalypse. He carries with him the Arcanum, an ancient book of power that simply by virtue of having been discovered already stirs the god from his slumber. But Calandryll and his companions are chased by another vengeful mage, whose dark magics created Cennaire, an undead murderess, to thwart their efforts. And as they face the perils of civil war, magical assaults, and the ever-present threat of Cennaire s treachery to reach Rhythamun before he wakes the god, they live with the knowledge that the fate of the world rests solely in their hands.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CaSr7ALGbisC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Physics by Inquiry: An Introduction to Physics and the Physical Sciences (2 Volume Set)","description":"A hands-on approach to learning physics fundamentals Physics by Inquiry: An Introduction to Physics and the Physical Sciences, Volume 2 offers a practical lab-based approach to understanding the fundamentals of physics.

As the cities grew, the Valley was their breadbasket.Japanese migrants called the area Shirakawa, an exact translation of the English \\"White River.\\" They first arrived in the late 19th century and worked as itinerants, but some Japanese workers leased farms in the Valley and settled in. They brought wives from the old country and encouraged countless other fortune-seekers to follow. By the 1920s, the Japanese were the majority ethnic group in the Valley farm belt and over half of all Japanese farms in Washington State were in the White River Valley.Part community history, part anthology, Shirakawa details how the first-generation Issei overcame waves of organized opposition to forge a viable, cohesive community. It is the story of their efforts to develop job opportunities, family support systems, cultural outlets, community organizations, and centers for worship and education. Above all, it tells how they paved the way for their American-born children, the Nisei, and descendant generations to succeed as citizens and bring honor to their heritage. Out of this environment came leaders like Tom Iseri, chairman of the Japanese American Citizens League, Pacific Northwest District, and Gordon Hirabayashi, famed resister of the wartime incarceration of Japanese Americans. More than forty Nisei who grew up in the White River Valley were interviewed for the book, and their voices resound in its pages.Just as Shirakawa chronicles the growth of a community, it also examines its swift demise after Pearl Harbor. The government swept Issei leaders out of the community and into detention camps. Shirakawa follows their fate, using rare documents from the National Archives to try to understand the unwarranted allegations of subversion against them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Cfd5AAAAMAAJ&dq=SHIRAKAWA&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Miami Indians of Indiana: A Persistent People, 1654-1994","description":"Now scattered in small communities in northern Indiana, the Eastern Miami Indians, once a well-known tribe, have lived in undeserved obscurity since the 1840s.

Gore, Richard L. Hasen rethinks the Court s role in regulating elections. Drawing on the case files of the Warren, Burger, and Rehnquist courts, Hasen roots the Court s intervention in political process cases to the landmark 1962 case, Baker v. Carr. The case opened the courts to a variety of election law disputes, to the point that the courts now control and direct major aspects of the American electoral process. The Supreme Court does have a crucial role to play in protecting a socially constructed  core  of political equality principles, contends Hasen, but it should leave contested questions of political equality to the political process itself. Under this standard, many of the Court s most important election law cases from Baker to Bush have been wrongly decided.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zZUUCgAAQBAJ&dq=God+is+a+Conservative:+Religion,+Politics,+and+Morality+in+Contemporary+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"IMPETUOUS: BRIDES WILDCAT #4: MATTIE'S STORY (Brides of Wildcat County)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a8pCAAAACAAJ&dq=IMPETUOUS:+BRIDES+WILDCAT&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Jersey estate reference guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZVt8RAAACAAJ&dq=The+New+Jersey+estate+reference+guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jackson's Silver and Gold Marks of England, Scotland & Ireland","description":"A revised edition of Sir Charles Jackson's classic English Goldsmiths and their Marks with more than 10000 corrections and additions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MXgBQwAACAAJ&dq=Jackson%27s+Silver+and+Gold+Marks+of+England,+Scotland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pastel City (Virconium, Book One)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kWTkAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Pastel+City+(Virconium,+Book+One)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Twentieth-Century Zen: Paintings and Calligraphy by Japanese","description":"Celebrates the unique brushwork of Zen monks and nuns","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FkdQAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+Twentieth-Century+Zen:+Paintings+and+Calligraphy+by+Japanese&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bruce Jenner's Viewers guide to the 1984 summer Olympics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yCqTAAAACAAJ&dq=Bruce+Jenner%27s+Viewers+guide+to+the+1984+summer+Olympics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Basics of Paralegal Studies, The","description":"The intent is to provide not only an overview of the legal principles in a variety of areas of the law, but also to give a practical introduction to the kinds of duties and responsibilities that may face a paralegal in the workplace.

But even the casual observer is aware that birds don t fill our skies in the number they once did. That awareness has spawned conservation action that has led to notable successes, including the recovery of some of the nation s most emblematic species, such as the Bald Eagle, Brown Pelican, Whooping Crane, and Peregrine Falcon. Despite this, a third of all American bird species are in trouble in many cases, they re in imminent danger of extinction. The most authoritative account ever published of the threats these species face, The American Bird Conservancy Guide to Bird Conservation will be the definitive book on the subject. The Guide presents for the first time anywhere a classification system and threat analysis for bird habitats in the United States, the most thorough and scientifically credible assessment of threats to birds published to date, as well as a new list of birds of conservation concern. Filled with beautiful color illustrations and original range maps, the Guide is a timely, important, and inspiring reference for birders and anyone else interested in conserving North America s avian fauna. But this book is far more than another shout of crisis. The Guide also lays out a concrete and achievable plan of long-term action to safeguard our country s rich bird life. Ultimately, it is an argument for hope. Whether you spend your early weekend mornings crouched in silence with binoculars in hand, hoping to check another species off your list, or you ve never given much thought to bird conservation, you ll appreciate the visual power and intellectual scope of these pages.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eYpkN_brmy0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"50 One-Minute Tips to Better Communication, Revised Edition: A Wealth of Business Communication Ideas (Crisp Fifty-Minute Books)","description":"Read and Learn: How to think of meetings as investments; how to use the F.A.S.T. formula to manage \\"meeting theft\\"; how to revise, simplify, and clarify your business writing; and tips on business presentations and teleconferencing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dhxIvgAACAAJ&dq=50+One-Minute+Tips+to+Better+Communication,+Revised+Edition:+A+Wealth+of+Business+Communication+Ideas+(Crisp+Fifty-Minute+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eternal Fountain","description":"This book is a collection of essays on various subjects.

It's hard to keep up, to keep our balance. It's hard to keep trusting in God. And it's especially difficult when the changes we're faced with are unwanted: the death of a loved one, a child leaving home, an illness, a frustrated dream. Craig Barnes knows the dark side of change. As a pastor, he has counseled many Christians through tough times of transition. And he has been challenged by unwanted changes--interruptions--in his own life. At times it seems as though God has moved far, far away. But Barnes has discovered that just the opposite is true: during times of change and seeming abandonment, God is right at our side offering to lead us in a new direction, offering us new life. He writes, \\"A young widow can outlive her grief and decide her life may never be the same but is far from over. A lost job can become the beginning of a new vocation.\\" Here is the book for all who have known disappointment, bereavement or the shattering of faith, a book all the more valuable because it promises hope without denying despair. In When God Interrupts a sensitive, insightful pastor shows us how we can be found by God in the middle of unwanted change.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r0bkMhyYKloC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of Multicultural Counseling, 1995","description":"This handbook is issue orientated, problem-focused, and concentrates on the challenges which confront practising counsellors.

J. H. Elliott, one of the most distinguished and versatile historians working today, offers us history on a grand scale, contrasting the worlds built by Britain and by Spain on the ruins of the civilizations they encountered and destroyed in North and South America.

Interest in Southeast Asian history and culture is higher than ever before. Ancient cartography of Oceania holds mysteries as old as time were these early ocean maps molded as much by fantasy as fact? Early Mapping of the Pacific bravely delves into all the questions surrounding the history of maps. The Pacific Ocean remained a mystery to mapmakers until the latter part of the eighteenth century. This book traces the European exploration and charting of the vast ocean through a cornucopia of beautiful maps stretching from Japan on the northwest, through Juan Fernandez Island on the southeast, with the various islands of Oceania the primary focus. It follows the history of mapmaking from Classical times up to the turn of the twentieth century. The ancient seafarers who ventured eastward from Asia, and were the Pacific's true pioneers, left no maps. They still helped make cartography history, thanks to the navigational genius their descendants passed to European visitors.

Humboldt's concern is to define the criteria by which the permissible limits of the state's activities may be determined. His basic principle, like that of Mill, is that the only justification for government interference is the prevention of harm to others. He discusses in detail the role and limits of the state's responsibility for the welfare, security and morals of its citizens. Humboldt's special achievement in this work is to enlarge our sense of what a liberal political theory might be by his particularly sensitive grasp of the complexity of our attitudes to and our need of other people. Dr Burrow has based his translation on Coulthard's version of 1854. In an important introduction, he provides a most perceptive as well as scholarly guide to Humboldt's political thought.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pCdbBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Music Teacher's Survival Guide, The: Practical Techniques and Materials for the Elementary Music Teacher","description":"This unique resource is packed with innovative, tested strategies, timesavers, and problem-solvers to help K-8 music teachers in virtually every aspect of their work - from lesson planning and general music instruction, to classroom management and discipline.

You won't find Luther's 95 theses, or the 264 Popes, for example, but you will find everything from the 3 sons of Adam and Eve all the way up to the 24 letters of the ancient Greek alphabet. This clever format lends itself well to quizzing and guessing, which gives it a deliciously sophisticated parlor-game quality. But for those who wish to delve a little deeper, there are thoughtful essays to go with each answer that include fascinating details and place the list in its larger cultural or historical context. Much more than a book of trivia, What Are the 7 Wonders of the World? offers a grand overview of the knowledge needed to appreciate many of the finest things in our cultural and intellectual life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TSEKh3bzo8YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gerf","description":"To date, the Center of Documentation and Studies on Ancient Egypt (CEDAE) has published four volumes of its work at the temple of Gerf Hussein: M.A.-L El-Tanbouli, Gerf Hussein (1965); M.A.-L Tanbouli and A.F.

A harrowing, moving memoir of the 1972 plane crash that left its survivors stranded on a glacier in the Andes and one man s quest to lead them all home now in a special edition for 2022, commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the crash, featuring a new introduction by the author  In straightforward, staggeringly honest prose, Nando Parrado tells us what it took and what it actually felt like to survive high in the Andes for seventy-two days after having been given up for dead.  Jon Krakauer, author of Into the Wild  In the first hours there was nothing, no fear or sadness, just a black and perfect silence.  Nando Parrado was unconscious for three days before he woke to discover that the plane carrying his rugby team to Chile had crashed deep in the Andes, killing many of his teammates, his mother, and his sister. Stranded with the few remaining survivors on a lifeless glacier and thinking constantly of his father s grief, Parrado resolved that he could not simply wait to die. So Parrado, an ordinary young man with no particular disposition for leadership or heroism, led an expedition up the treacherous slopes of a snowcapped mountain and across forty-five miles of frozen wilderness in an attempt to save his friends  lives as well as his own. Decades after the disaster, Parrado tells his story with remarkable candor and depth of feeling. Miracle in the Andes, a first-person account of the crash and its aftermath, is more than a riveting tale of true-life adventure; it is a revealing look at life at the edge of death and a meditation on the limitless redemptive power of love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iyPDBsZrCvkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bigamist's Daughter","description":"Alice McDermott's brilliant first novel 'One of our finest novelists at work today' LA TIMES 'There's no one like Alice McDermott ... her touch is light as a feather, her perceptions purely accurate' ELLE Elizabeth Connelly sits in a New York office that looks like a real editor's, but isn't quite.

A natural leader with an innate understanding of combat, he's able to command and hold the all-important \\"Bowling Alley\\" sector. Barinelli's successes on the battlefield earn him quick promotions. The Inchon landing relieves the pressure on Pusan and Barinelli's platoon takes the point for an American offensive. At Hungnam, they're ordered to the rear and reorganized as a reconnaissance company, while the Army's Tenth Corps and First Marine Division advance to the Chinese border. But a quarter-million Chinese secretly infiltrate the mountain passes and surround the Americans with orders to annihilate them all. The only escape route is along a narrow road past the Chosin Reservoir through the Funchilin Pass to Hungnam and safety. The Funchilin must be held. But when Barinelli's company commander suddenly disappears, the survival of over twenty thousand men falls on him. With fewer than two hundred men under his command, Barinelli faces the pressures of leadership in battle. More importantly, he learns of faithlessness and heroism and the inner gauntlet each soldier must pass through to survive.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IheIYSXY1_UC&dq=Barinelli%27s+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life is a Road, Get on it and Ride!

Really listening and providing compassionate empathy without judging is a core part of social work practice with service users. This book provides a theoretically informed understanding of the core skills required to provide counselling interventions that work. It provides detailed discussion of three core skills which are identified as: talking and responding, listening and observing and thinking. Over 11 chapters these core skills are described in terms of what they mean, how they can be learned and developed, how they can be used and misused and, most importantly, how specific skills can be employed in a coherent and evidence-informed counselling approach.

As she walks toward the store seeking directions, she is jostled by a young man. While Harry helps Diana retrieve the scattered contents of her purse, he gives her a preview of the local vernacular and mannerisms. Although Diana leaves the young waterman in anger after this volatile first meeting, she will welcome Harry's assistance later in the day. In time, Diana grows to love Harry, his family, and the region's culture. She enjoys the warmth and acceptance of the locals, a tightly knit community of watermen and tobacco farmers, many of whose families' roots extent back to Southern Maryland's colonial days. However, she knows that her upper-class family would disapprove of her involvement with these rural people. Soon, critical external pressures buffet the cocoon that Diana and Harry have spun around their relationship, causing the two lovers to question whether their love can survive.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DlsnYqi92_wC&dq=Hard+Crabs+and+Cultured+Pearls:+A+Southern+Maryland+Love+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Western Horse Power Hb","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tOk-AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Self-Fullness: The Art of Loving and Caring for Your Self","description":"LEARN HOW TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF WITHOUT FEELING GUILTY!

C.G. Jung's 'archetypes of the collective unconscious' have traditionally remained the property of analytical psychology, and have commonly been dismissed as 'mystical' by scientists. But Jung himself described them as biological entities, which, if they exist at all, must be amenable to empirical study. In the work of Bowlby and Lorenz, and in recent studies of the bilateral brain, Dr Anthony Stevens has discovered the key to opening up this long-ignored scientific approach to the archetypes, originally envisaged by Jung himself. At last, in a creative leap made possible by the cross-fertilisation of several specialist disciplines, psychiatry can be integrated with psychology, with ethology and biology. The result is an immensely enriched science of human behaviour. In this revised, updated edition, Anthony Stevens considers the enormous cultural, social and intellectual changes that have taken place in the past 20 years, and includes: * An updated chapter on The Archetypal Masculine and Feminine, reflecting recent research findings and developments in the thinking of feminists * Commentary on the intrusion of neo-Darwinian thinking into psychology and psychiatry * Analysis of what has happened to the archetype in the past 20 years in terms of our understanding of it and our responses to it","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Go6NAgAAQBAJ&dq=Archetype+Revisited:+An+Updated+Natural+History+of+the+Self&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Acting in Believing.","description":"Did you know that an actor must believe to make his audience believe?

Now Martini delivers the most daunting capital case of Madriani's career. Paul Madriani has ample reason to suspect he's representing a guilty man. Dr. David Crone, a respected medical researcher and principal in mapping the human genome, is charged with the murder of a young colleague: twenty-six-year-old Kalista Jordan, an African-American research physician whose body washed up on a beach in San Diego Bay. Forensic evidence links her murder with material in Crone's garage. Crone had both opportunity and motive: Kalista had recently ended their affair, and may have been deserting him professionally as well, moving on to a rival genetic research facility. However, when a key witness for the prosecution dies unexpectedly, leaving an incriminating note behind, Crone's innocence seems confirmed-until Madriani hits upon a potentially damning loose end.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8Cc_Ly4PSwEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"William 01 Just William","description":"In Just William at Christmas everyone's favourite troublemaker, William Brown, is back in a collection of hilarious festive stories - now with a gorgeous new cover illustrated by David Roberts.

Entangled uses all of Hancock's skills and knowledge to propel a fantasy adventure like nothing else preceding it. Entangled is a timeslip novel alternating between present day California, Brazil, and prehistoric Spain, with two teenage female protagonists who must come together to avert an incredibly bloodthirsty takeover of the human race. Entangled is the first book in a trilogy relating the story of an unrelentingly evil master magician named Sulpa who is on the loose and determined to destroy humanity. Leoni, a troubled teen from modern day Los Angeles, and Ria, a young woman who lives in Stone Age Spain, meet in a parallel dimension outside the flow of time to stop Sulpa's spectacular, deadly materialization of the modern world. Entangled rides a growing wave of interest in parallel dimensions and imaginary worlds and will have immediate appeal to readers of Philip Pullman, Stephen King, Neil Gaiman, and Kate Mosse, among others. But Entangled has the added merit of being grounded in solid anthropological and scientific research. Hancock calls on his years of research into cutting edge issues, including the \\"Neanderthal Enigma,\\" the nature of consciousness, the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics, parallel realms, time travel, and near death and out-of-body experiences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G_4zpbX243YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The C Standard: Incorporating Technical Corrigendum 1","description":"Table of contents","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e4whAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+C+Standard:+Incorporating+Technical+Corrigendum+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Undying Monster","description":"The Undying Monster (1922) is a horror novel by Jessie Douglas Kerruish. Recognized as a groundbreaking work of lycanthropy, or werewolf fiction, The Undying Monster was adapted into a successful 1942 horror film starring James Ellison, Heather Angel, and John Howard. Haunted for generations, the Hammand family has grown accustomed to tragedy. Early deaths, suicides, and gruesome injuries plague their family tree, and they have long been regarded as pariahs in their rural English community. When Oliver Hammand survives a vicious attack while walking in the woods one night, his sister Swanhild resolves to put an end to the ancient curse. Seeking the guidance of Luna Bartendale, a powerful psychic, Swanhild convinces her brother to join her on a journey of discovery and danger to not only free their family from its dreadful cycle, but to save their own young lives. Together with Luna, they scour ancient archives, investigate ruined graveyards, and search for whatever clues they can find. As they delve deep into the heart of their family's mystery, Oliver falls deeply in love with Luna. Led to the edge of existence itself, the trio find themselves face to face with a horror too terrible to imagine. The Undying Monster is a masterpiece of werewolf fiction by a largely forgotten writer of popular romance, mystery, and horror novels. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of Jessie Douglas Kerruish's The Undying Monster is a classic of English horror fiction reimagined for modern readers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=deNUzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Undying+Monster&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Environmental Toxicology","description":"The fifth edition includes new sections on the use of adverse outcome pathways, how climate change changes how we think about toxicology, and a new chapter on contaminants of emerging concern.

Although some of the book is dated, its conviction that \\"the church's meaning lies in its fulfillment of the sufferings of Christ\\" and that \\"every part of its history is intelligible in terms of the Passion\\" remains perceptive and challenging. Examining Scripture, doctrine, and history, Ramsey paints an intricate portrait of the church as an example of Christ's death and resurrection. He explores Eastern orthodox doctrine; explains the purposes and preconditions of the Reformation; and calls for a renewal of liturgical worship and reconciliation within the communion of the saints. Originally published in 1936 while he was serving as sub-warden of Lincoln Theological College, this was Ramsey's first book. After more than seventy years, its wisdom concerning the relationship between Catholic and Evangelical, and the underlying complementarities and tensions which characterize the Anglican tradition, remains theologically sound and biblically astute.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RACb6TICT4QC&dq=The+Gospel+and+the+Church&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sex & Sensibility (Harlequin Blaze)","description":"Go beyond the headlines and the hype to get the newest findings in the burgeoning field of gender studies.

Native Americans, frontier outlaws, antebellum duelists, authorities and protestors in the civil rights struggle, and present-day hunters have used weapons to survive, to advance causes, or to levy societal control. In Weapons of Mississippi, Kevin Dougherty examines the roles weapons have played in twelve phases of state history. Dougherty not only offers technical background for these devices, but he also presents a new way of understanding the state's history-through the context and development of its weapons. Chapters in the book bring the story of Mississippi's weapons up to date with a discussion of the modern naval shipbuilders on the Coast and interviews with hunters keen to pass on family traditions. As Mississippi progressed from a sparsely populated wilderness to a structured modern society, management of weaponry became one of the main requirements for establishing centralized law and order. Indians, outlaws, runaway slaves, secessionists, and night riders have all posed challenges to the often better-armed authorities. Today, weapons unite Mississippians in the popular pastime of hunting deer, turkey, dove, rabbit, and even bear. In the state's social and cultural character, a shared lore and knowledge of hunting crosses age, racial, and economic lines. Weapons, once used for mere survival, have transformed into instruments masterfully crafted for those harvesting the state's abundant game.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2pMqE2E63XgC&dq=Gentlemen%27s+Blood:+A+Thousand+Years+of+Sword+and+Pistol&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dimensional Man","description":"One of the most important texts of modern times, Herbert Marcuse's analysis and image of a one-dimensional man in a one-dimensional society has shaped many young radicals' way of seeing and experiencing life.

As Douglas Kellner notes in his introduction, Marcuse's greatest work was a 'damning indictment of contemporary Western societies, capitalist and communist.' Yet it also expressed the hopes of a radical philosopher that human freedom and happiness could be greatly expanded beyond the regimented thought and behaviour prevalent in established society. For those who held the reigns of power Marcuse's call to arms threatened civilization to its very core.

From their rise to a championship challenge in the Premiership and subsequent participation in the Champions League semi-finals, they plunged to the brink of bankruptcy and were relegated to the Coca-Cola League - for the first time in their proud history. Theirs is a story of financial mismanagement on a grand scale. In living the dream, they ran up debts of  100 million, and the dream became a nightmare, not just on the pitch, but also in the tabloids, with the trials of Lee Bowyer and Jonathan Woodgate. A succession of managers - David O'Leary, Terry Venables, Peter Reid, Kevin Blackwell and Dennis Wise - have come and gone. Following on from the departure of Peter Ridsdale, a succession of businessmen have also tried to steady the ship in the boardroom, culminating in the dramatic purchase of the club by a certain ex-chairman of Chelsea - Ken Bates - in early 2005. Under Dennis Wise, an inexperienced team was rejuvenated, with the club overcoming a 15-point penalty imposed by the Football League and pushing for automatic promotion. Sadly, their young manager departed to pastures more lucrative mid-season and the challenge died in yet another play-off defeat under the new regime of former hero Gary McAllister. What lies in store for Leeds United now? Can they regain past glories and taste Premier League football once more? Revised and updated, Leeds United: Trials and Tribulations continues the story of Leeds' struggle, with exclusive interviews with many of the club's leading figures during this turbulent period - including Allan Leighton, Peter Ridsdale, Dominic Matteo and Peter Reid.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8xZmbBKe2GsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Standard Bible Atlas","description":"Small group leaders, Bible teachers, and Bible students can use these satellite maps, reproducible maps, charts, chronologies, and time lines to enrich learning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gu3bPAAACAAJ&dq=Standard+Bible+Atlas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Basics of Abstract Algebra","description":"Relations between groups and sets, results and methods of abstract algebra in terms of number theory and geometry, and noncommutative and homological algebra.

He settles on the exotic island among the Malays and mainly deals in river trade. His half-Malay daughter, Nina, is met with reluctance by the local community. But Almayer wants to put an end to his waning career as a merchant and hopes to find the island's hidden gold mine, so that he can return to Amsterdam as a wealthy man, with his daughter, and give her both financial and social status. But fate can be cruel, not least in the colonies. ALMAYER S FOLLY A STORY OF AN EASTERN RIVER This is the story of a man living at the edge of two cultures, having to adapt both sociologically and psychologically to a new environment. Here Conrad masterfully combines romance and adventure with moral and existential issues. Joseph Conrad (1857-1924) was a Polish-born author who left Poland in his teens to avoid enlistment in the Russian Army. He learned English aboard British ships and started writing in that language after settling in England. His most famous novel is \\"Heart of Darkness\\" (1899), which was inspired by his experiences on the open sea.

He won fame early as a preacher and communal leader, but abandoned these pursuits at the height of his influence for the roles of political dissenter and moral gadfly. During World War I he became an outspoken pacifist and supporter of radical causes. Settling permanently in Palestine in 1922, he was a founder and the first president of the Hebrew University. Increasingly, he viewed rapprochement with the Arabs as the practical and moral test of Zionism, and the formation of a bi-national state of Arabs and Jews became his chief political goal. His life interests thus focused on the core issues that confronted and still confront the Jewish people: group survival in democratic America, the direction and character of the return to Zion, and thereconciliation of universal ideals with Jewish aspirations and needs. Dissenter in Zion draws upon a rich corpus of private letters, personal journals, and diaries to offer a moving account of an eloquent and sensitive person grappling with the great questions of the day and of an activist striving to translate private moral feelings into public deeds through politics and diplomacy. We see Magnes disagreeing with Brandeis over the leadership and direction of American Zionism and with Weizmann and Ben-Gurion over ways to achieve peaceful relations with the Arabs; defending himself against charges by Einstein that he was mismanaging the affairs of the Hebrew University; and persistently negotiating with Arab leaders, trying to reach a compromise on the eve of the establishment of the State of Israel. Dissenter in Zion also contains a biographical essay on Magnes by Arthur Goren, assessing his ideas and motives and placing him in the context of his times. It shows Magnes's profundity without covering up his weaknesses, his lifelong tactic for courting repeated defeat in favor of long-term goals that could not come to pass in his lifetime.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7A9z54ju7aAC&dq=Dissenter+in+Zion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secular Journal of Thomas Merton","description":"\\"Could it ever possibly mean that I might some day become a monk in this monastery?\\" The young man who wrote these words in his journal on April 12, 1941, was a recent Columbia graduate and Catholic convert.

For decades, Demi Moore has been synonymous with celebrity. From iconic film roles to high-profile relationships, Moore has never been far from the spotlight or the headlines. Even as Demi was becoming the highest paid actress in Hollywood, however, she was always outrunning her past, just one step ahead of the doubts and insecurities that defined her childhood. Throughout her rise to fame and during some of the most pivotal moments of her life, Demi battled addiction, body image issues, and childhood trauma that would follow her for years all while juggling a skyrocketing career and at times negative public perception. As her success grew, Demi found herself questioning if she belonged in Hollywood, if she was a good mother, a good actress and, always, if she was simply good enough. As much as her story is about adversity, it is also about tremendous resilience. In this deeply candid and reflective memoir, Demi pulls back the curtain and opens up about her career and personal life laying bare her tumultuous relationship with her mother, her marriages, her struggles balancing stardom with raising a family, and her journey toward open heartedness.

Just as she and her family settled into a new home, her father would tell them it was time to say their goodbyes. The instability wrought by Nadia s nomadic childhood was deepened by family secrets and fractures, both lived and inherited. Her Armenian American mother, who abandoned Nadia when she was two, would periodically reappear, only to vanish again. Her father, a Ghanaian, the great hero of her life, died when she was thirteen. After his passing, Nadia s stepmother weighed her down with a revelation that was either a bombshell secret or a lie, rife with shaming innuendo. With these and other ruptures, Nadia arrived in New York as a young woman feeling stateless, motherless, and uncertain about her future, yet eager to find her own identity. What followed, however, were periods of depression in which she struggled to hold herself and her siblings together. Aftershocks is the way she hauled herself from the wreckage of her life s perpetual quaking, the means by which she has finally come to understand that the only ground firm enough to count on is the one written into existence by her own hand.

Considers the possibility that the medieval castle of Gisors hides the Templar treasure. ? Examines all the evidence for a secret order within the Templars, whose heretical ideology brought down the wrath of King Philip of France. When French King Philip the Fair ordered the arrest of the Knights Templars and the confiscation of their property in 1307, the Templars were one of the most powerful forces in Europe, answerable only to the Pope. It was also one of the richest, despite its knights' vow of poverty. Yet not a penny of their immense treasure was ever found. The hunt for this lost treasure has centered on a number of locations, among which is the medieval city of Gisors, a site on the Normandy and French border that is honeycombed with complex underground passageways and chambers. Mysteriously, all attempts to discover what may be concealed in these subterranean corridors are rigorously discouraged by contemporary authorities. The enigma of the treasure is but one of the many unsolved mysteries concerning this order that continues to haunt our imaginations. Who were these \\"poor knights of Christ\\" who made denial of Jesus a requirement of acceptance into the order? What were their true purposes and what was the nature of their secret that drew the wrath of the king of France down on their heads? Was there really a treasure and, if so, what was it--material wealth or something more powerful, such as the Holy Grail or the secret to the philosopher's stone? Was there a secret order within the order that authorized the heretical practices for which they were condemned? In a search for answers to these and other questions, Celtic and medieval scholar Jean Markale goes back to original source documents in an attempt to clear away the baseless assumptions that have sprung up about the Templars and to shine new light on their activities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NC_FGwAACAAJ&dq=The+Templar+Treasure+at+Gisors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managing Your Headaches","description":"Headaches seriously affect the quality of life for millions of sufferers.

A poignant, bittersweet homage to love that overpowers reason, to the resilience of the human spirit, and to the worldweary beauty and majesty of Venice, Across the River and into the Trees stands as Hemingway's statement of defiance in response to the great dehumanizing atrocities of the Second World War.

This is the true story of Nora, the woman who, transformed by Joyce's imagination, became Molly Bloom, arguably the most famous female character in twentieth-century literature. It is also the story of Ireland, a social history encapsulated in the vivid recreation of Joyce and his small Irish entourage abroad. Ultimately it is the portrait of a relationship -- of Nora's complicated, committed, and at times shocking relationship with a hardworking, hard drinking genius and with his work.

Such grammar and vocabulary do not appear as frequently in everyday conversation as those words and structures they have learned up to this point, necessitating that they spend ample time on review. Moreover, learners at this stage are expected to become familiar with verb tense and aspect, time expressions, conditional clauses, and other topics that require them to have a solid grasp of context and speaker intent if they are to fully understand the differences in meaning conveyed by each. Such points cannot be mastered by reading through grammatical explanations alone. In short, the mid-beginner level is a difficult one for many adult learners who, unlike students in school, have neither time nor opportunities to take repeated tests or to otherwise gauge their progress. Japanese for Busy People II, Revised 3rd Edition helps overcome the above obstacles through grammar and content topics carefully selected to be appropriate to learners at this level of Japanese proficiency. The book is designed so that by practicing talking about each topic, learners will gradually and effectively acquire sentence patterns and vocabulary related to that topic. Like Volume I, Volume II is organized into several large units, each covering topics grouped under a particular theme. In this way, the book enables learners to achieve a well-balanced understanding of grammar, sentence structure, and context. Themes and lesson objectives of the five units in Volume II are as follows. Unit 1: Souvenir Shopping Following up on Volume I, Unit 1 presents survival Japanese related to shopping, thus providing learners with a thorough review of simple clauses. The unit also goes beyond what was covered in Volume I by showing ways of asking someone s opinion while shopping, making comparisons between items, and describing an item s characteristics. The overall theme is \\"picking souvenirs,\\" a subject that should be relevant to learners both in Japan and abroad. The verbal skills and dialogue patterns studied here may be applied not only to shopping but also more broadly to any situation that involves choosing between options. Unit 2: Building Rapport with Colleagues This unit introduces the plain forms of verbs   a crucial component of Japanese compound sentences   along with several sentence-final elements that make use of these forms. Topics are selected from among those that typically come up when interacting with people from work. Covered are constructions for indicating interest in another s actions, inviting someone to do something outside of work, asking for help or offering advice, and otherwise interacting with people in ways that help build relationships of trust and understanding. Unit 3: Returning to Japan for Work This unit explains how to build sentences using temporal clauses, direct and indirect quotation, and attributive modifiers. Through talking about factual events in one s life history or in that of a particular neighborhood, learners will study how to relate an event in chronological sequence, compare the way something is now to how it was in the past, and describe facilities and other things around them. Unit 4: Planning a Vacation Along with sentences with clauses for stating reasons or reporting questions, this unit covers sentence-final elements used to express indefiniteness, for example wish or probability. Topics deal with verbal skills necessary for planning and carrying out activities in cooperation with others, including explaining reasons or circumstances, expressing probability, and indicating desire. The overall theme is that of planning and going on a trip to a unique place in Japan. Unit 5: Solving Problems The focus of this unit is on forming conditional clauses. Topics include preparing for earthquakes or other disasters, discussing dreams for the future, solving problems, helping someone who is lost, and other situations that call on learners to talk about what might happen in the future, discuss options for solving problems, and give instructions or explain steps for doing something.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vZ1NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Japanese+for+Busy+People+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Felt Board Stories","description":"Presents twenty-five seasonal stories for retelling with a flannel board, and provides patterns for felt pieces and suggestions for related games and activities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G0yXPAAACAAJ&dq=Felt+Board+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Disaster Mental Health Services: A Primer for Practitioners (Routledge Psychosocial Stress Series)","description":"Disaster mental health is a growing field of practice designed to help victims and relief workers learn to effectively cope with the extreme stresses they will face in the aftermath of a disaster.

Since the inception of the Library in 1906, nearly 1200 unique volumes have been published, constantly placing the world's greatest books before a large public. A few of these titles proved unpopular and were never reprinted. But most were reprinted dozens of times, packaged in numerous ways, and benefited from updated editorial work and book design over the last century. Terry Seymour has studied and researched every aspect of this great mass of books. He now captures and distills this knowledge in A Printing History of Everyman's Library 1906-1982. A critical feature, of course, is to update the various collecting factoids that have emerged since 2005 when his Guide to Collecting Everyman's Library was published. The meat of the new book, however, is the Bibliographical Entries section. Each volume that has ever been printed receives its own entry, detailing every printing, each dust jacket variation, any new introductions, updated scarcity numbers, and all relevant notes. Typically an entry contains at least six lines of information, but often much more. In essence, each entry is a story written exclusively about each volume. Armed with this resource, collectors and booksellers can know reliably everything about the Everyman's Library volume that sits on their shelf or is ready to be purchased or sold. They will see how a book fits into the total printing history of that title, and be able to describe and value the book with precision. To further enhance the value of this book, color images illustrate all of the key collecting points. An extensive index of editors, translators and artists is now included. Not just a solo effort, the Printing History has been vetted by other expert collectors, ensuring greater accuracy and comprehensiveness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DbUp4qfbE_sC&dq=Collected+Stories+Pb+(Everyman)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Islamic Sacred Architecture: A Stylistic History","description":"Against a backdrop of Islamophobia, Europeans are increasingly airbrushing from history their cultural debt to the Muslim world. But this legacy lives on in some of Europe's most recognizable buildings, from Notre-Dame Cathedral to the Houses of Parliament. This beautifully illustrated book reveals the Arab and Islamic roots of Europe's architectural heritage. Diana Darke traces ideas and styles from vibrant Middle Eastern centers like Damascus, Baghdad and Cairo, via Muslim Spain, Venice and Sicily into Europe. She describes how medieval crusaders, pilgrims and merchants encountered Arab Muslim culture on their way to the Holy Land; and explores more recent artistic interaction between Ottoman and Western cultures, including Sir Christopher Wren's inspirations in the \\"Saracen\\" style of Gothic architecture. Recovering this long yet overlooked history of architectural \\"borrowing,\\" Stealing from the Saracens is a rich tale of cultural exchange, shedding new light on Europe's greatest landmarks.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sRUOEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real Matter","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=adnv-DLBgdAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Empty Sleeves (Contemporary Poetry Series)","description":"From a world tilted a fraction off its axis, these poems speak of angels in Maine and Balinese dinners beneath the Kansas prarie moon.

In this collection, language seeks to replicate the world, wresting the soul to all its fluent conjugations--the discourse of insects on the forest floor, the rhetoric of ballroom dancers, the crusty inflections of brushstrokes in an Edward Hopper painting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LGNCNjTvq4sC&dq=Empty+Sleeves+(Contemporary+Poetry+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oracle9i Development By Example","description":"Annotation Find out how to use Oracle9i to get a business where it needs to be for the future of the Internet.

His time with his family, in a world of homemade pasta, loud talk, and never-spoken love, forces him to confront his past, while he helps his mother face her mortality. Three love interests tempt Gus further from his failing marriage: Helen Boisclair, a beautiful Creole he has loved since grammar school, Maritornes MartA-nez, his sexy first girlfriend, and Maggie McGuinnis, a college crush and present chiropractor, who still believes in Gus.

All of 31 inches tall, Cady is a true survivor in a town where -- as she says -- \\"you can die of encouragement.\\" Her early starring role as a lovable elf in an immensely popular American film proved a major disappointment, since moviegoers never saw the face behind the stifling rubber suit she was required to wear. Now, after a decade of hollow promises from the Industry, she is reduced to performing at birthday parties and bat mitzvahs as she waits for the miracle that will finally make her a star. In a series of mordantly funny journal entries, Maupin tracks his spunky heroine across the saffron-hazed wasteland of Los Angeles -- from her all-too-infrequent meetings with agents and studio moguls to her regular harrowing encounters with small children, large dogs and human ignorance. Then one day a lanky piano player saunters into Cady's life, unleashing heady new emotions, and she finds herself going for broke, shooting the moon with a scheme so harebrained and daring that it just might succeed. Her accomplice in the venture is her best friend, Jeff, a gay waiter who sees Cady's struggle for visibility as a natural extension of his own war against the Hollywood Closet. As clear-eyed as it is charming, Maybe the Moon is a modern parable about the mythology of the movies and the toll it exacts from it participants on both sides of the screen. It is a work that speaks to the resilience of the human spirit from a perspective rarely found in literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i3CeYO7tWG0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pundits Folly:","description":"In this spectacle of words, the world is a sea of glass: a pageant of fond delight, a theatre of vanity, a labyrinth of error, a gulf of grief, a sty of filthiness, a vale of misery, a spectacle of woe, a river of tears, a stage of deceit, a cage full of devils, a den of scorpions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=484EAAAACAAJ&dq=Pundits+Folly:&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Greatest Football Games of All Time","description":"Profiles the most exciting games in professional football history","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6HvkRmfHcFwC&dq=Greatest+Football+Games+of+All+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Vatican empire","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f2RLAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Vatican+empire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ways of Escape","description":"This autobiographical essay is a sequel to \\"A Sort of Life\\".

It was general knowledge that the route of the Oregon Trail through the Blue Mountains and down the Columbia River to The Dalles was grueling and dangerous. About 1,200 men, women, and children in over two hundred wagons accepted fur trapper and guide Stephen Meek's offer to lead them on a shortcut across the trackless high desert of eastern Oregon. Those who followed Meek experienced a terrible ordeal when his memory of the terrain apparently failed. Lost for weeks with little or no water and a shortage of food, the Overlanders encountered deep dust, alkali lakes, and steep, rocky terrain. Many became ill and some died in the forty days it took to travel from the Snake River in present-day Idaho to the Deschutes River near Bend, Oregon. Stories persist that children in the group found gold nuggets in a small, dry creek bed along the way. From 2006 to 2011, Brooks Ragan and a team of specialists in history, geology, global positioning, metal detecting, and aerial photography spent weeks every spring and summer tracing the Meek Cutoff. They located wagon ruts, gravesites, and other physical evidence from the most difficult part of the trail, from Vale, Oregon, to the upper reaches of the Crooked River and to a location near Redmond where a section of the train reached the Deschutes. The Meek Cutoff moves readers back and forth in time, using surviving journals from members of the 1845 party, detailed day-to-day maps, aerial photographs, and descriptions of the modern-day exploration to document an extraordinary story of the Oregon Trail.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OKkpDAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Lost+Wagon+Train&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dada and Surrealism: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)","description":"A stimulating introduction to the many debates surrounding the Dadaist and Surrealist movements, such as the Marquis de Sade's position as a Surrealist deity, attitudes towards the city, the impact of Freud, and attitudes towards women.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W3kRDAAAQBAJ&dq=Dada+and+Surrealism:+A+Very+Short+Introduction+(Very+Short+Introductions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Soul of Vermont","description":"A photographic celebration of Vermont's landscape and people documents the experiences of native residents who work the land, in a lavish tribute that considers how their way of life is rapidly changing.

Desperate to break from the  mundane happiness  of Houston, budding writer Danny Deck hops in his car,  El Chevy,  bound for the West Coast on a road trip filled with broken hearts and bleak realities of the artistic life. A cast of unforgettable characters joins the naive troubadour s pilgrimage to California and back to Texas, including a cruel, long-legged beauty; an appealing screenwriter; a randy college professor; and a genuine if painfully  normal  friend. Since the novel s publication in 1972, Danny Deck has  been far more successful at getting loved by readers than he ever was at getting loved by the women in his life  (McMurtry), a testament to the author s incomparable talent for capturing the essential tragicomedy of the human experience.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6b86DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Napoleon's Commanders (2): c.1809-15 (Elite) (Vol 2)","description":"Acta Periodica Duellatorum (APD) is an independent, international, and peer-reviewed journal dedicated to Historical European Martial Arts studies.

In fact, historians have assumed that adoption had generally not been practiced in France or in the rest of Europe since late antiquity. Challenging this view, Kristin Gager brings to light evidence showing how married couples and single men and women from the artisan neighborhoods in early modern Paris did manage to adopt children as their legal heirs. In so doing, she offers a new, richly detailed portrait of family life, civil law, and public assistance in Paris, and reveals how citizens forged a wide variety of family forms in defiance of social, cultural, and legal norms. Gager bases her work on documents ranging from previously unexplored notarized contracts of adoption to court cases, theological treatises, and literary texts. She examines two main patterns of adoption: those privately arranged between households and those of destitute children from the Parisian foundling hospice and the H?tel-Dieu. Gager argues that although customary law rejected adoption and promoted an exclusively biological model of the family, there existed an alternative domestic culture based on a variety of \\"fictive\\" ties. Gager connects her arguments to current debates about adoption and the nature of the family in Europe and the United States. Originally published in 1996.

But suddenly their only hope for survival--never mind victory--was to unite to stop a mighty foe--one whose frightening technology appeared invincible. Far worse beings than the Nazis were loose. From Warsaw to Moscow to China's enemy-occupied Forbidden City, the nations of the world had been forced into an uneasy alliance since humanity began its struggle against overwhelming odds. In Germany, where the banshee wail of hostile jets screamed across the land, caches of once-forbidden weapons were unearthed, and unthinkable tactics were employed against the enemy. Brilliantly innovative military strategists confronted challenges unprecedented in the history of warfare. Even as lack of fuel forced people back to horse and carriage, physicists worked feverishly to create the first nuclear bombs--with horrifying results. City after city joined the atomic pyre as the planet erupted in fiery ruins. Yet the crisis continued--on land, sea, and in the air--as humanity writhed in global combat. The tactics of daredevil guerrillas everywhere became increasingly ingenious against a superior foe whose desperate retaliation would grow ever more fearsome. No one had ever put the United States, or the world, in such deadly danger. But if the carnage and annihilation ever stopped, would there be any pieces to pick up? \\"From the Hardcover edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5e2JAAAACAAJ&dq=Upsetting+the+Balance+(Worldwar+Series,+Volume+3)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Quieted Voice: The Rise and Demise of Localism in American Radio","description":"How has American radio once a grassroots, community-based medium become a generic service that primarily benefits owners and shareholders and prohibits its listeners from receiving diversity of opinions, ideas, and entertainment through local programming? In The Quieted Voice: The Rise and Demise of Localism in American Radio, Robert L. Hilliard and Michael C. Keith blame the government s continual deregulation of radio and the corporate obsession with the bottom line in the wake of the far-reaching and controversial Telecommunications Act of 1996. Fighting for greater democratization of the airwaves, Hilliard and Keith call for a return to localism to save radio from rampant media conglomeration and ever-narrowing music playlists and to save Americans from corporate and government control of public information. The Quieted Voice details radio s obligation to broadcast in the public s interest. Hilliard and Keith trace the origins of the public trusteeship behind the medium and argue that local programming is essential to the fulfillment of this responsibility. From historical and critical perspectives, they examine the decline of community-centered programming and outline the efforts of media watchdog and special interest groups that have vigorously opposed the decline of democracy and diversity in American radio. They also evaluate the implications of continuing delocalization of the radio medium and survey the perspectives of leading media scholars and experts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qlm4AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Quieted+Voice:+The+Rise+and+Demise+of+Localism+in+American+Radio&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Parables for Preachers: The Gospel of Matthew-Year A","description":"The parables of Jesus are puzzling sayings and stories with world-transforming potential.

Many of these plants also thrive across a wide region of the eastern United States and Canada, making this guide a remarkably helpful resource for both mid-Atlantic naturalists--amateur and experienced--and botanical enthusiasts across North America. Author Melanie Choukas-Bradley and illustrator Tina Thieme Brown have teamed up once again to create a practical tool for answering the age-old question frequently raised by visitors to the woods: \\"What is that plant over there?\\" At the same time, Choukas-Bradley and Brown aim to educate by presenting the plants grouped by family, so that the observer will learn to anticipate the presence of certain plants based on an understanding of their family characteristics. The text describes each plant's flower, leaf, and growth habit, gives its ideal habitat and range, describes similar species that might be confused with the plant, and gives an herbal history where applicable. And because plants are organized by family and genus, the scholarly reader can build on his or her botanical knowledge.

Henry Adams is perhaps the most eclectic, accomplished, and important American writer of his time. His autobiography and modern classic The Education of Henry Adams was widely considered one of the best English-language nonfiction books of the 20th century. The last member of his distinguished family after great-grandfather John Adams, and grandfather John Quincy Adams to gain national attention, he is remembered today as an historian, a political commentator, and a memoirist. Now, historian David Brown sheds light on the brilliant yet under-celebrated life of this major American intellectual. Adams not only lived through the Civil War and the Industrial Revolution but he met Abraham Lincoln, bowed before Queen Victoria, and counted Secretary of State John Hay, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, and President Theodore Roosevelt as friends and neighbors. His observations of these powerful men and their policies in his private letters provide a penetrating assessment of Gilded Age America on the cusp of the modern era.  Thoroughly researched and gracefully written  (The Wall Street Journal), The Last American Aristocrat details Adams s relationships with his wife (Marian  Clover  Hooper) and, following her suicide, Elizabeth Cameron, the young wife of a senator and part of the famous Sherman clan from Ohio. Henry Adams s letters thousands of them demonstrate his struggles with depression, familial expectations, and reconciling with his unwanted widower s existence. Offering a fresh window on nineteenth century US history, as well as a more  modern  and  human  Henry Adams than ever before, The Last American Aristocrat is a  standout portrait of the man and his era  (Publishers Weekly, starred review).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2efNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Touch Of Magic","description":"What's a young mage to do in a land where magic is illegal, and the penalty is death?

In the 1940s, FDR was the first airborne president, flying several times in a C-54 nicknamed the \\"Sacred Cow.\\" In the 1950s, it was aircraft known as \\"Independence\\", \\"Columbine II\\" and \\"Columbine III\\" that transported Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower on occasion. But it was not until after the Korean War, with the United States becoming the leader of the free world, that presidential air travel entered the modern age. The jet-age mobility of the American presidency beginning in the 1960s corresponds directly to the nation's emergence as a super power. Air Force One: The Aircraft that Shaped the Modern Presidency is the story of the planes, the Presidents, their staff and, their many trips across the nation and around the globe. But it's also more than that, it is a vehicle for better understanding the activities and dealings of each presidential administration in the second half of the twentieth century. Through vibrant photography, this book communicates the story of a unique set of planes and the presidents who made them a vital national asset. Now all of these planes and their famous passengers have been captured. Written by Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum curator Von Hardesty and featuring over 200 illustrations, including new photos of the airplane's interiors, this book takes you on a memorable flight through history.

Nowhere did this unusual art form reach greater popularity than in China, beginning a thousand years ago and continuing to this day. Using the kingfisher-with its uniquely iridescent range of ultramarine to bright turquoise-blue feathers-as their bird of choice, Chinese artisans created extraordinary objects, rendering the many-hued feathers with exquisite technique. The sheer breadth of these objects is staggering, from massive eight-foot-tall screens to tiny two-inch-long hair pins, from ornately ornamental lanterns to elegantly simple bird cages.

Which actions will be most cost effective, considering the true range of impacts and costs incurred? In 1997, the H. John Heinz III Center for Science, Economics and the Environment began a two-year study with a panel of experts to help develop new strategies to identify and reduce the costs of weather-related hazards associated with rapidly increasing coastal development activities.The Hidden Costs of Coastal Hazards presents the panel's findings, offering the first in-depth study that considers the costs of coastal hazards to natural resources, social institutions, business, and the built environment. Using Hurricane Hugo, which struck South Carolina in 1989, as a case study, it provides for the first time information on the full range of economic costs caused by a major coastal hazard event. The book: describes and examines unreported, undocumented, and hidden costs such as losses due to business interruption, reduction in property values, interruption of social services, psychological trauma, damage to natural systems, and others examines the concepts of risk and vulnerability, and discusses conventional approaches to risk assessment and the emerging area of vulnerability assessment recommends a comprehensive framework for developing and implementing mitigation strategies documents the human impact of Hurricane Hugo and provides insight from those who lived through it.The Hidden Costs of Coastal Hazards takes a structured approach to the problem of coastal hazards, offering a new framework for community-based hazard mitigation along with specific recommendations for implementation. Decisionmakers -- both policymakers and planners -- who are interested in coastal hazard issues will find the book a unique source of new information and insight, as will private-sector decisionmakers including lenders, investors, developers, and insurers of coastal property.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yNDltwKNSQEC&dq=The+Hidden+Costs+of+Coastal+Hazards:+Implications+For+Risk+Assessment+And+Mitigation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saturday at the New You","description":"Shauna, a young African American girl, loves helping Momma with the customers at her beauty salon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lAYDAAAACAAJ&dq=Saturday+at+the+New+You&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern Language Bible-OE","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Queen of the Dark Chamber","description":"It is a time of heavy persecution in China.

In 2015, Bloomberg News named Steve Bannon  the most dangerous political operative in America.  Since then, he has grown exponentially more powerful and not only in the United States. In this groundbreaking and urgent account, award-winning scholar of the radical right Benjamin Teitelbaum takes readers behind-the-scenes of Bannon's global campaign against modernity. Inspired by a radical twentieth-century ideology called Traditionalism, Bannon and a small group of right-wing powerbrokers are planning new political mobilizations on a global scale discussed and debated in secret meetings organized by Bannon in hotel suites and private apartments in DC, Europe and South America. Their goal? To upend the world order and reorganize geopolitics on the basis of archaic values rather than modern ideals of democracy, freedom, social progress, and human rights. Their strenuous efforts are already producing results, from the fortification of borders throughout the world and the targeting of immigrants, to the undermining of the European Union and United States governments, and the expansion of Russian influence. Drawing from exclusive interviews with Bannon s hidden network of far-right thinkers, years of academic research into the radical right, and with unprecedented access to the esoteric salons where they meet, Teitelbaum exposes their considerable impact on the world and their radical vision for the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O1WaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quilting As a Hobby","description":"Modern Quilting 10 Modern Quilt Patterns And Ideas For Your Home Quilting is a hobby that has been around for centuries, but it hasn't evolved as quickly as other hobbies have.

A casual conversation-or any social interaction that the rest of us take for granted-will, for Morgan, always be a cryptogram that must be painstakingly decoded. He lives in a world of his own: an autistic world. In Not Even Wrong, Paul Collins melds a memoir of his son's autism with a journey into this realm of permanent outsiders. Examining forgotten geniuses and obscure medical archives, Collins's travels take him from an English churchyard to the Seattle labs of Microsoft, and from a Wisconsin prison cell block to the streets of Vienna. It is a story that reaches from a lonely clearing in the Black Forest into the London palace of King George I, from Defoe and Swift to the discovery of evolution; from the modern dawn of the computer revolution to, in the end, the author's own household. Not Even Wrong is a haunting journey into the borderlands of neurology - a meditation on what \\"normal\\" is, and how human genius comes to us in strange and wondrous forms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EHeaQgAACAAJ&dq=Not+Even+Wrong:+Adventures+in+Autism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Windrow Garden","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RwZbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Windrow+Garden&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"St. Paul the traveller and the Roman citizen","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_cZ4kQhiRjQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Silent Language","description":"A study of the non-verbal language which exists in every culture, the elaborate patterns of behavior through which we communicate","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JsOSDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Silent+Language&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inside TCP/IP","description":"A tutorial for those needing to administer a TCP/IP network.

A remarkable introduction to cultural studies, Patterns of Culture made history in exploring the role of culture in shaping our lives. In it, the renowned anthropologist Ruth Benedict offers an in-depth look at three societies the Zu?i of the southwestern United States, the Kwakiutl of western Canada, and the Dobuans of Melanesia and demonstrates the diversity of behaviors in them. Benedict s groundbreaking study shows that a unique configuration of traits defines each human culture and she examines the relationship between culture and the individual. Featuring prefatory remarks by Franz Boas, Margaret Mead, and Louise Lamphere, who calls it  a foundational text in teaching us the value of diversity,  this provocative work ultimately explores what it means to be human.  That today the modern world is on such easy terms with the concept of culture . . . is in very great part due to this book.

And ain't that a big enough majority in any town?\\" -- Mark Twain Ross Thomas chose the quotation from Huckleberry Finn as the text of his post World War II story as well as for the title. When Lucifer Dye is released from three months in a Hong Kong prison, debriefed, handed a false passport, a new wardrobe and a $20,000 check, his haughty control makes it clear that Dye's career with his country has been permanently terminated. But a good agent is always in demand, and just a few hours later Dye is being interviewed for a highly ingenious position. Victor Orcutt, although a not very good imitation of a British pre-war gent, has creative talents of his own. He has his sights a small southern city, with the ordinary run-of-the-mill corruption one would expect in such a place. The canny Orcott knows there's no profit in that . His creed is \\"To get better, it must be much worse.\\" He and his two associates have looked up Dye's history, and he now offers the ex-spy's a mission. For two and a half times the government's bounty, Dye is to thoroughly corrupt the town. And the sly Dye takes the offer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zMWEVj-Kv0cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theology for Skeptics","description":"In these nine short chapters, Soelle seeks to leverage our incipient desire for social, political, and gender justice into commitment to God's justice.

'Science in Modern Poetry: New Directions' is the first collection of essays to focus specifically on what poets in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have made of the scientific developments going on around them. In a collection of twelve essays, leading experts on modern poetry and on literature and science explore how poets have used scientific language in their poems, how poetry can offer new perspectives on science, and how the 'Two Cultures' can and have come together in the work of poets from Britain and Ireland, America and Australia. What does the poetry of a leading immunologist and a Nobel-Prize-winning chemist tell us about how poetry can engage with science? Scientific experiments aim to yield knowledge, but what do the linguistic and formal experiments of contemporary American poets suggest about knowledge in their turn? How can universities help to bring these different experimental cultures and practices together? What questions do literary critics need to ask themselves when looking at poems that respond to science? How did developments in biology between the wars shape modernist poetry? What did William Empson make of science fiction, Ezra Pound of the fourth dimension, Thomas Hardy of anthropology? How did modern poets from W. B. Yeats to Elizabeth Bishop and Judith Wright respond to the legacy of Charles Darwin? This book aims to answer these questions and more, in the process setting out the state of the field and suggesting new directions and approaches for research by students and scholars working on the fertile relationship between science and poetry today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EHVvEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ecology (Science Fair Project Series)","description":"\\"Presents several science projects and science fair ideas dealing with ecology and environmental studies\\"--Provided by publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yYi_oFUqzNoC&dq=Ecology+(Science+Fair+Project+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"August Folly The Barsetshire Novels","description":"It's August in the Barsetshire village of Worsted, and Richard Tebben, just down from Oxford, is contemplating the gloomy prospect of a long summer in the parental home.

Important examples of this are the motion of stars in galaxies, ions in hot gas plasmas, electrons in semiconductor devices, and atoms in solids and liquids. The behavior of the system is studied by programming into the computer a model of the system and then performing experiments with this model. New scientific insight is obtained by observing such computer experiments, often for controlled conditions that are not accessible in the laboratory. Computer Simulation using Particles deals with the simulation of systems by following the motion of their constituent particles. This book provides an introduction to simulation using particles based on the NGP, CIC, and P3M algorithms and the programming principles that assist with the preparations of large simulation programs based on the OLYMPUS methodology. It also includes case study examples in the fields of astrophysics, plasmas, semiconductors, and ionic solids as well as more detailed mathematical treatment of the models, such as their errors, dispersion, and optimization. This resource will help you understand how engineering design can be assisted by the ability to predict performance using the computer model before embarking on costly and time-consuming manufacture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8JQvngEACAAJ&dq=Computer+Simulation+Using+Particles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Henri Matisse: The Vence Chapel: The Archive of a Creation","description":"Henri Matisse: The Vence Chapel, The Archive of a Creation Conversations and Correspondence with Marie-Alain Couturier and Louis-Bertrand Rayssiguier Edited and introduced by Marcel Billot Henri Matisse devoted four years of his life to designing the Vence Chapel, his \\"crowning achievement,\\" as he himself stated on several occasions. Though the circumstances which led to the creation of this unique building are well known--the project originated with Sister Jacques-Marie, who nursed the aging painter back to health after his brush with death in 1942--the story of the Chapel's construction has long remained shrouded in mystery. Much of the material in this book is drawn from the Couturier Archives. The bulk of the archive consists of the notes of Brother Louis-Bertrand Rayssiguier, the young Dominican monk who drew the plan of the Chapel and worked closely with Matisse on all phases of its building and decorating. From December 1947 to June 1951, Rayssiguier met frequently with the artist and recorded their conversations verbatim. His notes allow the reader to follow day by day the unfolding of one of the supreme masterpieces of religious art in the twentieth century. Even more significantly, they give us a rare glimpse into the artist's private world. They chronicle his disappointments and his moments of elation, his habits and his foibles, his reactions to contemporary developments in the art world, as well as his deepest personal beliefs. Gifted with an unusually keen sense of observation, Rayssiguier shows us Matisse at work as well as Matisse relaxing in the intimacy of his own home. Completing this invaluable record, the correspondence between Matisse and Father Marie-Alain Couturier, the Dominican priest at the forefront of the post-World War II movement to commission works of religious art from leading modern painters and sculptors, details the creation of the Chapel's most remarkable feature--Matisse's bold stained-glass windows. An expert on stained glass and the chief editor of L'Art sacre, an influential review devoted to religious art around the world, Courutier took care of all the logistical and technical matters relating to these great windows. The numerous letters he and the artist exchanged are in themselves a fascinating exchange on the art and the significance of modern stained glass. This archive charts a unique journey to the heart of artistic creativity. The compilation of documents published here for the first time in English is abundantly illustrated with sketches by Matisse and photographic records that show the successive stages of the Chapel's completion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gUlQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Henri+Matisse:+The+Vence+Chapel:+The+Archive+of+a+Creation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Religions of Rome: v. 1","description":"This book presents a wide range of documents illustrating religious life in the Roman world from the early Republic to the late Empire.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xQd82l39KX4C&dq=Religions+of+Rome:+v.+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","description":"50TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION WITH A NEW INTRODUCTION BY DAVID MITCHELL AND A NEW AFTERWORD BY CHARLIE JANE ANDERS Ursula K.

Beginning in November 1944, the 761st Tank Battalion engaged the enemy for 183 straight days, spearheading many of General Patton's offensives at the Battle of the Bulge and in six European countries. No other unit fought for so long and so hard without respite. The 761st defeated more than 6,000 enemy soldiers, captured thirty towns, liberated Jews from concentration camps and made history as the first African American armored unit to enter the war.

A spectacular success.\\" --Anthony Marra, New York Times Book Review \\"A dream of a novel... Part mystery, part war story, part romance.\\" --Anthony Doerr, author of All the Light We Cannot See Vienna, 1914. Lucius is a twenty-two-year-old medical student when World War I explodes across Europe. Enraptured by romantic tales of battlefield surgery, he enlists, expecting a position at a well-organized field hospital. But when he arrives, at a commandeered church tucked away high in a remote valley of the Carpathian Mountains, he finds a freezing outpost ravaged by typhus. The other doctors have fled, and only a single, mysterious nurse named Sister Margarete remains. But Lucius has never lifted a surgeon's scalpel. And as the war rages across the winter landscape, he finds himself falling in love with the woman from whom he must learn a brutal, makeshift medicine. Then one day, an unconscious soldier is brought in from the snow, his uniform stuffed with strange drawings. He seems beyond rescue, until Lucius makes a fateful decision that will change the lives of doctor, patient, and nurse forever. From the gilded ballrooms of Imperial Vienna to the frozen forests of the Eastern Front; from hardscrabble operating rooms to battlefields thundering with Cossack cavalry, The Winter Soldier is the story of war and medicine, of family, of finding love in the sweeping tides of history, and finally, of the mistakes we make, and the precious opportunities to atone.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sAtGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bridegroom","description":"The bestselling follow-up to Jesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist. Includes a reader's guide and an excerpt from Pitre's The Case for Jesus. In Jesus the Bridegroom, Brant Pitre once again taps into the wells of Jewish Scripture and tradition, and unlocks the secrets of what is arguably the most well-known symbol of the Christian faith: the cross of Christ. In this thrilling exploration, Pitre shows how the suffering and death of Jesus was far more than a tragic Roman execution. Instead, the Passion of Christ was the fulfillment of ancient Jewish prophecies of a wedding, when the God of the universe would wed himself to humankind in an everlasting nuptial covenant. To be sure, most Christians are familiar with the apostle Paul's teaching that Christ is the 'Bridegroom' and the Church is the 'Bride'. But what does this really mean? And what would ever possess Paul to compare the death of Christ to the love of a husband for his wife? If you would have been at the Crucifixion, with Jesus hanging there dying, is that how you would have described it? How could a first-century Jew like Paul, who knew how brutal Roman crucifixions were, have ever compared the execution of Jesus to a wedding? And why does he refer to this as the \\"great mystery\\" (Ephesians 5:32)? As Pitre shows, the key to unlocking this mystery can be found by going back to Jewish Scripture and tradition and seeing the entire history of salvation, from Mount Sinai to Mount Calvary, as a divine love story between Creator and creature, between God and Israel, between Christ and his bride--a story that comes to its climax on the wood of a Roman cross. In the pages of Jesus the Bridegroom, dozens of familiar passages in the Bible--the Exodus, the Song of Songs, the Wedding at Cana, the Woman at the Well, the Last Supper, the Crucifixion, and even the Second Coming at the End of Time--are suddenly transformed before our eyes. Indeed, when seen in the light of Jewish Scripture and tradition, the life of Christ is nothing less than the greatest love story ever told.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xxVHDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Bridegroom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Luciferian Witchcraft","description":"Second Edition completely revised and edited version now available!

The earth is becoming what author David Quammen has called a \\"planet of weeds.\\" Nature Out of Place brings this devastating but overlooked crisis to the forefront of public consciousness by offering a fascinating exploration of its causes and consequences, along with a thoughtful and practical consideration of what can be done about it. The father and son team of Jason and Roy Van Driesche offer a unique combination of narratives that highlight specific locations and problems along with comprehensive explanations of the underlying scientific and policy issues.Chapters examine Hawaii, where introduced feral pigs are destroying the islands' native forests; zebra mussel invasion in the rivers of Ohio; the decades-long effort to eradicate an invasive weed on the Great Plains; and a story about the restoration of both ecological and human history in an urban natural area. In-depth background chapters explain topics ranging from how ecosystems become diverse, to the characteristics of effective invaders, to procedures and policies that can help prevent future invasions. The book ends with a number of specific suggestions for ways that individuals can help reduce the impacts of invasive species, and offers resources for further information.By bringing the problem of invasive species to life for readers at all levels, Nature Out of Place will play an essential role in the vital effort to raise public awareness of this ongoing ecological crisis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7oMsCtAK81UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Absolut Book.: The Absolut Vodka Advertising Story","description":"Highlighting the award-winning marketing and advertising campaign of Absolut Vodka, this art and design book features over 250 pages of magnificent bottle art and iconic ads.

People needed the help that I could give them and the benefit of my experience and knowledge. In that book I gave the best I had and received my reward. People appreciated my efforts. They bought the book then and they are still buying it. They say it is a good book and more than worth the money. That is very gratifying to me. After the 1929 bull market culminated there was a demand for a new book to meet changed conditions under the so-called  New Era,  so I wrote WALL STREET STOCK SELECTOR in the spring of 1930. I gave freely of my knowledge and the benefit of years of experience. This book helped others to protect their principal and make profits. People who read the book pronounced it one of the best. It is still selling, and again I have been rewarded. No man can learn all there is to know about forecasting the trend of stocks in 3, 5, 10, or 20 years, but if he is a deep student and hard worker, he learns more and knowledge comes easier after years of experience. I knew more about determining the trend of stocks in 1923 than I did in 1911. Seven more years of experience gave me more knowledge and enabled me to write the WALL STREET STOCK SELECTOR in 1930 and give my readers the benefit of my increased knowledge. Now, after five more years have elapsed, my experience and practical test of new rules have enabled me to learn more of value since 1930. The 1929-1932 panic and what has followed since, gave me valuable experience and I have gained more knowledge about detecting the right stocks to buy and sell. I cannot lose if I pass this knowledge on to those who will appreciate it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pYzEDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Boys","description":"When sixteen-year-old Rashad is mistakenly accused of stealing, classmate Quinn witnesses his brutal beating at the hands of a police officer who happens to be the older brother of his best friend.

Webster s dictionary informs us that it means to possess, attack, or take forcibly. The explanation, however, feels as though it s one more reason for those already caught up by the relentless need to live life as though it was an endless war on completing tasks . . . to vindicate their behavior. I don t want to seize anything, but I do want to squeeze the juice out of every precious moment I m given and get the most joy out of everything I do, because if I don t, I ll become dried up and lifeless. This means that I have to pay attention and be aware of living a great life. I want to feel like a delicious piece of fruit just waiting to be plucked off the vine. I want to look like a child with watermelon all over their face fully involved with their eyes wide with wonder. I want to Ooh and Aah much more than I want to Oh no and Boo-hoo. We all desire those outcomes, but when our attention is to get to some finish line, what we re doing whether it s sex or sewing, merely becomes the segue to the next task. and so . . . we re never squeezing . . . we re seizing, being seized and seizing up. This little book will help guide you to a place where you ll begin to feel the delicious bounty that life has to offer. Pick a page randomly, read the message, and let it resonate for the day.

Dan Snyder was not a sure thing in professional hockey, but defied expectations playing for both the minor league's Chicago Wolves and the NHL's Atlanta Thrashers. Dany Heatley, on the other hand, had been tapped for success from the start as a college star and high draft pick. The two made an unlikely pair, but became friends. In September of 2003, the then 22-year-old Heatley lost control of his speeding Ferrari; Snyder was thrown from the vehicle and died six days later. The loss of their teammate, friend, and son sent those who knew Snyder looking for healing or revenge. As the legal story unfolds, so too does a story of forgiveness, rooted in the Canadian Mennonite tradition from which Snyder hailed. Snyder's family, taking an approach to their loss dictated by their faith, chose to make peace with both Heatley and his parents. This story of forgiveness reveals a lesson in loss, hope, and peace in the face of tragedy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CYArecGVepcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Language in Mind: Advances in the Study of Language and Thought","description":"The idea that the language we speak influences the way we think has evoked perennial fascination and intense controversy. According to the strong version of this hypothesis, called the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis after the American linguists who propounded it, languages vary in their semantic partitioning of the world, and the structure of one's language influences how one understands the world. Thus speakers of different languages perceive the world differently. Although the last two decades have been marked by extreme skepticism concerning the possible effects of language on thought, recent theoretical and methodological advances in cognitive science have given the question new life. Research in linguistics and linguistic anthropology has revealed striking differences in cross-linguistic semantic patterns, and cognitive psychology has developed subtle techniques for studying how people represent and remember experience. It is now possible to test predictions about how a given language influences the thinking of its speakers. Language in Mind includes contributions from both skeptics and believers and from a range of fields. It contains work in cognitive psychology, cognitive development, linguistics, anthropology, and animal cognition. The topics discussed include space, number, motion, gender, theory of mind, thematic roles, and the ontological distinction between objects and substances.

A twenty-first-century Nathanael West, he has been hailed for his powerful prose, his Swiftian satire, and the scalpel-sharp wit that has, in each of his novels, dissected and sometimes disemboweled Hollywood excess. Now, in his most ambitious book to date, Still Holding, the third in the Cellular Trilogy that began with I'm Losing You and I'll Let You Go, Wagner immerses readers in post-September 11 Hollywood, revealing as much rabid ambition, rampant narcissism, and unchecked mental illness as ever. It is a scabrous, epiphanic, sometimes horrifying portrait of an entangled community of legitimate stars, delusional wanna-bes, and psychosociopaths. Wagner infiltrates the gilded life of a superstar actor/sex symbol/practicing Buddhist, the compromised world of a young actress whose big break comes when she's hired to play a corpse on Six Feet Under, and the strange parallel universe of look-alikes -- an entire industry in which struggling actors are hired out for parties and conventions to play their famous counterparts. Alternately hilarious and heartfelt, ferocious and empathetic, Still Holding is Bruce Wagner's most expertly calibrated work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=daXIvVNJyocC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Day by Day","description":"This book is a collaborative, not isolated, approach to teaching writing.

Volume II, meanwhile, turns to the basics of Japanese syntax. The book is by no means only about grammar, however. Rather, it is designed to help learners consolidate their understanding of syntactical structure through lessons that focus on how to talk about topics relevant to daily life. In addition to serving learners continuing from Volume I, Volume II will benefit those who have already studied beginning Japanese to some extent but wish to brush up on syntax. Major Features of Japanese for Busy People II, Revised 3rd Edition Japanese for Busy People II, Revised 3rd Edition will enable learners to progress smoothly through the equivalent of the latter half of a typical first-year Japanese course while gradually building speaking and listening skills. Learners approaching mid-beginner status often find themselves suddenly faced with syntax and vocabulary much more complex than what they have studied before. Such grammar and vocabulary do not appear as frequently in everyday conversation as those words and structures they have learned up to this point, necessitating that they spend ample time on review. Moreover, learners at this stage are expected to become familiar with verb tense and aspect, time expressions, conditional clauses, and other topics that require them to have a solid grasp of context and speaker intent if they are to fully understand the differences in meaning conveyed by each. Such points cannot be mastered by reading through grammatical explanations alone. In short, the mid-beginner level is a difficult one for many adult learners who, unlike students in school, have neither time nor opportunities to take repeated tests or to otherwise gauge their progress. Japanese for Busy People II, Revised 3rd Edition helps overcome the above obstacles through grammar and content topics carefully selected to be appropriate to learners at this level of Japanese proficiency. The book is designed so that by practicing talking about each topic, learners will gradually and effectively acquire sentence patterns and vocabulary related to that topic. Like Volume I, Volume II is organized into several large units, each covering topics grouped under a particular theme. In this way, the book enables learners to achieve a well-balanced understanding of grammar, sentence structure, and context. Themes and lesson objectives of the five units in Volume II are as follows. Unit 1: Souvenir Shopping Following up on Volume I, Unit 1 presents survival Japanese related to shopping, thus providing learners with a thorough review of simple clauses. The unit also goes beyond what was covered in Volume I by showing ways of asking someone s opinion while shopping, making comparisons between items, and describing an item s characteristics. The overall theme is \\"picking souvenirs,\\" a subject that should be relevant to learners both in Japan and abroad. The verbal skills and dialogue patterns studied here may be applied not only to shopping but also more broadly to any situation that involves choosing between options. Unit 2: Building Rapport with Colleagues This unit introduces the plain forms of verbs   a crucial component of Japanese compound sentences   along with several sentence-final elements that make use of these forms. Topics are selected from among those that typically come up when interacting with people from work. Covered are constructions for indicating interest in another s actions, inviting someone to do something outside of work, asking for help or offering advice, and otherwise interacting with people in ways that help build relationships of trust and understanding. Unit 3: Returning to Japan for Work This unit explains how to build sentences using temporal clauses, direct and indirect quotation, and attributive modifiers. Through talking about factual events in one s life history or in that of a particular neighborhood, learners will study how to relate an event in chronological sequence, compare the way something is now to how it was in the past, and describe facilities and other things around them. Unit 4: Planning a Vacation Along with sentences with clauses for stating reasons or reporting questions, this unit covers sentence-final elements used to express indefiniteness, for example wish or probability. Topics deal with verbal skills necessary for planning and carrying out activities in cooperation with others, including explaining reasons or circumstances, expressing probability, and indicating desire. The overall theme is that of planning and going on a trip to a unique place in Japan. Unit 5: Solving Problems The focus of this unit is on forming conditional clauses. Topics include preparing for earthquakes or other disasters, discussing dreams for the future, solving problems, helping someone who is lost, and other situations that call on learners to talk about what might happen in the future, discuss options for solving problems, and give instructions or explain steps for doing something.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vZ1NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Japanese+for+Busy+People+2+Audio+(Pt.2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frontiers of Alusia (Dragonquest)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s3JQAAAAYAAJ&dq=Frontiers+of+Alusia+(Dragonquest)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Outside Magazine's Adventure Guide to the Pacific Northwest (Outside guides)","description":"The Disabled Hiker's Guide to Western Washington and Oregon is the first book of its kind to consider the diverse needs of disabled people in the outdoors.

Estleman","description":"John Jakes, #1 New York Times bestselling author of such acclaimed historical novels as North and South and The Kent Family Chronicles has long been both a fan and a distinguished author of novels and stories of the American West. Now, with the turning of the millennium, he has compiled in one volume a century's worth of his favorite Western fiction. To illustrate the evolution of the genre, Jakes has included such legendary authors as Owen Wister, Louis L'Amour, and Zane Grey along side their more contemporary peers such as Loren Estleman and Elmer Kelton. While the stories have changed over the years, certain timeless themes of Western fiction remain constant. At the heart of the stories are ideas that have become synonymous with the American dream---the frontier spirit, individual freedoms, and man's relationship with the land. A Century of Great Western Stories is essentially a retrospective of western writing over the past century, but Jakes also sets out to give readers a glimpse of what the future might hold for western fiction. While trends in publishing might not always be promising, the current crop of contemporary Western authors show that the old west will always have a place in the world of fiction. Like the American dream which it celebrates, Western fiction will perservere. Featuring classc stories by: John Jakes, Mantiow and Ironhand John M. Cunningham, The Tin Star, which became the classic Western film, High Noon Jack London, All Gold Canyon Louis L'Amour, The Gift of Cochise Thomas Thompson, Gun Job Elmer Kelton, The Burial of Letty Strayhorn Loren D.

I believe that is the most important question of the twenty-first century. Here are ten answers from the Bible. Jesus came to die... #10) To destroy hostility between races The suspicion, prejudice, and demeaning attitudes between Jews and non-Jews in Bible times were as serious as the racial, ethnic, and national hostilities today. Jesus died to create a whole new way for races to be reconciled: he \\"has broken down...the dividing wall of hostility...making peace...through the cross\\" (Ephesians 2:14-16). It is impossible to build lasting unity among races by saying that all religions can come together as equally valid. God sent his Son into the world as the only means of saving sinners and reconciling races. Only as the races find this reconciliation will they love and enjoy each other. #9) To give marriage its deepest meaning God's design was never for marriages to be miserable, yet many are. That's what sin does...it makes us treat each other badly. Jesus died to change that. He knew that his suffering would make the deepest meaning of marriage plain. That's why the Bible says, \\"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her\\" (Ephesians 5:25). God's design for marriage is for a husband to love his wife the way Christ loves his people, and for the wife to respond the way Christ's people should. This kind of love is possible because Christ died for both husband and wife. #8) To absorb the wrath of God God's law demanded, \\"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might\\" (Deuteronomy 6:5). But we have all loved other things more. This is what sin is--dishonoring God by preferring other things over him, and acting on those preferences. The seriousness of an insult rises with the dignity of the one insulted. Since our sin is against the Ruler of the Universe, \\"the wages of [our] sin is death\\" (Romans 6:23). Not to punish it would be unjust. So God sent his own Son, Jesus, to divert sin's punishment from us to himself. God \\"loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation\\"--the wrath-absorbing substitute--\\"for our sins\\" (1 John 4:10). Then God publicly endorsed Christ's accomplishment by raising him from the dead, proving the success of his suffering and death. #7) So that we would escape the curse of the law There was no escape from the curse of God's law. It was just; we were guilty. There was only one way to be free: someone must pay the penalty. \\"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us\\" (Galatians 3:13). The law's demands have been fulfilled by Christ's perfect law-keeping, its penalty fully paid by his death. This is why the Bible teaches that getting right with God is not based on law-keeping: \\"A person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ\\" (Galatians 2:16). Our only hope is having the blood and righteousness of Christ credited to our account. #6) To reconcile us to God The reconciliation that needs to happen between man and God goes both ways. God's first act in reconciling us to himself was to remove the obstacle that separated him from us--the guilt of our sin. He took the steps we could not take to remove his own judgment by sending Jesus to suffer in our place: \\"While we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son\\" (Romans 5:10). Reconciliation from our side is simply to receive what God has already done, the way we receive an infinitely valuable gift. #5) To show God's love for sinners The measure of God's love is shown by the degree of his sacrifice in saving us from the penalty of our sins: \\"he gave his only Son\\" (John 3:16). When we add the horrific crucifixion that Christ endured, it becomes clear that the sacrifice the Father and the Son made to save us was indescribably great! The measure of his love increases still more when we consider the degree of our unworthiness. \\"God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us\\" (Romans 5:8). Our debt is so great, only a divine sacrifice could pay it. #4) To show Jesus' own love for us The death of Christ is also the supreme expression that he \\"loved me and gave himself for me\\" (Galatians 2:20). It is my sin that cuts me off from God. All I can do is plead for mercy. I see Christ suffering and dying \\"to give his life as a ransom for many\\" (Matthew 20:28). And I ask, am I among the \\"many\\"? And I hear the answer, \\"Whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life\\" (John 3:16). Jesus paid the highest price possible to give me--personally--the greatest gift possible. #3) To take away our condemnation The great conclusion to the suffering and death of Christ is this: \\"There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus\\" (Romans 8:1). To be \\"in Christ\\" means to be in relationship to him by faith. Christ becomes our punishment (which we don't have to bear) and our worth before God (which we cannot earn). The death of Christ secures freedom from condemnation for those who believe that Christ has served their death sentence. It is as sure that they cannot be condemned as it is sure that Christ died! #2) To bring us to God \\"Gospel\\" means \\"good news,\\" and it all ends in one thing: God himself. The gospel is the good news that at the cost of his Son's life, God has done everything necessary to captivate us with what will make us eternally and ever-increasingly happy--namely, himself. \\"Christ...suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God\\" (1 Peter 3:18). #1) To give eternal life to all who believe on Him Jesus made it plain that rejecting the eternal life he offered would result in the misery of eternity in hell: \\"Whoever does not believe is condemned already....the wrath of God remains on him\\" (John 3:18, 36). But for those who trust Christ, the best is yet to come. \\"No eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined what God has prepared for those who love him\\" (1 Corinthians 2:9). We will see the all-satisfying glory of God. \\"This is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent\\" (John 17:3). For all these reasons and more, Christ suffered and died. Why would you not embrace him as your Savior from sin and judgment, and live with God eternally? If you are moved to embrace God's Son in this way, tell God in words like these: Dear God, I'm convinced that Jesus suffered and died for my sins. I gratefully trust in him now as my Lord and my precious Treasure and the only way I'll ever receive your forgiveness and your promise of eternal life. Amen.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GgH-jgEACAAJ&dq=Why+Jesus+Died&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dodge Pick-ups, 1994-2001 (Haynes Manuals)","description":"The mysteries of the versatile LS series engines are unlocked in the Haynes Techbook Cummins Diesel Engine Manual.

In the fall of 1888, all of London was held in the grip of unspeakable terror. An elusive madman calling himself Jack the Ripper was brutally butchering women in the slums of London s East End. Police seemed powerless to stop the killer, who delighted in taunting them and whose crimes were clearly escalating in violence from victim to victim. And then the Ripper s violent spree seemingly ended as abruptly as it had begun. He had struck out of nowhere and then vanished from the scene. Decades passed, then fifty years, then a hundred, and the Ripper s bloody sexual crimes became anemic and impotent fodder for puzzles, mystery weekends, crime conventions, and so-called  Ripper Walks  that end with pints of ale in the pubs of Whitechapel. But to number-one New York Times bestselling novelist Patricia Cornwell, the Ripper murders are not cute little mysteries to be transformed into parlor games or movies but rather a series of terrible crimes that no one should get away with, even after death. Now Cornwell applies her trademark skills for meticulous research and scientific expertise to dig deeper into the Ripper case than any detective before her and reveal the true identity of this fabled Victorian killer. In Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper, Case Closed, Cornwell combines the rigorous discipline of twenty-first century police investigation with forensic techniques undreamed of during the late Victorian era to solve one of the most infamous and difficult serial murder cases in history. Drawing on unparalleled access to original Ripper evidence, documents, and records, as well as archival, academic, and law-enforcement resources, FBI profilers, and top forensic scientists, Cornwell reveals that Jack the Ripper was none other than a respected painter of his day, an artist now collected by some of the world s finest museums: Walter Richard Sickert. It has been said of Cornwell that no one depicts the human capability for evil better than she. Adding layer after layer of circumstantial evidence to the physical evidence discovered by modern forensic science and expert minds, Cornwell shows that Sickert, who died peacefully in his bed in 1942, at the age of 81, was not only one of Great Britain s greatest painters but also a serial killer, a damaged diabolical man driven by megalomania and hate. She exposes Sickert as the author of the infamous Ripper letters that were written to the Metropolitan Police and the press. Her detailed analysis of his paintings shows that his art continually depicted his horrific mutilation of his victims, and her examination of this man s birth defects, the consequent genital surgical interventions, and their effects on his upbringing present a casebook example of how a psychopathic killer is created. New information and startling revelations detailed in Portrait of a Killer include: - How a year-long battery of more than 100 DNA tests on samples drawn by Cornwell s forensics team in September 2001 from original Ripper letters and Sickert documents yielded the first shadows of the 75- to 114 year-old genetic evid...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C3TUKNroaYkC&dq=Portrait+of+a+Killer:+Jack+the+Ripper+-+Case+Closed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Heaven With Diana!: A Study of Jordan of Saxony and Diana d'Andal with a Translation of the Letters of Jordan","description":"Lists more than 80,000 rhyming words, including single, double, and triple rhymes, and offers information on rhyme schemes, meter, and poetic forms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dXdtkpG_KhMC&dq=To+Heaven+With+Diana!:+A+Study+of+Jordan+of+Saxony+and+Diana+d%27Andal+with+a+Translation+of+the+Letters+of+Jordan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Basic Phonics Skills, Level A","description":"\\"Correlated to State standards.

Proves that the majority of cases of stroke, heart attack, and hypertension can easily be prevented by maintaining the proper ratio of potassium to sodium in the diet. ? Updated with scientific evidence from a recent Finnish study showing a 60 percent decline in deaths attributed to strokes and heart attacks. ? Provides a comprehensive program for balancing body chemistry at the cellular level. High blood pressure is entirely preventable, without reliance on synthetic drugs. Dr. Moore's approach is simple: by maintaining the proper ratio of potassium to sodium in the diet, blood pressure can be regulated at the cellular level, preventing the development of hypertension and the high incidence of strokes and heart attacks associated with it. Dr. Moore updates this edition with a new preface reporting on the latest scientific research in support of his program. The most striking results come from Finland, where for several decades sodium chloride has been replaced nationwide with a commercial sodium/potassium mixture, resulting in a 60 percent decline nationwide in deaths attributed to strokes and heart attacks. Extrapolated to America, the Finnish statistics would mean 360,000 strokes prevented and 96,000 lives saved every year. Dr. Moore makes it clear that high blood pressure is only one symptom of an entire systemic imbalance. He outlines a safe, effective program that focuses on nutrition, weight loss, and exercise to bring the entire body chemistry into balance. For those currently taking blood pressure medications, he includes a chapter on working with your physician to ensure that any reduction in hypertension drugs can be effected gradually and safely.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OThovwEACAAJ&dq=The+High+Blood+Pressure+Solution:+A+Scientifically+Proven+Program+for+Preventing+Strokes+and+Heart+Disease&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong","description":"The mysterious and powerful Phoenix Force is life incarnate, and yet it consumes whole worlds in a moment.

Although some of the book is dated, its conviction that \\"the church's meaning lies in its fulfillment of the sufferings of Christ\\" and that \\"every part of its history is intelligible in terms of the Passion\\" remains perceptive and challenging. Examining Scripture, doctrine, and history, Ramsey paints an intricate portrait of the church as an example of Christ's death and resurrection. He explores Eastern orthodox doctrine; explains the purposes and preconditions of the Reformation; and calls for a renewal of liturgical worship and reconciliation within the communion of the saints. Originally published in 1936 while he was serving as sub-warden of Lincoln Theological College, this was Ramsey's first book. After more than seventy years, its wisdom concerning the relationship between Catholic and Evangelical, and the underlying complementarities and tensions which characterize the Anglican tradition, remains theologically sound and biblically astute.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RACb6TICT4QC&dq=The+gospel+and+the+church&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The veteran and his pipe,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_UJLAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Winner's Circle","description":"A team of America's most successful financial advisors offer their advice to private investors and financial professionals in this insightful guide.

Basing his research on previously untapped judicial sources, prisoners  letters, criminological studies, quantitative data, newspapers, and political archives, Piccato examines the paradoxes of repressive policies toward crime, the impact of social rebellion on patterns of common crime, and the role of urban communities in dealing with transgression on the margins of the judical system. By investigating postrevolutionary examples of corruption and organized crime, Piccato shines light on the historical foundations of a social problem that remains the main concern of Mexico City today. Emphasizing the social construction of crime and the way it was interpreted within the moral economy of the urban poor, he describes the capital city during the early twentieth century as a contested territory in which a growing population of urban poor had to negotiate the use of public spaces with more powerful citizens and the police. Probing official discourse on deviance, Piccato reveals how the nineteenth-century rise of positivist criminology which asserted that criminals could be readily distinguished from the normal population based on psychological and physical traits was used to lend scientific legitimacy to class stratifications and to criminalize working-class culture. Furthermore, he argues, the authorities  emphasis on punishment, isolation, and stigmatization effectively created cadres of professional criminals, reshaping crime into a more dangerous problem for all inhabitants of the capital. This unique investigation into crime in Mexico City will interest Latin Americanists, sociologists, and historians of twentieth-century Mexican history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fzb6Rrr7yHsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The City Curious","description":"\\"The City Curious\\" by Jean de Bosch re (translated by F.

His sources were two: classical Sanskrit works and his own experiences with his lovers. Completed in 1939, his  treatise on passion  circulated in manuscript form in Tibet, scandalizing and arousing its readers. Gendun Chopel here condemns the hypocrisy of both society and church, portraying sexual pleasure as a force of nature and a human right for all. On page after page, we find the exuberance of someone discovering the joys of sex, made all the more intense because they had been forbidden to him for so long: he had taken the monastic vow of celibacy in his youth and had only recently renounced it. He describes in ecstatic and graphic detail the wonders he discovered. In these poems, written in beautiful Tibetan verse, we hear a voice with tints of irony, self-deprecating wit, and a love of women not merely as sources of male pleasure but as full partners in the play of passion.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VsFTDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Maya Sculpture in Wood","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lib4SAAACAAJ&dq=A+Maya+Sculpture+in+Wood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Barney Goes To The Zoo","description":"A LIFT-THE-FLAP BOARD BOOK which features Barney the dinosaur.

Most recent scholarship, however, has focused on the aggadic or narrative midrash, while halakhic or legal midrash the exegesis of biblical law has received relatively little attention. In Scripture as Logos, Azzan Yadin addresses this long-standing need, examining early, tannaitic (70-200 C.E.) legal midrash, focusing on the interpretive tradition associated with the figure of Rabbi Ishmael. This is a sophisticated study of midrashic hermeneutics, growing out of the observation that the Rabbi Ishmael midrashim contain a dual personification of Scripture, which is referred to as both \\"torah\\" and \\"ha-katuv.\\" It is Yadin's significant contribution to note that the two terms are not in fact synonymous but rather serve as metonymies for Sinai on the one hand and, on the other, the rabbinic house of study, the bet midrash. Yadin develops this insight, ultimately presenting the complex but highly coherent interpretive ideology that underlies these rabbinic texts, an ideology that contrary to the dominant view today seeks to minimize the role of the rabbinic reader by presenting Scripture as actively self-interpretive. Moving beyond textual analysis, Yadin then locates the Rabbi Ishmael hermeneutic within the religious landscape of Second Temple and post-Temple literature. The result is a series of surprising connections between these rabbinic texts and Wisdom literature, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the Church Fathers, all of which lead to a radical rethinking of the origins of rabbinic midrash and, indeed, of the Rabbis as a whole.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KU33uTiWvhkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cat and Mouse in Space (Learn to Read Series)","description":"Designed to enable adult and child to share the first concepts of reading, this book bridges the gap between pre-reading activities and first solo storybooks.
