[The author is a libertarian, free-market professor of economics; somehow, he was once the \\"King Faisal Professor of Islamic Thought and Culture\\" at the Univ. of Southern California (c. 2004), but (c. 2011) he is at the Fuqua Business School at Duke Univ.] This book is a very insightful book regarding how the supporters of \\"Islamic Banking\\" (\\"I.B.\\") have hoodwinked virtually everyone into believing that their anti-interest (anti-riba) concepts are \\"superior\\" to free-market, pro-interest (pro-riba) theories. The author tries to argue that almost all Muslims fail to understand the hang-up that Prophet Muhammad had against common interest (riba). The author argued that the Quran prohibits \\"is the pre-Islamic Arabian institution of riba, whereby a borrower saw his debt double following a default and redouble if he defaulted again. Because it tended to push defaulters into enslavement, riba had long been a source of communal friction (p. 14).\\" The author calls this type of riba: \\"mammon\\" which is not an Arabic term, but is derived from the Christian Bible (see Wikipedia). I am unaware of an Arabic word for the author's contention (besides riba). [Nonetheless, the author details how I.B. or I. Economics is a recently \\"invented business\\" concept (c. 1970s).] I don't believe that the author really \\"proves\\" his point regarding mammon/riba with his book - he doesn't cite any Quranic or ahadith references to his contention (not that I recall anyway). Nonetheless, I highly recommend this book for the MANY OTHER topics that the author analyzes in debunking Islamic Economics. A reader should be familiar with free-market concepts: interest theory, P/L, etc. The author discusses how Muslims are trying to 'accept' the use of interest (riba) by calling it instead a \\"management fee\\" and thereby avoid the opprobrium of 'riba'. Apparently, the author has expanded his arguments against the silliness (okay, anti free-market theories) of Islamic Banking/Economics history in \\"The Long Divergent: How Islamic Law Held Back the Middle East.\\" Islamists are not going to like this book for revealing (shouting out) about I.E.: \\"Look, the Emperor (I.E.) is wearing no clothes!\\" Essentially, the author is claiming that I.B. is not really \\"economics\\", but more of a politico-socio (religious) \\"feel good\\" populist concept ballyhooed by those ignorant of market economics. Islamists realize that acceptance of \\"riba\\" would contradict Allah's commandment against riba; they all-to-well properly realize: \\"accept riba, denounce Allah!\\" That is the Islamists' conundrum: how to admit that Allah got it wrong about interest/riba (this would then lead to inquiring if Allah made other errors in the Quran -- or maybe Muhammad misunderstood what Allah was saying). I.E. ranks alongside with those who believe in the \\"Flat World Society\\" or Stalinism."},{"Title":"Islam and Mammon: The Economic Predicaments of Islamism","review":"The central and most important point in this highly useful volume is that Islamic finance is an \\"invented tradition,\\" which empowers Islamic radicals. Now, coming as it does from the University of Southern California King Faisal Professor of Islamic Thought, that statement represents years of study, and a great deal of courage.\\"Neither classical nor medieval Islamic civilization featured banks in the modern sense, let alone \`Islamic' banks...,\\" Kuran continues.Western securities and banking regulators, legislators, bankers, money managers and securities lawyers, take note: Muslim Brotherhood founder Hassan al-Banna concocted the idea of Islamic banking in the 1920s to unite Muslims in one global Islamic nation (umma), to create a parallel financial system, and ultimately to help reestablish a global Islamic empire, subservient to shari'a law.These and many other such facts are things that radical sheiks and \\"shari'a finance scholars\\" do not want readers to know. Which is why anyone even remotely interested in shari'a finance should purchase and read this book, and keep it on their desk. It's invaluable.--Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"Islam and Mammon: The Economic Predicaments of Islamism","review":"The subject is \\"Islamic economics,\\" a system which has the goal that all dealings be of equal benefit to all parties and, through the use of the \\"tax\\" for charity and inheritance law, there be a high degree of economic equality. Kuran examines all these issues seeing some advantages and the many quandaries that result. Importantly, in view of current problems and events, he explores the political significance of this type of economy in the lack of prosperity and the isolation of Muslims from the rest of the world.In his exploration of why the Islamic economy has lagged Europe for several centuries he calls into use his work on preference falsification (See his \\"Private Truths, Public Lies\\") in the inability of the economy and its rulers to self-correct when the economy was sliding downhill.Carol M Fuller"},{"Title":"Islam and Mammon: The Economic Predicaments of Islamism","review":"The author is very likely a Kurdish nationalist, not implausibly a quite supporter of the PKK. As a Communist, he has no room for religion. His analysis is misleading, basically he runs after Muslims under the banner of Islamism, he seeks to undermine the Islamic religion to satisfy his own psychological needs. The author has suppervised the work of others who also claimed to have proved that Islam does not work. The author does not use objective scientific methods, he basically writes in a way that confirms his own priori conclusions. Read the book, if you wish, but with such qualifications in mind. You may read it to understand how the bigot's mind actually works."},{"Title":"Islam and Mammon: The Economic Predicaments of Islamism","review":"This is not a good book. It is rather descriptive in nature, poorly referenced, tests no hypotheses empirically and is too wordy. The author makes claims without any substantive evidence. He accumulates paragraphs and twists them in the way that leads him to his pre-assembled conclusions. The author does not seem to have the statistical tools of analysis, a great deficiency for a university professor. The author does not seem well-versed in the history of the Islamic world nor does he understand Islamic economics. He picks up few concepts he thinks will lead him to the conclusions he already knew, so he squeezes Islamic economics into a small area. Contrary to his claims, the main factor leading to the economic decline of the modern Muslim world is the adoption of Marxist ideology - almost every single Muslim country has adopted a Communist regime (leading to political repression by definition). This is not Islamic but rather Jewish Economics. Another factor, among others, would be colonization. Professor Kuran is not an expert on Islam, he would have done better had he sought endeavors in other areas that do not require rigorous empirical testing, perhaps literary work?."},{"Title":"Gorilla","review":"Ugly duckling, move over!

It had a rather garish cover, but the heart of the book was one of compassion and deep caring.George Ellis spent countless hours working behind bars to bring this meditation technique to prison lifers. I helped George teach the program at San Quentin, and every Tuesday evening, deep within the bowels of San Quentin, we would sit with men who would be there for the rest of their lives, to meditate and bring them a little understanding about the world within themselves; to help them find a little peace.This book is a valuable history lesson about alternate rehabilitation techniques. At Folsom, the TM technique was taught to men who were to be released within 3 to 6 months. The rate of recidivism among these men was half of that of the general population.This book chronicles the teaching of the TM Technique behind bars at San Quentin, Folsom, the Redwood County Jail, and other institutions around the world.

But you cannot &quot;give&quot; someone their own death. Death is a &quot;gift&quot; because it insures our irreplaceableness in God's eyes; it is ours and ours alone. No one can die in my place no more than I can die in theirs. Our willingness to acknowledge this relationship with our own deaths (which above all requires &quot;responsibility,&quot; a term Derrida seems to prefer to &quot;faith&quot;) in turn unites us with God and the self, with the giver and the receiver.I'll admit I hadn't expected a deconstructionist to use terms like &quot;absolute,&quot; &quot;transcendant,&quot; &quot;God,&quot; &quot;self&quot;--in profusion and in earnest. But perhaps Derrida has sufficiently exposed the instability, metaphoric basis and deceptive play of language to be able to employ it without qualifiers, disclaimers, and tedious textual self-referentiality. As is his custom, he represents his own work as a critique of others' works--Plato's &quot;Phaedo,&quot; Nietzsche's &quot;Genealogy of Morals,&quot; Kierkegaard's &quot;Fear and Trembling,&quot; and the contemporary, politically executed Polish philosopher Jan Potocka. While he establishes his distance from Plato and Nietzsche, his re-visioning of Kierkegaard offers new angles without questioning or challenging the great Dane's existential reading of the Abraham-Isaac story. And his alignment with Potocka is so complete as to suggest more an apologia than a critique of the latter's work. Add to these texts numerous references to Heidegger and to both the Old and New Testaments as well as to stories by Poe and Hawthorne, and you'll have some idea of how richly allusive, not to mention dense, Derrida's discourse can be, even in a brief work such as this.The primary requisite for reading &quot;The Gift of Death&quot; is some knowledge of its precursor, &quot;Fear and Trembling.&quot; Like Kierkegaard, Derrida defines religion as access to the responsibility of a free self, which in turn is defined as a relationship consciously and secretly experienced by the individual subject who sees him or herself in the gaze of God. Truth is separated from Socrates' truth by its interiority, by its replacement of reason, ethics, and aesthetics with the sheer horror of the abyss. Compared to Kierkegaard, however, Derrida's account is less romantic, less inspiring, more disturbing. The leap of faith involves not a sacrifice of Isaac but of oneself, a secret and senseless meeting with one's own death. Derrida interprets the absence of woman in the Abraham and Bartleby stories as proof that the &quot;knight of faith's&quot; quest is not the &quot;tragic hero's&quot;. Instead, it is beyond all knowledge, a confrontation with the abyss that marks the Absolute singularity of the self. (This latter observation is reminiscent of Marlowe's inability, or unwillingness, in Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; to share the &quot;truth&quot; of Kurtz' final words, &quot;The horror, the horror,&quot; with Kurtz' fiance.)In the latter part of his critique, Derrida offers a paradoxical criticism of the technological, modern age. Far from becoming quantified or de-naturalized, we have returned to the demonic and orgiastic from which religion arose. Modern man has fallen into inauthenticity, becoming not a self or person but assuming the mask of a &quot;role.&quot; Present-day democracy, in turn, is not about the equality of individuals but of roles. Hence the importance of discovering and accepting the gift of death that determines human uniqueness. Responsibility is the criterion; freedom is the result.This is a work not to be read quickly or only once. Derrida moves slowly, taking two steps backward before moving one step forward, but his method insures the communication of his meanings. If it's any inducement to the reader, I would suggest that the fourth and final chapter, &quot;Tout autre est tout autre,&quot; is anticlimactic and unhelpful. By then the attentive reader will already have located the gift."},{"Title":"The Gift of Death (Religion and Postmodernism Series)","review":"Like much of Derrida's work, The Gift of Death does require a familiarity with the continental tradition. Without knowledge of Heidegger, Levinas and Kierkegaard, it is unlikely to make an impression, but the central figure of the text is Jan Patocka, a little-known Czech philosopher who is only now beginning to come to light. Contact with his thoughts on Europe and the care of the soul makes this slim tract come to life. I actually found it to be one of the clearest of Derrida's works, certainly no more challenging than the average in current continental philosophy. Illuminates the tension between secrecy and givenness, human freedom and responsibility, and shows the ways in which death opens the space for human existence. A valuable contribution to the phenomenology of religion, and destined to be one of Derrida's more widely read essays, even if it never surpasses the importance of his earlier works."},{"Title":"The Gift of Death (Religion and Postmodernism Series)","review":"The deconstruction of Christianity plus some extent also Jewish and Islamic thinking from the point of view of gift or symbolic exchange is an interesting topic. Especially the core of Derrida's analysis, how to interpret -- or to deconstruct, depending your own stance -- the story of Binding of Isaac, is insightful. One could also use it as a masterful, more or less isolated close-reading of an enigmatic story.I also liked the general idea that morality is always based on shortcomings and that the monotheistic religions try to evade this impossibility of total ethicalness by totally merging the ultimate other (the God, the permanently unknowable) within the very core of the self.The Gift of Death is short book and not easy to read. I read it as a critique of monotheism, of 'monomanic' ethics that are based on surrendering yourself to an absolute and thus to monotony, monomania, monology and singularity (as opposite to generality). If this indeed what Derrida is saying, it is not as original as the idea of deconstructing religion seem to promise. But, as always -- with Derrida it is not so much what he says, but HOW he says it. Unlike Heidegger, for instance, this is also FUN to read.A good dose of poetry makes any give subversive morality more interesting. In the words of Bob Dylan, \\"Don't follow leaders, watch the parking meters.\\" I do both and it seems that in introducing multiple levels of simultaneous, symbolic exchange paradigms Derrida does, too."},{"Title":"The Gift of Death (Religion and Postmodernism Series)","review":"Written just shortly before his death, Derrida has a kind word or two about god and says that one of his many gifts is taking us out of this vale of tears of his and into his bosom - not for the Woody Allens of this world nor for Madonna, it invites contemplation on what \\"the life everlasting\\" might be: Plautus said it best: 'he whom the gods love, dies young'."},{"Title":"The Gift of Death (Religion and Postmodernism Series)","review":"Deconstruction is a deceptively useful philosophical device. However, this usefulness is severely limited. Deconstruction can present no positive conclusions. All it can do is show the fallibility of any attempt at such certain knowledge, primarily by exposing the inadequacy of language, a faculty so intimately connected with understanding. As a skeptic, I personally find deconstuction to be very pleasing. However, I am constantly annoyed by Derrida's insistance on frequently ignoring this aspect of his process. As a philosopher, I suppose the inclination to make some sort of positive assertion could be irresitible. I love the \\"play\\" and the analysis, but the attempt at ethical conclusions leaves me cold.In \\"The Gift of Death,\\" Derrida uses the story of Abraham and Isaac to distinguish between an absolute responsibility to \\"the other\\" from the typical ethical, \\"known\\" responsibility. I have never understood why it is that philosophers use this parable and others to decipher ethical realities. How much truth can one expect to extract from a fictional story? However, the idea that originary responsibility is always irresponsible is intriguing. Derrida proposes that Abraham's responsibility to God, the other, takes precedence over his lesser responsibilty to his son. And yet, later he makes the assertion that every other is an absolute other, making all responsibility absolute.All of this emphasis on otherness ultimately leads to a kind of ethical paralysis, but Derrida does not acknowledge this. Throughout history, small differences have been blown up into impenetrable divisions. Racism, homophobia, sexism, ethnicity, nationality, religion, all the institutions that Deconstruction usually attacks are fully supported by these \\"irresponsible\\" ethical conclusions.As I said before, the analysis reads like poetry and there are some very interesting ideas here. Derrida is frustrating, but worthwhile. I recommend this as well as \\"Writing and Difference.\\""},{"Title":"The Gift of Death (Religion and Postmodernism Series)","review":"This is a deeply religious work, not a philosophical one, though Derrida tries to employ philosophers to help him think through the matters he wishes to write about: Carl Schmidt, Heidegger, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Levinas, Patocka.It is also an obsessive work, focused entirely on the monstrous attempt by the Old Testament Abraham to kill his biological son Isaac because of a secret bond with (a self-made) God -- and the justifications necessary to elevate this primitive and mad story to the numinous (have \\"celestial capital\\") and beyond morality or ethics.It is a completely bogus and irrational notion that because man cannot know \\"infinite goodness\\" (whatever that is), due to the fact that he is mortal and can receive \\"the gift of death\\" (a highly ambiguous concept even within a religious context), man has \\"original sin\\" (which has been so variously defined over time as to mean everything and nothing). (Derrida never defines the term.) But this idea is (nonetheless) foundational to the case Derrida wants to build about man's relationship to God (who is \\"infinite goodness,\\" according to Derrida) and vice-versa.It's very clear that this work (which is not clear) could not have been written without the total denial of the validity of the Law of Non-Contradiction and the Law of Identity, basic axioms of Aristotelian logic. Derrida employs these axioms, however, in his text in order to deal his readers the few creative notions he can offer (mostly puns and unusual rhetorical devices: appealing nonsense) while denying their metaphysical reality. He does make you feel something with his prissy rhetoric but he certainly cannot make you think -- unless confusion is considered a positive and valued mental state.I think the only people for whom this book can be useful or worthwhile reading are those already convinced of the value of its contents even before opening the book, that is Believers of one sort or another, including so-called agnostics. Or maybe intellectual flaneurs with nothing better to do. On the positive side, this work struck me as a complete theft of the ideas from Rudolph Otto's 1923 excellent work, \\"The Idea of the Holy.\\" You should read that if you want a clear exposition of mysterium tremendem and mysticism. Derrida can only provide a muddy copy.Last point: In an interview Derrida gave while he was dying, Derrida said he thought Kierkegaard had too much Christianized the story of Abrahnam and Isaac, and so he wrote this particular work to correct that tendency. Well, he failed -- miserably. Not even a Reformed or Progressive Jew would agree with Derrida's views of \\"no substitution\\" in the matter of death, and I could infer no other idea than that Derrida was an ardent, mystical Christian in the manner of Rudolph Otto or St. Ignatius when reading this text."},{"Title":"The Gift of Death (Religion and Postmodernism Series)","review":"Derrida, as usual, is able to tease apart the conventional ways of thinking--in this case about the (im)possibility of ethics--and force us to think in a completely different way. I might disagree with his analysis of the ramifications of the ethical gesture explicated in Kierkegaard's &quot;Fear and Trembling,&quot; but i can't say old Jack didn't make me think."},{"Title":"The Gift of Death (Religion and Postmodernism Series)","review":"I write not long after the passing of Jacques Derrida. He was a man of questions and flights of powerfully intellectual fancy. He changed how the world looks at literature.I will not clang the bells and start up the chorus of \\"ding-dong Derrida's dead\\" that might be expected from a Christian reader of the man's work (if anyone expected Derrida to have such readers--we are inexcusably few).Instead, I will say that in Derrida, and in this set of essays, his look into Kierkegaard in particular, I have found a kindred seeker after truth, if not a kindred professor of it.Jacques is now with the undeconstructable--both the source, fulfillment, and, in most cases, the negation of all his observations and questions. He is with the pure ineffable which choses to speak to and through the failable.The very mention of such belies most of Derrida's work.The certainty that springs from his work's invalidation gives me peace that the seeker has at last found, that Jacques Derrida is now fully and forever constructed.His work is over, but his true life--as with all the lives of those who seek and ask--has resumed an ancient, intended course.Rest in freedom and fulfillment, Mr Derrida."},{"Title":"The Gift of Death (Religion and Postmodernism Series)","review":"I started to give a review in \\"deconstructionist\\" fashion - blather on about architecture surpassing old notions of \\"in\\" and \\"our\\", of reason giving way to the Neitzhien Uberwill, of absurd interpretations of text, relative yet \\"ultimate\\" truth and the unholy trinity of angst, subconscienceness and desire.I was afraid, though, that it would be taken seriously by students (quote unquote) of post-modern \\"thought\\".The danger of deconstructionism is undeniable. When literature and music are culturally interpreted, ethics are situational, when one speaks of slavery as freedom or humanity as inhumanity, we are lost in a sea of intellectual flotsam. The personal connections to fascism - Heidegger, Paul de Man, Blanchot, Bataille - can be overlooked. The intellectual similarities can't: The supremacy of will (Nietzsche) over reason and logic (\\"homogenising\\"), an obsession with emotion and political discourse, the celebration of the group over the individual (identity politics) and the idea that truth is what the critic, dictator or prophet says it is. Deconstructionism is, needless to say, popular among folks favoring modern \\"intellectual\\" movements with fuzzy tenets.Here, he speaks to us eliptically (of course) as he partakes in the familiar one step forward - two steps backward approach. But if one follows Deconstructionism, why can't HIS writings be interpreted as an S&M; fantasy or a desire to be a Greek Orthodox priest in drag? How do we know what he really means since he suggests that we often write exactly opposite of what we mean?. He writes of God, death, solitude, life and sacrifice BUT in a new voice of existentialism and doubt. He employs vague, self-defined and self-referential terms which effectively shield him from serious study.Derrida, for all his rampant explicating, gets hot under the collar when his own words undergo the deconstruction challenge. Few have questioned his writings since (1) many are impossible to understand and (2) they may or may not mean what they say. What began as a new approach to literature has evolved into the language of intellectual totalitarianism. No one denies his extensive knowledge of Western literature; what galls are the bewieldering interpretations and his ironic attempt at building a new ethos based on syllogism. As another reviewer stated, take it slow, read several times, search for meaning even when there is none."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"See story summary above.No doubt an action packed story that'll take you from spots in England to spots in the Mideast. Pure action all the way. If that's all your looking for, look no further. As far as details and dialogue are concerned, there is very little to sink your teeth into, which is typical for a Higgins novel. Though short and to the point, I do enjoy his books. I would match super hero Sean Dillon against any fictitious villian.

When the diplomat is provided immunity by Russia and America, vengeance is sought with the life of the American president.Action swerves throughout the world until a terrifying finale takes place in a remote castle.Patrick Macnee, whom many will remember for his portrayal of John Steed on the hit TV series The Avengers, has the perfect voice for this reading. His control, accents, and delivery are superb, bringing a larger than life story to even more vivid realization."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Let's face it; this book is not great literature, but I don't think that the author meant it to be. What he wanted to do was entertain his readers, and that is what he does, with a bang! I enjoy relaxing with an exciting, page-turning work every so often, and Mr. Higgins' Sean Dillon series is the perfect read. Yesterday was a snowy day, the office was closed, and I started this book right after lunch. The plot kept me going throughout the day, and I finished the book before turning out the light and going to bed. I will admit that, at times, Dillon's almost flawless performance becomes a tad annoying, but he is such a cheeky rascal that I can overlook that possible failing. It's just good to sink into a book, and let the author take you where he wishes. The characters are fairly engaging, and I get interested in finding out how Dillon and friends are going to make everything right in the end. As long as Mr. Higgins keeps writing these tales, I will keep reading them!"},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Oh, man...Jack Higgins, where have you gone? Eye of the Storm, the introduction of Sean Dillon, is perhaps Higgins' best work. Starting with The President's Daughter, however, it's been all down hill.It's sort of like when your favorite All-star ballplayer starts hitting below .250, and never snaps out of it.I know fiction is fiction, but anyone who has even the most basic understanding of world politics will have a tough time buying into the plot.Higgins has a history of characters whose families have dual ethnicities, as does the main antagonist in this story. But Paul Rashid's background -- half Arab, half English, and he was an SAS soldier in the Gulf War -- doesn't jive with some of the things he does in the present setting of the story. Like Rashid telling all of the Arab fringe groups to start kicking up a fuss. Arafat can't control these people, but they'll listen to some guy who fought AGAINST Arabs? Don't know about that one, Jack old boy.The book boils down to the Rashids sending one hit squad after the next to knock off Dillon and his cronies, Dillon of course foiling the attempts and wasting the hitmen, and then Dillon and Ferguson et al bumping into the Rashids the next day in a nice restaurant and chatting about it."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Here's the whole three hundred pages, in a nutshell: Supercool IRA hitman Sean Dillon plays some piano (cigarette hanging from lip, Hoagy Carmichael-style), cracks wise (Irish-style) with the resident skirt, kicks a** (with style, of course), and has a Bushmills. Then he goes somewhere to eat and talk, cracks wise, kicks a**, and has a Bushmills. Subsequently, he (inexplicably) gets into an underwater speargun duel, kicks a**, and manages to find a Bushmills in some hellhole in Yemen (no clean water, but they've got Bushmills). Then he takes a break, and has a Bushmills. Then he crash lands his plane after it gets machine-gunned by baddies, wins a three-page mini-Beau Geste gunfight at a deserted desert fort, cracks wise, and--even though he has to walk a few miles to get it--has a Bushmills. I could go on, but you get the picture.Ludicrous, flat, and uninvolving, from a writer who's capable of much more (The Eagle Has Landed, The Eagle Has Flown, Storm Warning, etc.). And does J.H. own stock in Bushmills' distillery, or WHAT???? Have a bourbon and soda once in a while, for the love of god."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"The premise of this book is that someone who doesn't care if he dies is unstoppable.Mr. Higgins's invincible hero in Edge of Danger is the familiar Sean Dillon, ex-IRA, who continues his role in earlier Higgins books of foiling terrorists on behalf of the British government. The terrorists here come from a wealthy, influential British family (the Daunceys) with Bedouin roots (the Rashids) as well. The Rashids employ IRA and Arab mercenaries to execute their plans, but get their own hands pretty dirty in the process.The book is marred by several problems. First, Dillon's inevitable success makes the action seem redundant. Second, there's too much action crammed into the story (enough for about four books) so you don't get the careful build-up of tension and then relief that makes action thrilling to read about. You just get another punch in the stomach, and move on to the next. Third, this book is about meglomania on such a grand scale as to be like looking inside an insane asylum. That robs the story of validity. Fourth, the villains are cut out of such thin cardboard that all you can tell about them is that they are crazy, rich, and stupid. The threat from their plots is hard to take seriously. Fifth, the book relies on references to products and brands as the primary means to establish mood and setting, a weak method to employ in such a sketchy book.I was surprised by how far Mr. Higgins has strayed from his roots as a thoughtful thriller writer. In Edge of Danger, he has almost written a satire of his own work. In fact, the book is almost a crossover into the worst of the post-Ian Fleming 007 books.The point he wants to make is that honesty and loyalty are what count, rather than one's ancestors, money, or influence. That message seems distorted by the fact that Sean Dillon turns out to be available to run errands for the rich without fully understanding what he is facilitating. What good are honesty and loyalty if they can be suborned by almost anyone, including the creeps in this book? This early betrayal of the Dillon character by Mr. Higgins sets up a reason for Dillon to be angry and want revenge, but even that's not carried off well. Between violent episodes, the good guys and the bad guys are having civil little chats with one another suggesting that the bad guys should mend their ways.Unlike many series, you could skip this book and not miss a single important development about Sean Dillon and his colleagues. If you do decide to read Edge of Danger, set a time limit and read quickly. That will make the experience more exciting by giving you a real source of suspense. Will you finish the book before your time runs out?After you finish the book (if you insist on reading it), I suggest that you contemplate what makes thrillers thrilling. What draws you to this genre? How can you tell if a book will meet that promise from reviews? Which reviewers are reliable and which praise everything? How can you evaluate whether to finish such a book once you've started? What face do you want evil to show, in order to make the triumph of good rewarding?Seek out the spread of goodness in all that you do!"},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Many years ago Jack Higgins wrote The Eagle Has Landed, one of the best adventure novels of my lifetime. Then he wrote Storm Warning, an extraordinarily good adventure novel. In total he has written 29 adventure books. Most have been pot-boilers (a nineteenth century term for light novels you read while waiting for the pot to boil).Higgins developed a set of characters involved in counter espionage and trying to stop bad guys from succeeding. In the post cold war world he has found an increasing range of bad guys. Edge of Danger is worth reading as a reminder of several key realities of our time. There are many people with massive resources who may decide they dislike us for reasons of their own. They may have backgrounds that give them remarkable knowledge of and contacts in our society. A free society is remarkably open and vulnerable.The details of this book are not believable but the overlying sense of vulnerability and threat are as real as the Taliban destroying priceless historic monuments and Osama bin Laden still holding press conferences eight years after the United States began trying to knock him out of the terrorist business. If you are looking for a quick read in a world of adventure and danger this will get your mind off whatever you have been worried about and remind you of the real threats the CIA and the FBI have to worry about. I look forward to Higgins' next work."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"this book is great could not stop when i started. can not wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"As most people readers know, Jack Higgins has written many fine action-packed books. However, this book reads like a twelve-year-old wrote it. The characters are so transparent they could be ghosts.The author and his publishing house must really need the money to rip of the public in this manner. This is the last book I read by this author. One can only rest on his laurels for so long. I'm glad this book was handed down to me or I would have written a really nasty review."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Edge of Danger is a step above a number of recent Jack Higgins tales. The protaginist - Sean Dillon, must track down a dangerous Middle Eastern billionaire before he can reek havoc on the world. While prior to 11 September, this book is relevant to our crisis. Higgins does a nice job bringing out more dimensions of Dillon and some of the other good guys. The author bumbles a chance to knock off a key character - losing the opportunity to add some tension and passion to the survivors. Incredibly, this person takes three bullets and lives. The plot is solid and fast paced. My only problem is with the enemies. They are too cold and their motives are weak. The key assaisin could audition for the Key Stone Cops. Don't get me wrong, the Edge of Danger is a good yarn. I hope Higgins continues to improve the depth and reality of his characters. I look forward to the next edition."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Somebody from higher places should have stopped Mr. Higgins and the publisher from putting this book on the market.It&iexcl;s quite disturbing to see the absence of integrity and sense of responsibility in providing a joy of reading to the public.All along, I had fight off the growing urge of disposing this disastrous novel only because the shipping charge cost more than the book itself.Yet, once I overcame my frustration and finished the book, I regretted not heeding to my senses.It&iexcl;s obvious that Mr. Higgins had no heart in writing this book, and he made no effort in showing creativity with words.I was about to scream my head off when he kept rehashing the same phrases (e.g., browning with carswell silencer) over and over again in every single chapter!!This book made me a true anti-Higgins...."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"1 star - only because that's the minimum.This book proves the famous can publish anything."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I love the Sean Dillon series but after anticipating this book I was very disappointed. There was more talk than action - and the same talk &quot;what are they going to do?&quot; repeated too often. Paul Rashid's family's motives and characters were superficially explained and Kate is nothing but a talking mannequin. For Dillon to lose control over an assassin in his own home and allow Hannah to nearly get killed is unreal. The author brings numerous characters (i.e. Blake and Villiers) in and out without giving them much to do. I think Higgins is getting lazy and it shows in this book. It was a fast but lightweight read."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Edge Of Danger. The book was in good condition. The story was excellant. Recommended to anybody that likes Jack Higgins and Shawn Dillon stories."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"This is my very first book review. Because this book is so fundamentally wrong I need to speak up. The main character Sean Dillion, formal IRA, has a license to kill and make the killing like a game rather than justice. He does whatever he wants to do without follow orders nor has any boundary. He pickup a couple of his terrorism/criminal partners making killing like a habits, terrorism competition, fun game and egoism fulfillment. It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity. The killings like a joke to him and have absolutely no legal consequence. This book has promote violence behavior has no artist nor entertainment value. I lost my interest in Jack Higgins Sean Dillion's serial after finishing this ridicules book."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"It's a hard slog to read a book written by someone just going through the motions.Jack Higgins drags out his stock company of characters - Sean Dillon and his .22 in an ankle holster and glasses of Bushmills and cardboard villians and it's just a bore.The action isn't believable. The plot is silly. The dialogue is written to tell the reader what's going on (and every character speaks with the same voice) - this isn't how real people speak. Then the characters overexplain because, apparently, the author wasn't paying attention when he gave you the same information a dozen or so pages ago.Frankly, I've read enough about the IRA and Prods and One Para and County Down to last me the rest of my born days. It just isn't worth it anymore, Jack. Too much work reading for too little reward."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"This minimalism style of writing exposes too much reliance on characters and events from previous books with little descriptive detail of some promising locations. The action is thin as well, characters die frequently and quickly with little build up or detail.

When the diplomat is provided immunity by Russia and America, vengeance is sought with the life of the American president.Action swerves throughout the world until a terrifying finale takes place in a remote castle."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"This is simply the worst book I remember reading. I enjoyed a couple other Jack Higgins novels, so I happily picked this up. I'm sorry I did. It is nothing but action, which might be OK for a fun read on the beach, but even the action is so poorly written it is ridiculous. Massive action scenes (such as large battles) take place in only 1 or 2 pages. There's no character development, poor dialogue, no setting descriptions, no drama or suspense -- nothing but a poorly-described series of \\"events\\"! Enough said."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I have been a Higgins fan for many years, and have read and collected almost all of the books he has written. Some were great and full of suspense. But the last three he has written, including this one, &quot;Edge of Danger&quot;, are very disappointing. He has resorted to producing 2 books a year, based on the formula of a superficial story line with no depth, predictable characters, and it seems that he now writes just to capitalize on his prior reputation as a good suspense writer.Count the number of Marlboros smoked, the amount of Bushmills and champagne drank, (and in the midst he changes his champagne brand which makes one wonder whether he has received a better commission from one favorite to another), and you find a shallow book. I would save my money on this one, and buy it only if you collect Higgins First Editions, hoping to capitalize someday on the commercial side of selling all Higgins books to a collector."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I don't usually write reviews for books I've read, as I don't usually visit the sites of books I've read, but somehow I wandered into this site and had to respond to all the negative reviews of this book. I should mention that while the title of the version I listened to says that the book was abridged, the product description (as well as the cover of my set) clearly demonstrates that I did listen to the entire book, so I was not &quot;spared&quot; any of the &quot;bad&quot; parts.I stumbled upon Jack Higgins' books a couple years ago and have been hooked ever since. The Edge of Danger was no different than the rest, being very well done and hard to put down. Perhaps if I had been reading the book, I might have been disturbed by the dialog that others have complained about, but on tape, the narrative flowed smoothly. Others have complained about the plot, but I found the plot enjoyable, as Dillon and friends try to keep ahead of the Rashids, who are driven by the intense desire to revenge their mother's death and the assassination attempt against Paul Rashid. In addition, this book delved further into the personalities and natures of Dillon and the other characters than many of the other books. I appreciated seeing the reasons why Dillon is driven to perform certain actions instead of only what actions he actually takes.I like to listen to books by Jack Higgins when I am in the car, and this one, just like all the others, was a good choice. For those interested in the aspects of the audio version, Patrick McNee does an outstanding job of narrating Higgins' books, and I now look for his name if I am purchasing a new audio book. He smoothly switches among the various accents represented in Higgins' books, speaking clearly and with enjoyable, believable expression. Higgins' books seem particularly conducive for listening to, as things are written in a straightforward manner. This contrasts with this writing of Tom Clancy, to whom Higgins may be compared, because Clancy moves so rapidly from scene to scene that it is very difficult to follow. When Higgins changes scenes, I have no problem following while I am listening to the book.In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed this book so much that when I would get home from work, I would take the tapes out of the car and bring them into the house because I was so anxious to learn what was going to happen next. I certainly recommend this book for anyone looking for an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I've read 5 or 6 Higgins books, and this is one of my favorites. I like Sean Dillion. I also enjoyed the Rashid Family as characters, although I was surprised how quickly and easily Dillion went through them. I thought there would be a few more left for the sequel."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I was a big fan of Jack Higgins adventures until this book! I think this book reads like a poorly written condensed version of a good story - or like the outline of a book. It jumped around too abruptly with poorly written dialogue - no conversation was stretched into a normal length of exchange between people. It was difficult to keep track of all the minor characters in the book because none of them were well developed. I will proabably never read another Jack Higgins book. I am very disappointed - just like I got with Robert Ludlum in one of his later novels. I have never read another book of his either."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Sean Dillon again impishly dances the Irish Jig through England, Ireland, and parts of Saudi Arabia, while efficiently wounding and killing every bad guy in or out of sight and drinking a Bushmill's while doing it all.

God bless all here."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Jack Higgins, my favorite author, does it again.

This is not only Higgin's worst effort to date, it is probably the worst book I've read in the past 5 years.

Unbelievable chapter after unbelievable chapter, no character or plot development, written like a 5th grader.The end of the book foretells a sequel...a book that I will immediately pass on. Probably my last Higgins book without reading the reviews first.Don't buy it -- don't borrow it -- don't read it."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"After reading this book, I felt guilty for having purchased it, because that contributed to its best-seller status. (Oops, maybe not; the way it works now, it was a bestseller the day it hit ths stores.) But it is sad to think of all the aspiring writers who struggle to get a publisher's attention for their worthy efforts, while this strangely hollow piece waltzed its way to bestseller status.

When the patriarch dies in battle, his survivors knew he was doing his job. However, when someone runs over their mother and nothing happens to the perpetrator, the new patriarch swears vengeance. He orders the assassination of the driver, but when the United States and Russia interfere with his business in the Arabian province of Hazar, he vows to bring death upon both nations.He assembles an elite assassin team to kill the American president, but Sean Dillon, former IRA terrorist and now agent of the British government learns of the plan. Blake Johnson and the Secret service foil the attempt. Blake and Sean with the support of their respective governments intend to bring down the Rashids one person at a time.Jack Higgins writes a fast-paced action thriller that keeps the reader turning pages at supersonic speed. There is plenty of action filed with shoot-outs and techno-gadgets along the lines of 007. Although dangerous and clearly a &quot;bad boy&quot;, Sean still seems authentic. EDGE OF DANGER brings exciting entertainment that never eases up until the very last page for its adrenaline soaked crowd.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"This book was obviously written by the numbers, but Higgins appears to have become lost when he got to ten. Perhaps if he had removed his shoes it might have perked the tedious text up a bit.\\"Paul Rashid was one of the richest Englishmen in the world.\\" He was also half Arab and half British nobility. He and his brothers and one sister wanted to rule the world of Arab oil, but Russia and the United States did not support their hegemony. So, what to do? They would assassinate the President; that should show the meddlesome Americans. Why not kill the Russian President? Well, everyone knows the Russians are a second-rate power. No one would take that seriously. If you have taken this seriously so far I will not mention what they did to the Russian diplomat who killed Mom in a head-on accident in England. I wouldn't want to ruin the suspense for you if you buy this, this, this... story.In the interest of full disclosure, I must state that I could not force myself past page 51, despite the fact that I was desperate for a good mystery to read. Someone else will have to tell you whether their plot succeeded."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Having read only one other Higgins book before (Cold Harbor), I hesitate, somewhat, to comment on the author's general talent. However, this book has to be one of the worst I've read in some time. I think the thing that got me the most was the dialog; unbelievably simplistic and totally formulaic. &quot;Damn, he said to Kate, &quot;It's the Hazar Scouts, &quot; Puhleeze! Not even an exclamation mark. Many other examples could be given. Now, assuming for the moment that the dialog was, say, written at greater than a 7th grade level, the plot is almost as bad. The protagonists' reactions to their fellows getting knocked off one-by-one is almost comic. There's no depth here; just one simple vignette after another. I wouldn't even want to compare this to Ludlum or Clancy (although Clancy's gotten a bit rough of late).A terrific waste of a good"},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"This book is not well written and leaves nothing to the imagination. If I hadn't bought it in hard cover and spent the money I would not even have finished reading it."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Jack Higgins a.k.a Granny's favourite.His world war 2 novels were very well written, with good plots. However, these latest Higgins novels lack something which the early Higgins novels had in abdance. They were obviously written by a person with a high command of the English language.His latest books have been somewhat lacluster in the way they are written. He seems to have cast aside the need to write well in favour of high powered plots.Lucky for him it works. Many authors couldn't get away with letting their writing get slack. But with Higgins, we just don't seem to care. And Why? Because his plots are so damn good. He writes to a very old formula of action novels. There is a flawed but brilliant hero, and a girl, and a formidable enemy. throw in different world location, lots of guns, lots of fighting, and simmer for 15 minutes. It is a very simple formua, and one which he never strays from. SOme people criticise him because they believe this shows a lack of depth and range. In some ways they are right, but in others wrong. It is really great hwo he can just put pen to paper, no matter what he writes, and just make you want to turn the page. Also, it astounds me how he manages to come up with so many differney and exciting ideas which still manage to satisfy his writing formula. it is simple yet effective.This latest book is no less a pageturner than several of his previous ones. He has a great plot here, and a great, and very popular lead character, and one of the best baddies in a long time.extract from blurb: &quot;When Paul Rashid, leader of the Rashid Bedouin of Hazar in the Persian Gulf, uncovers an international conspiracy to deprive his family of the oil wealth that is theirs by right, he vows to gain vengeance. The man sent to stop him is the British Government's uncompromising sevret enforcer Sean Dillon. It is a mission that will test him as never before, confronted by old foes and new in a deadly game of cat and mouse that will take him from Ireland to the USA, and from the heart of the English countryside to the deserts of the Hazar...and the very edge of danger.&quot;This in itself promises a brilliant an exciting book. Especially with such motives of the villain, who the reader empathises with right from the very beginning, hoping against hope that he does in fact gain his vengeance. It's a strange device Higgins uses here, because the reader knows they are not supposed to want the villain to win. But in this book you just can't help it. You feel so much sympathy with the fact with the fact taht Russia and America are trying to take away their families land and oil. You will him on, to win. And you, for once, wish Sean Dillion would fail. It's a book that really toys with your emotions.Because the characters are so compelling, and the plot so great, it more than covers up for the fact that they are not actually very much more than card-board cut outs. He doesn't draw his characters in any depth, but you.just.dont.care.I got through this book in a single day. It's excellent. It starts with a bang (when a gypsy insults Paul rashid's mother and abuses, whereupon Paul goes to the gypsy camp to have it out with the man, and ends up cutting his ear off). and does not let up from there.Higgins writes excellent plot-driven thrillers. As well as being able to be very tender with his writing. There are times when you want to cry (rather like with his previous book &quot;The President's Daughter&quot;).Another good thing about this book is Paul Rashid's sister, Lady Kate Rashid. She's superb. A wonderfully strong willed young woman, who vows vengeance upon Sean Dillion right at the end of the book. I cannot wait for the sequel. Kate Rashid pitted against Dillion, will be an absolutely wonderful read.This book comes highly reccomended, with a stunning plot and compelling characters. You shoudl definitely give it a try if you like quick, exciting reads. But if you think that half the beauty of a book is in the writing, then it probably isn't for you.great. can't wait for Midnight Runner"},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"This is my second Higgins novel and I am reall getting into this world that has been created by the author. I have learned a lot of the IRA in ways that I find pretty entertaining if at times a little fantastic.The story once again centers around Dillon the bad boy of the IRA that is now working for the British. His mission is to stop this family of half British and half Arab bilionaires.The action is non-stop and pretty interestng. It's a quick read sometime that is to the point and nothing really deep.The only compaint that I have is that I want to know more of Dillon but little by little we are seeing more of the character and some character growth."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Very simplistic writing style- he said, she said, then he said, then she said. This reads like a first attempt, not like a book written by a seasoned author of over 30 books."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Higgins is a great storyteller. This is a great book. I liked it. A climax that was explosive."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"The villains in &quot;Edge of Danger&quot; are the Rashids, a ridiculously wealthy family that is half-Arab and half-English. The leader of the clan is Paul Rashid, who is a graduate of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst and is also a decorated veteran of the Gulf War. Paul's two brothers, Michael and George, are also graduates of Sandhurst, and their beautiful sister, Kate, attended Oxford University.Paul Rashid is enraged when his mother is killed by a Russian commercial attache driving on the wrong side of the road. It turns out that the Russian, whose name is Gatov, enjoys diplomatic immunity; he is brokering an oil deal in the Middle East for the Russians and the Americans. The interests of Gatov and his friends conflict with the oil interests of the Rashid family. Paul Rashid decides that it is in his best interests to strike at his enemies before they can strike at him. He forms a plot to assassinate the President of the United States.&quot;Edge of Danger&quot; is basically a cat and mouse game between Paul and his family on one side, and Sean Dillon, the former IRA soldier and scourge of the British military, on the other side. Sean occasionally does dirty work for his former enemy, Brigadier General Charles Ferguson. When Ferguson needs a tough job done on behalf of the British government, he calls in Dillon, who is an expert marksman, knows how to fly any plane that exists, and can even scuba dive.Dillon and his cohorts fight it out with Rashid and his hired thugs, and a great deal of blood is spilled. In this violent book, people die in many ways, such as knifing, gunshot wounds, having their necks broken, drowning, and falling off balconies. Rashid is little more than a rich sociopath, and his character makes little sense. Why would a man who enjoys enormous wealth and an enviable social position behave like a common thug? His excuse that he wants &quot;vengeance&quot; doesn't explain his completely irrational behavior.Although the action scenes are exciting enough, carnage alone is not enough to make a book credible and interesting. None of the characters rises above the level of a stereotype. &quot;Edge of Danger&quot; is basically a string of bloody action scenes glued together with some exposition and stilted dialogue. I do not recommend it."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I've never written a review but my curiosity about what others thought of this book was a thousand times more compelling than the Edge of Danger. I've enjoyed Mr. Higgins' books in the past but can't for the life of me understand a) why he wrote this book, or b) why it was published! There is no plot, no character development, predictable action, no tension. It's like reading an Executive Summary of a book. Are you sure they didn't publish the outline by mistake?"},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"This is most probably my last Jack Higgins novel.There was a time when I couldn't wait for the newest book from Jack Higgins to come out. Regrettably that time was the mid 1980's. I have increasingly become disenchanted with his storylines and two dimensional characters. It is perhaps time for Mr. Sean Dillon to retire from active service.As other reviewers have said, there is very little (if any) true plot to &quot;Edge of Danger&quot;. The entire Rashid family are thin and vacuous. Paul's motives most especially are questionable. This novel is a complete parody of Jack's earlier (and more entertaining) works.A common thread of recent Jack Higgins novels has been the very formulaic writing style...for example... a cheesy villain arrives on the scene and does something to upset Ferguson and Dillon. Dillon takes on the job of figuring out the villain's plan. Ferguson berates Dillon for his cavalier attitude. Dillon has a Bushmill's. Villain and Dillon talk and talk and talk. Dillon somehow manages to save the day. All along the way re-reminding readers of Dillon's past with the IRA. You'd think after all this time Mr. Higgins would have assumed his fans know this fact.Save your money on this one. I'd love to be able to recommend it, but simply cannot. It's a tiresome and insubstantial read."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Look. I can't really disagree with the other reviews. However, I enjoyed this book. If you, as have I, read every Sean Dillon book in the series you will enjoy spending a few hours with these characters who have become so familiar after so many years. Great literature? Not a chance. A good read for fans of Jack Higgins? Definitely!!!!"},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Unlike most other books written by Jack Higgins, &quot;Edge of Danger&quot; suffers from several major problems. Rather than careful plotting and suspense, the narrative descends spectacularly into a series of uneven gunfights. While this makes for some reasonable- if shallow reading, the plot is further marred by the unerring success rate of the protagonist Sean Dillon (in one of many appearances) and his nigh-on invulnerability.The premise is simple: A nefarious, rich family with both Engliah and Arab heritage hatches a plot to overturn the world order while lining their pockets. As expected, ex-IRA Sean Dillion is pitted against the undertakings and is characteristically successful in thwarting their plans.While at times interesting, &quot;Edge of Danger&quot; is an uneven read, punctuated with frequent doses of shallow action and insufficient character development/description. What is initially an interesting premise is marred by the invincibility of Sean Dillion and the lack of any concrete narrative structure. &quot;The Eagle has Landed&quot; remains Jack Higgins's finest offering"},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"This novel has got more plot holes than a mosquito net and more repetitions than financial scandals in corporate America. Did Jack Higgins think he was designing a computer game with progressive scenarios and cut scenes of tete-a-tete between the heroes and the villains between scenarios?The premise of the story was this: a union of the a Mid-Eastern tribe and a Scottish noble family produced the Rashid-Daunceys, financially rich, ambitious and aristocratic from long traditions. Family motto \\"I Always Return\\".All the male scions of the family graduated Stanhurst, with the eldest, Paul, serving in the Gulf War and Northern Ireland. Post Gulf War, they concentrated their efforts to monopolise control of the oil production in their native Bedu. Enter American-Russian consortium intent on bypassing the Rashids, involving some failed assassination attempt on Paul. An unfortunate accident also killed their mother, coincidentally involving a Russian representative of the consortium.It was from here that the plot began to become ridiculous. Granted that their Arabic blood (and Scottish as well) demanded some revenge, but Paul chose the assassination of the US president to make a warning against messing with the Bedu, never mind that the president Jake Cavalet was acknowledged as a decent guy who was not involved.The first big question was: even if they could assassinate Jake Cavalet, how would the world know it was for messing with the Bedu? And if the Bedu or the Rashids claimed the kill, what would be left of the Bedu or the Rashids after the outraged Americans were done with their vengeance? Frederick Forsyth's Day of the Jackal had the assassin carefully planning his moves, erasing his tracks and maintaining his anonymity, intending on permanent retirement in the aftermath. In contrast, Higgins' plotters talked like they accepted such deals every second Tuesday of the month.The failed attempt of Jake Cavalet (no thanks to dismal security), and capture of one of the assassins, leaked the entire plot to the president, his advisor Blake Johnson, and through a connection with Sean Dillon, the British PM and MG Ferguson of Group 4. This was where the ridiculousness was brought to a new height - they did nothing except to watch the Rashids and try to catch the Rashids at the next attempt. Had there been no surviving witnesses, the authorities might not have been able to do anything. But enough evidence was present to confirm the Rashids involvement, and instead of bringing the very expensive agencies, the US and UK leaders took the passive role. The Rashids swaggered through town with impunity after failing to kill the US president and left one of the assassins to be captured alive; this was where the book lost its credibility altogether.The rest of the book had Sean Dillon playing cat-and-mouse game with the Rashids, except that they could not agree who was to be mouse and who was to be the cat.Jack Higgins tried to make this a little different from his previous Dillon-is-the-hero book by introducing two sidekicks for him; former London gangsters; one of whom the readers were repeatedly reminded of how many times he was imprisoned, and Jack also took out policewoman Hannah Bernstein, having her wounded and confined to the hospital. However, instead of making this book fresh or different, the scenes became trite with cliche conversations and reactions from the characters.Though the locations moved across the world from UK to US to the Bedu's Hazar in the Middle East, there was nothing meaningful significance about each scene. In the end, it concluded with Paul Rashid telling his sister Kate that he wanted to continue the game with Dillon because it gave him more kick than earning another billion. The charaters in this book could hardly be less cardboard-like.The epilogue ended with Kate Rashid, still a free (and bloody rich) woman, despite being clearly and personally involved in the plots, promising vengeance on Ferguson, Dillon & Co., all in a cozy bar just like the British commenting on the weather. The hint of the sequel did not hold much promise, Jack Higgins had better realise how awful this book was before he became condemned permanently as a has-been. He ought to re-study his previous books like Cold Harbour, the Eagle had landed and A Game for Heroes to rediscover the human element which made his book so good."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I'm so glad that this was not my first Jack Higgins novel. If it were, it would also be my last.Normally, I can forgive Higgins his cliche's and his obsessive attention to his characters' drinking habits, because his characters are fun and interesting. He puts them in great plots and pulls the reader happily through them, and you can't wait to find the next book especially if it's got Sean Dillon.But not this one. All the characters are wooden. The action is colorless and completely unbelievable. A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog? A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone else?There is no sense of timing or place, only the thinnest of motivations for most characters, and no justification for many of the decisions made by characters.This book is amateur hour. Don't bother. Read some of Higgins's earlier works instead."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I felt compelled to finish the book partly because I read on the treadmill and I didn't have anything else to read. That said, it wasn't the worst book I have read, but it certainly is the worst I have read recently. Since this is my first go at reading Higgins I will assume perhaps he is an acquired taste that I just haven't acquired as of yet.My suspension of disbelief was stretched to the limit and beyond by such gems as (***** Spoilers follow *****)* The president of the United States only has 2 secret service men every weekend, and one of those is a communications guy.* A billionaire hires an assassin apparently incapable of accomplishing the simplest of tasks. Why didn't he use a law rocket instead of a sniper rifle? Don't you think a billionaire could hire several competent assassins?* Why could Dillon just go round and shoot the bad guys sometimes but other times he needed proof.* Continually the bad guy keeps trying to kill Dillon at every opportunity \\"because he is not expecting it right now\\". Well golly gee, I guess maybe Dillon would never have caught on to that the first dozen or so times Rashid tried to have him offed.I sort of liked Sean Dillon but at times the novel seemed almost a self-parody. The number of times the characters threatened to do one another in face to face was ludicrous. Really, why not just pull out the guns and have at it right there.Now I am going to go drink a Bushmills. The worst part is I might actually buy the follow-up book to this one because I developed a modicum of curiosity as to the future these characters. So it wasn't a total loss. But after reading some espionage thrillers by Daniel Silva I was quite disappointed in this Higgins offering."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Boy, this was a disappointing read. The characters were not well developed (hence challenging to keep track of), the plot was implausible yet predictable, and half way through I had to wrestle with whether or not to even finish the book. I did, although it was unrewarding to do so.I'd rate this lower if I could.FYI, if you're looking for an alternate selection in the same genre, I highly recommend Silent Joe by T. Jefferson Parker."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Jack Higgins may not be running out of his fascination with modern weapons, fine dining, glamorous women or the IRA but he appears to be slipping on plot and character development. Sean Dillon makes Doc Savage and Dirk Pitt look like pikers. And this curious extension of gentlemanly methods for attempting to kill one another -- sending a crazed assassin and then both sides meeting later at the Savoy to exchange notes -- strains credulity.Higgins has done some first-rate work. Had this been published twenty-five years ago, this might have made a difference. It wasn't and it doesn't."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"This is by far his worst effort that I've read. He's not my favorite spy author,anyway. This book feels like it had been written to fulfill a publisher's contract or obligation that Mr. Higgins had assumed and needed to finish in a hurry. The characters are not at all fleshed out, and the story line is too contrived. I would advise not wasting time by reading this book."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Sean Dillon, Blake Johnson, Hannah Bernstein and Brigadier (now promoted, though heaven knows what for because he never does anything) Ferguson are back; this time they are after the dastardly half-British, half-Bedouin Rashids, who seek revenge and will not be stopped. They hire a completely inept assassin to take down the President of the USA, or, when that doesn't work, an Arab Council of Elders, or, when that doesn't work, the Russian Premier (and that doesn't work). Yes, it's ridiculous.Sean is the same caricature of himself, with a growing disciple in young Billy Slater, who should be killed off ASAP. Blake is the same, only useless in this story. Hannah is the same, only even flatter as a character. The Brigadier is still a dullard. The Rashids are supposedly bad, bad guys and gal. Bored yet? If the story doesn't hold you, you could always entertain yourself by counting references to Bushmill's whiskey. You'd have to pay me a lot to go back through this book but I bet there are hundreds.I pick up Jack Higgins's books sometimes because they're usually good entertainment, despite being cliched, generally preposterous, and awfully short on character development. This one, though, was so bad it can't be forgiven. My advice is to skip it.And if that wasn't enough: Patrick Mcnee's narration on the audiotape version was awful. Gravelly to the point of silliness, and all the characters sounded the same.The worst news yet: The villain's motto is \\"We always return.\\" That means we are in for a sequel... which I for one will avoid."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Up to now, I have enjoyed almost all of the Higgins books, although they have tended to become more samey. I was particularly disappointed by Edge Of Danger. The tired old characters of Dillon, Ferguson etc are dragged out again for this entirely predictable, highly contrived and unbelievable yarn. The plots have all been used before, and if you've read any two other Dillon books you'll be able to guess the next line throughout. I bought it to read on the plane - was bored by check in and had finished it long before boarding. Give this one a miss."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"This book has no plot, and is so absolutely predictable that I had to put it away without finishing. Sean Dillon's character is getting so tired and his invincibility is sickening. A very poorly written book. The only good thing about this book is that I got it from the local libary and did not spend any money on it. Mr. Higgins, it's time to retire Sean Dillon and maybe spend more than 2 weeks on writing a book??"},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I love this book. I thought the characters were well-balanced in and the pace exciting. I can't wait for the sequel to this book."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I had the rare experience of giving up on a novel after only a couple of chapters when trying to read Edge of Danger recently, but Higgins managed to pen a book so lame that I refused to go any further. His bad guy is supposedly a Scottish-Arabian aristocrat but comes off as just another cartoon Arab terrorist with an implausible, pointless heritage. But, what do you expect from a middle-aged author who poses in bomber jacket and aviator glasses on the dust jacket.... depth?"},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Given the lack of character development, or rather, simplistic and at times contradictory character development; the lack of any plot whatsoever; and poor visualizations; I can't believe I read the whole book. I guess I kept waiting for the action to start. It never did."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I would have to agree with the other reviewers that this wasn't the best of the Sean Dillon books, but I did like the fact that Dillon at least showed a trace more vulnerability in this novel, but maybe that's just because I'm a woman and don't read them just for the action/adventure aspects. I also like the Northern Ireland background since that is what I like to read and write about myself. Though, this wasn't a particularly memorable book and the characters were definitely stereotyped, I keep continuing to buy them. It was definitely too short and over way too soon. I was also bothered by the killing of the one brother on the boat, which seemed totally senseless and coldblooded."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Deep in his latest novel, either by odd coincidence or deliberate design, Jack Higgins writes, \\"\`Well, that explains a lot. You've been damaged enough. He wanted to keep you out of it. You see, a face-to-face confrontation with Rashid will probably be like a spaghetti western.'\\"Unfortunately, a spaghetti western would have more character development and plot than this work. As in his last several novels, this one seems to read more like a Greek tragedy with limited character development and style. His formulaic style continues where the good guys do evil (at times) for the right cause and the bad guys are misguided and do evil for the wrong cause.In this case, the Earl of Loch Dhu, Paul Rashid, leads the evil empire. Paul is of mixed blood involving the aristocracy in England and in the province of Hazar, in the Persian Gulf. \\"The two traditions flowed together in their blood, the medieval British and the Bedouin, producing a general fierceness that was remarked upon in Paul, . . .\\" In short, a powerful man that when crossed or defied can seek powerful vengeance.And vengeance is the theme and motivator for all character actions in this simply plotted novel. Rashid and his two brothers and one sister, control a large empire of holdings in a variety of interests. The sultan of Hazar, bypasses their interests, to make an oil deal with the Americans and the Russians. If that wasn't enough, the ungrateful Sultan, is also apparently part of a plot to assassinate the Rashids. The plot is easily foiled with the assassins slain in the desert.Of course, such an act demands vengeance on a local level as well as at the ultimate levels in the American and Russian governments. The people that lead these two nations must die so the world will know of their actions and resulting punishment. Enter General Ferguson, Sean Dillon and the usual suspects of the British Intelligence Service who plan to stop the attacks, one way or another.This novel continues in the recent tradition of Jack Higgins. The writing is weak, the character development is exceedingly limited, the style is poor and the scenic descriptions are poor. The sameness of his recent novels continues and the reader is left with the sense that this has been read before, many times. It is unfortunate that he continues in the slide from the promise of his early novels to a writing style and effort that just seems to be going through the motions for a few sales. This author has talent and expertise that he simply is not using, for whatever reason, and that is a shame."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I kept hoping it would get better.

This one does:&quot;Stone said, 'It really is like a bad movie, Harry.'&quot;'You can bleeding well say that again. . . .'&quot;This book reads like a 7th grade reading-level condensation of an outline of a screenplay: The paragraphs are no more than a few lines long; very few words greater than two syllables are used. No complex thoughts, no character development, no suspense, and little description. Pure formulaic twaddle."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"This novella (stretched to 271 pages by wide margins and double-spaced lines) reads like a screenplay treatment. There is very little character development, movie-like dialogue, and plenty of mindless action. The ending is wholly unsatisfying and I'm led to believe that this is simply a set-up for another book. An author with some integrity would have placed Edge of Danger as part 1 of a 2-part novel.If you are dead-set on reading Edge of Danger, don't waste your money. The cover price of .....is an insult and the deeply discounted .......... price will still leave you feeling ripped-off. Go to your local library in the morning and you'll finish Edge of Danger in time for an early lunch. Just don't expect to have any appetite left."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"The plot is not believable, there is not a shred of character development, and there isn't even any descriptive atmosphere. It shocks me that Jack Higgins and the publishers actually make money off of this puerile drivel. I shall not buy any more of his efforts."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I agree with Gingrich, the Eagle Has Landed was one of the best books I have read by this or any other author in the genre. It is, perhaps, why I have read many of his other books, with varying degrees of pleasure.This book, &quot;Edge of Danger,&quot; is not one of Jack Higgins' best efforts. I have enjoyed his books before, and admired his plots. In this book, the plot has potential, although is presented in a thin and stereotyped way. But the story and its telling let the plot down. The plot never gets developed in a believable way, or even at all. The dialogue is mostly obvious, inane, and unimaginative. The characters are cardboard replicas of what they could have been. I get the impression that a book, riding on the superb reputation of the author, was slapped together in the hopes of eliciting a lucrative movie rights deal. Since the story gets substantially rewritten when made into a movie, why bother with creating interesting characters or putting much effort into the book itself? The money is in the movie.I also find the story somewhat insulting. The Russians and the Americans (oil companies) have conspired together to drill oil wells all over the desert. Some political correctness here, Greens and Friends of the Earth to the rescue! Everyone sits calmly by while the locals (some sort of Arab tribe) skin alive some poor throw-away British Army junior officer. But the hardened heros take it all in stride. Business as usual for the tough guys. Plastic scene. And, there are others.The final scene, the climax of the plot, is a total flop, written it seems, out of boredom with the story, just to get it over.I am left with the nagging question: did Jack Higgins really write this terrible book himself, or did he hire someone to do it for him? At least with Mozart's Requiem we are left with a great piece of music and a mystery about who wrote it. In this case, we only have the mystery."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I look forward to reading a Jack Higgins novel. As a kid I read every Ian Fleming 007 book I could find. Granted Higgins is not Fleming and Sean Dillon is not James Bond-but I draw the parallel just the same because I like the action stories and Jack Higgins never disappoints when it comes to action. If you like the action/danger story, one that will most assuredly place you at the edge of your chair, at the edge of your bed, or at the edge of your toilet seat, depending on where you do your most serious reading, then Edge of Danger is the book for you. Jack Higgins is a far better writer than I so when I offer criticism I do it in my most humble way. So here it is, I get tired of plots involving the President of the United States."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"This is without a doubt Higgins' least inspired work in years. The plot is predictable and over worn, and the books is very uninspired. A real disappointment"},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"It's another exciting page turner featuring Sean Dillon. This time he's dealing with the wealthy Rashid Family (three brothers and one sister) who are half Arab and half British nobility. It's makes for a very interesting plot line and story with Sean Dillon who is capably assisted by Blake Johnson, Charles Ferguson and Hannah Bernstein and a few others. The end of the story is good for it sets up the reader to anxiously await the sequel and the further adventures of Mr. Dillon and Kate Rashid."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"The style of writing leads me to believe that Higgins was under pressure to churn out a book to meet some editor's deadline. There was no character development. Critical turns in the plot and action were blown through without the slightest bit of suspense. I've never read Higgins before and likely will never read him again."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I have read many of Jack Higgins' books and this is the poorest so far, in my humble belief. As I travelled thro' the pages it just got harder and harder to believe the simplicity with which Mr Dillon strolls thro' the events at hand. The story also lacks any imagination and could probably have been summed up in a short story. Mr Dillon is just to sci-fi I'm afraid.There is a quote at the start of the book and as I got near the final chapters, I was starting to imagine that the Author would be writing the finale of Mr Dillon....the quote read&quot;To Tess, who thinks it's about time&quot;Author, I think she may mean something else...."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I buy all of Jack Higgins' books. For a thriller/espionage writer, his books have a QWON about them, they are well written, engaging, don't bog down into technical details, and offer a very entertaining story. There is so much (crud) in this genre, that Higgins' usually proves a ray of sunshine. Most of his books I have read multiple times.Edge of Danger is decidedly so unlike Higgins' previous literary titles, that I would be inclined to believe someone else wrote it (with exception to a few decent chapters). I think the character Dillon needs to be retired, which is alluded to in the last few chapters. This series in Higgins' catalogue is becoming boilerplate pulp. I think the Dillon series really began taking a turn for the worse several books back, although there was hope offered in Drink With the Devil. I most certainly hope we can expect other works from Higgins' along the line of Flight of Eagles, because this series is merely becoming silly. I certainly hope he does not trade Dillon for Salter and continue the series somehow!"},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"It is hard to believe that the same author wrote The Eagle Has Landed and Edge of Danger. The writing is just plain shallow. the plot predictable. Save your money for something better."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"This is my first Jack Higgins book and it will certainly be my last. Especially if, as the reviews state, it is the best Higgins book in a long time.The characters are never developed. The way the book begins, you think that the Rashid's are the good guys, and Dillin is the bad guy. Then all the sudden, without developing the characters, the roles are switched. You end up not caring who dies (and 6 billion people die in this book...a little overkill) and who lives.The \\"adventures\\" are similar to Dora the Explorer in how boring they are. They are very predictable, and of course, Dillin is killing 50 people and no one can kill him. Just ridiculous scenes.Don't get this book, despite the \\"reliablity\\" of the author."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"This is a fast moving story, with lots of action and superficial details. It is not great literature, but provides some light brain candy. Lots of bodies are left lying around as people are killed by various means (shooting, drowning, incineration, torture, falling off a roof).An Arab fanatic, annoyed by U.S. and Russian oil interests exploiting his country, decides on a high profile assassination. Nothing seems to work out for the bad guys, but some of the British ended up wounded.The story has an interesting ending with a very rich woman with a grudge, biding her time, and planning to spend portions of her wealth to get revenge. It brings to mind Matilda of Flanders (wife of King William I) who, spurned by a Saxon nobleman when she was a teenager, waited 20 years until William conquered England, then tracked down the Saxon and had him thrown into a dungeon."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"Edge of Danger is yet another installment of the on-going saga of Dillon, Ferguson and Bernstein. If you truly enjoyed the preceding efforts by Higgins, then you might like Edge of Danger (because it is more of the same). However, if you have been growing disenchanted by Higgins' efforts, then you probably want to take a pass on this (and for me at least, future efforts as well). Higgins' books are more and more like screen plays and less and less like novels. Dialog between the characters, which often is terse, choppy, and unimaginative, makes up virtually all of the text. Higgins almost completely avoids the opportunity add any depth and breadth to the story through the use of descriptive text. As with the last few books from Higgins, Edge of Danger is clearly a disappointment."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I've read a number of the reviews, and thought they were too hard. This is escapism - nothing more, and nothing less. The dialogue is trite and cliche, and the plot formulaic. But that is what makes Higgins so good. Its fun! And sure you have to suspend disbelief occassionally to make the plot work - but what's the harm with that? I enjoyed this book. It returns Higgins back to form after a number of less successful books in recent years. Even inspite of the cliches and plot formulas, there is a distinct 'grittiness' about the characters, which has been long over due."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"A terrible, childishly written book with absolutely NO redeeming value as literature. Higgins loves to &quot;speak Irish&quot; but even that gambit fails in this trite, poorly plotted, worthless endeavour by a writer who should remain retired if he can't do any better than such trashy writing."},{"Title":"Edge of Danger","review":"I purchased this book expecting very good things. I found the plot very thin and predictable. There was very little suspense. It almost seemed like an abridged version of a book where all the detail leading up was left out.

If he had researched this herb in depth he would have known this is a VERY dangerous suggestion to make to the general public. (not everyone is a rocket scientist, or possesses good reasoning ability, and some might just follow his advice without precautions) This plant is a member of the TOXIC Digitalis family and could be lethal if ingested by a small one! He even went as far as to suggest using the juice of the plant as well. In my humble opinion as an old wildcrafter-buy the book, BUT..double check things if there is any suggestion of using the plant with small children or of ingesting it.

I was excited because it seemed that the author's research and scholarship was much greater than Cunningham's.Unfortunately, as another reviewer pointed out, his magical corespondences seem arbitrary. Also, the plants he chooses to list seem to have come off the shelf of some musty old occult shop and not out of the author's garden. How can you claim to know anything about the plant and its powers if you know it only in death and have never experienced it alive and growing.Also, I sadly discovered that the author's scholarship is actually somewhat lacking. He describes Milkweed as the plant which attracts Monarch Butterflies, which is correct, unfortunately he lists the plant with the scientific name &quot;Apocynum Androsaemifolium&quot; which, while also sometimes called milkweed, has nothing to do with monarch butterflies. This plant is also sometimes called Dogbane and its a shrub which is totally unrelated to plants in the Asclepiadaceae family, which monarchs frequent.

But, it is a must have for any Herbal Collection."},{"Title":"Compendium of Herbal Magick","review":"Perhaps the most promising part of this book is Beyerl's astrological correspondences of the herbs. Unfortunately, it is also the part needing the most work. For example, Beyerl tells us that the energetics of a solar herb is hot and drying, and that a lunar herb is cool and moistening. This is actually very helpful information. However, he lists ginger as a lunar herb!! The logic of this absurdity defies comprehension! Ginger is one of the hottest and most drying herbs we have! Clearly it should be a solar herb! This most obvious contradiction calls into question Beyerl's other correspondence listings.If astrological herbalism is to be taken seriously -- and there is no reason why it cannot be, assuming it accurately portrays the energetics of herbs -- it must become more rigorous, adopt accurate criteria for classification, and come up with a comprehensive and noncontradictory system that is also useful in clinical practice. Peter Holmes' book The Energetics of Western Herbs would be a useful place to begin, as he accurately describes the advantages and disadvantages of the Galenic system that astrological herbalism builds upon. Rather than attempting to interpret the planetary attributes of an herb according to its analytic effect upon isolated tissues, it would be better for astrology to develop a bodily energetics based upon the planetary archetypes. In this way, the energetics of a planet would nicely fit both physiological conditions and herbal properties, rather than trying to fit an energetic model into an anatomic model which it poorly fits. Planetary attributes of herbs must be distinguished in terms of various categories : medical/therapeutic, archetypal/active, etc. For example, certain plants have become associated with the activities of certain planets / gods which makes sense mythically, but not necessarily clinically in a medical or therapeutic sense. This does not invalidate either, but requires specific elucidation in an herbal, so we may distinguish amongst categories.We need to be fair. Beyerl has done a great deal of synthesis in his book, especially on the magical properties of herbs, which does not particularly interest me. And he cannot be blamed for the rather pathetic state of modern astrological herbalism, which is in great need of intelligent, synthetic, and clinical revival. However, without dialogue with the author -- which I would welcome, by the way -- I cannot understand his method of planetary alignment with many of these herbs.I will say that pages 434 - 453 (&quot;Working With Astrological Correspondences&quot;) is one of the strongest parts of the book, which gives us an awesome and fairly comprehensive nature of the energetics of the planets. It is only when we come to the listings that I begin to question."},{"Title":"Compendium of Herbal Magick","review":"Unlike some of the other reviews, I liked it...and I have used it, to great success.

I do not really like how the author writes but I enjoy the story line."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter is truly one of literature's greatest triumphs, its characters and themes reverberating in our collective consciousness more than 150 years after its initial publication. Few novels inspire as much contemplation and feeling on the part of the reader. Hester Prynne, American fiction's first and foremost female heroine continues to haunt this world, inspiring a never-ending stream of scholarly debate. Even in our less puritanical age, some doubtless see her as a villainously great temptress, but to me she is a remarkably brave hero indeed. Her sin is known to all, and she never runs away from it, bearing the scarlet letter on her bosom bravely for all to see; she realizes the true measure of that sin, fretting constantly over the effects it will have on young Pearl, remaining steadfast in her beliefs while at the same time envisioning a new society where women and men can exist on more equal terms, free of the stultifyingly harsh punishments meted out on even the most repentant of souls by Puritanism. She shows her noble spirit by refusing to name her partner in sin and goes so far as to allow the ruthless Roger Chillingworth to torment the man she loves deeply enough to protect him for all time. Little Pearl is somewhat of an enigma, truly manifesting traits of both the imp and the little angel; her questions about the letter her mother wears and the minister who continually holds his hand against his heart reflect an insight that amazes this reader. Chillingworth is a thoroughly black-hearted man; I can certainly understand the blow he sustained as a result of Hester's sin, but his actions and thirst for prolonged revenge on the so-called perpetrator of the wrong he suffered can only be described as roguish and unpalatable.Of course, the most complex character in the novel (and literature as a whole) is the good minister Arthur Dimmsdale. One is compelled to both like him and despise him. He is basically a good man and an unquestionably fine soldier in the army of the Lord, winning many souls to God with his impassioned sermons. He is more aware than anyone else of his sinful nature, and he punishes himself quite brutally in private in a useless attempt to make up for the public ignominy he lacks the moral courage to call upon himself with a public profession of his deed. Dimmsdale is a coward and a hypocrite. At one critical moment in the latter pages of the novel, he blames Hester for his state of misery, and it is that comment in particular that makes this tragic character a man I can only commiserate with to a limited degree. Even at the penultimate moment of the novel, as he finally bears the mark of his shame and guilt for all his parishioners to see, the very men and women who have viewed him as a saintly man of God rather than the brigand he knows himself to be, he does not openly confess-his words and deeds do make plain the secret of his heart, but it is his lack of a thoroughly bold confession that causes some of his most devoted followers, so Hawthorne tells us, to blindly judge his final act as an illustrative parable on the danger of sin threatening each member of his congregation rather than an admission of guilt and self-condemnation."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Thought I was getting a book received book on tape. a little deceiving. Rather than that the process went as expected. If it had been what we wanted would have been great."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne shows his expertise in delving into the human emotion: probably the best at psychological analysis of his characters next to Shakespeare!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Upon finishing The Scarlet Letter, I would have to say that I was met with mixed emotions. While I enjoyed the storyline and reading about the characters, the length of the novel irked me a little, particularly because Hawthorne tend to overelaborate certain minor aspects of the story that are rather trivial and frivolous to the overall plot.I really enjoyed the content of the book as a whole. Hester's experience of being socially isolated due to her having a child, Pearl, with someone other than her husband evoked a kind of sympathy matched with curiosity in me. Early on in the novel, I felt disgusted at the townspeople for treating her this way, but soon discovered that Hester's wearing of her sin and the story behind it made for a rather interesting drama. Hawthorne definitely knows how to keep the reader interested, because this book contains everything we like to see in good literature: scandal, romance, an illegitimate child, irony, and the good old allusions.However, as good as this novel might seem to be, everyone should beware that this book is excessively long and at times extremely boring. While you argue that \\"boring\\" contradicts the previous paragraph, let me justify myself in saying that while the storyline itself is brilliant, Hawthorne's writing style of being overly descriptive and sentimental ticked me off a little. Something that is written in 50 pages can easily be cut to ten, since those 50 pages are mostly fluff and fillers anyway.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves good literature, and also has the patience and dicipline to stick to it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Hawthorne's \\"Fanshawe\\" was respectable and well done. But in his \\"The Scarlet Letter,\\" Hawthorne takes his writing to darker and more intense levels. The story starts with Hester Prynne being mocked and scoffed at in public for her crime of adultery. Her affair has resulted in an illegitimate daughter Pearl. And her penalty of death is reduced to wearing an A. Interestingly, if we read \\"Dante's Inferno,\\" we know that adultery is virtually the LEAST punished sin in hell. Apparently none of the authorities read this. (\\"Dante's Inferno\\" was written about 400 years before the events of \\"The Scarlet Letter,\\" so the authorities could have been familiar with it.) Moving on, Reverend Dimmesdale (Pearl's unknown father) can not bring himself to confess, but he does clearly tell Hester she can name him if she chooses. She declines. It is interesting that Hawthorne keeps Pearl somewhat disturbed. (At one point, she rips flowers, throws them at Hester's A, and dances every time she hits it. Another time she throws rocks at birds.) In comes Roger. (Step aside Othello. You've been outsmarted, outstyled, and outclassed.) Hester is of course frightened that her husband Roger has found out about her affair. But Roger makes it clear that physical vengeance is beneath him. Interestingly, Roger wants revenge for himself, but to some extent he blames himself for what happened. Naturally, Roger wants to find out who Pearl's father is, but Hester declines. Though Roger makes it clear that Pearl's father has wronged both Roger and Hester. (Can we really deny this?) Roger is by far the most intelligent and captivating character in the story. Rather than wanting revenge for himself, he seems to want revenge for both himself AND Hester. It doesn't take the sharp Roger long to suspect that the now growing ill Dimmesdale is the father of Pearl. ButRoger is no Othello. He studies the situation as carefully as possible. And when he is certain, this is when his revenge kicks in. Dimmesdale despite his crime is still a human being. His remorse is great, and even when he tries to hint at how bad he is, his anxiety only increases. Why? THE PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH LOVE HIM ALL THE MORE FOR IT! He becomes even more of a hero for it. (Why not? Fake heroes think they're above everyone. A true hero admits he has faults. Modesty actually becomes a hero more.) And, this is where Roger's revenge kicks in. Dimmesdale is growing more ill, and Roger (no simpleton like Othello) actually uses his medical skills to keep Dimmesdale alive. Roger is smart enough to know that keeping Dimmesdale alive is hurting him more than any physical revenge could have. One fault Hester has is that she doesn't warn Dimmesdale about Roger. To be sure, she promised Roger she wouldn't reveal him as her husband, but she could have (without breaking her promise) warned Dimmesdale to avoid the dangerous Roger. It is interesting that in this story, there are no real heroes. Hester is too much of a back stage player; Pearl is too disturbed; Dimmesdale helps Hester keep Pearl from the authorities who want to take her away, but at best he arguably triumphs in the midst of his fault; and even my favorite character Roger becomes too evil to be classified as the hero. It would seem even non physical revenge can leave one psychologically warped. Moving on, Hester and Dimmesdale feel that escaping to Europe is their only chance to escape Roger. But Roger (unlike Othello) is not so easily duped or defeated. The end explodes into a dark and frightening climax. Hawthorne cleverly avoids a happy cliche romance ending, but at the same time frees Dimmesdale from Roger's evergrowing hate and fury. Roger sounds almost demonic when he says: \\"Thou hast escaped me.\\" But Hawthorne reminds us that Roger was a human being. He interestingly leaves his wealth to Pearl. Overall, Hawthorne did a great job of showing his fierce edge in this book. We have rich complex characters who do NOT fall into typical patterns. He also reminds us that people are not all good or evil. They have some of each. Overall, Hawthorne's writing here is arguably very close to Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I read this book during a high school vacation. Although the long words and unconventional characters did not catch my fancy, the mystery involved in the story captivated me. As the story developed, I realized the profound intricacy of the plot. The conclusion of the story was not happy, nor did it even seem fair. As one who knows Hawthorne's puritan morality standards, however, I say that he communicated his message extremely well."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I have just finished reading \\"The Scarlet Letter\\"; before school ended, my english teacher gave most of her students a letter from our future AP English teacher, and it exhorted us to read two books for the summer: The Scarlet Letter and The Color of Water. I have not read \\"The Color of Water\\", but \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is a wonderful story that should not be missed. Yes, Hawthorne may use sentences that are a trifle too long, but that does not really detract any of the genious from the book. I have a feeling that I will be one of the very few people (possibly 4) that will actually read the book; because, even though it will be an AP class, most of the students are quite apathetic.The book should be read by anyone that can appreciate it; it will improve your vocabulary (as it did mine). Hawthorne contrived to write an archetype of a classic novel that will last for many more years to come."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Beyond brilliant, The Scarlet Letter is in another sphere entirely.This book is incredibly profound, deep, spiritual, eerie, and, in the end a soul-quickening experience. Hawthorne took the romantic, gothic themes popular in his day and transformed them into a new genre, the psychological novel. It may take a few readings, but eventually you will *GET IT* and when you do, you will feel a chill go down your spine. Hawthorne is delving into the psychology of evil, and the ring of truth is so strong it can be a moving experience. But as i said, it may take a number of readings before it hits you. It's kind of like those 3D drawings you must stare at until the picture resolves itself.Beside all this thematic content, Hawthorne is a master of the language, and his phrases are so delicious, I found myself repeating them just for the beauty of the expression. This book is to be read slowly, one sentence at a time. If you don't understand it, read it again. You will get it eventually.The plot itself is just beautifully realized. Many of the scenes are played out with real pathos and heartbreaking realism. Though, one can't discount the symbolism which abounds in this book.Someone has said that nothing really happens in the book. That is really not the case, but H does take numerous side trips into the minds of his characters. In this sense he prefigures the moderns like Joyce and Faulkner with their stream of consciousness technique. It is true that one often gets the feeling that time has been stopped, and we are in a moral realm that presses us on all sides until we feel claustrophobic and stifled. This is H's intent, to intimate the opressive moral imperatives, many societally coerced, that operate beneath the surface of our everyday business.While the book as a whole is a dreary, sad, almost mystical experience best read at night with a candle burning, the prologue is H at his most lighthearted. His descriptions of his fellow custom house employees are just delicious, and quite humourous. It makes a nice complement to the story. It is autobiographical up to the point where he finds the scarlet letter. That is a fictitious device he uses to introduce the novel. I believe the introduction (or prologue) was originally included to fatten up the book for publication. As it turns out, the prologue is one of H's best works, and should NOT be skipped! It can also be read on it's own.Finally, if you want more Hawthorne, try the short stories, *Young Goodman Brown* and *Ethan Brand*. They are deep meditations on sin written as allegories. Do not read if you are prone to paranoia or schizophrenia. ; )Hawthorne anticipated the psychology of the unconscious half a century before Freud, and his insistence on the connectedness between spirituality, psychology and physiology anticipates modern wholistic medicine. Plus, as I said, he is one of the greatest stylists who ever lived. You can not really understand America, unless you've read his works."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I was not assigned to read this in high school, which is fortunate because I probably would have hated it back then. I used to think that anything written before the 1950's was too old to be entertaining. But, happily this book proved otherwise. Hawthorne writes with a poetic rhythm that kept me so absorbed that I was stunned to see how quickly I finished. The story is surprisingly relevent even today because of its thoughtful distinction between moral values and human compassion.A few things, however, kept this book from being five-star worthy, the first being the introductory chapter entitled \\"The Custom House\\". As eloquent as Hawthorne is, his words alone could not energize this ploddingly dull prologue. And speaking of eloquence, one occasionally gets the feeling that Hawthorne tries to lend too grand an air to unworthy subjects by forcibly inserting wordy descriptions. I had dictionary.com up constantly in an effort to decipher certain passages. Suffice it to say, my vocabulary nearly doubled after completing the book. One final, but minor, criticism concerns his excessive use of the words 'ignominy' and 'tremulous'. I admit, I got a little tired of seeing those on every other page.These faults aside, the book is well worth a read, and I would recommend it to anyone, provided one reads it freely of his/her own will and not out of necessity."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a book to be read, but not certainly enjoyed. The plot, though interesting and unique, at times seems to drag on along with its characters and descriptions. Though it is a slow moving book, it is one that should be read for its insight on the past and how they compare to contemporary views.The story is about a woman name Hester Prynne who is living in a Puritan community in Boston during the seventeenth century. She has been forced to wear a scarlet letter A on her chest as a punishment for committing adultery and having an illegitimate child with an unknown man. Her and her daughter Pearl are forced to live as outsiders as Hester's husband, who is carrying a secret identity, is trying to unravel the truth of Pearl's father.Much time and concentration must be given to The Scarlet Letter in order to understand the text and meanings. When given attention, it will prove to be a good book. The plot is very thought provoking in how the life styles of the characters differ from people living today. Though it is a book that not many can relate to, it is an excellent portrayal of the past. Readers should be young adults to adults in order to grasp the sometimes difficult writing. However, it is a book that all should read at one time or another."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I found it hard to stay awake while reading the first 22 chapters of The Scarlet Letter. I thought that Hawthorne overexplained unimportant details. I really enjoyed the last 2 chapters, however, because it seemed more focused and there was some suspense. The novel is set in Puritan New England. Salem,Massechusetts to be exact. The main character is Hester Prynne, an adulteress who is forced to wear a pin, in the shape of the letter \\"A\\",made from scarlet colored fabric, hence the title. Her adultery results in the birth of her daughter Pearl. The man responsible for this is none other than the town preacher, although he keeps this secret hidden from his congregation. A complication in the plot is the arrival of Hester's husband from Germany. He is thought to be dead, and uses this to his advantage by disguising himself as Roger Chilligworth and becomes a physician in Salem. He vows to find out who Hester's lover was. The Scarlet Letter relates to Nathaniel Hawthorne's personal life, because of the setting. He spent a majority of his life in Salem, and claimed that the story originated from his discovery of a box containing the actual scarlet letter and a record of Hester Prynne while working in Salem's Custom House. Whether his story is true or not, it made me think of the novel as a real story, so I connected more with it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Now I've read the other reviews about people who were bored by this book because they had to read it for AP English, and that is in fact why I had to read this book, but rather than take a modern view at an older book and talk about how &quot;stupid it is to be embarassed by wearing a letter on your clothes&quot;, its better to not put books like this in a modern context. In that time villages were small, people very judgemental, and horribly cruel. And the fact that she had no friends or even a person to talk to and only a child to keep her company is truly sad. Now I got into AP English dreading the &quot;Summer Assignment&quot; and especially dreading have to read 2 BOOKS!!, but this book was truly great and I enjoyed it far more than expected. While it really is a tough a read, I would still recommend. I used the Cliff Notes to assist me in reading the book , and I found it to be excellent. The ending of the book was truly classic. If you've never read this book, you should!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"WHen I finally started reading this classic, I was simply astounded by the alien beauty of the language: the prose style is as dense as the best of Nabokov, with characterisations of people and nuances of emotion that are far-reaching and subtle. Even better, the psychology of the characters is so finely drawn that it begs to be read again from cover to cover. Things are never neatly and unrealistically resolved, but continually appear in their full ambiguity, so much like real life. While not exactly a historical novel that depicts a period with total accuracy, it is one of the first great psychology novels ever written, and indeed is in a league with Stendhal in that respect. As this has been extrensively reviewed, I will leave plot descriptions to others.This is a classic that truly lives up to its reputation. Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Like so many reviewers before me, I first read this book in high school. And, like so many readers before, I was sorely disappointed. How could this book have amassed such a legendary status in the canon of American literature?? The pacing is dreadfully, consistently slow, the characters are unengaging, the description is tedious, etc. For those of you out there who would defend these tactics, let me say one thing: while a good author would know how to use these literary techniques (as Hawthorne obviously does), a GREAT author would know how to use these techniques in MODERATION. What Hawthorne spends page after mindless page describing in agonizing detail, could have been summarized in just a paragraph or two of direct, memorable, grabbing prose.For those who still believe that this book is just too sophisticated for all of those dumb high schoolers, let me offer another example. In addition to The Scarlett Letter, my high school English classes also required us to read some other classic works of the English language, and none of these other classics brought about nearly as negative a response as the reponse brought about by this book. I remember that my classmates and I were by and large much more interested in the tragic story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Heart of Darkness, Great Expectations, The Lord of the Flies, The Grapes of Wrath and The Great Gatsby were much better reads than The Scalet Letter ever was. Were these lesser books, because they were more accessible and often faster paced than The Scarlet Letter? I think not.As for all those people out there who profess a deep love of the book: although I'm sure that some of you actually did thoroughly enjoy this book, I fear that there are those of you who subscribe to the notion that just because something is labeled a literary classic, it must be good, and if it seems boring or longwinded, that's only the &quot;genius&quot; of it. Please don't blindly fall into this trap. Judge the book for yourself and forget about whether or not you &quot;should&quot; like the book. There's a reason that this book is despised moreso than any of the other books I've previously mentioned..."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This is a book of many challenges. At times I caught myself going back and reading the same chapters over and over till the point that I kept falling asleep. Eventhough it is compelling and written in beautifully explict details, after awhile it presumebly became boring. Its wonderful imagery could not hold up to the expectations of what I call a well written book. The only character I felt for was Dimmesdale; the rest I had no feelings for. If you love a romance with hardly any action, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"As glad as I am to see in the reviews below that many high-school students have at least enough interest in reading to write a review, I am disheartened that so many of these high-schoolers have such difficulty in understanding the novel. As is usually the case, those who rated the book at one star don't have a clue as to what the story is even about; some haven't even finished the book! Nevertheless, there seems to be an alarming trend (to me, at least) toward reading Cliff notes as a substitute to actually reading the novel itself. I fail to see how anyone could even hope to understand the intricacies and subtlety that Hawthorne has woven into his greatest work through some watered-down retelling. (I don't particularly care for Cliff notes, but never mind that.) Being myself a high-school student, I feel that I must always try to represent the greater masses as something more than commonly believed, yet comments I have read lead me to wonder if the stereotypes are not more real than I have hoped. What I see when I look at the population is a group unable to understand and unwilling to try.To those who have lambasted &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; as being boring, slow, etc., all I can ask is that you not review books that you do not understand. Without understanding, certainly, no work can seem worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I read this book for my 11th grade Lit class and I must admit the book was quite a shock. Many of the books I have read have been nothing more than an attempt at delving into the inner parts of the human soul. This book does much more than that. It depicts the struggle of a man with himself and an outside enemy. He commits one of the most unspeakable acts of the time and punishes himself constantly. He lacks the courage to confess his crime and goes through a period of mental and physical torture. He also faces the wrath a cruel and vicious enemy who lives for nothing more than to torture his victim. All in all I believe it was an excellent book and I would reccomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I am a junior in high school, and I just finished reading this book. Yes, the language and characters were stiff and formal, but at the time that this book was written, that was the convention. It is an excellent portrayal of the far reaching consequences of selfish sin, and the inner struggle that comes as a result of this sin. True, the characters had no depth, but this book was full of symbols and the characters are also symbols, representing different sins and evils, and the ways of dealing with said sins. The language does tend to bog down a reader, but remember that this was before authors began to write in the vernacular (Mark Twain, I believe, was the first) so the dialogue ends up sounding stilted and formal, especially from the children (Pearl, and the mudslinging ones). I personally did not like this book, but that does not mean that it was not an excellent work of literature. This type of book simply does not appeal to me, I prefer writers equally as thought-provoking but who write with more colorful prose, such as Dickens, or Salman Rushdie. The fact that I didn't like this book does not keep me from seeing the merit of it. It's an excellent book, though not quite a classic of the caliber of Macbeth or Great Expectations."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I was given The Scarlet Letter to read in my 11th grade English class and, as opposed to some books we've read, I was actually pleased. This novel is interesting and is a true look into the human soul. Hawthorne is not a humorous writer but he is a true to life one. He tells it like it is, including not only the strengths but the weaknesses of the human soul. Anyone who finds this book boring must be entirely niave or else the book was over their head. To those people I would suggest reading it again and this time actually TRYING to understand it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This is book is one of the greatest book I've ever read.

So what! if he spent 20 pages on explaining about a D--- arm chair! The person who complains about something like that, obviously dosen't see the reasoning behind such a writing...and therefore lacks the necessary attitude to learn of such things. With that said... The character of Roger Chillingworth, (I thought), was one of great intrigue. His thought processes, and actions,(Even though they were morbid and evil) are all done with reason and intent. Unlike our dear Hester Prynne, who seems to run on emotion, like an old car runs on sulfer. As for the Rev. Aurthur Dimmesdale I believe him to be a self-centered hypocrite who finaly, does some actual good upon the end of the book. The story itself, is one of good writing and attention to detail.

I also found out that Hester's husband was an evil man. This is a good book for anyone to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Scarlet Letter was rather dry and not very intresting at the beginning, but overall, the book was pretty bearable, if not interesting at times. Hester's daughter, for example, was quite intriguing with her &quot;witchy- sinful?&quot; characteristics and I felt really sorry for Hester. The ending was kinda predictable, but still, if you want to read it, check it out from the library."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This product requires a stereo player in which the balance is turned totally to the left.

I wish he'd just get to the point and stop blabbering on and on. The plot of the book seems like a modern melodramatic soap opera. All of the characters are one-dimensional.

Overall, a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I was truly amazed upon completion of the Scarlet Letter. In no way was I mesmerized by Hawthorne's brilliant imagery, or even his sublime command of the english language in which the general book reading community seems to revel. On the contrary, I was mystified at how one seeming normal man was able to select the exact combination of phonemes necessary to initiate a neurological cascade leading to an undebiably unconscious state. It was unbelievable really. I would literally pick up this book at noon, and be quite asleep and 12:15. Forget valium folks, this is cheaper and more effective. The &quot;A&quot; on Hester's chest should have stood for awful. Or better yet, anteater. No relation to any themes really, I just think that it's a funny little mammal. At least if this were the case, Hester's plight would have been slightly amusing. As it was, however, the only treacle to the unending dolor was the last page.

Most people in today's society don't get pointed out for commiting adultery. It's like an everyday thing now. People just don't do that anymore. I do think that is was great to see how the people back then viewed certain quailties and how they carried out their religious beliefs. To me, this was a story about a woman named Hester Prynne who was caught up in a bad love triangle. She was married to a scholar who had sent her ahead to Boston. She got caught up and fell in love with the minster Dimmesdale. She got pregnant and had a daughter who she named Pearl because she was the most precious and expensive thing in her life. All of her earnings went towards her. They made Hester and baby Pearl sit out on a scaffold allday to let the people come by and look at them and ridicule them. Hester had to wear a scarlet A on her bosom from hence forth. She made the most of it, though. Pearl had an intuition and she could recognize how was good and who was bad. She knew the Chillingworth, Hester's husband, was a bad man. She felt a connection with Dimmesdale. One day when Pearl was about seven years old, she asked her mother what did the scarlet letter mean and why did Dimmesdale always cover up his heart. Hester had still not revealed who the father of her child was because she loved him that much. As far as I have read the guilt is eating Dimmesdale up and he wants to tell the people but he doesn't know how.

I'm torn between saying it was the worst 3 weeks of my life or the most wasted 3 weeks of my life.The writing was drier than the 18th amendment, flowerier than a gay bar, and more boring than watching paint dry. Reading it was like reading the dictionary, but with a horrible plot and descriptions that are horribly specific.Additionally, I got the version WITHOUT the random house opening, and I STILL hated this book. If this is the peak of Hawthorne's literary 'genius', I don't want to read anything else he's written.The story itself has 24 chapters. About 20 of these are pointless and are just there for Hawthorne to flaunt his ridiculous writing style. In the end, the only things about the book that are even partway of a mystery are 1) Who adulterated with Hester Prynne, and 2) why Hawthorne even wrote this book in the first place.This book is the worst waste of ink and dead trees I've ever seen. If you're a person who heavily supports the eco-stuff, don't protest fossil-fuels, protest the use of trees to make this horrible monstrosity of human imagination put into words. I can't even imagine how Hawthorne lived with himself after writing this.During the weeks I read this, I experienced the only mood-swings I've EVER had. There's both a correlation AND a causation going on here. This is the literary equivalent of \\"Crazy Frog\\"; it sounds like crap, and only insane people like it. This is not a book you read for fun. If you have read every book on your shelf/Kindle, don't even get this book for FREE. Buy something comical by an author who is underrated (I personally recommend 'John and the King' by Liam McMahon) and don't waste precious memory on this horror. This is the kind of book you read when a scary man with a big axe stands over you and says \\"If you don't read something within ten seconds, it's curtains for you,\\" and even then you look for something different.In the end, the only redeemable fact about this book is, if you order it paperback, then you're going to have a LOT of fun destroying it.BTW: here's the book I recommendJohn and the King (The Incredible Adventures of John)"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book was in excellent condition for the price.

I never really did believe in the whole 'they completely ostracized her but let her stitch everything.' That is just a bit hypocritical, either she was excepted as prat of the society *which she was not) or she wasn't (which she almost was. See that just doesn't make any sense.

It tells the story of a young woman, Hester, who gives birth to a child, Pearl, that is the daughter of the preacher, Arthur Dimmsdale. Hester's cold and calculating husband, Roger Chillingsworth, concocts ways of discovering the truth about Arthur and Hester's relationship, which taxes the young preacher's health greatly and ultimately leads to his demise. This classic of literature examines love, relationships, perceptions, and human actions. It proves that Hawthorne was a keen observer of human nature and was able to use his observations to write a legendary novel that is certain to retain its outstanding status far into the future."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This version (Modern Library) gets two stars because it is very well annotated. The book itself only deserves one star.Having now made it just more than halfway through this book, I have a theory as to why \\"no one reads the classics\\" anymore. It is probably because they were subjected to this turgid, boring book in high school, and came to the erroneous conclusion that all old books are this slow, long-winded, and tedious. How sad. Because of all the classics I have read (several hundred now), this is by far the slowest, windiest, and most tedious of them all.One of the first rules of writing is \\"show, don't tell.\\" This rule has applied as far back as the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Book of Genesis. Well, Hawthorne is of the \\"tell until you are about to lose your reader--then show you a bit to string you along\\" school. He is wordy beyond description. His paragraphs are constructed of endless run-on sentences that have more side trips than a sorority girl's recounting of her weekend in Fort Lauderdale. In the first 43-page chapter, only three paragraphs have anything to do with the story (I'm not kidding).Once we get into the story, the pace picks up--but only slightly. We are presented with a series of long and endlessly wordy \\"sketches\\" that DESCRIBE the characters, their environment, and how they feel, and that bludgeon you with overt symbolism. We are TOLD all about the characters' internal and external conflicts, but we are SHOWN none of it. Again and again, I find myself thinking, \\"This boring description could have been made into a really great scene.\\" Instead, I find my mind numbly wandering as I wade through deep rivers of slow moving prose.Just when I am about to give up all hope of action or plot and throw the book down in disgust, Hawthorne injects a brief snippet of dialog that (barely) keeps me interested. But sadly, he uses these moments to make his characters melodramatic and cartoonish.Some examples:The evil physician is twisted, misshapen, and deformed; his face is dark, and a fire burns in his eyes. He speaks friendly words with sinister, hidden motives. (I'm surprised he doesn't twirl his mustache, too).Or, the tortured preacher is wasting away under his own inner conflict over some sin he has committed. He is weakening and clutches at a pain in his breast. (Gee, which sin could it be? Care to guess? Hawthorne pretty well telegraphs it so you won't be surprised when it's unveiled).Or, Hester feels a searing heat beneath her scarlet letter, and her daughter shows impish, devilish behavior-the living embodiment of Hester's sin.Okay, okay -- we get the point.In short, this book sucks.If you want to read a great American novel that is loaded with symbolism, read Moby Dick. While it, at times, is also challenging, slow, and meandering; it is also deep, layered, complex, and structurally interesting, and it actually delivers the money shot at the end. Oh, Lord, how it delivers. With this turkey, the journey is so painfully slow and uneventful I'll never find out if it delivers. I just don't care enough to finish. I guess I'll have to watch the movie...If this is your first classic and you are getting discouraged, don't. Quit reading it and try another one. There are hundreds of great books out there. This isn't one of them."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I read this book on my first year of college, as a student of English Language and Literature in the Universidade Cl&aacute;ssica de Lisboa (Lisbon, Portugal). To better understand the writer I also did a &quot;little&quot; research on him. That investigation gave me enough evidences to conclude that (as you can see in the SL) Hawthorne is better at creating ambiencies that at creating a solid, appealing plot, and more successful conceiving brief sketches of people and caricatures than at developing complete three-dimensional characters (since in the SL, the subconsious is well explicit to the reader, nothing being left to the reader to imagine). And why is this? Because even though Hawthorne is more commonly known as a novelist (due to his latter work, after the success of the SL), most of his legacy is composed of numerous short stories, and if you have the opportunity to read them, you will agree they are truly bewitching pieces of literature. But the fact is the literary &quot;establishment&quot; as always deemed short stories (as well as detective fiction)as lesser forms of literature. Hence, the focus given to this work of his, which may not be his better (but which evokes that &quot;ahead of its time&quot; aura some people seem to valorize so much in a book). So if you want to read Hawthorne at his best try his short stories (like &quot;The hands&quot;). But if you &quot;have&quot; to read this book, try to ignore its chronical lack of pace and the unevenness of the plot, whilst enjoing the little portraits of puritan life and those magical descriptive paragraphs where Hawthorne's imagination really soars high."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"After reading this classic it makes you wonder what skeletons are worth bringing out of the closet in order to clear space. The hypocritical situation that occurs in this book would never happen in the present time would it? Oh wait it does. Any political or highly esteemed official, athlete, or movie star can do what they want today just as easy as they could back then. If not even more so. They feel themselves invincible and untouchable by the consequences of inappropriate decisions. However, just like the priest, those individuals that try to fool us that they are who they are not will awake one morning to have all their sins broadcast to the world."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter, for me was just a little boring. Sometimes the description was just too long and I just started to lose interest in it. Also sometimes it got confusing as to what the relationships the characters had to each other.

Although it was a very interesting and provkitive novel. I did not like it very much. I think it maybe that I'm still too young to throughly understand this piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne, in writing The Scarlet Letter, took that which was considered so very taboo in the society and placed it in the household. He took a simple woman trying to escape her past, and a lonely man, who was also a preacher, and made them the models for the \\"it could happen to anyone\\" story.Many may say that Hawthorne's writing is full of glitches, is slow, and perhaps too ornate and verbose at times - but I disagree. In my opinion, he was an author who employed almost every literary technique, and used it well. The first chapter is probably the most difficult to get through, since it seems so detached from the rest of the book, but for those who are looking closely, it is full of foreshadowing elements and in reproducing the structure of the society in which the story is about to take place - Hawthorne is forewarning us of the limitations of said society, of how these rituals will come to be bane of Hester Prynne's existence, as the story unfolds.The story begins with Hester's public shaming,and her being made to wear a 'Scarlet letter' upon her bosom as a sign of her adulterous ways. Amongst the crowd, watching, is her husband Dr. Prynne, who now goes by the name of Roger Chillingworth. The plot is simple, Hester Prynne comes to live in a village near Boston, and there, she finds herself inexplicably for the town preacher. The town preacher, Reverend Dimmesdale, also falls in love with Hester. The husband, who was to follow Hester, a cruel and conniving man, is captured and considered dead which further fuels the level of intimacy between the Reverend and Hester. The result is an illegitimate child - although, Hester continually refuses to name the father of the child, for fear of the persecution that will result from this confession of her lover, the Reverend. While Hester remains ostracized from the society, her daughter and her both treated like the Plague, the Reverend wastes away with the guilt that he allowed Hester to take the entirety of the blame. He pines away for his love, and for his child, and becomes weak and disturbed. This only serves to add to the suspicions of Dr.Chillingworth, who is seeking to exact revenge on the man who had left his wife astray, and when he confirms his suspicions serves to fuel the Reverends self-hatred. The relationship between Hester and Dimmesdale is ever tender, but the relationship between Dimmesdale and his daughter Pearl is, although seemingly calm, tense and tortuous.Hawthorne paints his characters with such intensity, Hester's love and her patience, Pearl's innocence, Dimmesdale's self-loathing and guilt, and Chillingworth's jealousy and anger - and above all, the townsfolk's constant judgments. The novel is a classic, written in the way of a classic, full of eloquent prose, rich commentary and extremely descriptive. It is a slow and meticulous read, but also a very satisfying one. If you can get past the slow pace, and the alliterations and allegory, you will find yourself reading of a beautiful tale about love, passion, guilt, redemption...and above all, faith."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book is a masterpiece of not only American literature, but of world literature. Reading this book was the experience that showed me what good literature is. This is easily in my top three along with Fahrenheit 451 and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"As an English teacher, I always look forward to the point in the school year when my students ask me to name my favorite book. Every year, I see their puzzled expressions when I choose The Scarlet Letter. Perhaps Hawthorne's masterpiece is out of place in our fast-paced world, our ridiculously simplistic culture where a book has no value unless Will Smith can play the hero in the movie version. If these criticisms of the novel are true, the fault lies with us, not with Hawthorne.The Scarlet Letter is a story of complexities - the complexity of love, the complexity of sin, and the struggle to find who you are in a society that demands conformity. How could anyone not identify with Hester, a woman whose only crime is in not covering up her mistakes as well as everyone around her does? How could anyone not sympathize with Dimmesdale, a man trapped between who he is in private and the mask he wears when he steps outside his door?That anyone can criticize the book as too wordy is beyond me. Saying The Scarlet Letter is terrible because there isn't enough action is like sayingTransformersis a better movie thanCasablanca. The details in the novel are there for a reason. Hawthorne is creating a world, a Garden of Eden, where the choices facing his characters are not as simple as the one facing Eve, though the effects are just as devastating.As a reader, if all you look for in a novel is \\"who did what,\\" then try the latest slop on the bestseller list. The characters will all fall into neat categories, there will be some painfully obvious moral, and best of all, you won't have to think. But if you want to read a story that forces you to define who you are and what you believe, try classics like The Scarlet Letter. Trust me, you'll find these books a more rewarding experience."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I believe that this is a fantastic book for those who have more distinguished tastes. As for others, it is a slow read with challenging vocabulary."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I have a vague recollection of being forced to read this in High School many years ago. I just finished re-reading the Scarlet Letter. In my opinion, the Scarlet Letter would be out of reach for many teenagers - like it was for me. Now I'm older and wiser and have been reading classic literature in my bookclub for 15+ years. I have a greater respect for the SL and the new ground it was breaking in literature and I can appreciate the impact it had on future writers. In fact, the reason I picked up SL again was that I had learned that 'Moby Dick' - by Herman Melville - was was dedicated to Hawthorne. So that peaked my interest as I think MB is likely the best American novel ever written.I think adultry is still a big issue. Anything that's on the list of 10 commandments has pretty well served the test of time. Adultry is probably one of the commandments that many people have somekind of firsthand experience. So even though the story and characters seem archiac at times, many readers of SL can (or will) be able to identify with the guilt and angst at some time in their lives.So what about the guilt and angst? The parts of the story most interesting to me were the one's having to do with nature and the woods surrounding the small colonial village. The villagers were surrounded by nature along with the fear of the unknown. The Puritan settlers had brought with them their beliefs and systems into a new world that 'shielded' them to an unnecessary extent to nature and the laws of nature. It seemed like the Puritans carried a very heavy moral burden that most were nor equipped to handle. Hester turned to nature to get direction as the village had shunned her and left her with no options. One of best line's (I'm paraphrasing) is \\"Let God be the judge, people need to learn to forgive each other and get along.\\" Hawthorne was in fact saying to the readers that these old 17th century Puritan beliefs were largely irrelevant by the late 1800's.So toward the end of the SL I found a connection that I was seeking between Scarlet Letter and Moby Dick - namely the scenes with the sailors and ship merchants - how they were not morally bound to the land - as were the settlers - and enjoyed a freer existence - and it was accepted by most people. I think this became a point of departure for Melville and his many books on ocean adventures.If you didn't like SL today, don't give up in literature as some of this stuff only gets better with time."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Anyone who suffered through this book in high school, but has since developed a more mature intellectual curiosity and is willing to put in a little effort, will here find one of the most incredible rereading experiences the English language has to offer.A government official, his imaginative faculties deadened by years of dreary work in a Salem custom-house, shuts out the modern world and travels back in time two hundred years, using an old piece of emboidered fabric as a portal. Behold: a different world, the Puritan world, a dusky twilight zone between the Celestial City and the fires of Hell, where witches ride with Satan through the night air and the sky is a heavenly scroll with which God sends his chosen people messages via shooting stars. Here we become privy to a grim secret drama, a matter of life and death between three characters: Hester Prynne, beautiful, impulsive, conscious of her guilt and her mistakes, dutiful to her daughter and to the community who condemns her, and an expansive visionary amid the most closed-minded of people; Arthur Dimmesdale, the falsest person in the community, yet a devout religionist and believer in truth, who punishes himself with brutal acts of self-abasement; and Roger Chillingworth, the quiet man of learning whose devotion to scholarship does not prevent him from turning into a vengeful fiend.The Scarlet Letter is amazingly germane to our world: sexual transgression, single parenting, rebellious children, abusive authority, the importance of community and family, the clash of cultures, gender issues, etc. Yet it is as sometimes as weird as anything David Lynch or Thomas Pynchon could come up with: reality and fantasy, mirrors and hallucinations, sadism, masochism, witchcraft, dementia, UFOs, weird mystical symbols, nocturnal vigils, silent Indians, drunken sailors, ridiculous parades. A thoughtful reader will laugh hysterically at the dancing ape mentioned in Chapter 21. The narration is wordy but stylistically appropriate for Hawthorne's purposes; it finds a perfect balance between tongue-in-cheek irony and the seriousness of life-and-death issues. The book's reputation as grave and ponderous is the result of our inability--or more accurately, our unwillingness to take the time--to detect Hawthorne's subtly ironic tone toward his well-intentioned but sadly misled ancestors. His sentences are also longer than our diminished attention can sometimes handle, which is our flaw, not his.It is true that this story \\"tells\\" rather than \\"shows,\\" violating the \\"show, don't tell\\" rule of creative writing. Our interior worlds don't follow linear plots, and a writer like Hawthorne doesn't have to abide by such formulaic rules. This is a book for the ages, magic via the written word. Read it again, and slowly this time. Preferably by moonlight."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's prose in \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is slightly complex at first but his description of Boston and of the people during the Puritan era is vivid and strong. I disagree with an earlier reviewer that the book was boring. The description of the characters and of the situations they were undergoing was helpful. It made the story much stronger. The last three or four chapters were surprisingly suspenseful. It is a fantastic read.Moreover, \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is a classic example of why social oppression is such a terrible thing. Thanks to the oppression of those times a child grew up without her father and a man died without ever having a real relationship with his daughter. One can't help but to think about the type of oppression (ie. sexual) that goes on today. This novel is a stark reminder of why oppression of any kind is really not worth it. When oppression exists in society, good people are always bound to suffer and all because of rigid, inhumane, socially conservative beliefs. Within its own context (Puritan era), the novel delves into this topic in a very powerful way. I highly recommend it because its subject matter still applies today."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Since the 1970s I have probably read this book at least three times. It is a powerful book about sin and redemption, guilt and pardon, and revenged and forgiveness. I will let other reviewers deal with the great literary themes presented within this novel, but for this review, I want to look at Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale, Hester's lover and the father of Pearl.As an evangelical pastor, the character of Dimmesdale has always intrigued me. I can understand how godly men fail. I can understand how godly men can fall into sexual sin. Just because a man is called of God does not mean that he cannot fall for temptation, especially sexual temptation, became sexual temptation is common to all men. A quick survey of biblical heros makes this point clear. For instance, David, who is described as a man after God's own heart, certainly did not behave himself sexually. Aside from his adulterous affair with Bathsheba and the murder of her husband, David also, in addition to taking many wives, took to himself concubines for his sexual pleasure. One can argue all he wants about the cultural acceptability of such practices, but the fact remains that most Hebrew contemporaries of David did not take concubines, and although the Law of Moses does not directly address the concubine issue, the plan of God clearly states that God desires one man married to one woman for one life time.Back to Rev. Dimmesdale. Ok, the guy made a mistake. Two lonely young people fell in love and in the passion of the movement conceived a child. Sin happens. Even the godliest man can fail. The problem is not that he failed, but that Dimmesdale proved to be such a wimp about his failing. He allowed Hester (who was a better man than Dimmesdale) to bear the shame alone while neglecting his responsibility to his daughter Peal. Lets face it; this guy was a wimp, not a man. Why did he not accept responsibility for his actions and take care of Hester and Pearl? Instead, he sets on a course of self-destructive behavior that, in the end, leads to his death and abandonment of any responsibility to those whom he loved.Dimmesdale, get a life. Be a man. Quit whining and accept responsibility for your behavior- that is what a truly godly man does. Hester was a better man than Arthur any day."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"After reading &quot;The Scarlet Letter,&quot; I really wondered how such a strong woman was able to go through this kind of hardship and still be strong in her heart. Nathaniel Hawthorne is one of the best authors in all of literature, but he can really be one of the hardest authors to read. Once you pick up &quot;Scarlet Letter,&quot; do not turn away from his ample vocabulary. He is a really good writer and he knows what the reader wants to read about. Especially when he takes a woman and makes her the strongest of all the characters. I love his use of symbols throughout the novel, especially Pearl. She is one of the most captivating characters to read about. It is thought-provoking to sit and read about Puritan times and how things took place. I recommend this to anyone who not only has the time to read it, but also to those who enjoy a good story of what true love is all about."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Another one of those texts that we hated in high school, one that was almost literally shoved down our throats. Then, it was a dry, dull tale of a Puritan woman who had a penchant for a minister's black veil.Now, though, a few years later, it is clear that Hawthorne's seminal novel is more than just a tragic love story. It is yet another \\"defining\\" piece of literature, this time centering on Puritanism and its eventual decline, a decline clearly evidenced when the women first see Hester leave her jail cell, Pearl clutched close to her chest. The older women condemn her, but the youngest of them seems indifferent, an air of what could be understanding about her.Hawthorne's use of metaphor, symoblism, and the intriguing characterization of Hester, Chillingworth, and Dimmesdale as well as Pearl--who herself is a symbol of change and hope--serve to turn the mundane plot and two-hundred years of dust into an excellent work of art.We know who Pearl's father is, and the ultimate moment in the novel is not when Dimmesdale exposes his breast and reveals his own scarlet letter; it instead occurs during the juxtaposition of night and day, of Dimmesdale's refusal to admit his guilt, of Chillingworth's insidious insertion into Dimmesdale's trust.\\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is not the best novel in existence, but it is worth the price of admission, and its overtones have an impact even today, addressing many social issues and resolving them in ways that echo biases and solutions of today."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I chose to read this book because of its status as a classic in American literature. I chose to continue it because I looked with sympathy, horror, and amazement at the protagonist, the priest, the physician, and the illegitimate child. There were moments when I was downright afraid of the child, Pearl, and convinved she must be demonic. I regarded Roger Chillingworth, the antagonist, as a generally benign, justice-seeking man. The protagonist, in light of her background, appeared to have little to defend herself with.But as the book progressed, it became apparent that Hawthorne had painted the portraits of characters more human than many of the people I know! Did Hestor Prynne utter words of (gasp!) sexual liberation? Or was that just my hindsight vision? Could Mr. Dimmesdale really be such a coward? Or was he truly a benevolent, if imperfect, man?In truth, regardless of what anyone else sees in The Scarlet Letter, I found a compelling story that encoruaged me to revaluate certain beliefs, and to enshrine others. No wonder it's a classic!I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This story is a moving representation of the dissonance that can be found between the human soul and society. Hester Prynne's suffering is painful because the reader understands that though she feels the sin of her actions, it is society that has condemned her. She must forfeit her freedom to walk as an equal citizen of Boston, never allowed to forget the silent agony haunting her every moment.It is not only Hester who is affected by social expectations and custom; it is eventually revealed to the reader that Hester's crime affects those who surround her, which tells us how much of an impact a individual's actions can have on another.Hawthorne's novel displays this fallen, detached member of Puritan society, but counters it with the revolutionist, the demon, the wild rose of Puritan lifestyle--perhaps hinting at the author's dislike for Puritan attitudes. Hawthorne reiterates these two devices: depicting his personal opinion through the actions of the characters and creating characters that refract each other.This is an amazing part of American literature, reflecting on human behavior and commenting on aspects of American history. How do people today act and react to each other, dominated by our culture's expectations? How are we self-serving or self-deprecating? A tip to readers: &quot;The Custom House&quot; (the book's preface) is dense stuff, quite possible of cultivating a strong dislike for Hawthorne as a writer, so I recommend saving it for last or skipping it completely.&quot;It is remarkable that persons who speculate the most boldly often conform with the most perfect quietude to the external regulations of society. The thought suffices them without investing itself in the flesh and blood of action.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I never liked The Scarlet Letter, although I have read it many times. I never liked &quot;The Custom House.&quot; The chapter never ends! It just goes on and on. I fell asleep many times while Hawthorne described his job duties.The thing that sticks in my mind after all these readings and re-readings is the fact that Hawthorne finds the manuscript wrapped up on a shelf. Hawthorne finds &quot;The Scarlet Letter.&quot;Other authors have found the manuscripts of the book they have their name on. The author of the Arabian Nights finds the manuscript of the &quot;Arabian Nights.&quot;The blind Argentine poet Jorge Borges finds many manuscripts hidden in the library which he writes about.There must be other books where the author claims he found the manuscript on a dusty shelf.Frankly, I like the &quot;Arabian Night.&quot; I like Borges.I just wish that Hawthorne had left the manuscript of &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; on the shelf where he found it. I know how you feel if you are reading it for the first time. It doesn't taste any better as you get older."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I can't remember being so conflicted about a novel in a long time. On one hand, I admire the brilliant analysis of Puritanical guilt that pervades the lives of Hester Prynne and the Reverend Dimmesdale. On the other, Hawthorne's writing often left me more irritated than I have been in a long time. \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" seems to me both a masterpiece and a crude dime novel at the same time.I don't question that Hawthorne's exposure of the moral dilemnas and guilt man faces is indeed well done. Every page is filled with the agony of the main characters. At the novel's best, \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is spellbinding, simultaneously repulsing the reader and luring him/her onward.However, the novel suffers from several problems, not least the clumsiness of Hawthorne's prose. His sentences are needlessly complicated and repetitive. Unlike a Henry James, for instance, whose sentences are densely constructed, Hawthorne could have easily sliced the length down with no loss of meaning. The writing here is weak.Even more irritating is the lack of subtlety in the novel's symbolism. The symbols Hawthorne creates could be fascinating. However, when they're spelled out in blatant, crude detail, they lose their power. Hawthorne fails to show us his symbolic meaning, instead settling on telling us instead.So ... the novel is a worthwhile read, but it's a far cry short of what it could have been."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"well a classic is a classic. a classic is a classic.

Hester Prynne, who is believed to be a widow (it's thought her husband died at sea on his way to Boston), gives birth to a little girl she names Pearl. Hester is convicted of adultery, and her punishment is to wear a scarlet letter \\"A\\" on her chest for the rest of her life. Since Hester refuses to name the father of the child, and he doesn't come forward on his own, he goes unpunished, while Hester and Pearl become outcast in the town. Roger Chillingworth is a doctor who is a newcomer to the town. He is actually Hester's husband, but no one knows that other than Hester. Chillingworth swears he will find out who Pearl's father is and get revenge. Meanwhile, the Reverend Dimmesdale, who is Pearl's father, is consumed with guilt about his sin and about the fact that he allowed Hester (and Pearl) to take all the punishment for it.I first read this book 20 years ago in high school and recently re-read it. I enjoyed it much more this time around. This is a very difficult book for a young adult to read. The pace is very slow, the vocabulary words are rather advanced, and the author is very wordy--he takes half a page to say something that could be said in one sentence. Those reasons are why I only gave the book 4 stars, instead of 5 :) Still, it's important to remember that the book was written over 150 years ago.Even with all those 'problems' the story itself is wonderful. It's a story of sin and the price that people pay for them, as well as the price that others are forced to pay for those sins. It's a story of guilt and the effect it has on you. It involves difficult decisions--do you admit your guilt and accept the punishment or do you hide it in an effort to still be in a position to do some good in the community? And do you forgive someone who hid his guilt while you accepted complete punishment?It is a book that makes the reader think about some very hard issues. And that's always a good thing."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Hawthorne wrote a masterful work of historical fiction incorporating an examination of guilt, revenge and suffering in the context of Puritan Salem.

Amongst the restless villagers hides her partner in crime, secretly concealed under the blanket of his most respected profession.

But with all the pressure and Hester's former husband evilly breathing behind his back, will the guilt of his shameful crime be more than he can manage to live through? Penetrate into Nathaniel Hawthorne's world of The Scarlet Letter...Anyone who has the ability to read should look into this famous novel of sin, evil, knowledge, and the human condition. It clearly dominates in the literary world for its indescribable symbolism, depth, and diversity of characters. The Scarlet Letter has certainly earned its well-deserved place into the world of classic novels.~ Jasna"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"For those who enjoy audio books, and there are many of us (especially working mothers who are always on the go- taking our children to school, or a playdate, or commuting to our yoga or aerobics classes), this is an impressive buy. The Scarlet Letter, written by Nathaniel Hawthorne, whose books explore the themes of guilt, is a striking romantic tragedy set in Puritan New England. The characters are well developed, each tinged with deep human emotion and conflict. The societal beliefs and superstitions of the people at the time provide Gothic elements. Again, one can make the argument that this is not only classic American literature, but Gothic romance.The Scarlet Letter revolves around Hester Prynne, a beautiful young early colonial woman who has recently ben married. Her husband has not yet arrived to the states from England (for some reason or other) and there is even rumors that he is dead. She loves the pastor of the community, Dimmesdale. Dimmesdale and Hester make love, committing the \\"sin\\" of adultery. When their relations are discovered through Hester's pregnancy with his child, the Puritan society they are part of are in an uproar. They immediately brand her as a sinner, an adultress and imprison her (she even gives birth in prison). As a reminder of her hell-bound deed, the elders sew a scarlet letter A (adultery) on her gown. She becomes a recluse, where she raises her daughter, Pearl, away from the people who have shunned them. Dimmesdale, is by far, the most troubled character. He is thoroughly immersed in guilt, and he must bear the hypocrisy of his crime. As a pastor, it is his duty to enligthen the people spiritually. He hides his sin, but punishes himself with physical torture each night, branding his own letter \\"A\\" with hot wax. The villain of the novel is not the Devil (who, contrary to the references made to the Devil, witches, etc) but the villainous Chillingworth, Hester Prynne's husband.Chillingworth returns from England to discover that his wife has become an outcast for her adultery. Full of raging jealousy and the desire to extract revenge upon the transgressor, he makes it his sole mission to torture Dimmesdale and plunge him further into dark despair with guilt. He feigns a friendship with Dimmesdale, but he makes it possible to mentally punish him and to inflict him with emotional pain. This is the real sin, here, the violation of the human heart. Through Chillingworth's constant torture of Dimmesdale, in addition to what seems like heavenly signs of condemnation (a comet passes in the sky leaving the letter A), Dimmesdale becomes so full of pain and guilt, that he dies in Hester's arms, announcing that he has committed the sin of adultery with her. The classic tale is read well and the cover is very striking. This can also make a nice gift."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter is a novel that I enjoyed reading and gained much knowledge from. After reading this novel, I learned a lot about love and adultery and how the people in the seventeenth century responded to it and dealt with it. The story takes place in Boston where a passionate woman named Hester Prynne goes off and cheats on her husband, Roger Chillingworth. While he was in England, Hester Prynne was having an affair with the pastor of the town, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale. Since he is the Reverend of the community, their love was to remain a secret even though they had brought a child into the world. Because Hester Prynne had committed adultery, she was forced by the townspeople to wear an embroidered letter &quot;A&quot; which was patched on her clothing right over her bosom. What you will read about in this novel is how Hester Prynne and Reverend Dimmesdale live through their struggles and what their daughter Pearl had to go through during her childhood. Be aware, it's intense!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This is for all the kids out there who have had to read this book for school and then written awful reviews of it here. Take a few years and PLEASE TRY AGAIN! You will not be sorry. Hawthorne is a wonderfully subtle author, and while his writing might seem tedious at first, it will reward you. This is not just a book about adultery punished by a repressive society- it is about guilt and love, secrets and integrity, personal demons and responsibility. The story has true relevance in today's world. And Hawthorne's language is amazing. If anything he writes seems obvious, look again. He may not have said what you first thought. He often shows many sides of a situation and lets the reader draw his own conclusions. I never had to read The Scarlet Letter for school, but I have read it twice and will probably read it again soon. It is one of the few books that have really stuck with me and made me think. Like other great works of art, it will keep coming back to you. What it lacks in swift and exciting action, it more than makes up in the author's great understanding of and compassion for his characters."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne, is a beautifully written controversial novel. It really highlights many of the problems of society during the time when the puritans had power up until present day society. The issues brought up include sexism, sexual morality, religion, and a line between what is considered right and wrong. Hawthorne shows the struggle of women in a society that is solely based on religion, the obstacles that have to be overcome in a situation of love vs. society, and the strength a single person can have to stand up for what they believe in when everyone else tells them they are wrong. Hester Prynne, the female protagonist, maintains many admirable traits and does not let society get the best of her. She comes to set up in Boston, which was then a puritan colony, while her husband takes care of business in Europe. While awaiting his arrival, Hester has an affair with Reverend Dimmesdale and falls in love with him. The consequence of this affair put restraints on Hester when she becomes \`with child'. Society ridicules her and makes her wear an A(adulterer) sewn into her clothing so every person will scorn her because of her sin. An inspirational strength is shown in Hester when she wears the A like a badge of honor. This shows her overpowering the standards of society and that she is not ashamed of her actions just because people tell her that she should be remorseful. Hawthorne integrates many ideas together that make this novel intriguing. His word choice strings together pictures and feelings to the scenes in his writing. The situations that many of Hawthorne's characters endure are ones that many people can relate to today in the 21st century."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I had a friend who used this for one of her dissertations. If you're one who enjoys classic literature then there are few works that top this book. The symbolism of this relatively short novel gives Hawthorne the ability to write a story with an incredible amount of depth. One of my favorite things about Hawthorne is his focus on characters. The development of all the key characters is simply amazing! Grief and religious zeal are obviously major conflicts and themes in the work, but that's just barely scratching the surface. This is just one of those books that you can take so much out of and still find that there is more to learn about it.I'll warn you now, if you haven't already read this book, this is not for everyone. Hawthorne writes pretty densely, and so if you're not one who enjoys that style then look for a different book. He is known for creating very vivid scenes and part of that means that he spends a large amount of time describing the setting. If you don't mind to reading about what the room looked like or Hester's prowess with a needle then you'll find that Hawthorne weaves a lot of symbolism in with those descriptions.There is so much to say about this book that I don't know where to begin or end. It is a great work done in the spirit of early American movement of transcendentalism. Nature is a major component of this work while the corrupting tendency of society is demonstrated through the near-fanaticism of early American religious communities. THE SCARLET LETTER is a brilliant and powerful work. There are very few authors who are as capable of developing characters as believably, or effectively for that matter, as Hawthorne does and this work is his masterpiece in regard to character development. If you're interested in reading classic literature and don't mind that such books tend to be dense then this is a must read. There are so many layers to the book but the story line still maintains an extremely exciting structure. The last few chapters are simply brilliant in regard to power and emotion that they bring to the plot. This is a classic for a reason!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I was quite pleased with the condition of this book, as well as it's hardcover, and the footnotes, definitions, and reading reviews for beginner readers of the genre. I am, of course, a huge fan of the Scarlet Letter itself and this copy served its purpose well. One of the few disappointments was that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral, or pink, than scarlet or red. Also, the back cover is white, and I am most definitely one for appearances. I would have like a slightly more classic looking cover. Nonetheless, the binding will look fair on my bookshelf. Over all the book was clean and well taken care of, and was shipped to me with great haste; A Good Buy."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I have no less than fifty books literally waiting on the shelf in my bedroom for me to read them.

So, when I finished the book last week and needed something to read, it shouldn't have been hard to pick something. I surprised myself by reaching for my Nathaniel Hawthorne collection and opening up to The Scarlet Letter.I read (or skimmed) The Scarlet Letter in high school. B-O-R-I-N-G! After I fell in love with The Peabody Sisters (which I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys biographies and literature) several years ago, I was anxious to try some more Hawthorne (he was married to the youngest Peabody sister). I started The House of the Seven Gables but put it aside when I just couldn't get into it after fifty pages. Even though I really really wanted to like Hawthorne, I figured it was hopeless.Perhaps I just wasn't ready or mature enough then. I devoured The Scarlet Letter this time. I was enthralled and fascinated with the story, themes and the beautiful language (makes reading most novels now seem like fifth grade work). I almost wish I was back in high school college so that I could discuss it with a group. I definitely have some ideas to contribute this time.

While it is true that some books overcome this at the time they are first read, others can take years before the reader is able to stomach reading them again. For myself, Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" falls into that category. Though I had already come to respect the work again, I never got around to re-reading it until I saw it was available as a free download for the Kindle. As with all the free downloads, it is a bare-bones edition, but there is nothing wrong with that since the book stands on its own. Published originally in 1850, it is an historical romance which takes place in Puritan New England during the 1640s.The book opens with the somewhat autobiographical introductory work called \\"The Custom House\\". Of course it is also fiction in that he did not find a scarlet letter or the roll of paper which contained the story while working there. One could easily read the rest of the book without this section, but it does offer some insight into the author and his perspective.The story itself is well written, and Hawthorne integrates several major themes into the work, such as sin, guilt, punishment and foregiveness, etc., which add to the enjoyment. Also key to the story are the characters. Hester Prynne is the woman who must wear the scarlet A. Roger Chillingworth is her husband who comes to town from the Netherlands as Hester is being publically shamed, and he is determined to find and torment the father of Pearl, whom he determines is Arthur Dimmesdale, the respected minister who is torn apart by his guilt.At times Hawthorne has been bashed by critics, but at this point he has stood the test of time. Though I wouldn't consider him the great American writer, he is one who should be read and \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is certainly his most famous, if not his greatest work."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This is a great classic read.

The story tackles the issues of how one deals with his/her sins, and how honesty, for some, comes at the price of great shame.The novel does take patience, but it moves along at a very neat pace. Had the novel been written with more scenes, and less exposition, it could have been even more gripping.I read the Reader's Digest edition, which comes with about 12 lovely illustrations, which capture the essence and the mood of the novel.

It was one of the first books I downloaded when I got my kindle 2. The character portrayals are superb. It analyses the thoughts, motivations, strengths and weaknesses of the four major characters in the story - Hester Prynn, the vengeful doctor, the hapless minister and Hester's vivacious and elf-like daughter Pearl. The description of the little girl and how she copes with being ostracized with her mother by a rigid puritanical society, is especially moving. While there are some descriptions of nature that are quite vivid, most of the text goes into developing these four characters and is a fascinating psychological study, though at times it's little slow.Overall, a well-crafted story and a good read.The book though is hard to navigate on the kindle because it has no active table of contents. I therefore would not purchase this version at regular price. Luckily, it's free!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Like many reviewers here, I was &quot;forced&quot; to read this book for my English Composition class. However, unlike many reviewers here, I have a much different view of the story. As some people have said before, Hawthorne's book takes a good deal of concentration, effort, and strength to understand. Not only to understand, but to finish. The story can drag sometimes, it is true, and Hawthorne's style of writing occasionally leaves something to be desired (I don't think I've ever seen that many commas, 15 letter words, or page long paragraphs before), but we simply must look past these minor issues. Overall, the plot is highly creative and intense, despite the writing.\\\\Ok, ok, I agree that the first chapter, &quot;The Custom-House&quot;, was pretty bad. In fact, it was so bad and boring that I drifted off to sleep several times while reading it! The first chapter has little relevancy with the story, so, unless you have to, I would suggest skipping that part of the text. The rest is exceptionally good, and the quality of the plot cannot be overlooked. My advice is to just lay off the first chapter; that way you'll be able to enjoy the rest of the book without difficulty.The story itself deals with sin and adultery, a subject that isn't very popular right now. Hawthorne does an excellent job of telling us about this, but he leaves the reader with many questions floating around in his mind at the conclusion. At the end of the story you're not 100% sure if Hawthorne was condemning the Puritan society, or if he was commending it. He leaves that for the reader to figure out, which is a thing authors seldom do. That's a major reason I believe this work is so unique and timeless.The story involves a women named Hester Prynne, living in the New World in the late 17th century. She has committed adultery with someone unknown, and, since the Puritan society considered the Bible to be their ultimate source of law, the punishment was quite severe for such an act. Hester is forced to wear a scarlet &quot;A&quot; (for adultery) on her attire at all times, as a sign to everyone that she has sinned deeply. And so she must carry out the rest of her life this way. That's the major gist of the plot, although there's much more. I won't give it anyway, though, you'll have to read the book to find out.Let's face it: at some time or another we all are going to probably have to read this book, voluntarily or involuntarily. Shouldn't we try to make the best of it? Read it for its enjoyment, anything else would be missing the point."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne, takes place in the 1600s in Boston, which was a Puritan community at that time. The Puritans had extremely strict moral codes, and adultery, a subject matter in this novel, was deemed by the Puritans in the same way that felonies today are regarded. The novel's plot is directed by the Puritans' reactions to such behavior.Nearly all classic novels get praised for character \\"development.\\" However, the Scarlet Letter is the only novel I have read so far that, in my opinion, truly demonstrates development of characters. All other novels I have read have \\"exploration\\" of characters, but not actual development. Development of characters involves portraying the changes in a person's personality as a result of conflict.In my opinion, the most impressive aspect of the Scarlet Letter is the ingenious connection between the novel's message and character development. In the Scarlet Letter, a single incident of adultery has unforeseen consequences that affect four people. How each character responds to the situation determines his or her physical and mental outcome in the story. The core message of the novel is that hiding one's sins causes more anguish than revealing one's sins.The character development is superb, but the novel does not seem to use the developed characters to influence the plot. The subject of adultery was a creative element to develop characters, but I wish that the author had introduced a different conflict toward the end of the novel to show how the 3D characters would have reacted to the change in subject matter. I personally think that varying the subject matter and conflict would have made the message even more convincing; however, the novel is written with a confident call to action, which is the MOST important aspect of any work of fiction.We live in a world in which immorality is everywhere, so a novel in which nothing inappropriate happens would be a pointless novel. Novels must address societies' immorality without sacrificing decency. Therefore, I commend The Scarlet Letter for referencing sexually immoral subject matter, without being a \\"sexual\\" book. This represents brilliance and should be observed by all writers of fiction.Many readers have complained that The Scarlet Letter is irrelevant to today's society. To some extent, I agree. However, the greatest novels written today will be irrelevant to society two hundred years into the future. Therefore, there is no justification for criticizing writers simply because their masterpieces will someday seem irrelevant. As time progresses, scenery changes, climates change, countries split up or join together, governments change, laws change, etiquette changes, etc. However, the elements of human personalities do not change with time. It is for this reason that I constantly emphasize the importance of characters. The Scarlet Letter's characters' personalities are thoroughly developed and distinctive, so they exist throughout today's world, as well as tomorrow's world."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"\\"All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,\\" might well be Nathaniel Hawthorne's theme in The Scarlet Letter. Certainly, by all community standards Hester Prynne's adultery is a sin. Worse yet Arthur Dimmesdale has triply sinned since he has had carnal knowledge of a member of his flock, and through a deep and abiding cowardice has failed to acknowledge his sin; and what is even worse yet, he allows Hester to bear the weight of public condemnation alone.However the worse sin of all belongs to Roger Chillingworth, Hester's husband who is not dead at all, but returned in disguise as a physician who has learned the efficacy of various medicinal concoctions from the Indians during his captivity. He pretends to befriend Dimmesdale in order to extract his long and torturous revenge. But it is Chillingworth's character itself more than anything that marks him as the worse of the sinners. He lives only for revenge and to give pain and suffering. He cares nothing for his wife and her child. He cares nothing for anyone, not even himself. He lives only to avenge.Dimmesdale's sin is that of a weak character. In a sense Dimmesdale is Everyman, the non-heroic. We see the contrast between the proud bravery of Hester and the all too human weakness of Dimmesdale who cannot bring himself to confess his sin, but looks to her strength to do it for him. We see this in the first scaffold scene as he pleads along with Chillingworth for Hester to reveal the father's identity. \\"Reveal it yourself!\\" we want to say.While some have seen Chillingworth as the devil incarnate--and indeed I suspect that was Hawthorne's intent--it might be closer to the truth to see him as the vengeful God of the Old Testament with his lust to mysterious power and his desire to see the sinful suffer. At any rate, Hawthorne's masterpiece--and it is a masterpiece, one of the pillars of American literature, to be ranked with such great works as Melville's Moby-Dick and Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn--is about sin and the effect of sin; and this is only right since the central tenet of Christianity itself is sin and the forgiveness of sin.By employing and investigating deeply three types of sin--Hester's from love and even something close to innocence; Dimmesdale's from lust, pride, neglect and cowardice; and Chillingworth's from hate--Hawthorne came up with a most felicitous device for examining the human soul.The Scarlet Letter is regularly taught at the high school level, but surely this is a mistake. The novel is difficult and challenging even for honors students. The architectured sentences, with their points and counterpoints, their parallel construction, their old school rhetorical cadences are strange and even wondrous to the modern eye. It is a good practice for the teacher and for the student to read aloud Hawthorne's prose so as to grow accustomed to his words the way one must for Shakespeare. If this is done and the edifice of Christianity and especially the fatalism of the Puritan mind brought to bear, then with leisurely pace and a steady concentration, the terrible beauty of Hawthorne's novel might be made immediate.Although the story itself is compelling, and the prose rich and poetic, the real strength of this great novel is in its characters. How true to life are all of them including even little Pearl who is defiant and willful in her beauty and her promise, so like a heroine-to-be of a modern novel. And how despicable and loathsome is this bent old man who embodies the very soul of the despised! And how attractive on a superficial level is this pretty young pastor whose actions are not the equal of his looks. And how strong and faithful and heroic is Hester who invites both envy and admiration, something like a flawed goddess of yore.What stuck me when I first read this, and remains with me today, is that it is those who presume to punish sin who are the real sinners. Chillingworth's life is one devoid of human feeling, devoid of any real joy as he lies in the stone cold bed of hatred and revenge. And to a lesser extent so it is with Dimmesdale who cannot forgive himself, who secretly flagellates himself so that his life becomes a hell on earth. On the other hand there is Hester who finds forgiveness and love with good works and in the joy of her beautiful and precious Pearl and in her unstinting love for Dimmesdale and her hope and faith that a better life will come.This is a deeply Christian novel although it is usually seen as a criticism of Christianity in the sense that the Christian community condemns the least of the sinners while the hypocrisy of its clergy is made manifest. Looking deeper we see that it is forgiveness of sin and the redemption that comes from good works that is exemplified. Hester knows the joy of life because she is a loving and giving person; and on another level she is forgiven because we the reader forgive her. How could we not? And most of the Puritan flock also forgave her since it came to be said that the scarlet \\"A\\" she wore upon her person stood not for \\"Adultery\\" but for \\"Able.\\"It is also good to realize that when Hawthorne published the novel in 1850 the scene of the story was nearly two hundred years removed. Thus Hawthorne looked back at Puritan America from the standpoint of a more secular society greatly influenced by Jeffersonian deism and the transcendentalism of Emerson and Thoreau. In some respects, Hawthorne's brilliant treatment of the ageless theme of sin, guilt and redemption was a serendipitous, even unconscious, artifact of his literary skill. No artist composes a masterpiece without some deep talent at work independent of his conscious efforts."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I think the many readers who were forced to partake of this classic were angry at their English teacher for making them read a book so wordy, detailed, and archaic in language. Many of the reviewers' complaints are about the author's style, which is definitely an acquired taste. Hawthorne doesn't merely give you a scene; he tries to tell you what time it is, how and why it is happening, and what each character is thinking as they enter the room. In this way, this can be a turn off to a leisurely reader; it may even be a turn off to an avid reader. The bottom line is that The Scarlet Letter, maybe more so than any other classic, is definitely a matter of style. I tend to admire the book because I can over look some of Hawthorne's unorthodox styles and look for a deeper meaning; if you happen to feel this way, great, if not, then maybe it just wasn't your kind of book.The main subject in The Scarlet Letter is sin--but not only the sin of adultery (Hester and Dimmesdale). There is also the sin of jealousy and revenge (Chillingworth) as well as the sin of hypocrisy and gossip (Puritan community). Hawthorne's opinion of the hypocrisy of the Puritans seems to be illustrated in the opening scene with Hester coming out of the prison door we hear the Puritan women making besmirching comments about Hester, and one even wanting death for Hester because of her sin--this reaction from a do-good community! The main crux of the story though, as alluded to, is about Hester and Dimmesdale's sin of adultery, and, more importantly, how each of the two protagonists deal with their sin. While Hester's sin is spread out in the public eye of the New England community, and she is shamed publicly, Dimmesdale's sin is hidden, as no one except he, Hester and Chillingworth knows about it. In this way, there are two very paths that follow for Hester and the Reverend Dimmesdale. Hester, after her initial public humiliation and shame, begins life anew, and is able to find a hobby (that of a seamstress) to make ends meet, and her suffering seems to make her able to take on the challenges in life. She is able to deal with the questions and mischievousness from her daughter Pearl, and seems to implore Dimmesdale, who is obviously overcome with guilt, to forget their sin and live free. Dimmesdale, on the other hand, takes his sin very harshly, and not only feels he must punish himself for it, but physically becomes a shell of his former self. Still, Dimmesdale has a remarkable power to still give amazing sermons to the community, even with guilt. Chillingworth, Hester's ex-husband, enters the scene early in the book, and begins to \\"peck\\" away at Dimmesdale, knowing full-well that he can break him down mentally and physically with such a weight on his shoulders. During the scenes where Chillingworth is probing the mind of Dimmesdale, there seems to be a symbolic parallel between Chillingworth and the devil (there are several references to Chillingworth being the \\"black man\\" in the novel). Dimmesdale can't save himself physically, but he can spiritually. Hester emerges as the novel's hero, mainly because she sheds her former faults, and becomes a stronger person in the process.The Scarlet Letter is definitely \\"heavy\\" reading. It might take you a few times to get through a few of the chapters. But, alas, persevere, and you may find it worth reading. And, take some advice: skip the introductory chapter \\"The Custom House\\" and just begin reading with \\"The Prison Door.\\" I can give you a quick synopsis of the introduction: Hawthorne wrote a book about two people who sinned by committing adultery, and the Puritans weren't happy. As much as people say this book is outdated, it really isn't. I mean, public scandals are a part of our culture just as much as they were then. Hester Prynne is that public scandal, the story you hear on the news or other media outlets. Public infamy, as well as changing public perception, seems to never go out of style.3 stars"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I enjoyed reading The Scarlet Letter. I was not forced into by a Literature teacher; I picked it up on my own because I heard it was a great American classic; and, indeed, I have to agree. It is truly timeless. It has been almost five years since I have read this book and I can remember the scenes and words so vividly. Hawthorne's dizzying imagery provides an adventure into the life of a Puritan woman, Hester Prynne, that one does not soon forget.Hester, practically abandoned by her husband is left to take care of herself in a lonely new world. She is flesh and bone with desires and passions like any other human being. Hester commits adultery and is found out by a cruel, judging community. She must wear a Scarlet A on the front of her dress; A for Adultery. Hester refuses to give the name of her lover Dimmesdale so he goes free and untouched by the damning society, but must face the tortures of his own conscience.Hester is humiliated and must suffer the consequences for her actions but she is not a broken woman. She stands, brave.Dimmesdale comes through in the end and admits his role in the dangerous game. Hawthorne takes the readers on a spinning ride to get to this point. Read it and know the exact ending for yourself. I recommend it; highly."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I loved this book! I could really feel for the characters, who each had a special quality that made them who they were. This is a must-read!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter is truly one of literature's greatest triumphs, its characters and themes reverberating in our collective consciousness more than 150 years after its initial publication. Few novels inspire as much contemplation and feeling on the part of the reader. Hester Prynne, American fiction's first and foremost female heroine continues to haunt this world, inspiring a never-ending stream of scholarly debate. Even in our less puritanical age, some doubtless see her as a villainously great temptress, but to me she is a remarkably brave hero indeed. Her sin is known to all, and she never runs away from it, bearing the scarlet letter on her bosom bravely for all to see; she realizes the true measure of that sin, fretting constantly over the effects it will have on young Pearl, remaining steadfast in her beliefs while at the same time envisioning a new society where women and men can exist on more equal terms, free of the stultifyingly harsh punishments meted out on even the most repentant of souls by Puritanism. She shows her noble spirit by refusing to name her partner in sin and goes so far as to allow the ruthless Roger Chillingworth to torment the man she loves deeply enough to protect him for all time. Little Pearl is somewhat of an enigma, truly manifesting traits of both the imp and the little angel; her questions about the letter her mother wears and the minister who continually holds his hand against his heart reflect an insight that amazes this reader. Chillingworth is a thoroughly black-hearted man; I can certainly understand the blow he sustained as a result of Hester's sin, but his actions and thirst for prolonged revenge on the so-called perpetrator of the wrong he suffered can only be described as roguish and unpalatable.Of course, the most complex character in the novel (and literature as a whole) is the good minister Arthur Dimmsdale. One is compelled to both like him and despise him. He is basically a good man and an unquestionably fine soldier in the army of the Lord, winning many souls to God with his impassioned sermons. He is more aware than anyone else of his sinful nature, and he punishes himself quite brutally in private in a useless attempt to make up for the public ignominy he lacks the moral courage to call upon himself with a public profession of his deed. Dimmsdale is a coward and a hypocrite. At one critical moment in the latter pages of the novel, he blames Hester for his state of misery, and it is that comment in particular that makes this tragic character a man I can only commiserate with to a limited degree. Even at the penultimate moment of the novel, as he finally bears the mark of his shame and guilt for all his parishioners to see, the very men and women who have viewed him as a saintly man of God rather than the brigand he knows himself to be, he does not openly confess-his words and deeds do make plain the secret of his heart, but it is his lack of a thoroughly bold confession that causes some of his most devoted followers, so Hawthorne tells us, to blindly judge his final act as an illustrative parable on the danger of sin threatening each member of his congregation rather than an admission of guilt and self-condemnation.It upsets me to see readers who do not appreciate this novel as one of the earliest and best American classics, a novel that contributed greatly to the establishment of a literary culture in the young country. The language is of a more florid style than today's readers are used to, but this novel is in no way boring. Hawthorne paints some of the most vivid scenes of human drama I have ever witnessed; he writes in such a way that you are there in colonial Boston watching the story play out before your very eyes, struggling to come to terms with your own feelings in regard to such complex and sometimes inscrutable characters. The climactic chapter is truly and deeply moving, more than capable of bringing tears to the eyes of the sensitive soul. The Scarlet Letter is just a brilliant, gripping, thoroughly human novel that I wish everyone could appreciate as much as I do."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"One of the American classics, THE SCARLET LETTER tells of a woman named Hester Prynne in late 17th century who committed the then-unforgivable sin of adultery. She had been living in Boston for two years and had been found guilty of bearing a child (Pearl) by an unknown father. As punishment for her sin, Hester was forced to wear a scarlet A (adultery) on the bodice of her dress and to stand on a public scaffold before Boston's townspeople.The opening chapter &quot;Custom House&quot; seemed irrelevant to the rest of the novel the first time I read the book. It was not until a couple of years later I found it not true when I re-read the novel. I do have to admit that Hawthrone's writing style can drag at times, the once-seemed boring opening chapter significantly set the mood for the rest of the novel.&quot;Custom House&quot; does not seem to be an integral part of the story; yet the passage in which Hawthrone tells of having discovered, in the Salem Custom House, the faded scarlet A and the parchment foolscap sheets containing the facts which he says he used as the basis for this novel. The two landmarks mentioned at the beginning: prison and cemetry, point to the central themes of punishment and death, which will be combined in the climax of the novel. Prison might symbolize how Hester Prynne, who wore that scarlet A on the bodice, was forever locked in by her sin.This entire tale is filled with symbolisms. The prison is described as &quot;the black flower of the civilized society&quot;. The tombstone at the end of the book implies that crime and punishment may well bring about the death of such civilized life. The most popular and conspicuous symbol that is well sustained throughtout the book is the scalet A that is worn by Hester Prynne. Initially it is a red cloth letter which is a literal symbol of the sin of adultery. But the author makes the symbol A much more richly symbolic throughout the rest of the tale. The scaffold is not only a symbol of the stern Puritan code, but also a symbol for the open acknowledgment of personal sin. Night and day are symbols for concealment and openness. The sun symbolizes happiness and freedom of guilt. The list goes on and on....Arthur Dimmensdale, Roger Chillingworth, Hester Prynne, and Pearl themselves, are symbols as well. They reflect certain view of sins and effects on humans and society. The book might take strength and effort to read; but it's not quite a bad read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Just look at a portrait of him as a young man, note the noble brow, the handsome features, the sensitivity, how romantic......... Curl up with this book and let Nathaniel tell you his tale in his beautiful poetic language . This is a book to be read quietly, alone, not in an airport lounge or on the subway, but preferably in a beautiful garden or sunroom with the windows open. Let the beauty of his language flow over you and transport you back in time.It is over 200 years since Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in Salem Massachusetts, his great great grandfather officiated at the Salem Witch Trials. He was both disturbed and intrigued by his ancestry. One day when working at The Custom House in Salem to make ends meet as a struggling young author, he discovered in one of the upstairs rooms some dusty old boxes, on opening them he found them to contain relics from the past, long since forgotten. Yellowing documents and an intriguing piece of embroidery, a scrap of faded and torn material with the letter A embroidered on it. He picked it up, and while wondering what it was, he held it up to his chest, and at that moment he claims to have felt a burning sensation which caused him to drop the piece of cloth. It gave him inspiration for this story along with documents he found about a woman called Hester Prynne.The scene he sets so vividly is somewhere around 350 years ago 150 years before he was born. In a time when behavior to which we can hardly be bothered to raise an eyebrow was in that day considered a punishable sin. A disgrace for life. Branded by having to wear a scarlet letter on the chest for all to see.It is a feminist novel, (Nathaniel Hawthorne supported women's rights). Briefly, the protagonist Hester Prynne has a child from an adulterous relationship and refuses to name the father. Her husband a physician much older than she has never been a \\"proper\\" husband to her so she had looked elsewhere for love. The husband vows to find the father of the child, and in exchange for her freedom makes Hester swear she will never disclose who her husband is. Her husband being a physician quickly deduces who the father is from the way he is wasting away under his burden of guilt. He sets about a long period of torment of the young man of which Hester is aware but can say nothing because of her promise. Finally she has had enough and decides to come clean, shaming the devil, (her husband) and redeeming the young man. I do not want to spoil anything by divulging the name of the father of the child in case you do not know.This is such a simple and brief account it would make Nathaniel wince to read it. There is so much more to the story. It states in the blurb that it is a psychological novel before there was a science called psychology. The way the characters in the story interact with each other, the symbolism, the different values of the day from Nathaniel's day, and then again to this day. The religious aspect in Puritan times, the emotional ups and downs as you empathize with first one and then another of the characters. It is a wonderful story and well deserving of its position as one of America's great classics."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I was a little disappointed with this book. After hearing all the hype (good and bad) about the movie, I was anxious to read the book when it was assigned in school. There was a lot of lengthy description in the book that was a little hard to follow. The novel didn't really &quot;come alive&quot; for me- I was too busy trying not to get lost in the descriptions. On the other hand, the book/writing does a good job of portraying human nature and human feelings. After reading the book, there's lots to talk about in terms of the characters' feelings, motives, and internal struggles as a result of Hester's and the Reverand's sin."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I just finished reading this book (found a copy on the internet) and must say it was quite a story. I think readers young and old can enjoy this book, but if you're in high school and your school has only fed you those soppy, milktoast pieces of so-called English lit, I must tell you that you should probably look elsewhere for Winter Break reading. On the other hand, if you're a somewhat linguistically precocious high school student and are well-acquainted with other authors of this genre, you will find this book a quick read and beneficial to your high school studies for a number of reasons. One. You will now understand those vague references your friends make when they call you Hester Prynne under their breath. (okay, so maybe that's just me.) Two. All that Puritanical &quot;nonsense&quot; from American history will make a heck of a lot more sense now that you understand in a more emotional sense what impact Puritan morals had on gender roles in colonial New England, etc. Three. Your English teacher will appreciate the fact that you went out of your way to read something that wasn't Tom Clancy or Michael Crichton. Four. If you've been having a hard time with your college app essay, you now have a great topic for the one about who you'd like to meet and why. (Pick either Hawthorne or Prynne -- but please, be intelligent.) Anyhow, if you've got over two brain cells, this book is an intense and very speedy read. And you're not likely to confuse it with any other literature, like I so often do with Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility or Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. So read this book. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"A friend of mine called this book ponderous; she read it in 8th grade. Go back to this one; I keep returning to it myself. Maybe it's in response to my parents' divorce. And how Hawthorne handles adultery -- not the danger and desire, but the punishment and crime. Hester's story begins outside the jail house. An American sex crime. Read it as such. Trust Dover for a good, cheap reprint."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Nathanial Hawthorne is a wonderful writer, if gloomy. I have read quite a few of his books because of how much I enjoyed this one. This is his masterpiece, although some of his other books are worth a read as well. This book is chilling because of his mastery of language and characterization. He explores sin, alienation and spiritual regeneration as he tells the tale of a Puritan woman (Hester Prynne) who has an adulterous affair with a minister. We see the ripple effect that this illicit affair has on Hester and her lover, as well as Hester's husband, and most disastrously, her daughter Pearl. We see the effect that being ostracized has on Hester herself. This is visibly pictured by the scarlet A that she is forced to wear, but the effect that this has on her psyche and the way that she finds to cope with this estrangement show how strong a human being can be if pushed to it. This is a great book, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I read the Scarlet Letter last year for English and found it to be one of the most increadible stories I have ever read. Symbolism abounds in the forms of Pearl and Chillingsworth; even the scenery comes alive to tell this tale of love, atonement, and revenge.Don't come into this book looking for action, there isn't any. Instead, there are intense mental conflicts between the characters, making for some exciting and powerful scenes. Hawthorne's uses a great deal of description, mostly to create symbols, but also just to allow you to imagine yourself in the time and place: puritan New England, so that you can empathise more with the brilliantly designed characters.If you aren't familiar with the story of the Scarlet Letter, it describes the punnishment of Hester Prynne, a woman charged with adultry and punished by having a red letter 'A' sewed onto her main article of clothing. She is a marked woman, and therefore raises the daughter from her affair in a house seperate from the rest of her village. Her husband, who was supposedly following Hester to Massachusets from England, but took a long time getting there, arrives to witness her punishment, and decides that he is going to find the man who did this and make him suffer. From there, Hawthorne brings his characters together through scene after powerful scene, until the amazing ending.The Scarlet Letter is a classic for a reason, and deals with many issues that we still wrestle with today. If you're a fan of symbolic books, don't mind books which lack action, and want a book which will make you think, I recomend the Scarlet Letter to you. If you want the action and not the symbolism, then you probably shouldn't be looking for classic books, especially not this one."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"How could anyone call the plot of this timeless story mundane?! This story is timeless as anyone in our age of technology who has had a baby out of wedlock can attest to the social ignominy they immediately endure, whether by their own church or by the Puritan bred society we live in. Some things do not change. The central figure Hester Prynne must stand on the public scaffold with her fatherless child and endure the silent reproach of her peers and town fathers, putting on a good front of indifference while also serving as a means of perverse entertainment for the crowd gathered round. Hawthorne makes the public shame of the scaffold felt in his rich skill with words that resurrect the cold, disapproving world of the Puritan. The Romans had the colliseum, the Puritans had the scaffold! Some will find the reading heavy, bogged down with a rambling of words. Others who want to rekindle what it meant to tell a story in Victorian times will enjoy the rich prose, each sentence carefully composed to the point the reader feels Hawthornes throbbing pity for the fallen Hester Prynne and her undisclosed lover- which will remain so here in case anyone has not read the book yet. The narrative voice is one of sympathy for the doomed lovers and the innocent child Pearl, and at the same time one of grudging empathy towards the Puritan fathers who given the age, did only what they felt was right in condemning a woman of wicked ways, but not so wicked that they stop purchasing her fancy laces and superb skill with the needle. The hypocrasy of the Puritan way of life is easily discerned within three chapters. Hawthorne's own grandfather had been party to the Witch Trial period, having sat in judgement over a woman condemned to hang. His interest in the human turmoil the strict Puritans must have endured is evidenced in his writing of the poor Rev. Dimmsdale, caught between the dark presence of the physician Roger Chillingsworth's snake like vigil, the blind devotion to him from the townspeople as a living saint, and his desire to help Hester Prynne, clutching at his own heart everytime she passes by with the Scarlet Letter emblazoned upon her chest. This is well worth taking the time to read. Think of those long passages as sitting in front of the fireplace with Hawthorne as he unravels his tale for you, his desire to make you sympathetic to the lovers inciting his lengthy descriptions. A must for any age reader."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I remember reading this novel back when I was in high school, and again recently when there was another film version of it done. It really is a classic tale, set in early America. However, the moral of the tale is rather timeless -- it deals with sexual morality, but more importantly it deals with honesty and corruption in society, and how we can really harm ourselves by trying to live up to what society wants from us.Hester Prynne is the main character. In a Puritan community, she breaks her marriage vows by having an affair, with the new preacher no less, Reverend Dimmsdale. This affair results in a pregnancy, something that is impossible to hide in the small community. Reverend Dimmsdale becomes both her lover and her chief accuser, given the status he has in the village. The entanglements that Dimmsdale and Prynne have with each other, in public and out, make for fascinating reading, and shows that people remain the same essentially no matter how technology and history may change.The title, the scarlet letter, refers to the big red \\"A\\" Hester Prynne is required to wear, identifying her as an adulteress. Interesting, of course is that while the whole community is full of sinners, because Puritan religion believes this of all people, they single her out. This also shows times don't change, because even today sexual \\"sins\\" are often considered worse than far more bloody or violent ones.This is a well written book, not really easy but not really difficult to read, and a fascinating look at both early America and how people interact."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Hawthorne was a complex writer that used big words --oh did he use them often-- to get his message across.

So that when anyone asks her, \\"Oh... what's that on your chest?\\" She will have to answer. \\"It is proof that I am a lower being and don't deserve the respect of God or anyone for that matter. Please, kill me where I stand!\\"This is a great book that deals with human emotions superbly. The language is beautiful and full of life. The only reason I give this book 4 stars is that some of the modern readers will find the big words a little confusing. This surely is not a high school book even though they read it in high school. You need to be a good reader to appreciate it fully. If you read one page and find it horrid and shrug it off when you have to read it for class, you will never enjoy this great book. Probably because you will never pick it up again and try to read it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I usually like the classics. But when I read this book and a number of the author's short stories I couldn't escape the conclusion that Nathaniel Hawthorne wasn't a great writer. He doesn't belong among the immortals of literature. His short stories are predictable. After reading Hawthorne I read some Herman Melville and found him to be far better. The one thing in Scarlet Letter's favor is that it is politically correct. It's satisfying that the intolerant religious fanatics are the bad guys. The villain of the story is respected Roger Chillingworth, and the heroine is his wife Hester Prynne, adulteress. Would you consider it adultery if the husband was missing for years and assumed dead, as is the case here? It's not enjoyable to read about religious intolerance. The book gets quite dopy when something magical happens to Hester's boyfriend at the end, something right out of The Exorcist, and typical of Hawthorne's silly writing. It gets even dopier when Hester deserts her happy family to return to misery. Hawthorne has a thing for magical events and foolish endings."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I am a 48 year old college student reading The Scarlet Letter for the first time. In fact, I have never read any of Nathaniel Hawthorne's works before--doesn't say much for my high school. Hawthorne's use of imagery and double meanings captivated me. ANALYSE ANYTHING--EVERYTHING HAS ANOTHER MEANING. I couldn't wait to read the next page and get to class to discuss it. When I read the passages again, I found more hidden meanings. I've gone on to read more of his works since and would now like to find out more about his family heritage. His family was involved in the Salem witch trials and the persecution of the Quakers during the 17th century. It has been suggested that this has influenced in his writings about guilt, shame, sin, &amp; alienation.I loved his allegorical treatment of the emotional ramifications brought on by social, family, and religious situations. What was chillingworth's sin anyway? Who cheated on who? I would say that the &quot;goody-two shoe&quot; minister, Arthur Dimmesdale, was the real villain. He never confessed to save Hester and Pearl until his dying day; he had nothing to personally gain by keeping his secret.I &quot;feel&quot; for all the high school kids that do not appreciate or understand Hawthorne's stories. I suggest that you go to a quiet place, without interruptions--take the phone off the hook, and read. It will take time to get going; a little research would help. Coming to this site is a start. See what others think about his writing--BUT DON'T GIVE UP. You may even have to admit that you like it"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I put my goal to read Moby Dick on hold in order to read The Scarlet Letter as I prepare to teach it with my AP Language & Composition class. As Hawthorne and Melville were friends, I didn't think that Melville would mind.While I read and taught The Scarlet Letter before, I never had the appreciation for it as I did in this reading. I was captivated by the story, but the language and style of its writing was preeminent for me. Hawthorne crafts a beautifully written story that tells the familiar tale of Hester Prynne's public shame and Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale's private tormented guilt after an adulterous affair set in the backdrop of Puritan Boston. The story is simple, as Hester faces a judgmental crowd in the town, and Dimmesdale suffers from a burning conscience as he does not admit to his sin. One man, Roger Chillingworth--Hester's husband--knows the secret and is bent on revenge against them both.While The Scarlet Letter is often used to criticize and demonize the Puritan era, it rather shows the importance of what the consequences of sin lead to within our hearts. The public consequences are temporary, but the private consequences are far longer reaching as the \\"Hound of Heaven\\" chases after us to confess and repent. While Hawthorne does not condemn adultery as a sin, we see the destruction causes by infidelity with the Prynne family. Hester Prynne is indeed a model of feminine strength and virtue in accepting responsibility and guilt, but she also provides us a picture of the results of our sin and the need for redemption in a Savior.The book begins with this excellent line, showing the coldness of the scene and the tone of the entire novel:A throng of bearded men, in sad-colored garments and gray, steeple-crowned hats, intermixed with women, some wearing hoods, and others bareheaded, was assembled in front of a wooden edifice, the door of which was heavily timbered with oak, and studded with iron spikes.In our first picture of Hester, Hawthorne contrasts the ugliness of sin with the beauty of the woman:On the breast of her gown, in fine red cloth, surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold thread, appeared the letter A. It was so artistically done, and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy, that it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the apparel which she wore; and which was of a splendor in accordance with the taste of the age, but greatly beyond what was allowed by the sumptuary regulations of the colony.If you are looking to read novels that you should have read in high school but didn't, I heartily recommend starting with this one."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Book is a great read.

Thank you for a pleasant transaction."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I first read The Scarlet Letter (TSL) back in high school. I thoroughly enjoyed the book then. Going back and rereading a second time still brought back the awe associated with the imagery painted by Hawthrowne. Perhaps the most striking image is that in the beginning, where Hester Prynne is about to come out of her jail cell and a single rose blossoming amidst the bleakness of her prison is used as a metaphor. Hawthrowne does a superb job describing the details and ways of life. I believe he captures 17th century Bostonian life accurately. In a way this book is a history book. I do admit that the plot is slow at times, but the book does appear to move much more quickly if you try to admire Hawthrownes writing style and descriptive language. Overall, I would say this book impressed me as much as War and Peace and some of Dickens' novels did."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"When people think of a \\"scarlet letter,\\" we immediate think of a person outwardly branded for something they have done. Credit Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" for that -- it's an intense, impassioned (if slightly hammy) story of a strong-willed woman in Puritan New England, who is branded for her sins and her love for one weak man.In the mid-1600s, a passionate young woman named Hester Prynne has been accused of adultery -- she recently had a baby, even though her husband was abroad. Just as damning to the elders is the fact that she won't name baby Pearl's father. Even her estranged husband -- a cold-hearted older man calling himself Roger Chillingworth -- wants to know her lover's identity, but Hester steadfastly refuses to even hint at the man's identity.We learn early in the book that Pearl's dad is actually the local minister Arthur Dimmesdale, who is wracked with guilt, hallucinations and sickness because of his secret adultery. Chillingworth slowly deduces who his wife's lover was, and begins to scheme revenge on Dimmesdale. Will the former lovers manage to escape their guilt-ridden lives, or will they reveal the truth to everyone?It sounds like \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is JUST a story about guilt and sin, but it's also a story about love and steadfastness. Hester remains strong and kind throughout her life despite others' cruelty to her, and her love for Dimmesdale and Pearl is what gives her that strength. Chillingworth (symbolic name!) is a cuckold, but it's impossible to like him because of his lack of love -- he loves no one, and lives only for revenge.And at the same time, Hawthorne reminds us that goodness can overcome your past sins. Hester slowly overcomes the Puritans' loathing for her by simply being charitable, kind, helpful and loving, until eventually her sin is eclipsed by her virtues. On the flip side, Dimmesdale is annoying because of his weakness and cowardice -- I know he's supposed to be wracked with guilt, but he's so pathetic compared to Hester that it's just infuriating.Hawthorne's writing may take a little while for modern audiences to get used to. It's very 19th-century in style, with staid, slightly stuffy prose gilded with hauntingly poetic moments and intense passion (\\"Never, never!\\" whispered she. \\"What we did had a consecration of its own\\"). At times Hawthorne's story gets a little... hammy (such as Dimmesdale revealing his \\"A\\" burn scar), but the power of his story keeps this from getting silly.\\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is used to describe outward signs of guilt, but Hawthorne's novel is actually about strength and love, and how they can blot out misdeeds."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"It is hard to imagine the world Hawthorne creates, but he brings it to life completely.

The author wrote about Hester and Pearl in a way that helped them attain emotional sentiment from the readers. Also, Hawthorne showed the physical and psychological effects of having a guilty conscience by writing about what Hester and Dimmesdale had to endure to hide their sin. The author also successfully showed the hypocritical aspects of Puritan society in Boston, Massachusetts during the mid-seventeenth century. For example, Dimmesdale still remained a religious minister and role model for the rest of the townspeople even though he was responsible for a forbidden affair with Hester. A main purpose of The Scarlet Letter was to show that human beings can be misunderstood if they aren't allowed to have personal identities due to strict societal regulations. In this novel, the author, Hawthorne, portrayed the idea that Puritanism often lead to unjustified punishment, sometimes against the wrong person. Throughout the novel, he draws strong criticisms against Puritan values.The Scarlet Letter was ineffective in achieving its purpose of satisfying readers because it did not come to a significant conclusion at the end and some of the main characters didn't receive enough focus. The author could have more effectively showed how Pearl shaped her later adult life by stating more information throughout the novel about her early life experiences. This addition would have significantly improved the novel because Pearl was a significant character that deserved a stronger focus. At the end of the novel, none of the characters surfaced as a winner above the others. The Scarlet Letter would have been significantly better in achieving its purpose if the author had written more about Hester and Dimmesdale at the end of the novel. Hawthorne didn't write in detail about their time together at the end of the novel. Instead, the characters died rather quickly and readers didn't get a chance to delve further into their lives to see if they could live happily after overcoming the ordeal of their sins.The Scarlet Letter is a well-known classic American piece of literature. Hawthorne effectively conveyed to readers the downsides of Puritan society during the mid-seventeenth century and values through expressing the hardships characters such as Hester, Dimmesdale, and Pearl had to endure due to the society and time that they lived in. However, the novel was ineffective because it didn't achieve its purpose of satisfying readers. The ending of the novel seemed rushed and didn't show or symbolize enough. Also, some of the main characters, such as Pearl, Hester, and Dimmesdale, deserved more credit in order to further exemplify their significance and everything that they symbolized throughout the novel."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I love it but it saddened me. . .

A great book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I started off a review of the more famous of 19th American writer Nathaniel Hawthorne's short stories by noting that the old social democratic literary critic and editor of \\"Dissent\\", Irving Howe, once noted that Mark Twain, and his post-Civil War works represented a dramatic break from the Euro-centric ante bellum American literary establishment. And on this question I agree with him. As I do on his choice of Nathaniel Hawthorne as an exemplar of that tradition. Certainly his most famous work, \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", reflects that European influence, and is justly place in the pantheon of that handful of important works that emerged in the early days of the American Republic.One of the of clearest links the ante bellum American literary establishment and the European tradition, especially from the English tradition was the need to pose and resolve some high moral question. And of course what is simpler to do that go back to the stark and isolated foundations of the white American tradition, the Puritan tradition. I know that if I were a writer and I wanted to dramatically portray the effects that physically isolated (and isolating) religiously-driven communities have on the individual, and on individual choice, those Puritan settlements from Cape Cod to Salem on the coast of Massachusetts in the 1600s would, at least get my serious consideration.So that, in part is what drives the action (if one can use that term usefully here) of a woman (naturally) banished from the tight-knit community (or so they claimed) by running off and having an affair with Mr. X. Now today that would create in the reader nothing but a big yawn, and maybe some spicy gossip, but hardly banishment, and hardly the necessity to wear a badge of courage sewn on your dress. Except maybe today one would advertise that status and place a video on \\"YouTube\\". And that is my moral point.Hester Prynne did not deserve the social opprobrium of the religious fundamentalists of her day. But old Hawthorne did a great service by creating a masterpiece to point out that moral ambiguity and dilemma back in the days."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Being unconditioned to Hawthorne's writing style, this one took some perseverance at the front end of the story before I could read through his narrative style without getting bogged down or letting my mind wander. However, I'm grateful I stuck with it, as in the end the story captured me. Unbelievably, before it was over, Hawthorne actually produced a real page-turner of a story!! But I have to give all praise to the wonderful character of Hester Prynne. In my limited exposure and experience to the world's great literature and associated characters, I have to believe she might rank among literature's greatest women. Strong and full of character, overcoming the Puritanical intolerance and \\"ignominy\\" heaped upon her; a woman of soft heart with a core of steel."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Is it better to admit guilt and choose to live a life of shame, or is it better not to admit guilt and choose to live a life of dignity? This is the theme of Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter. The heroine, Hester Prynne, is accused of committing adultery, and has to live with a scarlet letter \`A' hanging from her neck. Because she wants to protect the dignity of her lover, she refuses to disclose his name.The story is set in the eighteenth century, when having a baby out of wedlock was considered to be extremely shameful. That may seem irrelevant to the present culture, but conflicts around shame and guilt are prevalent even today. So the emotional conflicts are as relevant today as they were in those days.Hawthorne is an expert in describing psychological conflicts. Even though his style may seem old fashioned, he dissects the human mind with the expertise of a modern psychologist. As he describes the course of the two lovers' relationship with society, Hawthorne expertly describes their emotional and character changes.A priest, a doctor and a wild little girl are some of the other colorful characters woven together to create a story full of suspense and surprises.If you like serious dramas, which deal in depth with complex human characters and situations, you will love reading this book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I'm sad to say that I overlooked the Scarlet Letter when we were forced to read it in high school.

I purchased it for my daughter, who is in highschool. The book arrived around the time it stated it would. Above all of that the price was great."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book is a masterpiece of English (not just American) literature. It is as beautiful as prose can be, showcasing the amazing technique and depth that Hawthorne could communicate. It isn't trite story of a puritan scandal; rather, it is a penetrating exploration of shame, redemption, and true love. Melville had it right when he dedicated his book to the \\"Genius of Hawthorne\\". Not surprisingly, this is one of the few American novels on the list of Great Books, which should obviate any needless disputes about the quality of this novel constantly brought up by sophmoric readers that have little experience in literature.This edition is nicely bound and quite affordable. For such a great book, the introduction is unfortunately shallow and unscholarly. Instead of exploring the themes or structure of the piece, the write opts for a bland biography of Hawthorne, a light summarization of the novel along with the Custom House prologue, and finishes her essay with some obstuse comparisons of Hester Prynne with Monica Lewinksy. Making such idiotic references to pop culture prompts the reader to wonder if this person understood the book at all.Fortunately, the comments at the end of the novel are what makes this edition valuable. Reading the reviews of contemporaries, including Melville, add to the reader's understanding and they are nice pieces of analysis in themselves. The essay of Hawthorne's own son, Jullian, superbly catches the nuances of Hawthorne's style and should be held as a template for literary analysis.For the price and the reviews at the end, I highly recommend this edition of a timeless classic."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"\\"The Scarlet Letter\\" by N.

Some enjoy it, while many others dread the task of reading this ?classic Americannovel?. I can relate to many who have felt as though they would rather do anything butread this novel; I too was required to read The Scarlet Letter as a junior in high school.However, after having read through this intricate novel more than once, I believe thedread that many feel can easily be turned to fascination and interest, if this novel is readcorrectly and intuitively.Throughout The Scarlet Letter, a web of intricate plots and themes arises. In thebeginning of the novel, the reader is given a detailed description of the New Englandsetting in which the novel takes place. A series of contrasting images is provided, suchas the ?ponderous iron-work? of the prison door, and the ?wild rose bush...covered indelicate gems?. Although these images may become confusing to some, contrastingimages such as these offer insight into the characters that are described in the next fewchapters. Some of the major characters in this novel include Rodger Chillingworth, theReverend Dimsdale, and Hester Prynne. However, the protestant women described in thesecond chapter are quite frequently overlooked, yet play an integral role in theadvancement of the novel. These women are first seen waiting at the prison door forHester Prynne to exit, and are described as ?goodwives?. They are portrayed as a moredelicate and briefer beauty than their ancestors had. Characters like these women arecrucial to the advancement of the plot, but are too often overlooked. While majorcharacters are most often examined, minor characters can carry the plot in crucial ways.Utilizing complex and witty characters within the novel, such as the women by the prisondoor, adds depth to the themes, which is something Hawthorne is very good at doing.As the story line deepens, we find ourselves in the midst of a nineteenth centurylove triangle, between Hester Prynne, Dimsdale, and Chillingworth. Hester, who ismarried to Chillingworth, has had an affair with the Reverend Dimsdale. Because of thisaffair, she becomes pregnant with an illegitemate child. When the community uncoversthe sin she has comitted, she is forced to wear a scarlet letter ?A? on her breast. Whilemany believe and teach that the letter stands for ?adultry?, it can be argued that the ?A?stands for something other than this theme.When Hester leaves the prison, she is described in a completely different mannerthan the women who awaited her at the prison door. In the second chapter, Hester isdescribed as ?...tall, with a figure of perfect elegance, on large scale?, which is starklydifferent from the description of the other women. The ?A?, in this case, could mean?admirable?, or even ?American?, unlike ?adulteress?. I have not heard this optiondiscussed or even acknowledged; it is only insisted in high schools that the ?A? onlymeans one thing, even though it is never even stated what the ?A? stands for.One of the biggest misses in the high school teachings of this book is the absenceof the Custom House Essay in the course syllabus. In the Custom House Essay,Hawthorne lays the plans for the entire novel. He carefully describes the New Englandtown he grew up in, and offeres readers an inside look at the men who worked in thecustom house. While never stating his dislike for these men, Hawthorne uses ironicdescriptions of these men to give the reader a true depiction of the leaders of their time.The Custom House Essay also contains Hawthorne?s definition of a ?romance?, anddescribes for the reader how he created the novel. Hawthorne appeals to the readerssenses by using both fiction and truth in this preface to his novel. It sets the stage for therest of the book, and plays upon the idea that the ?A? on Hester Prynne?s chest couldstand for more than just an adulteress.One of the major downfalls to The Scarlet Letter is the language style used in thebook. At times, certain words can be hard to understand, and the language used todescribe the setting can slow down the reading of the novel. However, this is not thefault of either the writer or the reader, because this novel was written in nineteenthcentury America, which is quite different from the world we are living in now.One of the biggest problems a reader could surface from reading the novel is theunderrepresentation of women and minorities. While the novel is centered around awoman, she is not given a distinct voice in the story, nor is she represented by a woman.She is forced to live on the outside of town, and is forced to wear a letter ?A? on herchest. When confronted by her husband Chillingworth, she is not even given the choiceto acknowledge him as her husband. Instead, she is told by him that she should notreveal his identity to anyone.Not only are women underrepresented, but minorites as well. There is nomention of any African American people in the novel, yet they were quite present innineteenth century America. The only minority mentioned is the unnamed Indian, wholike Hester, lives on the outskirts of town.Although certain aspects of the novel can confuse and hinder the reader, TheScarlet Letter is a novel which transcends time and location. It has become a majorAmerican novel not just because it was written about American life, but because itsthemes question what it truly means to be an American. I highly recomend reading thisnovel, and stronly encourage readers to include the Custom House Essay in their reading.Whether it be the first time, or one hundredth, The Scarlet Letter carries themes whichremain prevelant throughout American literature."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I first read this book in college, and I have purchased it again to read. I think the book speaks volumes about society that was slow to be tolerant of differences and finds it easy to pile on when someone is ostracized. I found many parallels to today's society, where many people still exist who like to judge first and ask questions later. You will look at today's world with new eyes after reading this story crafted many years ago by one of America's best ever writers.Jeffrey McAndrewauthor of &quot;Our Brown-Eyed Boy&quot;"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Some people immediately dismiss the worth of this book by criticizing its seemingly clich&eacute; plot, centered around adultery and the guilt which follows. I say, Hawthorne's novel is not revolutionary or amazing in its subject, setting, or even characters, but rather in the way in which it unfolds. The story delves remarkably into the souls of several individuals in a New England Puritan town, gradually and ephemerally casting beams of soft light on new aspects of each's personalities and struggles. Each character is masterfully and magically revealed, and the tale strives for intimacy and understanding of each point of view in a complex circle of deceit and secrecy. I think it will be enjoyed by everyone who appreciates detailed and beautiful analysis of character, sentiment, thought, and human nature, but may not be ideal for those seeking constant action."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I came up to this book (a reading assignment for school) with a bit of dread, having heard that Hawthorne's writing could be hard to read. Actually, it was a delightful suprise to find it was a captivating plot, very well written, and very easy to read. I enjoyed it thoroughly. This book is about a woman who has an affair, choosing to bear the scarlet letter than reveal her lover's identity. Along side her is her ilegitamate daughter, a delightfully and hillariously strange character in the book. The scarlet letter is a good book having a melancholy but redeeming ending. A definate classic. Check it out... it'll be better than you expected."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; is about a young woman named Hester Prynne who has a child out of wedlock. Set in Puritan, Boston, the people shun Hester, especially when she refuses to divulge the name of the baby's father. Her punishment is to wear a scarlet A on her dresses, which is where the title comes from. This book is one of the first true romances written. The main character, Hester, is a very strong, very independent woman character. I think the book is an excellent romance and social defiance.The first appearance of romance shows up in chapter 3, when the stranger shows up in the market, asking why Hester was standing on the platform. A townsperson then spins Hester's tale: Of how her English husband had sent her to Boston before he himself moved, of how no word had been heard of the husband in the two years that she had been there, and how she had had a child. The man then asks who the baby's father is, and the good townsperson answers by saying that Hester refuses to give the name, but that the man is undoubtedly in the crowd. In the end, we discover that the father is really Arthur Dimmesdale, her preacher and the stranger is really her long-lost husband. All throughout the book, this romantic triangle comes to play, giving this book depth and character as one of the first true romances.It is also a story of social defiance. The first instance of this is in chapter 2, when she walks out of the prison. Instead of being humble and meek, as the townspeople had expected, she holds her head up high and refuses to avert her eyes. All during the book, she wears her mark of shame with pride. In the end, the A no longer stands for adultress, but angel. She refuses to be beaten down, and this is such a strong statement. In those days, women were expected to be meek and subservient. It is a great example of social defiance.I think that Nathaniel Hawthorne should be given a medal of honor. During his time, women were not entitled to be strong. Basically they were there to cook and have children. If they didn't have a husband, they were basically expected not to be able to do anything. But the character of Hester Prynne proves them all wrong. She manages to defy the townspeople, raise a child, and become a heroine to other women. She managed to accomplish all of this all on her own. It is a wonderful portrayal of a woman's spirit.For a book written in the 1800's, it is actually quite easy for a teenager in the twenty-first century to read and relate to, especially for a girl. Most girls like romances, and a strong female character. It is an outstanding piece of work that is sure to be around for years to come."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I trudged through this wordy book, like many others, in high school. I previously thought the coolest part was that a married woman had had an affair with a priest. This time around, however, I actually got sucked into the book itself, not into what had happened before.Yes, this book is extremely descriptive, but it isn't a book of what happened, but why it happened. Instead of having the reader determine or deduce the motives and minds of the characters, Hawthorne comes out and tells you. That's what makes it so timeless. Had he not written it with such density, I don't think it would be what it is today simply because times, customs, and opinions have changed so much. For many people, I think Dimmesdale's (somewhat hypocritical) pious behavior would have just been dismissed as simple cowardice.However, I'm not trying to say that the events of the story are those that only fit into past culture, many of these things happen today, but the treatment is different; it's much more open. For me, even knowing the ending of the story, I almost couldn't bring myself to read the rest because I felt transported into the mindset of the characters. I didn't feel the need to interpret, just observe."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Hester Prynne and much of the framework of the story is modeled on Anne Hutchinson who in 1638 was imprisoned and then banished from Boston for being Antinomian, (anti-law), her belief being that love and personal religious experience were greater than the elderly Puritan authority. Hawthorne describes the rosebush by the prison door as springing up under the footsteps of the sainted Ann Hutchinson. Hester and Anne have several parallels, the dignified manner of facing their trials, rumors that each had a child by the devil, strong relationship and betrayal by a well respected Puritan clergyman, defiance of Puritan elders, punishments of prison and banishment, and both were advisors to other women. Hawthorne takes the A of Antinomian and makes it the A of adultrey because he wants to shine a brilliant spotlight on the workings of the human heart in the course of the narrative.Witchcraft plays a role in the Scarlet Letter. John Hathorne an ancestor of the author was one of the judges at the infamous Salem witch trials where most of the condemned and executed were women. Govenor Bellingham's sister Mistress Hibbins, an historical figure later hanged for witchcraft, believes herself to be a witch in this novel. Many believe Hester's child Pearl to be fathered by the devil and that Hester's A glows red in the dark. Hester tells Pearl she met the blackman in the forest once and that the A is his mark. Chillingworth ,Hesters elderly husband, practices alchemy or something close to it and his heart is darkened the most of the players in this tale. As Dimmesdale stands on the scaffold at night he sees a display of lights in the sky and it looks to him like a giant A marked out in lines of dull red light for his adultrey.Dimmesdale cares more for his ambition than for Hester and Pearl. The Puritans think him saintly and the truth gnaws away at him and weakens him. Hawthorne tells us at one point to \\"Be True Be True\\" meaning genuine, real, to show and be yourself warts and all.As in Hester's great art with her needle Hawthorne has crafted great art with this masterpiece.Some have confused the heralds description of what was on the tombstone thinking the words were on the stone. Only the red A on a black background is on the stone. The Heralds description is \\"On a field, sable, the letter A, gules\\". Gules is a heraldic word that also has a root meaning flowers, so a rendering of this in plain english would be: On a background, black, the letter A, blooms red."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I loved this book, the structure of it, the characterization, etc, etc! It contains so much symbols, conflicts and all kinds of literary terms you can think of that it's the best book for the introduction to serious literature. It's the foundation to other American novels as Hawthorne paves the way of how a book should be written- with passion and interest.I just find Arthur Dimmesdale so fascinating while some people might disagree with me. It is his mind that intrigued me to evaluate him and as my subject for my paper.This is definitely an American masterpiece by Nathaniel Hawthorne. I wish that this classic book would be more highly appreciated. Just don't see the movie!

Often when I discuss comparative literature, I tend to use the example of Charlse Dickens's &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, for in Dickens's famous novel, there are about five hundred pages of mere background information. And so, we have the style of Nathaniel Hawthorne presented to us: he is, in essence, a lover of symbolism and all things literarily analyzed. I really got into the story when the first pyre scene happened... Now, note, when I said pyre I meant pillar, for pyres are something entirely different and generally greek/medieval... Anyway, as I was saying, Hawthorned loves literary symbolism and creativity. I love the way he ended the plot, but I think that the story line could have moved a little faster, thus giving &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; a Dickens-like quality."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book was very interesting to me and I like the time period it was set in, which made me love this book.

However, it is not a work for the simple-minded. Those who do not fully understand it fail to appreciate the precision and genius with which it was written. Hester is such a strong character; as she struggles to win back the respect of the community, she regains her self-respect, which, she realizes, is ultimately more important. Hawthorne sets Rev. Dimmesdale, a very weak character, opposite Hester perfectly. Chillingworth is, in fact, &quot;chilling,&quot; and little Pearl is a troublemaker but grows to be much like her mother. The book is a slow read but well worth the wait. It's full of symbolism -- pay close attention to the rose bush (first mentioned within the first chapter, so be alert!) and the significance of &quot;mirrors.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I've read worse. But it takes a lot of mental energy to wade through all the commas and figure out the point of each paragraph. It seems a lot longer than 240 pages.

And the introductory thing is torture."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I read this book over the summer because I had no time to go to a library or a bookstore and I had gotten to book for my birthday from my aunt back in May. I usually read ALL the time. If it's a good book, I can read it in less than 1 day. Sometimes it even takes me 1-2 hours. But this book took me 3 weeks. I couldn't believe how long it took me! Then it turns out that I have to read it this year in school. (UGH!) Please don't read this book, only if you love very old books that are very hard to understand."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book is the first of two grand contributions that Nathaniel Hawthorne made to American literature (the second being the inspiration that he provided to Herman Melville during the composition of Moby Dick.) Like all great books, this novel deals with issues which are timeless and central to the human condition. Can (or should) the state legislate morality? If so, to what degree? Which is the greater sin, a momentary weakness or a sustained and conscious deception? Which is the greater punishment, public humiliation or private guilt? And, perhaps most importantly, what is the proper response to each? The novel provides clear and compelling examples of tragic consequences which can be avoided by the simple, but sometimes difficult, act of telling the truth. The permeating sadness of the story results from the failure of each character to do so.Despite comments here to the contrary, this book is not difficult to read or understand, and it is not dull if you can grasp its themes. The ideas expressed are intricate and symbolism is pervasive throughout the story. However, any reader who really wants to understand and enjoy the book should not have great difficulty in doing so. To those readers who feel challenged to appreciate this book, Hawthorne himself offers you a thought (on page 18 of my edition) which you should seriously consider --&quot;It contributes greatly towards a man's moral and intellectual health to be brought into habits of companionship with individuals unlike himself, who care little for his pursuits, and whose sphere and abilities he must go out of himself to appreciate.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter was an great book in that it kept me reading.

I found that the author was too verbose in describing people, places, situations, and just the story in general.

Dimmesdale would beat himself, and stay up till the early morning hours!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I first read this book as a high school requirement, and was one of the few who actually liked it. I recently read it again in my college literature class, and I learned to appreciate it even more. I picked up so much more the second time through. The thing that just blows me away is the author's use of symbolism and the way *everything* ties together...it's genius! Another amazing thing about this book is that it represents three different time periods: the time in which it took place (1600's), the time in which it was written (1800's), and the time in which you read it (present). So in a way it spans across centuries and connects to so many different generations. It's truly a timeless classic. I hate to be negative or insult anyone, but any person that hated this book is probably just an ignorant high school student who doesn't appreciate depth in a novel, and doesn't know a true masterpiece when they see one. This is also a great book for people who love American history (such as myself). It sheds a lot of light on the Puritan times."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This is from a student's point of view. I'm not a 'reader' type, so this book, for me, was awful. I can see how people might like it, the storyline is great, all the themes and everything, but the thing about this book that turned it down for me was Hawthorne's style. Coming from a time where authors get paid by the word, lets just say, it takes him AGES to get his point across."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I want to start by giving some background information on me... I am a straight &quot;A&quot; student and I love to read, but one of, no wait, THE worst book I have ever read would have to be The Scarlet Letter. It has been more than I year since I read this book, but the suffering is still fresh in my mind. I don't want to sound like I didn't like it because I was forced to read it in English class(which I was), because many of the other pieces of literature that I have been assigned to read I have enjoyed.This is not the case with The Scarlet Letter, however. I DID &quot;get&quot; this book, in that I understood it, but there was a lack of an interesting plot and characters for whom you could care. The Scarlet Letter was filled with unnecessary language, which, even for me, was overwhelming at times.Another thing about this book that I dislike is its ability to tire and put to sleep. Many times while I was reading this did my eyes get tired and eventually shut, and I awoke later having to re-read some of the text. I tried a lot of things to keep this from happening, such as blasting my stereo, getting caffiene, etc. none of that seemed to work.All I can say is that when I was finally finished with this mind-numbing novel, I was relieved of a great pain in my neck.

There is nosuspense, little to sympathize or empathize with, and evenless to enjoy. A better writer could have told the samestory in half the number of pages. Some have labelledthis book a tragedy; they are right only in the sense thatit is tragically bad."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter has long been lauded as a \\"classic,\\" sure, but any avid reader knows that just because a novel comes bundled with this title, does not mean the story guarantees excellence. This is the case with Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, a mundane, tedious read that stretches across an insufferable 250 pages. I don't see much in this novel that merits it the \\"classic\\" label; despite a small collection of praiseworthy subtleties in language, insufficiently engaging characters, plotlines, and writing styles turn this book into an undesirable story.Beginning with a needlessly long, unnecessarily convoluted introduction, The Scarlet Letter immediately discourages hopeful readers searching for an excellent read. Most of the introduction is superfluous, as are most of the words in Hawthorne's sentences. Not only is the beginning impossibly lengthy, it is also annoyingly uninteresting. I am not exaggerating when I say the introduction is completely uneventful; instead of beginning with an engaging prologue, Hawthorne chooses, for some reason, to bore his readers with a thirty-page explanation that readers just beginning to read the book will have no reason to continue on with. By starting out with such a dull preface, Hawthorne immediately cuts his audience in half. I'm sure that most people who pick up the book for fun quickly put it back after reading the first few pages of pretentious yet trivial garble. Hawthorne's droning on about nonsense that few people can understand, and even fewer can sympathize with, sets The Scarlet Letter off to a terrible start.Even worse, as the book picks up pace and moves on towards the main plot, there seem to be few signs of improvement in the narrator's mundane droning. You would think that the characters, including a vengeful, mad doctor, an audacious, rebellious Puritan outcast (who is, by the way, a female), and a seemingly saintly minister who safeguards a horrid sin, would greatly contribute to the excitement of the story. Unfortunately, these characters remain, for the most part, distant from the reader. They are developed fairly well; it's just that a typical reader in the current era can't find much in common with a Puritan minister, doctor, or outcast. This absence of engaging characters detracts significantly from the entire novel, keeping the reader from fully absorbing the story.To be fair, quite a few chapters are intriguing, and Hawthorne does write several noteworthy excerpts in his otherwise flat novel. His style is highly sophisticated, which is most likely the reason many people find the book boring. Filled with hidden symbols, allegories, and themes, The Scarlet Letter is not a simple book for passing the time. Hawthorne's writing often drags, and ends up sounding very mediocre. The novel seems to become more riveting at trivial times, and excessively dull during parts with elevated examples of symbolism, which a typical reader will have to trudge through.If you are willing to devote time and effort to reading the novel, you will probably find it decent, or possibly even worthy of being called a \\"classic.\\" Casual readers, however, will not find this tale a good read, and will probably shy away from it after the first chapter."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"that I don't like this book. I read it in high school, when all I did (and still do) was read everything I could get my hands on. I love literature, I am even majoring in creative writing in college. I UNDERSTOOD the book, what it was trying to say, the plot, etc. I just thought it didn't do a very good job of saying what it was trying to say. It was unnecessarily vague (what is the reason behind trying to confuse somebody?), wordy, high-flown and just too big. The story could have been told more effectively as a short story, even half the length. I don't reccommend."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"the way the characters in this book speak makes it too dificult to follow along. i tried to follow along, but too boaring. also the book is mainly based on her thoughts. there is not a lot of human interaction with the main character."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The novel is the story of a woman of Colonial America, Hester Prynn, who bears an illegitimate daughter. Her community does not approve; what she has done requires trial and punishment. She suffers terrible guilt, but she treasures her child, Pearl, and keeps her secret (who is the dad?) to the end. The Scarlet Letter has a horribly overwritten and boring beginning, describing the inspiration for the book, to wit: a document found in the narrator's workplace. (A customs house in Salem, Massachusetts in the 1800s, where newly arrived ship captains must check in and pay a fee for docking their vessels.)The beginning goes on and on and on and on describing the narrator's fellow workers and circumstances and surroundings. All of which has almost no bearing on the plot. I'm guessing the author, Nathaniel Hawthorne, was putting several manuscripts together, or maybe he was just being paid by the word. Anyhow, I already knew the bare bones of the plot and kept wondering -- have I got the wrong The Scarlet Letter? When is the story going to start?Finally it begins. Here's the first scene: hapless Hester, babe in arms, is punished for her sin publicly. She has been sentenced to wear a symbol of her shame, a scarlet A for adultery. She has sewn it on the front of her dress and she stands in front of a sneering crowd of Puritans, wilting, guilty. Though ashamed, she does not weep or beg forgiveness, and she adamantly refuses to name her lover/the baby's father. By an amazing coincidence her long-lost aged doctor husband arrives at that moment! In time to see her shamed! Later when they meet face to face she won't tell him who the dad is, either. But he says he'll figure it out, and he does: it's the town's beloved minister. Dr. Prynn gives himself a new name, swears her to secrecy, and sets out to make the minister suffer.Misery commences and goes on and on for some time, as well, to the point the reader may think of abandoning the book (at least this one did). We learn of every pang of guilt and sorrow of Hester and the minister, of Hester's isolation and humiliation, of her lover's terrible guilt, of her husband's persecution of her lover, of her pretty little daughter's odd personality, which Hester attributes (possibly; it's hard to be sure) to the evil influence of her illegitimate birth. Finally the situation is resolved in a scene so well-written and captivating it seems hardly possible that the same author who wrote the rest of the book could have written it. Also it seems hardly possible that Hester could suddenly arrive at a sensible solution to everybody's problems. Also it seems hardly possible that the wussy minister, who should have confessed he was the dad at the start, is able to even think about saving himself. It is a wonder.The rest of the book is so hurried, no more than a summary of events, that I got the impression that an editor had taken Hawthorne in hand and said, \\"no more, you've written enough!\\" My sentiments exactly. If ever a book could have used some judicious cutting, The Scarlet Letter is that book. Perseverence in reading the whole long list of classics is what made me stick it out to the bitter end. I'm giving this novel 3 stars just because it's a classic, not because I think it's actually that good a read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter is a fascinating story about guilt, revenge, and the faults of the Puritan community. But even with this interesting plot, Hawthorne's verbose style with excessive detail makes the novel difficult to read quickly.The book begins as Hester Prynne is being punished for adultery by having to wear the letter \\"A\\" and being publicly embarrassed. Her strong personality is displayed as she does not break down and reveal the person she committed adultery with. Minister Dimmesdale is her lover, but is weak and scared to face his responsibilities. Roger Chillingworth, Hester Prynne's husband, returns after disappearing for years and secretly plans to destroy Dimmesdale because of his desire to avenge his injured pride.By setting the novel in a 17th century Puritan colony in New England, Miller is able to full examine the effects of guilt and sin on a person's soul under a pressured environment where religious beliefs and laws are strictly enforced. This is displayed through Dimmesdale's deteriorating health as he faces an inward battle. He fears the condemnation of the townspeople, but at the same time, feel obligated to take care of Hester Prynne and their child.The plethora of symbols and allusions in the story add to its profoundness.Hawthorne has a verbose and formal style, as shown through his diction and syntax. He uses antiquated words, even in the dialogues between Hester Prynne and Pearl, her young child. The lengthiness of the novel is due to excess of detail given.The Scarlet Letter has an intriguing plot that makes us reflect on our ethics and teaches us about revenge and guilt, but Hawthorne's proper diction and lengthy descriptions prevent readers from reading it continuously in one sitting."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I am truly amazed at how one novel can stir up so many emotions from its readers. Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter emphasizes the cruelty that people are capable of treating against others. He also demonstrates the toll that guilt has on people, restricting themselves from performing daily tasks in fear that they have to acknowledge their wrongdoings.Although I am very intrigued and captivated by the plot of the story, I found his writing style to be too descriptive and elongated for my liking. An important scenario that happens within fifty pages could be cut down to ten, but he tends to describe about every single detail possible, which irked me at times. Hawthorne's focus on such minute details may appeal to other readers, but it certainly did not have a positive effect on me.On the contrary, I applaud his utilization of allusions to the bible throughout the book. By encompassing the biblical allusions, he heightens the effects of certain actions such as Little Pearl's repetitive questionings towards her mother. The reader begins to fear Pearl, although she is only a child, because of her close resemblance to the devil. These allusions also enhance Hawthorne's development of the characters. Hawthorne really did do a thorough job of exposing the strengths and weaknesses of his characters to relate to his audience. Because the readers are aware of how a certain character acts, they are capable of recognizing the significance for Hawthorne to portray the character in a different light.Although the readers may have to put up with the extensiveness of the novel, I recommend this novel to anyone that is willing to take the extra time and effort to fully understand Hawthorne's themes, which are cleverly entwined within the novel; it is futile to toil through the lengthened plot without delving deeper into the text to comprehend its meaning. Reading the book the first time, I honestly believed that it was a decent novel despite the many complaints and criticisms that others gave me; but after I analyzed the novel myself for some considerable time, I almost considered it a classic tale of all time, with its many symbols, themes, and other literary elements that were hidden among the text that all lead to the Hawthorne's ingenuity at the very end, if I had not been reminded of his unnecessary tedious style. This should not hinder anyone from picking up the novel and reading it though because, in actuality, it really is an amazing piece."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The book was really good if you like to read of old times and how the &quot;ways&quot; were back then. The whole Puritan way of thinking is just different and kind of intriguing.

Sure, high school students who are forced to read it &quot;understand&quot; it superficially, but the material hits home once you have matured and experienced some of the themes brought up in the novel. I liked it in high school, but as an adult, it resonates much more. I just reread the book after having not looked at it for over 10 years. The beginning does drag a bit, but the superb chapters near the end when Dimmsdale meets Hester in the forest after having not seen her or Pearl for 7 years make it all worthwhile. Even the writing becomes more vivid. During one great scene, Dimmsdale is allowed a moment of realization when he says to Hester than Chillingsworth's sin is much blacker than his own because it was done with malice. Dimmsdale realizes that his soul is not the blackest of all and to me, this gives him some level of redemption, at least on a personal level. The last 8 chapters or so are spellbinding as they bring up themes of sin, lust, and love against the horrifying behavior of the evil &quot;physician&quot; Chillingsworth. If you are forced to read this in high school, try to get past the sometimes opaque writing and give it a chance."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book has a nice plot, but it just isn't exciting. It's not riveting enough, maybe because it was written in the 19th century. Things that are exciting more than a 100 years ago just don't seem all that interesting to me. It's hard to read because most of the book is composed of metaphors and other examples of figurative language. If you had to read it, I'd say give yourself at least three weeks."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book really expresses any feelings of shame that I may have ever had, but I still cheer on its hero and heroine."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"In Nathaniel Hawthorne's tale of seduction, betrayal, adultery, and the consequences following these turn of events, Hester Prynne, the heroine that succumbs to her passions and in doing so reaps the punishments of her &quot;sins&quot;, finds herself trapped in a lonely Puritain colony whose inhabitants hold only disdain, pity, and disapproval toward her. As a demonstration of her will and furvor, she sews and wears a scarlet &quot;A&quot; which stands for &quot;adultery&quot;. Perhaps this &quot;A&quot; also stood as a reminder to the man who also committed these &quot;sins&quot; with her, the &quot;pure and religious&quot; Reverend Dimmesdale. Hester's unforgiving and avenging husband, Chillingsworth, soon finds that his unfaithful wife has borne a daughter from her &quot;sin&quot;, a child she calls &quot;Pearl&quot;. This even moreso enrages him, and causes him to seek out her lover. In life, our actions may not be condoned by society and there are certainly consequences to everything we do. Just as Hester Prynne wore her scarlet letter &quot;A&quot; on her breast so do we in our everyday lives (though of course our letters aren't tangibly displayed as was hers). The Scarlet Letter is a book with many lessons to teach. I read this book first when I was in fifth grade, a second time in high school, and now I own a copy. It shows us that not everyone is perfect, even the Puritains had their faults, and that if we truly love one another, we can look beyond these faults."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I thought this was a great book, years ago, and it still is, but I think it is outdarted for those living today and this modern world.

From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I think that The &quot;Scarlet Lettter&quot; is a very well written book. One of the things that I would watch out for, is the vocabulary and how it is used in the context. The vocabulary is very confusing at times. However, it can lead you on to another world by wisking you off in the times where the&quot;Scarlet Letter&quot; took place. Other than that, I think this book is very good. I personally liked the characters and their roles in the story. The main character,&quot;Hester Prynne&quot;, is written very carefully and it shows how she struggles to go on with her life. That is the only thing I can say about this book. You have to read the rest to find out what happens....."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book was very good i had to read it for school I didn't really understand it the first time but each time i read it, it gets better."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"In writing the Scarlet Letter, Hawthorne brought up a few good points. For example, there were many instances in which he describes the suffering of secret sin through the eyes of Arthur Dimmesdale, Hester's child's father. As Hester grows stronger throughout the novel as a result of her repentance, Dimmesdale, the man with whom she cheated, grows weaker and weaker until he finally gives in at the end of the story. To reach these fine conclusions from the book, however, one must stay completely focused and search long and hard for the evidence. Buried beneath Hawthorne's dull insignificant speeches on content that literally has nothing to do with the story, one may be able to find a moral. In saying this, I am referring of course to the 54 page introduction that is almost totally irrelevant to the entire story. He describes everyone that works in the custom house with him and what they wear and eat and do in their spare time, and then in the last 4 or so pages, he talks about the importance of the scarlet letter. What a waste of paper! With all of the trees that he killed writing his intro, you would think that it would actually serve a purpose. Overall, my opinion on the novel is that it could be summed up in about 3-5 sentences, although Hawthorne drones on for about 250 pages of frequent symbolism and aristocratic dialogue. If you really want to read a story about the shame and suffering of secret sin, then I highly recommend reading &quot;The Minister's Black Veil&quot;, also by Hawthorne. This is a much shorter story with a lot more meaning and fewer words. It basically sums up all that he really wished to say in the Scarlet Letter in a different plot and setting."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I read this &quot;Classic&quot; novel for a class, and must admit I was thoroughly disappointed. Hawthorne should have stuck to writing non-fictional books about the Puritan settlers. This book was a pill. There are so many American authors, and novels that could be taught in schools that could far exceed the entertainment level of this out of date story. Two thumbs down."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I am not one who enjoys romance, however Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter is truely an unshakable landmark in American Literature. Unlike most people, I read this novel in college (I don't know why junior high teaches this book; it's way to advanced for that intensity of reading) and depicted it as a soap opera in Puritan society. The novel inhibits sex, suspense, drama, and romance all in one pakage. I found the invidious Roger Chillingwoth to be an extremely interesting aspect about the novel's well-rounded plot. The theme of the novel is sin, and how tragically easy it could destroy a normal town denizen. I mean, all 3 main characters are virtually consumed and eventually destroyed by their own private sins. Read this book; by doing so, one will appreciate truly powerful literature that still shakes our foundation today."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"It was a great buy and would buy again if I get the chance to buy again from this seller."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"bought for a sibling as a course requirement. she read the required chapters for class, but I found her reading the entire thing. when I read it remember enjoying the great story.

Throughout the novel, only 3 major events occur: one in the beginning, one in the middle, and one at the end. The characters are flat and difficult to relate to. Overall the book was decent at best and could have been completed in no more than 50 pages or so. Hawthorne's writing is totally ridiculous. He goes on and on stating irrelevant details and fills page after page with unnecessary imagery. These pages consist of long paragraphs, some which encompass multiple pages. If I didn't have to read this for class I definitely would not have read it on my own. I'm not saying that it is a difficult novel, but it is an unpleasant one.

The use of diction and the author's attidude toward the character's and their behaviors make the novel appeal to a more variety of audiences.

Maybe if a couple of generations completey ignore it, it will cease to be a so-called classic. First of all, it is written in pretty difficult language. That is all fine and good if the book is worth the effort, but this one definitely is not. The author has no knowledge of subtlety and his message is both wrong, I believe, and poorly conveyed. The second star is given only because his use of language is sometimes impressive, but I would sooner read a taudry romance novel than re-read The Scarlet Letter."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"A moving and biting indictment of hypocrisy that is still relevant today"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Either you love it or hate it. As for me, I loved it! Admittedly, I can understand how many people find this antiquated novel difficult to comprehend. The lengthy descriptive narratives can be taxing on our twentieth-century fast-food attention span. However, if this classic work of literature could somehow be miraculously re-written for modern readers in our contemporary vernacular, most readers would then be able to appreciate its captivating and compelling themes, all of which are relevant to our lives today: women's rights, religious bigotry and hypocrisy, vindictiveness against a perceived injustice, and the eternal quest for self-realization. Wow ... just imagine how thought-provoking this novel must have been in the era in which it was written. This makes it all the more outstanding! Truly an undeniable masterpiece!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"It's been almost a year since I've read _The Scarlet Letter_, so my memory of it isn't entirely intact (yeah, a year isn't _that_ long, but for my brain, it is :)). All I remember thinking was how disappointed I was from about the middle to the end. The book started out with excellent twists and turns, and I would constantly wonder about what each character would do, and where the book was going to go. Then, Hawthorne started dawdling and blabbing to an unnecessary extent. The book became boring. I was really disappointed, but _The Scarlet Letter_ is a worthwhile read just for the very human qualities of the characters."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I can't agree with people complaining that Hawthorne uses a difficult language. I am not english-speaking and yet I found it pretty easy to understand and follow. (By the way: at what age does the average American boy master his mother tongue and when is he able to read anything that comes within his reach without the support of a dictionary? it seemes impossible to me that a 16-year-old can't read a book written in the 19th century!! Come on, Hawthorne is no Chaucer!) On the whole, The Scarlet Letter is not my favourite book, but it is well written and well structured. Let us give it its due."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I have read some of the reviews pertaining to this, the first great novel written in our country, and was not surprised. This novel is typically read in high school,in grade ten. At that age who can appreciate Hawthorne's poignant prose, and insightful observations into a woman's heart; for he warns that the most wretched man is the one who&quot;procures the hand of a woman, and fails to procure the uttermost passion of her heart&quot;. A sixteen year old can not even begin to fathom what that entails. I recommend to those who have given this book poor reviews, to wait a few years and then reread this amazing novel which is an insightful journey into the one region that is worth exploring: a woman's heart! Also, the way females were mitreated at the dawn of our great country's rise to equality is a lesson worth pondering."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"If this book is so great, then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars? Should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone? To the best of my knowledge, only erudites and scholars enjoy this book. A good book, but one with a limited audience. Don't read it unless you don't mind wading waste deep through overly long sentences, antiquicated words and flowery prose. Personally I like an author who gets to the point."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Perhaps this is not exactly a review of Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter; rather, it is a commentary on the Amazon.com reviews I've read on this book.

Cherish this book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Hawthorne's theme of secret sin and the fault of all humans is once again present in this novel. A woman, Hester Prynne, has committed adultery, with a priest nonetheless. She is made to wear this shame, by having a scarlet letter sewn on to her clothing. She is shunned by all of her townspeople as they see the scarlet letter on her breast. The townspeople however, do not know the sin was committed with their new minister, Arthur Dimmesdale. Dimmesdale allows her to bear this burden alone. Hester's husband is believed to be dead, but he comes back as a doctor for the priest with the name of Roger Chillingworth. A chilling feeling is just what he inflicts upon people. He has a knowledge of natural medicines, and becomes the doctor for the priest, only so he can seek his revenge. The priest suffers from heart troubles, a burden of the hidden sin, and is on the verge of death. He goes and sees his and Hester's daughter Pearl, a sprite like girl, and promises to sail away with her and Hester. The ending is unexpected and sudden but also appropriate. The burden of secret sin, and the purging that comes from exposing this sin reigns throughout the novel. Beautifully written and wonderfully conceived, this novel is a timeless classic that will remain for years to come."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Haven't finished the book, but love it.

His use of symbolism is amazing and the plot is pretty good too. However, I must say the book is way too long and very difficult to read. Only read it if you are forced to for school. If you have to read it, try your best to appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Hawthorne's best work is central to understanding the trajectory of american culture from the Puritans to the moderns. Still, many of the book's allusions will be cryptic to contemporary readers. The footnotes and appendices make the book more available without all the weight of the Norton edition."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book was written in the 19th century to make a point about the 19th century. To do so, however, it caricatures the 17th-century Puritans pretty badly, a people who were generally cheerful, generous, and deeply suspicious of legalism. They even wore colorful clothing.I encourage you to read The Scarlet Letter as a classic novel that speaks to a number of universal human themes, just don't expect it to be historically accurate."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"In The Scarlet Letter, Nathaniel Hawthorne tells a story of the results of sin. Set in Seventeenth Century Massachusetts, it is a tale of the life of Hester Prynne, who has been convicted of adultery. She is sentenced to wear a scarlet letter \\"A\\" on her chest, as a badge of dishonor. We follow her decisions to keep her lover secret, and how this bears down on her over time. We watch as her child (Pearl) resultant of the act grows into a wild daughter, unrestrained by her mother (who feels guilt from her sin, and who also questions the established morals of the society she lives in). All the while, her aged, learned husband comes closer and closer to discovering the identity of the man who took part in the adultery.Hawthorne describes all this with unique detail. Nearly every object -- whether it be a rose at a prison door, or a river in the woods -- contributes some symbolism to the plot. The language of the narrative is very fitting, and the dialogue is delightfully written in the correct form of the day. With small supporting details woven in (such as the few brief but important appearances of a witch named Mistress Hibbins) and the deep symbolism, The Scarlet Letter has an almost supernatural tone, while it still remains a perfectly realistic novel.Many consider The Scarlet Letter to be Nathaniel Hawthorne's crowning achievement. It has certainly stood the test of time, being a classic that is now over 150 years old, and still very well known. For anyone who enjoys this style of literature, this book is one to read.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I'm a high school student who had to read this book for school. Yes, it is hard to read sometimes because of the outdated language and sometimes difficult to understand writing style. But if you read a book that is easy to understand and always entertaining, then you are probably not learning anything. This book is a classic that everyone should be exposed to, and hopefully learn to appreciate.I stumbled over parts of this book, but in the end, I got a better appreciation of Early American Puritan life. I also really enjoyed watching the movie of the Scarlet Letter."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I read this book as an assignment for my American Literature class. Outside of school, I would never read in this genre, but for not being my style, it was actually very interesting. The reading moves slowly, more because of the lack of dialogue and action, and the long spiels of description and analytical discussion, than difficult wording. It offers a deep insight into how the human mind can so torture the body if the soul is afflicted, and how bottled-up sin and lust for revenge can destroy a person. If you're interested in what makes the human mind tick, then I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"literature.

This is a testament to its originality and complexity. But do not be intimidated by this. This novel tells a story which everyone should be able to comprehend if time is given. Hawthorne clouds this novel with so many minor details and facts, but in between all of this lies a plot and message that is worth the read. If you are reading this for high school, I recommend you buy the cliff notes also, but ONLY TO READ ALONG WITH THE NOVEL FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING!!! This is an extremely hard book to read without guidance, so if your looking at this novel for recreational purpose, it is best that you are someone who loves to read and analyze whenever possible. I give this novel a 3.5"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I really enjoyed reading the Scarlet Letter for the second time since highschool this year. Though it was heavily laced with symbolism, the fact that Hester Prynne showed strength and dignity throughout in a situation that is still relevant today makes this one of my favorite books. I did not like Dimmesdale at all. He was almost weaker than you would think humanly possible, but I suppose that was Hawthorne trying to make a point. I thought it was overall a book that everyone should read due to its messages about standing up for what you believe in, self love, strength, determination and confidence. Hester is a rolemodel for all women because even though she had a man with no backbone, she made the decision to stand by him and not give him away and she never compromised herself. She even regained the respect of her fellow townspeople by turning the A she wore from a negative to a positive when she became an entreprenuer, which was unheard of in those days. She was the sole source of income and support for her daughter Pearl. Rev. Dimmesdale by the way should remain an examole of what not to do for a man in his situation. Although a little corny at times, it should stay on the list of books to be read by students of all ages. There is much to gain from it on many levels."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne does an excellent job at depicting a huge 'American' characteristic; the public punishment for private transgression. Clinton was scrutinized for his private, adulterous act in the oval room, but it was Hawthorne that wrote about this public punishment through the character, Hester Prynne. Written in the nineteenth century, about the Puritans in the seventeenth century, in Boston, Massachussetts, Hawthorne sets up the cruel punishment that Hester sufferred for her adultery. Having to wear a bright, red letter 'A' on her breast at all times, being forced to move to the outskirts of town, and being treated as a whore, Hester suffered for the love that she found in the pastor, Dimmesdale. Their love did not comply with the Puritan communal laws, nor by the laws of God, in turn resulting in the scrutinization of Hester and her daughter, Pearl. Discretion and true love are not rewarded in this story, although the love was more lively, brighter, and real, in comparison to the bland, monotonous marraiges of the Puritans. If one is in the mood for long, elaborated, descriptions of plot detail, in lue of the timeless themes, then this is the novel for you."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This was a very good book. It started out about a Women names Hester Prynne who committed adultery. Her community and all who judged her made her wear the letter &quot;A&quot; on her chest to signify what she has done. Hester had been having an affair with her priest, Aurther Dimmesdale. Se was made to stand on a scaffold in the middle of town. Although it was supposed to be an embarrassing thing to have to do, she did not act ashamed at all. Pearl has a daughter named Pearl whom her husband finds out later that it is not his child but it is Aurthor Dimmesdale's. At the begining of this book it got a little confusing but once it started to pick up the pace it all fell into place. This book was set in Salem, Massachusetts, also where Howthorne was born and grew up with his puritan traditions."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"For American Literature we were assigned to read this book. When I first started reading it, I really had trouble because of the wording. But then I really got into it. Besides the wording, this book is great. There are so many things you can learn from this book. It will have you asking questions about the society back then, and even about our society today. If you ever get a chance to read this book, I would strongly suggest it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"While I was less than impressed with The Scarlet Letter when I read it in high school I LOVED it this time around. Hawthorne's rich use of language adds to what is already an intensely compelling story. Hester Prynne is a standout among a throng of submissive Puritan women and one of the most interesting heroines in literature. She steadfastly stands up for herself and her child's well-being amidst a storm of controversy surrounding her actions. Symbolically and literally, this is a beautiful novel that explores the inner workings of the human heart and various facets of forgiveness, guilt, passion, pride, self-worth, and the standards by which we judge those around us."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I first heard of the classic novel &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; when I was in fifth grade. My mom told me a brief description of the story, and her thoughts on the book made me want to read it. I finally got the chance to read it this year, and I was greatly disappointed. The novel failed to hold my interest at any point in the story. I could only read so many pages at one time as I found my thoughts wandering away from the story of Hester Prynne, her young daughter Pearl, and the affair that she had with one of the ministers in Boston. The vocabulary was quite advanced and often hard to comprehend. The lengthy descriptions of Hester's agony over this great sin she has committed were quite repetitive. When Nathaniel Hawthorne adds the complicated vocabulary to the descriptions of Hester that go on page after page, it creates frustration and a sense of hopelessness for the reader. Most of the time, I knew what Hester was thinking or what she was going to say before she thought it or said it. Even through all of the tedious descriptions, it was hard for me to identify with Hester Prynne since I have never been in her type of situation before. The only aspect of the novel that I really understood was the Puritan way of life. Hawthorne's description of the way that the Puritans lived was quite accurate. The Puritans were a very religious society based on high morals and respect. Once one did something to shame those morals, they were ultimately shunned from society. This aspect of Puritan society was one of the only points that was well illustrated by Hawthorne. Overall, the book was lifeless. I would recommend this book only to someone who has a large amount of both patience and time."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I would not inflict this story upon my worst enemy"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Hawthorne's dull prose really gets to you after a while. The book is filled with antiquated language, and is basically an account of a Puritan woman who suffers because of her adultery. I was forced to read this book for my English class, and it was a terrible waste of time. Hawthorne hits you in the face with run on sentences that take up the entire page. I do have one good thing to say about this book however, for all you insomniacs out there, read it! It induces sleep in minutes! ZzZzZzZzZzZz....."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Getting through this book was quite a task. The wording and the pace make it a bit hard to follow. However, once you read deep into the plot, the web of characters and their relationships draw you in. This book is set in Colonial New England in the 1600s. Hester Prynne, protagonist, has been condemned to wear a scarlet letter (...) to remind the public of her sin of adultery. Reverend Dimmesdale, a public hero, struggles with guilt and personal hypocrisy. Roger Chillingworth is seen as the antagonist, consumed with hatred and revenge. These three characters make up a very intriguing story line that touches on controversial issues such as sin, lust, adultery, and primal human nature. This book can be easily compared to Kate Chopin's, The Awakening. Both deal with the repression of women and one woman's struggle to rebel against society. Each character attempts to broaden the closed minded views of their time and set the bar for women in the future. Although it was a tough read, I would recommend this book for its ability to relate to common issues."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I stongly dislike this book.

I would never put another person through the torture of reading this long-winded dull attempt at a scandalous and exciting romance. Even though there is much symbolism to be found, when is one supposed to find it, while they are sleeping? Another factor of my displeasure with this book is that I love to read and now hesitate to pick up another Hawthorne piece. How did this book become a &quot;CLASSIC&quot;?"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This work by Hawthorne, whose subject matter is always really boring anyway, is as dry and frigid as a desert. Horrible, horrible, horrible. I started with great optimism, for I had been curious about it for ages, and if it weren't for the paper I had to write about it, I would have stopped reading it in page twenty-five. By the end I was screaming thanks to the forces of the universe. Not only is the book periphrastic and dull; it completely drains the reader's energy and sanity. One just cannot relate to the characters--so imitative and spurious; besides, the story line is EXHAUSTINGLY and OBVIOUSLY outdated!!! I hated Hester. I cannot comprehend the concept going through some individuals' minds when they call her one of the most moving characters in American literature. WHATEVER!!!!!! And Dimmesdale's character was despicable, absurd, and ordinary. If you've read about the tremendous psychological impact of the novel, you have been deceived! You won't find any psychological force.

If it wouldn't have been for the help of my English teacher I never would have understood this novel, but from what I did gather it had a great story and wonderful moral.

Plus, it was written by the great Nathaniel Hawhthorne!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Some people immediately dismiss the worth of this book by criticizing its seemingly clich&eacute; plot, centered around adultery and the guilt which follows. I say, Hawthorne's novel is not revolutionary or amazing in its subject, setting, or even characters, but rather in the way in which it unfolds. The story delves remarkably into the souls of several individuals in a New England Puritan town, gradually and ephemerally casting beams of soft light on new aspects of everyones personalities and struggles. Each character is masterfully and magically revealed, and the tale strives for intimacy and understanding of each point of view in a complex circle of deceit and secrecy. I think everyone who appreciates detailed and beautiful analysis of character, sentiment, thought, and human nature will enjoy it, but may not be ideal for those seeking constant action."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Everyone needs to read this classic.

The STORY was good...I am sure you have an idea about it so I won't waste time with a summary. The SETTING was great...Hawthorne brought 17th Century frontier Boston alive with his stunning descriptions. The CHARACTERS were ok...yes, only ok, because I never found myself loving or hating any of them, which to me is evidence that the author was successful with his creation. But...The SYMBOLISM is what makes this book, what makes it a classic!...This book is a brilliant essay on how important it is to abide by a conscience. One mishap can lead you down a path towards destruction. BUT aiding in that destruction were Christians who were more unforgiving then the heathen around them...The christian who reads this book should learn that forgiveness was the #1 thing Christ taught and expects from us! (i.e. He who is merciful shall obtain mercy). BUT what I learned most from this book was how important it is to understand Gods grace! God is not some powerful ogre waiting to punish but a friend waiting to forgive. If this frontier town only could have known this how different their experience would have been!However, I think this book was cheated because I read it right after the stunning 'Grapes of Wrath' and it simply could not compare, overall, and therefore can not receive the elite five star status! Still a must read if you have never...!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Any Hawthorne work, including this one, shows why the author remains one of the most celebrated in American literature. As to subject matter, kids are more receptive to the likes of &quot;The House of the Seven Gables.&quot; Perhaps adults would be too if they hadn't been forcefed &quot;The Scarlet Letter,&quot; complete with the Customs House filler, in high school. Lest the reader find this teacher cynical, note the five stars. (I also have a dog named Hawthorne and had another named Prynne.)"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter shows us the meaning of human nature.People know that utopias never work but no one tells us why the ideology doesn't work. In the Scarlet Letter, the books based its views about the general citizens of the town, who believe in perfection of the human kind through religion, the ideology of the citizens of Boston, presented as hypocrites of harsh judgment that believes that a jail and public scaffold inside the infrastructure of Boston is necessary for the utopia to thrive. However, when someone, like Hester Prynne, was found committed adultery inside the town Boston, everyone rushed judgment that she sinned and immediately punished her for her crimes against nature, as the townspeople call it. Hester's sins are small, compared to how the townspeople perceive her since they find out she has committed adultery and how the people who knew what happened, hid it from the townspeople. She did not hide from the humiliation, but she continue to co-exist with the people who knew what she had done and hate her for it and thrive in their environment with her daughter, Pearl who has no real father to her name.This alone shows how this town would never achieve the goals that the citizens wanted, being a perfect society, since the purpose of the puritans living in the town is to be free to practice their own religion. However, how could someone be free of practicing their own faith if the very nature of the human beings is being oppressed and then released out of anger towards someone else that is able to show what they believe in? The Scarlet Letter is proof that even if a person is oppressed, he or she could still improve his or her current situation and do what he or she wants without limits and still be true to his or herself in the meantime.Overall, this book is full of ironic outcomes, but that is what is good in a novel. Of course, there are a lot more to this book than what I mention here, like the symbolism that is present in most parts of the book and the historical significance of the early history of the Americas and Hawthorne's background, but that is not as important as finding the meaning of human nature in a town that is full of hope, as well as hypocrisy combined in the life of a utopian society."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I am an avid reader, specially of books in the English language. The movie &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; has been a favorite of mine, but reading other reviews of the novel (other editions) here in Amazon, prompted me to read it. People kept saying they were dissapointed with the movie and vice versa; people kept saying they could not deal with Hawthorne's 19th century language. But I could deal perfectly with the idiom, even though it's not my first language. Both the movie and the novel are excellent, although different."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Passion, greed, lust and denial are all the ingredients that make The Scarlet Letter a novel that caused much controversy back the days where women would not even think about having committed adultry, but Hester Prynne did. In the Scarlet Letter, passion justifies nothing, while its denial that justifies all. The reason why I rated The Scarlet Letter so highly was because it was very rare that a book so racy in its content would be written in the eighteen hundreds and still be good. The reason why this book was so intriguing was because there was a psychological approach to destruct; dealing with the controversy that surrounds The Scarlet Letter that I found really refreshing and more interesting because its always better to read about a person loosing their mind rather than mere violence such as fighting. I recommend this book to people who like to read about deception and mind games to destroy the guilty."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I will recommend that if you read this book, to not skip the introductory, it's crucial. (I did and I had to start over when I was almost finished.)To sum up the introductory: it's long and talks about the nameless narrator and how the story started. The narrator finds some documents in the unoccupied second floor of the building he works at. After going through the documents he finds a large scarlet \\"A\\" with beautiful embroidery wrapped around some manuscripts, which he later rewrites. He soon discovers that the manuscripts were 100 years old and written 100 years before he found them.If you are seeking for a book with more meanings then one and a harder vocabulary you might have found the book for you. The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is aimed for an audience with a higher vocabulary and a good understanding of irony and symbolism. While reading this book it also might be helpful to know that motifs are recurring structures, contrasts, or literary devices that can help develop and inform the text's major themes; because they are throughout the story and occur from the beginning. This book would be good for either male or female of an age that can do well in a 12.0 accelerated reader book. Just remember that is a 24-chapter book with a long introduction.I had a hard time enjoying this book because I didn't read the introductory and had to start over. I also wasn't prepared for the vocabulary and all of the symbolism. Another thing I didn't understand was that there was more meaning to the book then just the words. If anyone asked me I would give it a 3 on a scale of 1-5. It's not that The Scarlet Letter was a bad book, because it is very well written, but I just didn't get into it.12/18/03"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's mid-19th century novel reflects the strict Puritan Enviornment two-hundred years prior to the release of the book. What can be a tedious read at times is ultimately a redeeming piece of literature exposing the hypocrisy of the \\"godly\\" Puritan Communities.Much of the novel gives us inductive information forcing the reader to either ignore or figure out much of the background of the story for themselves. Regardless, Hester Prynne, the Protagonist, is portrayed as a strong women who has a extra-marital affair with an unknown man of the Boston Community. While raising her eerie bastard child, \\"Pearl\\", Hester refuses to compromise or openly break down for her crime. There are numerous plot twists, including a perverted love-triangle, that gives this novel it's romantic characteristics.Although there was probably hundreds of novels written during this time period that are stylistically superior to Hawthorne's masterpiece. This work has remained a mainstay as required reading because of its radical notions that women are equal and sometimes stronger than men emotionally, and deserve respect for the works they perform for society. It's a dark novel with many redeeming qualities, if you can get over the lofty-archaic English this should be an interesting read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Dis book was vedy, vedy good.

This guy (Nathaniel Hawthorne) could have competed with Marry Shelly for most long-winded of the year.

Virtually every book ever written during this period, (essentially, before Twain's Huckleberry Finn), bears the same markings - incredibly lavish diction, complex structure and syntax, and all the elements that make for a generally hard to follow novel. If you elevate your reading to that next level, where you're seeing beyond the simple plot and percieving Hawthorne's masterful use of symbolism and metaphor, and are able to appreciate probably the last great novel written in before the literary revival of the late 1800s, then you'll consider this book a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"As always, it is difficult to describe a book (or rather novella) as intricate as The Scarlet Letter. On the surface its story of adultery may appear plain, longwinded, and uninteresting, but Hawthorne never wrote primarily for the \\"mob\\" reader who only likes action and suspense.

I reccomend this book and hope that the reader will understand fully the meaning of this work of art."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The majority of reviews for Hawthorne's classic, THE SCARLET LETTER, here at Amazon.com have been negative. Many of the people writing the reviews appear not to have read much classic literature. To give them credit, I don't know why this novel is forced upon young minds and influential minds. This book is not meant for the close-minded. Having lived a life as shallow as most Americans do today, it would be hard to appreciate the genius of Hawthorne's masterpiece.THE SCARLET LETTER remains as significant today as it did when it was first published. The book, though full of symbolism, is much more than a simple morality tale. It is a tale of passion and lust, truth and lies, life and death, revenge and betrayal. The story illustrates the disasters of living an unhonest and sinfilled life. It serves as a historical text in to an age that has past away and it gave us one of the first truly feminist characters in American literature. The story remains prevalent because it speaks on so many different levels, illuminating a little of each person as they read.Therefore, do not be discouraged by the large vocabulary and do not let one's inexperience in life and literatrue dissuade you from reading one of the great pieces of American literature.As a footnote, the WSP Enriched Classic edition of the novel includes a wonderful introduction, pictures, critical excerpts, notes of Hawthorne's, and a few other extras that make this a superb copy to own."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I had to read this book for English class, and I did not enjoy it. My favorite genre is scifi-technthriller, and this clearly is not it. However, although I had to force myself to flip to the next page, when we analyzed it in class the book was amazing. Hawthorne can be considered nothing less than a pure genius in his writing. We could easily spend 30 minutes talking about a single page in our class of 17.

Otherwise, buy a Tom Clany novel."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter is a good but long and discriptive book.

In Nathaniel Hawthorne's most famous novel, we are caught in the bleak and powerfully intense world of a Puritan village. Hester Prynne and her \\"bastard\\" daughter Pearl are shunned by the rest of the village for Hester has committed adultery. Her husband, Chillington, was away in England, which was in the middle of a war or something and he was away so long that he was presumed dead. Still, in those days, a widow had to remain loyal to the memory of her husband. Also, it was not known that Chillington was dead and he could be alive. Hester fell for the Reverend Dimmesdale, the spiritual leader of the community. While Hester's sin came out, Dimmesdale could not bring himself to tell the truth. Hester suffers shame, exile and disdain and through the experience attains the forgiveness of the community. She is perhaps the first adulterous heroine in 19th century literature who does not die in the end! Instead she triumphs through her innate virtue and desire for rehabilitation. However, Dimmesdale's guilt and Chillington's inhumanity are the focus of the novel. The theme of the violation of the human heart is the real strength of the novel. Dimmesdale suffers far mroe than Hester. He is eaten up by guilt, and nightly flogs himself. He is surrounded by corrupt Puritan leaders, including the Governor and his sister who is an honest to goodness witch. Chillington uses subterfuge to shame Dimmesdale and drive him mad with guilt. Dimmesdale dies of guilt. The novel is immersed in Gothic elements and in typical Hawthorne symbolism which deal with man's struggle versus sin and good versus evil. The \\"Black Man in the Forest\\" is the Devil, Pearl is a frighteningly weird girl, a comet prophetizes death, and even ghosts figure in this novel. In many ways, it is a little like Hawthorne's short story John Goodman Brown, about a man who discovers that the spiritual leaders he once believed were good were really Devil worshippers and when they come for his pious wife he succumbs to evil. The dark world that Hawthorne describes were moralizing tales. The 19th century, with its industrial revolution, capitalism and materialism, was thought by spiritual people to be in danger of losing its soul. Charles Darwin came along and rejected the idea of Creation! Atheism was spreading, science was advancing and the world was getting bigger. Hawthorne may have been spurred to write novels like this to get the message across that being godly is important in a world that is crumbling in and out."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I did read the book in hs, so maybe that is when I bought it, but who knows.

However, once past that interminable overture, the story actually picks up a bit, though it never really takes flight, and the ending is...pat. Hawthorne's idea of the scarlet letter is much more ingenious than his execution: the seed never sprouts as high as it should."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Basically Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" centers around the heroine Hester Prynne and her adulterous affair. She refuses to reveal the name of her lover, choosing to protect the identity of their love child's father. However Hester's husband, Chillingworth, returns from overseas and hears of his wife's sins. He makes it his life's purpose to discover and destroy Hester's unnamed lover. In a twisted love triangle,Hawthorne explores how each of the characters deal with the sins they have committed and its' effect on their lives.Though I know \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is an American classic, one of the greatest novels written by an American writer, it didn't strike me as all that great. The plot is good. There were moments in the story where the book does really live but to its reputation, but there were too few. The story just drags on. If you list out what really happens in the story, the meaningful points, there really aren't that many. But somehow Hawthorne is able to stretch that into 256 pages of really hard reading. It's not hard in the sense that the vocabulary, sentence structure and what not is hard to read, but it's hard to read in the sense of getting through the story. It just wasn't enjoyable. I kept dozing off in the middle of the story, lost in all the comma splices and semicolons.Even so, at the end, despite all the boredom, Hawthorne was still able to pass on his message through Hester Prynne. I began to admire Hester's audacious courage in dealing with her situation, especially during the circumstances she lived in. She is someone I would like to be...the post-committing-adultery part. As a woman she was already at a disadvantage, a second-class citizen in her male-dominated world, furthermore as a moral sinner in the uptight Puritan society sunk her social status to the bottom of the pyramid. But instead of hiding from society, afraid to give her A the light of day, Hester glams up the A, sporting it like a badge and not the mark of sin the officials had intended. She stands her ground, staying in town to live out her punishment . With her own good deeds, the townspeople perceive her A to represent her as an able person, forgetting it once branded her as an adulterer. Hawthorne immortalizes Hester in American literature not as the living sermon for all congregations to avoid, but as a living model of endurance and grace for the rest of men to aspire to."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The book came in in great condition- brand new.

First of all, the book is packed with, like, a walnut of a story surrounded by a husk of un-understandibilityness (pardon the mixed metaphor). Like theres this rose at the beginnins, but it doesn't really mean a rose. Oh no, so much more. Like it represents flowers as a whole--red, blue, bulb planted and seed--not just roses. The words are really big--like even the word scarlet, I had to look that up in my Websters New Dictionary for ages 6 and up. For those of you with the same problem, it means &quot;a bright red color.&quot; Who new red had another name-the book is chock full of educational goodies like that. Anyway, the plot: Demi Moore has this baby, but the baby's shunned by the villagers. He never says why though but my class thinks its because Demi had an affair and the townspeople are like repressed pilgrims who like just don't get that its cool to do things like that. Things get really freaky though when the reverend Dimsdale starts whipping himself! Yeah, he goes outside and sees this shooting star and makes a wish and then whips himself cuz he knows who the kids dad is--its him!!! Anyway, Demi keeps having trouble but at the end the pilgrims move to vermont and everything turns out all right, and the book closes with this cool ring thing--but instead of a rose symbolizing beginning, it says &quot;the end&quot; symbolizing the end. Its deep. Anyway, I recommend this book to everyone and his other book--the house of seven gables--I love gables, their dappled fur, the way the sun shines off their wet, glistening hides, their speed. Although, I like can't believe they eat them in china and stuff. Anyway, see you later.Sincerly,10th grade student from Plano"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"To me this book would turn a young person, like my self away from the key and enjoyment of reading .

No action. No drama. Very predictable. It is about a woman who cheated on her husband with another man. The baby dad is the preacher. Why the couple couldn't have gotten a divorce is beyond me. And the writing is horrible. Maybe Webster would have fun with this book but not a high schooler being forced to read it. Reading this is like a punch in the testicles.. it HURT!!! This book is hell on earth. Don't read it. By the way, I had to give it one star."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I had to read this book for my advanced English class. I am in the 11th grade. It sucked REALLY bad! I mean, who would want to read a bunch of &quot;thee&quot;s and &quot;thou&quot;s. It was so confusing! After I read the first chapter about 10 times, I went to Cliff to help me out. I love that Cliff Notes book. It helps a LOT! And I suggest that if you have to read this book for school, I would go get the Cliff Notes. I really could care less about a woman who sleeps with another man while she is married (or is she?). If I wanted to hear about that kind of thing, I would turn on a soap opera. And the whole letter thing is just stupid. Like she would really care that she has to wear the letter &quot;A&quot; on her clothes. I mean, most of us could go through life with big spagetti stains on their shirts and not care at all. The book is totally irrelevant when it comes to times today. We study history to learn from others' mistakes yet today if we make the mistake of adultery, it's called DIVORCE. I would have given this book a flat out 1 star but I decided to be nice since it related to my favorite soap opera. For anyone that just feels like reading a book, I don't recommend this one. For anyone who wants to be MAJORLY confused and utterly bored to death, enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This isn't your book if your looking for adventure or swordfights or any of that sortI had to read this for my English class and my first impression was from all the other rumors about it.. \\"it's boring\\" and etc. As a result, when I began reading I held that in my mind. However as I kept reading, I discovered Hawthorne's character are so 3 dimensional in their personality and who they really are. Hawthorne does an AMAZING job of describing his characters and giving them life I couldn't help but begin to really love the bookThe only problem was when I had to give my presentation on it.. Hawthorne took all my insight..hahaha"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Okay I'll admit right here and now that the first time I heard about this book was indeed for my AP English class but unlike the other degenerates out there I actually appreciated this book. It's simply amazing! Hawthorne's writing is intensely descriptive and so full of symbolism that you're pretty much drowning in it, but that doesn't make him a horrible author. In fact it's one of the things I love so much about this story.Hester's shunning from the colony is absurd by today's standards, but you can't compare Puritannical methods to today's trials and tribulations. If you are then you're a fool. Anyone with half a braincell will know the glaring differences between how we run things today and how things were viewed back then. This book seems a bit too advanced for seventeen year olds to handle only because they'd rather be watching reality tv or crappy Hollywood ''films'' to pass the time instead of entertaining their mind with a book.There's really not much I can say about the book that hasn't been gone over and over again in previous reviews: I simply wanted to address how enraged high school juniors shouldn't be the only voice that is allowed to be heard in regards to The Scarlet Letter."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I was introduced to Hawthorne rather late in life, having shunned the classics and literature during my high-school and college years as impractical and not relevant. Now almost twenty years removed high-school, I recently started reading some classics, on my own terms, to find out what I had missed.The Scarlett Letter, on its face, is about the impact that an adulterous liason has on Hester Prynne and the small Puritan community she resides. Hester, as punishment for breaking the moral code of the era, is sentenced to wear the scarlett letter A - signifying her as an adulteress. Hawthorne, through this short tale ,seems also to be making a statement about the self-righteous hypocrisy of the Puritans. While Hester is portrayed as the scourge of the community for having been caught in a moral lapse, the scarlett letter seems to endow her with the power to see the hidden transgressions of her accusers: &quot;She shuddered to believe, yet could not help believing that it gave her a sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts. She was terrorstricken by the revelations that were thus made.&quot;Although a very dark tale, allowing us a glimpse into the darkside of zealotry and revenge, I thoroughly enjoyed Hawthorne's depiction of it. His style, which I initially found to be ponderous and wordy, especially in the introductory piece The Custom House, grew on me as I progressed and at the end found myself enjoying."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book was mediocre. I think Hawthorne is a good writer, but sometimes his works are too Romantic for me. There are defiantly worse classics that I have read, but the Scarlet Letter is not among the best.The symbolism in this book is quite good, I must say. Hawthorne manages to achieve subtlety without not getting his point across. Although I thought the things his characters stand for are overwrought, he does a good job of presenting the story as an allegory.It's easy to get frustrated with Hawthorne's characters, however, (especially the Reverend Dimmesdale, whose pithy whining gets boring half-way through), and sometimes the heavy moral overtones can be a chore to wade through. The ending is not particularly brilliant and Hawthorne's characters are, for the most part, not well-rounded (although this serves a purpose).In the end, my favorite character was Chillingworth, even though he is 'evil', because at least he brings some variety to the story. One gets awfully sick of hearing endless descriptions of Hester's bravery and Dimmesdale's moral plights, so that any diversion, be it twisted or not, is welcome."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Forcing students to read novels such as this could be considered one of the primary obstacles to promoting reading as an independently pursued hobby. The story, I'll admit, was a good idea. However, the moody overromanticized method of telling it stifled what was a good idea. Hawthorne was a victim of the style of the times--not a victim of bad writing. In short, a great book to have read, but a miserable book to read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I recently purchased a copy of Modern Library's edition of Scarlet Letter. The introduction was very helpful in situating the book in its time, and also in showing how relevant it is to our world. Besides the helpful introduction, this edition has the nicest cover of all those on the shelf. Keep up the good work Modern Library!!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Few novels capture the essence of a different time like The Scarlet Letter. Yet reading this novel about strict moral rules leaves one with a difference sense about today's society. Very often a woman who has a child out of wedlock experiences severe judgments from those around her. Yet the man involved will often stay hidden and not be subject to the same sanctions. Perhaps less changes than we think.Reading this book also provides an uplifting view of the potential for goodness in how well Hester Prynne bears her shame and raises her child. You will also come away with a renewed appreciation for the strength that women often bring to tough situations. The courage to face a disapproving society with little in the way of emotional support is probably greater than the courage needed to face physical danger. You cannot help but appreciate Hester as a symbol of true courage.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the Puritan beginnings of our modern American culture."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I too was forced to read this book in my Literature class, but I do have to say that I am a bit surprised that people my age did not like and understand this book. If anyone remembers there history, they would have known that Hawthorne nailed the Puritan ways with this book, and Hawthorne being a descendent of one of the Judges in the witch trials makes this book even better to read. The way he has written it shows that he is ashamed with his ancestors' ways. This book was shorter then most I have read and simply to the point. Although it's not my usual style of reading, I do have to say it was enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1850 novel The Scarlet Letter may well be a classic, but it just didn't work for me. I'm certainly not afraid of 19th century classics - I've read Stevenson, Shelley, Stoker, Dickens, Hugo, and more, and I've enjoyed a lot of their work. The Scarlet Letter, unfortunately, is one of those classics that, for me, knowing the gist of it is more worthwhile than actually reading it.The story, as most American high school students know, is set in 1640's New England, and features Hester Prynne, a woman who is convicted of adultery and made to wear a scarlet \\"A\\" as a badge of shame.Unfortunately, the 250 page book could really have been about fifty pages and done the job. Hawthorne isn't just wordy, he's wordy while thinking about being wordy about wordiness, then he's wordy that he might not have been wordy enough. The first 50 pages, in fact, isn't even about Hester or the 17th century - it's an \\"introductory sketch\\" that amounts to a framing narrative of \\"I found these old notes in a box at work and wrote this story.\\" So, yeah, if you do read the book after reading this review, at least do yourself a favor and skip \\"The Customs House.\\" Trust me.Even once you get to Hester, the narrative, such as it is, just crawls. Or, rather, it ponders if it should advance, and so, wither, and if it should advance - if that be what God has ordained - by what means of Earthly locomotion it might utilize, should that be the course of events necessitated by the demands of the story, and, perchance, how many times the word \\"bosom\\" should be employed, and in what capacity.Again, I'm not afraid of long, 19th century prose. I love Dracula and Frankenstein, after all. But at no point did I really feel like Hawthorne had gotten me into the story. Other than an oppressive grayness and the sparking scarlet \\"A\\", there's no strong sense of setting or atmosphere. Worse, I never really felt like I had any idea what Hester was feeling or experiencing. In fact, more time is spent on her secret lover and his torment, but even that seems shallow.I listened to the audio book read by Dick Hill. Hill wasn't horrible, but he didn't really do anything to bring the text to life, either. I don't think a better reader would have made that big a difference, but Hill didn't really bring much to the production himself.I just can't recommend The Scarlet Letter, even for the sake of being able to say you've read a classic. If you want to read a 19th century classic, I recommend something by one of the above authors. Anything, really, before The Scarlet Letter. If you want a modern classic that's actually meaningfully about female sexuality and woman's place in society, read Margaret Atwood's fantastic The Handmaid's Tale."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I guess I should have read the last review or even the fact that the description says Landscape. I didn't think it was necessary, it's just a book right?I guess it's supposed to be easier to read in bed. I just thought it would be cool to have the Scarlet Letter be a red book.If you buy this book you will be holding the book like a wall calendar and reading in two columns; first the two columns on the top page and then two columns on the bottom. This just seems really irritating to me."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The best measure of the greatness of a literary work is its capacity to reward rereading. By that measure, the SL is one of the greatest works of literature, one that keeps American Literature in competition with the other great literatures of the world. This does not mean that the first or second reading will be easy: indeed, difficulty of decision and moral judgment is one of the book's major modalities. The Preface alone tries to block a happy, entertaining reading, to promote thought about language, history, national identity, and ethics. The point of the novel then is mortal education but not in favor of a religion or creed but in favor of humility in the face of the complexity of our collective experience."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter shows Nathaniel Hawthorne at his finest. The imagery is quite wonderful, but there's only so many times you can say the same thing. The images in this novel stretch out far longer than needed.I nearly couldn't make it through. I do like to see every detail given it's fullest attention but even this is too much.This book is one that is very vivid and quite pleasing to understand, but hard to read and not as easy to follow. Sometimes there's only one resourceful fact in a half a page paragraph.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I read The Scarlet Letter when I was in 10th grade more than 14 years ago. This was one of the three novels, the other two being Beowolf and Great Gatsy, that I remember reading, which tells you how boring high school curriculum was and also how outstanding this book is among its peers."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Wow, I can't even put into words how good this book was, and so much better the second time around. The classic tale of Hester Pryne, forced to wear The Scarlet Letter as a sign to all of her adultery, but she refuses to name her lover who is then forced to bear his guilt in silence.Enough reviewers have recounted the story better than I could. Suffice it to say I loved Hawthorne's prose, it was very dense and lyrical at the same time, and you have to pay close attention or you might have to backup and reread a paragraph or two. His descriptions of the scenery and people came alive, especially the character of young Pearl. And I very much enjoyed the scenes in the forest -- it was amazing how Hawthorne brought it all to life, even the sounds of the babbling brook.Highly recommended to anyone looking to discover (or rediscover) an old classic. Side note to some of the young misses who clearly weren't happy at having this book as required reading in school -- you really really should try to work harder on your spelling, punctuation and grammar when criticizing a great masterpiece such as this."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne became one of my favorite classic writers, after I read The Scarlet Letter. Hawthorne writes with passionate emotion and depth, as he tells how the minister, Arthur Dimmesdale, and the beautiful young, Hester Prynne share a secret which causes Hester, who is the mother of a young daughter, the impish energetic Pearl, to be condemned to wearing the scarlet-colored letter \\"A\\" stitched to her dress. Even though the language is written in 17 century Puritan New England style, the story addresses issues that are still prevalant today in our modern society.I love this novel. This hardcover edition is the best one to have if you want to keep it for years to come. I've had my hardcover edition for years, and it is still in perfect condition."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Wow, this was another high school required reading book for me, and while I really like the story - I walked away from it thinking \\"It's not fair that women get the burden of blame and the man walks away free!\\" Which got me to thinking about whether or not society's attitudes about infidelity or pre-marital relations have really changed all that much. I love a book that sparks me thinking about things like this one did as well as having a great story to it too. I recommend this book, although, not for younger children, in my opinion, but high school level and beyond would probably appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I had to read this book this past school year (junior year), so I might be slightly biased against it. I'm generally a very avid reader, sitting down to devour books for hours at a time, but for this book (as short as it actually is), I'd have to force myself to sit down and read one chapter a day, which still took over an hour because it's easy for one's mind to wander when reading this. The sentences are excessively lengthy (although Hawthorne pulls this off quite well), and you'll probably need a dictionary a few times. My vocabulary felt much improved upon completing this novel.I think the storyline, once it is understood, was interesting and I think that the author did do a good job of expressing the vast array of emotions Hester Prynne and Dimmesdale go through. Sometimes I almost felt is was overly dramatic (i.e. Dimmesdale screaming into the night), but sometimes it might have been necessary. The intense feelings the main characters are experiencing form a nice contrast to the drab Puritan setting.Another one of the book's downfalls is the dialogue. The book was actually written a considerable time after the early colonies (I didn't know this until reading the book), and it seems Hawthorne was attempting to duplicate the manner of oral language he believed the Puritans used. He created a Shakespearean like dialect, using words such as 'thee' and 'thy,' which made it not so very--enjoyable. There isn't a lot of speaking going on in the book, so that's a relief.All in all, I'm glad to say that I was one of the few (maybe three-ish) students whom actually read the entirety of this book. It was fun to analyze because it actually made me appreciate it more. I think I'd prefer to wait and re-read when I'm an adult, so that it won't be quite as difficult a read and I can fully appreciate the author's message. I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in a challenging read with some enlightening insight to the effects of sin upon mankind. To anyone forced against their will to read it--I'd say at least give it a try (skip over \\"The Custom-House\\" though, it'll bore you to tears and you'll never even begin on the first chapter), and know that SparkNotes are always good to help you grasp parts of the plot you don't quite comprehend."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book is definitely a classic, contrary to some reviewer's opinions. The virtues of it have been already told by other reviews, so I won't repeat them. Let it suffice to say that this book changed the way I look at the world, the Hereafter, and my fellow immortals.I would also like to briefly point out a bit of irony. Many of the negative reviews here say that the book was to long, and that all those pages would better be summarized like this: The irony is that what follows if different for each person! There is no \\"true\\" summery of this book. Each person pulls what is important to them from a true classic, and each of us is different. I encourage you, therefore to read this for yourself.I also have to warn you NOT to use Cliff's Notes. I think they would find symbolism in the placement of commas! I read a few chapters of Cliff's Notes and immediately the pure discourse of the author and me through the medium of this wonderful tale was corrupted."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"After recently re-reading The Scarlet Letter in this edition, one passage stuck out:\\"One day, leaning his forehead on his hand, and his elbow on the sill of the open window, that looked towards the grave-yard, he talked with Roger Chillingworth, while the old man was examining a bundle of unsightly plants.'Where,' asked he, with a look askance at them,-for it was the clergyman's peculiarity that he seldom, now-a-days, looked straightforth at any object, whether human or inanimate,-'where, my kind doctor, did you gather those herbs, with such a dark, flabby leaf?''Even in the grave-yard here at hand,' answered the physician, continuing his employment. \\"They are new to me. I found them growing on a grave, which bore no tombstone, no other memorial of the dead man, save these ugly weeds that have taken upon themselves to keep him in remembrance. They grew out of his heart, and typify, it may be, some hideous secret that was buried with him, and which he had done better to confess during his lifetime.''Perchance,' said Mr. Dimmesdale, 'he earnestly desired it, but could not.''And wherefore?' rejoined the physician. 'Wherefore not; since all the powers of nature call so earnestly for the confession of sin, that these black weeds have sprung up out of a buried heart to make manifest, an outspoken crime?''That, good Sir, is but a fantasy of yours,' replied the minister. 'There can be, if I forbode aright, no power, short of the Divine mercy, to disclose, whether by uttered words, or by type or emblem, the secrets that may be buried with a human heart. The heart, making itself guilty of such secrets, must perforce hold them, until the day when all hidden things shall be revealed. Nor have I so read or interpreted Holy Writ, as to understand that the disclosure of human thoughts and deeds, then to be made, is intended as a part of the retribution. That, surely, were a shallow view of it. No; these revelations, unless I greatly err, are meant merely to promote the intellectual satisfaction of all intelligent beings, who will stand waiting, on that day, to see the dark problem of this life made plain. A knowledge of men's hearts will be needful to the completest solution of that problem. And I conceive, moreover, that the hearts holding such miserable secrets as you speak of will yield them up, at that last day, not with reluctance, but with a joy unutterable.'\\"It recalled a recent conversation with an old friend. We got to talking (writing, actually) about whether truly private experience is possible. My friend recounted many experiences in which he had intimations of things which we might term \\"private\\": intimations of the death of loved ones, clairvoyant or telepathic experiences, and that sort of thing. One of the things that Hawthorne keeps coming back to is the social and personal skirmishes across the public/private border. A woman has a private affair that bears public fruit in the birth of her child and results in her being very publicly humiliated. Her husband abandons his public claims and ties to her and assumes a new identity. He attaches himself to her lover, a minister, who holds the knowledge of his sinful affair deep within his own heart, where it nonetheless becomes known and visible to the husband. Throughout, the public and private have a way of bleeding into one another.In the passage above, Dimmesdale is blind to those workings of Divine mercy which may have effects that are broader than the confines of a purely solitary heart. He seeks to make his sin purely an issue between him and his God, not realizing that by seeking to restrict sin and guilt, he is equally seeking to confine God and his action to the merely private realm. The novel turns on the futility of this task.Never really saw this before. Of course that's not surprising. You don't see much the first time around, especially when this is assigned reading for a high school student. It may seem like a book of merely historical interest, but it's a pertinent read on the human heart and its transformations through desire, shame, and guilt. While some of it may be overly allegorical for modern tastes, the sheer force of its insights is pretty remarkable. Kathryn Harrison's introduction is fine, and the work itself is truly stunning."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter presents to the reader a classic story of man, in this case, woman versus society. The reader is presented with the infamous Hester Prynne who, according to the laws of Puritan society, has committed a sin of adultery. She is forever condemned for this sin, by wearing a scarlet letter \\"A\\" on her chest to signify that she is an adulterer. When Hester came to Boston as a young woman, she was by herself. To questioning townsfolk she had said that she moved there alone because her husband was traveling for work purposes. However, after she becomes pregnant and gives birth, she's sent to jail and later publicly shamed for her adultery. Throughout the novel she serves as a cautionary tale to the rest of the world. As time passes, Hester's alienation from society makes her realize that their opinion isn't worth her pains. She will use this realization to free herself from the stigma that taunts her because of the scarlet letter that she'd been forced to wear. This novel is an excellent peace of work for anyone who is fascinated by stories in which an individual is facing society alone and experiences a personal awakening. The introduction chapter is very difficult to pay attention to, due to the excessive language which Nathaniel Hawthorne uses. Nonetheless, the subsequent chapters, although adorned by Hawthorne's redundant language, are interesting. The novel is filled with metaphorical diction. Hawthorne is a master of ornamenting his writing with figurative language. All in all, the novel is an excellent read and I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book will enrage you, and help you understand the characters more then you ever thought possible.

As classics go, this is definitely one you shouldn't pass up."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Warning: Some minor parts of the plot revealedThe first thing you will notice when you start reading this book is the words used. This book will certainly drain your mind, and force you to look up many words they used in Nathaniel Hawthorne's time, but are not used today. The work pays off though with a good story.It tells the tale of what happens after an adulterous affair between a young women (Hester Prynne) and a preacher (Dimmesdale) in Boston's Puritan society. Chillingsworth (Hester's husband), a scholar from England, comes into the story when Hester is being punished in front of the town. He makes it his mission to find who did this with his wife.The story turns out to show what guilt and revenge can do to people. Chillingsworth and Dimmesdale are both affected by their obsession. Both men allow their obsession to put both pysical and mental pain on them. The effects can be seen in their actions and how they deteriate.This is a story you will long remember. Do yourself a favor though, have a dictionary close by.

I feel that the novel was very helpful to me. After studying the time period in which the Puritans lived in both my History and English class I feel that I got a good sense of what life was like for the Puritans. This book was certainly not the best book I have ever read. The book was great for a book that you have to read in highschool. i thought the plot moved along quickly in this story. I feel that nothing really ever happens in alot of those books that we are forced to read. This novel is diffrent. If your about to fall asleep something will happen in this book that wakes you up. There are elements to this book that constantly keep you thinking and wondering who did what? or who is who? or what!?Besides just being a decent novle, this novel is fun to analyze.I had alot of fun pulling this book apart with my english class.I realized that something as simple as a rose bush can mean so much for the meaning of the story and the lesson it teaches. This book taught me alot about sin and what sin is all about. I I learned that sin can have some positive affects. Many positive things happened in this book through a child that was a product of sin.This book was a pretty good read. I wouldnt go read it again, but I'm glad I read it mainly becasue it taught me alot. For a book that you are forced to read in school I give it 10 stars but it is definatley not one of the best books I have ever read. I think you will enjoy it for a book you read in school.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I'm sure most of you have heard of the book by Nathaniel Hawthorne, &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;. Hawthorne weaves a tale of hardship, struggle, and victory as we follow the life of Hester Prynne, a woman who has had a child out of wedlock, whom she names Pearl. She is shunned from the community, refuses to confess the identity of Pearl's father, and is forced to wear a letter &quot;A&quot; on her dress, the symbol for adultery. Fighting against the stifling and hypocritical ways of Puritan life, Hester rebels in her own way, first by embellishing her letter with fine embroidery. This book gives us a look at what it is like to live in Puritan America from not just a woman's point of view, but a so-called &quot;sinner's&quot; point of view as well. As we read this book, we come to see how the letter becomes a symbol of strength and freedom for Hester, in a fight against facades of piety and hypocrisy. A very good novel, and Hawthorne does a wonderful job in the portrayal of his characters. Another little known fact, Hawthorne's grandfather was a judge at the Salem witch trials and Nathaniel was so embarassed by the affiliation, that he changed the spelling of his last name to distance himself from his grandfather and what he stood for. A very good novel, definitely something that everyone should read. Besides, don't you want to know the identity of Hester's lover? Go and read this book!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Many claim that classic literature is a relic of the past that has no relevance to the present, however, Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter perfectly depicts how classic literature is classic because it is timeless and not simply timely. We do not live in the Boston, Massachusetts of the mid 1600's, when people were cruelly ruled by hypocritical Puritan law, nevertheless, persecution, \\"sin,\\" truth, justice, mercy, revenge, isolation and perseverance reign as powerfully today as they did over 200 years ago.In The Scarlet Letter, Hawthorne beautifully develops the story of Hester Prynne, a young woman who dares to violate the public appearance of Puritan propriety, by bearing a daughter out of wedlock. She is forced to wear the ignominious letter \\"A\\" upon her chest as a constant reminder and lesson to all, of the burden of sin. The reader follows Hester through seven years of suffering, persecution, and isolation, to find that she is far more sinned against than she has sinned. The truly provocative idea in this book, however, is that it is one of the first books in which the reader sympathizes with the supposed culprit, and only Hawthorne's masterful use of symbolism and allegory do honor to such an undertaking."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I found that this book was full of text that is not exactly for the typical high school reader. It is mostly out of date, so most people don't understand unless they are fairly good readers.As for the story. I believe that is was beautifully put together. I think that it is great how Hester (the main character) uses her sin as a way to show that she has strong character. The way it is portrayed is remarkable. I believe that if you are an american literature fan, this is a must-read. The reason for the 4-stars instead of five, most of the vocabulary takes more than basic skill to comprehend."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter is a classic story of love, betrayal, lies, and an evil child all set in a Puritan town in the mid-nineteenth century. Hester Prynne falls in love with some mysterious man and becomes pregnant with his child. There's a slight problem. She's married to another man who wasn't anywhere near her when she got pregnant. In Puritan society, Hester has committed a serious crime, and when she decides not to turn over her lover to the rest of the town, they force her to wear the letter 'A' on her chest every day for the rest of her life. With this punishment, she is also mistreated by other members of society who look at her as if she is some kind of vicious monster.This is a great story to teach people about their prejudices and what happens when you fall in love with the 'wrong' person, especially after you've already married someone else."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I first read this book in 10th grade and breezed through it. A few weeks ago, I had to reread this book for my English class. With the plot not so fresh in my mind, I picked up the book again and was amazed at what I initially brushed off. While the idea of a married woman being forced to wear a scarlet A on her chest for producing a child born out of an affair would be improbable today, the story contains many truths about sin, revenge, love, guilt. Also, though some might disagree, his writing is amazing and a joy to read. Pick up this book again, you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The first time I tried to read this book I had to keep looking in the dictionary, which was very distracting, and the last thing you need when you read this book is distraction; besides, I was too young to really understand this, anyway. I picked up the book again recently and this time, the first thing that comes to my mind is whether a person like Hester really existed, and if all the things she had to go through without losing her serenity and aplomb happened the way it happens here. Hester Prynne is a married Puritan woman who was condemned to wear a scarlet letter A embroidered in her clothes at all times, to remind everyone of her sin: having a child, Pearl, with another villager whose identity she will not disclose. Being publicly recognized as an adulteress, Hester is a victim of her neighbors' scorn and the authorities' suspicion, even threatened to have her daughter's custody taken away from her, and in the midst of this, she discovers her husband's designs of revenge on the man he suspects of being her lover. Hester's personality and her suffering are superbly described, but the story in itself drags on excruciatingly from the beginning to about the middle of the book, and even from that point on, the prose is still very complicated and full of arcaic words and florid descriptions, that's why I say distraction is the last thing you need when reading it; you have to really want to read this book, but it will pay, if what you want is something that keeps you thinking about it well after you finish reading; I don't know why it is required reading in some schools and I certainly would not reccomend this book for occasional readers."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Although I commend Hawthorne for his brilliant writing style that seems to convey exactly what he is trying to say, I must admit that I found the actual novel itself slow to read. I try to look for literary devices that unfold the novel before my eyes, but I find very few in The Scarlet Letter. Conrad's Heart of Darkness and Dostoyevsky's Notes from the Underground are prime examples of the symbolism I am looking for. The Scarlet Letter has a remarkable message about human morals and cruelty along with divine intervention, but you may find it difficult to complete due to its lack of interesting prose."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"THIS BOOK IS A GREAT CLASSIC THAT EXPLOITS THE IDEA THAT A PREACHER WOULD DO THE UNTHINKABLE AND MAKE A WOMAN PREGNANT WHO HE WAS NOT MARRIED TO.

It paints a vivid picture - with a bit of purple prose here and there - of life in Puritan times and the trials of Hester Prynne, condemned by the village for adultery.

It takes place in Boston, Massachusetts during the era when Puritans were there. The main character Hester Prynne is forced to wear a Scarlet Letter A for adultery because she cheats on her husband while waiting for him to come from Europe.The book really recaptures what Puritanism was like. Its interesting to think about what America would be like if we were still Puritan. A theme of the book is concealed guilt. The minister Arthur Dimmesdale has concealed guilt which causes him severe pain. The message of the book is that you shouldn't let some minor sin you did in the past haunt you for the rest of your life.The book denounces the religious atmosphere of the Puritan village claiming that it stifled the merriment and joy of the culture of Old England. You get a picture of how the wonderful culture portrayed in the works of Chaucer was lost in America due to the influence of the Puritans."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"An extremely pared-down version of the classic, but it was still very enjoyable.

What this means for me is that the pages are ultra thin, and whenever I use pen or highlighter ink it seeps through the pages, making the back much less legible.2) This book lacks footnotes.

However, the strong characters are revealed through their actions more than through Hawthorne's descriptions. The story takes place in 17th Century Boston and Puritanical Law is heavily enforced. A young woman, Hester, has been imprisoned for getting pregnant while committing adultery. Now that the baby is 3 months old, they have her stand in the center of town with so she can be shamed by the whole town. Her husband just happens to come to town as she stands on the scaffold and thus the story continues in a dark spiral of hidden friendships, revenge, immense guilt, and sin.

In fact, although written in a language of a different time, we can find some of the same types of actions happening today - albeit in a more subtle manner.Overall, this is the story of a young woman who committed adultery, and is caught because she becomes pregnant at a time when abortion was not an option. Although many other people in her puritan community have committed the same \\"transgression\\", they haven't been caught yet (i.e. haven't become pregnant), so they participate in ruining this woman's reputation by forcing her to wear a scarlet \\"A\\", to symbolize her adulterous nature.I believe that in our society, people tend to do the same thing - they participate in gossip/making fun of people who have been unlucky enough to be caught doing the same thing many other's are doing day in and day out. For this reason, I feel as though this story is as relevant today as it was when it was written.I do have to agree that the writing is a bit difficult to get through, as the language is quite different than what we are now used to. But, if you have the time and patience to work through it, I think you will find it to be quite an eye-opener."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter is a work of genius. Nathaniel Hawthorne tells his story with astonishingly perfect art. The plot is flawless (except for the final chapter). His prose style, though difficult, is entirely appropriate to the seriousness of his themes. We are taken into the mid-seventeenth century world of the Puritan New Englanders with brilliant economy, the social and natural scene is superbly rendered, the drama is immediately and vividly brought before us.In a holier-than-thou community where the sinner (a person who has broken one of God's commandments) is forever judged, damned and punished, a young woman, Hester Prynne, has been found guilty of adultery. She will therefore be made a permanent example of. The story of the rest of Hester's life is one half of what the novel is concerned with, showing us the goodness and healthy rebelliousness of the human heart that must, and does, prevail.The other half of the story concerns Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, Hester's lover (the father of their 'unnatural', illegitimate child), who only near the end reveals his crime to the people of the town. Before this occurs, unlike Hester, who is almost completely ostracised and forced to always wear a scarlet letter A, for Adultery, he is venerated as a saint by the community. His confession exposes the whole compromised, hypocritical system - outcome of a movement which began (history records) with hopes of being a 'new Zion', 'a city set on a hill'.The novel is at its most intense when revealing Dimmesdale's profound spiritual torment as he struggles with his feelings of guilt and need to both confess and keep hidden his 'fallen' state. Our appalled identification with him, as he recognises his utter damnation (his conscience continually pricked by Hester's vengeful, cold, intellectual husband, whose true identity only she knows), shows us the full horror of believing sins are never forgiven and must be defeated through suppression of 'corrupt' human nature.As well as the justly famous symbolism, the story is composed of many other elements, including fable, psychology and the simplest down-to-earth realism. Reading it is to feel that all life - however circumscribed - is here. The characters, especially Hester and Dimmesdale, are so well drawn they rise above symbolic limitations. They are fully realised human beings, with recognisable flaws and virtues.The Scarlet Letter is a book for all humanity and all time. It took me to a world which I sometimes found oppressive and very nearly life-denying, yet due to Nathaniel Hawthorne's artistry an infinitely enriching and always enjoyable experience. These are, after all, the surest signs of a great novel."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Ok, like a fair number of other people, I read this just recently as a highschooler. My highly qualified judgement: Its has beautifully worked prose, and an intriguing plot (I wont try and say whether its good or not), and is a great study of symbolism, but at that point its redeeming qualities stop.The real trick is that the work is fundamentally a tableau. I like my characters to develop, to possess hidden (TO ME) traits; that is to say, I care much more for a story that evolves. The problem is, The Scarlet Letter has and does none of these. The characters, from about the third chapter, are as revealed as they ever become. I sat through the entire book waiting for something to suprise me, for some prediction to prove false, BUT IT NEVER HAPPENED. Take the worst qualities of ancient Greek fiction -and even samples of Shakespeare (predestination, the end is basically known from the beginning)- and remove nearly all traces of excitement and drama. Those two happen to be what makes getting from the start to the finish of those pieces enjoyable.I don't know what makes people love this book so. It represents many extremes (high morality, deep religious piety, clear boundaries of good and evil) that, while different from much of current \\"cultured\\" literature, are no better for their excess than any modern, overly-muted, grey-area tales.The overdone symoblism begins to irritate a reader, particularly when they have recently been reading many of the generally acknowledged classics (as numerous highschoolers have). Interpreting is all well and fine, but for even the mildly observant reader, the meaning of EVERYTHING is carefully explained at one point or another. Where lies the educational value in that?I also happen to think that the current new audience, that of my generation, have a wholly different perspective on the story than the people who originally dubbed it a classic. In the story, I found my own interest and empathy to be in and with Pearl, the fairy-child. Her caprice is the only wisp of life, of vibrancy, that I could find. My personal world is niether as austere, melodramatic, or dull as the place this book wishes to send my mind, so I miss the passion that might have been there. All I read is the art of the words.Lastly: Nate's opinion of the Puritans as a whole is blatantly transparent to anyone who takes the time to notice. This day and age, I already have enough people, places, and things that I'm subconciously being taught to hate without reason. I can live my life without the bitter thought that my own country was based in the ideals of the harsh, drab, and narrow-minded weevils Hawthorne paints the Puritans to be.In summary: in The Scarlet Letter, Hawthorne exquisitely delivers an utterly hamhanded tale. I dont need to be told the moral of a story at the end, thank you very much."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Frankly, in reading the negative reviews it is clear to me that there is a growing body of illiterates among us. It seems too, that the more a book makes one think the more negaive review it receives from some readers.I do agree that this particular Kindle edition is cumbersome to navigate due to the format but it is still an exceptional book and very worth reading. Not only is the character developmet quite thorough and enjoyable but it gives us a glimpse of the society in which it was written. What I always find fascinating is that this, like most other classics, is about human nature, power and the consequences of actions. So in the end these themes are enduring and feed our desire to look into the hearts and souls of others- to be voyeurs-which is what makes a classic a classic."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I was always skeptical when teachers used the term \\"classic\\" when referring to a book. It always seemed to me to be a term to describe books I had to read that were going to suck. The Scarlet Letter was a happy exception; one that actually has meaning today as it did when written.I really enjoy historical fiction. Hawthorne easily puts a reader into the time period by laying out the facts of puritan life and laws, the dress of the time, as well as with the old-fashioned dialog. Hestor's husband is \\"away\\" at sea and she has become pregnant. Normally, adultery would carry a very severe punishment, but the town can't prove her husband is alive. So, she is forced to wear a scarlet \\"A\\" (for adultery) on her chest whenever she's in public. This stigma will pass on to her daughter, despite her innocence in the matter. Hestor's stoic perseverence in the face of this humiliation is even more poignant when you learn who the father of her baby really is. This tale of a town forcing its morality on a person is still valid today. Women aren't forced to wear a scarlet A (at least in the US), but we still label people who are different or don't conform to our values.Unfortunately, at the time this was written, authors were paid by the number of pages in their books. Readers can easily guess this caused uncessary bloating in stories and this book suffers the same. There is a lot of description and fluff that I found myself skimming over, but the heart of the story is still excellent. This tale is powerful and meaningful. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Hawthhone's \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is literature at it's finest. The attention to detail for both settings, and especially the thoughs of the characters will chain you to this book.

The \\"Scarlet Letter\\" is a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"As an eleventh grader I was assigned The Scarlet Letter to read. When I finished, I was glad I had read it. It was a great book which had me guessing, or should I say wondering all the time. It was somewhat hard to read and completely understand. Published in 1850, there were words and sentence usage I wasn't familiar with (having CliffsNotes helped a lot), but the plot and points Hawthorne made were wonderful. It was a little confusing trying to figure out how Hawthorne felt about certain aspects such as; sin, adultery, Puritans, and whether or not he thought Hester and Dimmesdale were right or wrong in the things they did. Not knowing his thoughts are what make the novel the way it is. It was fascinating to see Hawthorne's use of symbolism in this novel; the way he would take something simple, such as the letter A and turn it into the focal point of the entire novel.If you like mystery, scandal, and an all around classic read The Scarlet Letter!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"There are so many things I could say about this book, but should I reach the heights of elegance achieved only by Shakespeare, Hawthorne himself, or Faulkner, I could not overcome the horrible, terrible misconceptions most people have formed after having this beautiful novel foisted upon them in high school. Instead, I'll share a few observations and some tips for reading.First, this is a complicated story. It's not about evil Puritans and hero Hester, although you will read this point of view in the cheat note summaries on the internet. It's not about feminism, really, nor is it about religion in any technical sense. The only comparison that really fits is that of love story, or love triangle, or maybe love square. (I told you it is complicated.) In all of literature, there are very few writers who have penned characters so incredibly real and well-rounded. When you finish the novel, you KNOW these people. Certainly there is some minor societal commentary, but the real story here is about these people.Now, I'm assuming that many people looking at this page have been told they must read this book for high school English. As a former teacher of said subject, I have some pointers.(1) Make sure you read the book for yourself. Chances are (in our current educational system) your teacher is going to have a flat interpretation of this book, likely gleaned from some ready-made teaching packet. (If you have another kind of teacher, consider yourself lucky.) You can have some very interesting class discussions if you actually read the material and challenge some of the majority opinions about the novel. Be a rebel. Have some fun in English.(2) Read *The Custom House* introduction, but wait until after you've finished the book. It's only good in that it explains Hawthorne's view of his own book (difficult and painful) and reveals his struggle to write it. The writing style, however, is decidedly un-Hawthorne and more difficult to read than the rest of the book. If you read it first, you will be unfairly biased against the novel.(3)Read it SLOWLY, if at all possible. The storyline is complex and should be read with care. I would also recommend underlining and taking notes, if your copy of the book allows it. You will develop a truly deep appreciation of the work.(4) Finally, avoid the Demi Moore 1995 adaptation AT ALL COSTS. Words cannot describe how awful it is. And if your hope is to find something to help you on the test, the only real similarities are the character's names and the red patch on Hester's dress. If you must see a film version, find the PBS miniseries with John Heard and Meg Foster (made in the 1970s). It does the best job that a film possibly could with this material."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This classic work on Puritan life and morality was written 200 years after the events described took place. Hawthorne (House of the Seven Gables and Twice Told Tales) begins with an autobiographical description of the Custom House of Salem in his day, of his work there, and of how he came to write this story. He then jumps in 'in medias res' and we see a woman being put on display before the people of Salem with a scarlet A on her breast, to be worn forever as a remonstrance for her adultery. It is to be a warning to others and a scourge to her soul.We follow the story of this woman (Hester Prynne), the child of her affair (Pearl), her husband (unknown to the community and in the guise of a doctor), and the object of her sinful passion, whom Hester has refused to name before the magistrates, clergymen, or town. Hawthorne treats everything with vivid descriptions and the style of prose popular in his time (1804-1864) that is often seen as cumbersome today. (Think Dickens if unfamiliar with Hawthorne's contemporaries.) With concentration, however, any reader can get through the seemingly endless procession of commas and insufferably long paragraphs to see the beauty of the story within.Most fascinating is the way Hawthorne describes the physical transformations that occur as a result of their sin. In addition, he lays bare the consequences of sin, not only on Hester, forced to wear the scarlet letter all of her days, but on everyone touched by the adultery.Hawthorne was a transcendentalist, friend to Emerson, Thoreau, the Alcotts, and many other influential thinkers of his time. This philosophy is seen in the reverence with which he describes nature as well as the harshness he has for Puritanical solemness. He holds no approval of adultery, however, even if he does disapprove of Salem's residents and society, but desires to place before us an example of the consequences of sin, in order that we might not do likewise. He also holds out hope in the last paragraphs that an equality in marriage, such as had not been seen in the 1600s would develop, in contrast to the unhappy unequal marriage to which Hester felt bound. This was another distinguishing trait of the Transcendentalists, especially the Alcotts.It is a classic for a reason, a beacon of time tested truth. It should not be read with a modern eye for it is not a modern tale, but full of what we consider unwieldy language and awkward grammar. However, it is no less a classic to be enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"In this classic tale written in 1850, N. Hawthorne tells the tragic tale of a fallen woman, Hester Prynne. In his essay entitled \\"The Custom House\\", the author pretends to have found a mysterious relic of cloth in the shape of the letter along with a manuscript in which a certain Jonathan Pue described the letter's wearer.Thus the character of Hester Prynne was born, this adulteress who has to wear the shameful letter A embroidered on her garment in scarlet letter and insolent gold thread. Her error is adultery and the Puritan magistrates of colonial Boston decided that she should wear the bright letter affixed to her breath. In the opening scene, Hester is standing dishonoured before the town holding another man's child just as her long-lost husband Roger Chillinworth arrives in Boston. The story is tightly constructed and takes place in 24 chapters with the action in the first, the twelfth and the last revolving around the scaffold on which Hester suffers her punishment. The structure is taught and essentially limited to the description of the three adult characters of Hester Prynne, Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale and Roger Chillingworth, each in turn wearing various masks to hide themselves from the failures of the human heart. Hester never reveals her lover's identity thus protecting her from public disgrace but not from his interior sense of guilt. At any rate she is a strong character, a rebel dwelling in solitude which grants her freedom of thought, particularly concerning the fate of women: \\"The world's law was no law for her mind\\" the author writes. To the reader she appears as a fascinating creature, captivating, rebellious, even intimidating. The d&eacute;nouement is equally startling. After Hester's daughter Pearl marries, she returns to the small abandoned cottage and resumes her former life, not being able to remain an expatriate, the scarlet letter now voluntarily clamped to her bosom as if it were part of her true identity. Her triumph finally lies in her willingness to take up the mark that identifies her as a woman."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Because a member of my book club chose The Scarlet Letter as her selection for the month, I reread this classic tale of love, heartache, loss, and the seamy side of human nature. Although I enjoyed Hawthorne's novel set in Puritan New England, I found much of the writing so dense that I had to read some of the passages twice, and while I have a fairly decent vocabulary, I'm glad I read the book on my Kindle Fire so that I could immediately find the definitions of words I didn't know.What I admired about the novel was Hawthorne's gift for telling a tale so masterfully and for his powers of description. Because of his powerful use of langague, I could see and feel the darkness of the forest, sense Hester's humiliation, feel Dimmesdale's guilt, and view the faces of the judgmental townspeople. Then there was little Pearl, a lovely little child often portrayed with sunshine around about her person. Even her name seemed symbolic to me. She was the pearl cast before swine (in the village) AND the pearl made beautiful by friction. Chillingsworth, the other major player, appeared evil from the first day he appeared at the scaffold.Throughout the book, I found myself wondering what Hawthorne would think about the world of today! Reverend Dimmesdale would be an anomaly in today's \\"love \`em and leave \`em\\" climate. Hester would be accepted rather than stigmatized, and she'd likely receive some sort of support, either from her \\"partner\\" or from the government, and she wouldn't have to live on the outskirts of town, ostracized by society. I rather enjoy thinking of Hester with an attitude!As a whole, my book club enjoyed The Scarlet Letter except for the extremely long chapter, \\"The Custom House.\\" The book generated much lively discussion, and all admired Hawthorne's plot and his depiction of life during that era. This review is based on a Kindle edition with pictures, something that added a lot to my enjoyment of the book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The book The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne was a interesting book. This book is a story about religious and other beliefs. The main women in this story whims name is Hester Prynne. She decides to move to America and start a new life, she is still stays married to her husband though. While she is living in America she has a child with another man. She has to attend trial because of it. After the trial she has to wear a scarlet letter A on all her clothing. Her real husband tries to seek revenge on her. Hester is pretty much hated by everyone so she has to teach herself and learn how to live her life and raise her baby alone. This book takes place in the 17th century during the Puritan time period. This is definitely a book filled with suspense. Some things can be a little boring but all in all a pretty great book. I would definitely recommend this book to people who are wanting to learn about things in the Puritan time. Also I would recommend this book to a mature audience. This book truly shows how people were treated dring this time period. It is a great book and everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter is profound piece of literature, and the characters and imagery are beautifully written. Hawthorne takes the concept of morality and adultery and just descripts the struggles from the effected parties extremely well. The one thing that stood out most for me was just how well written all the characters were, you can't help to feel their pain and understand what they are going through.Hester Prynne, the bearer of the Scarlet \\"A\\" on her breast, her badge of shame. Branded for adultery for everyone to see, Hester still has a desire to redeem herself. She never reveals her lover's identity and for that she has been publically shamed.Her lover is a well respected member of the community (I won't reveal who it is just in case people aren't aware and don't want a spoiler). He is faced with carrying the burden of his sin in secret, always putting his hand over his heart, an expression of the pain that is dwelling up inside him. He lives with his sin until it all begins to unravel and he breaks.Roger Chillingworth is Hester's husband; ashamed of the betrayal, he had changed his name so no one would know. He takes up the role of the local doctor, in an attempt to find and get close to his enemy. He has asked Hester to keep his true identity a secret, while he searches for her lover and the father of Pearl.Pearl, Hester's daughter, known as the demon child, is a devilish by nature. I have the feeling that she is very aware of what's going on and knows who her father is, and she is just baiting them all to reveal the truth. I always thought of Pearl as the-demon-on-the-shoulder type character.Each character is simply amazing and with the judging townsfolk, the struggle feels so real and you can't help but feel for the characters. I found this book more enjoyable after I finished reading it and began reflecting on it. The Scarlet Letter did at times feel drawn out but overall it was well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book was very good.

It was so tragic and really held me. However, on my reread I found I didn't like the characters as much.

So this book is still a good read, but I think in my more mature adult self I just didn't care for the plot as much."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Though it is a love story, love takes second place to puritan morality. Another name for this novel could have been \\"Sin and Punishment\\". The long-suffering Hester Prynne, an apparent spinster, refuses to tell the name of the man who impregnated her, though she is punished by some time in the stocks and being forced to wear forever the scarlet letter pinned to her clothes. Meanwhile, her husband, a medical scholar, who had sent her on to the New World ahead of him, turns up on the day of her public humiliation, having met with shipwreck and captivity among the Indians. He, consumed with anger, vows a revenge on her \`defiler', discovers the man, and wreaks psychological trauma on him. Hester, living a humble life alone with her lively daughter Pearl, shunned by all, slowly redeems herself by good works. The lovers come together once again, years later. The end is befitting such a story.The self-righteousness and sanctimoniousness of the Boston Puritans is well-described. The tale is one of tragedy, suffering and partial redemption rather than of romantic love. Human emotions, universal to all times and places, appear, but was there ever a society less receptive of love ? The characters are indeed well-developed, both major and minor, as befits a classical novel.THE SCARLET LETTER was a landmark in American literature and as such is an important work, but for today's readers it may not be a popular choice. First, its theme and plot line are far from today's concerns. Second, the language, especially in the dialogue, is archaic. Thus, I pray you think twice before launching your ship upon the Seas of this novel forthwith, for verily thou treadest upon difficult speech and mayest come to the end of thy tether. Even though thou wilt give this tome a full five stars, I do not, for by my troth, three must suffice."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Downloaded to read, got started then wasn't too interested in the book, had read it in school years before thought i'd reread it but never finsihed."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I had to read this for 10th grade English and it was very interesting.

The story always gave me reasons to think about were values originated. All faiths have a system and justification. Puritan outlook is still threaded in our American culture but diluted. I can't escape the mindful link to politics and the human condition. Politicians call for values and virtue in the name of handed down value systems that are humanly flawed and unsustainable.

This book has a good moral value to it and when you read this book you need to let your emotions take over. If you let the emotions take over you will get more out of the story. Through out this book Hawthorne shows his unique writing style. His writing style is long sentences and good vocabulary words to describe what he means. This book talks about how two people of different backgrounds can get along and fall in love. Their town doesn't accept people like that so therefore the women had to wear a scarlet letter \\"A\\" on her chest. In this book there is a lot of guilt, revenge, and pride. There is a lot of guilt involved because of the lady having an affair and she has to wear the letter \\"A\\" on her chest. This book shows pride also because she does not let the letter and the people of the town bring her down. Her life stayed the same as it was before her affair with another man. The ending in this book is really good. It is weird how they find out that the preacher is the one who had the affair with the lady.Hawthorne wrote this book many years ago and now it fits perfect into our life. We have a lot of relationships in this world of people with different ethic and religious backgrounds. So this book puts into perspective of what it was like to have a relationship with someone not like you back in the late 1800's early 1900's. Who would have ever thought that this book would be so close in relationship to how we live now? This book is such a great book to read. So I think that everyone should read this book and let their emotions take over and they will feel this book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book was very different from any other book that I have ever read. I was very impressed with the way Hawthorne put such a deep meaning into his novel. I have never read a book like it. It's definitely different from a book like Harry Potter--there's not any deeper meaning in that book, it's cut 'n dry. It's neat also how much influence Nathaniel's Hawthrone's own life has influenced this book. I did not like the the plot or setting so much of the book at first. You really have to think about it and concentrate on what is being said at the end. It's kind of neat the things that you could say about it, the things you could relate it to. Basically the only thing about it that I didn't like was the the plot wasn't action-packed. I like books that have more action and dialog. I think it was a good experience for me though to read it just to get the feel for reading a book like that--the Old English and the deeper meaning. I would recomend it to people who enjoy the 17th centry and its society, because I think it reflects that very well. As well as reflecting the society of th 1850's--the time when Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote this book. It was a pretty good book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"It is a travesty that this novel is even classified with the classics. This is by far one of the most boring and pointless novels in existance. The plot dribbles on about sin and adultry with few arguments. The contrasting of light and dark, with shadows, light and color is overdone and quite childish. Any third grade student can classify purity as light and sin as darkness. More over, there is over a hundred pages of belaboring the point, with no real conclusion. At the end of the novel, all I had was a headache, and I had fallen asleep more than a dozen times."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"i couldn't listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you're into audio books"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"On first glance, such a slim volume would seem to be something you could read quickly. Not so! The turgid and heavy prose is over-ornamented and complicated by ye olde New England Puritan syntax.I suspect that even when it was written Hawthornes prose was never accessible, and in the modern context it is so far from spoken english that reading it is like wading through treacle. It is sweet, cloying and ultimately sickening.The underlying story is simple, a universal enough theme to span the ages, and could easily be rewritten well into the modern context.It is never easy to be harsh with a book that is listed as a \\"classic\\" but in this case I feel I must be truthful about it. This is not an easy nor an enjoyable read. It is hard work. To be oxymoronic I suppose it is the heaviest light read and the fattest slim book I have encountered.Read it at your peril!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":".I enjoyed this book very much. And it is not outdated for our day especially since fundamentalism is so overwhelming modern civilization subordinating flexibility and lowering tolerance to a zero level. It is here that a story that takes place in the early American Puritan culture is surprisingly not far from today's anti-sexually neurotic society. While the Puritans appear far harsher, it is only because the fundamentalists were in control. It is no different today, except they are not the majority, not yet anyway, but are growing in vast proportion as can be seen in the censorship of media, music, advertising and entertainment.And so this story would have been revolutionary during the puritan era, it is a valuable lesson and honest when pertaining to the human animal, something which we all are, even if we cease to admit it in our Christian or religious pietism.It is here that a Hester Prynne, apparently a \\"liberal,\\" had relations with a man and subsequent illegitimate child and refuses to tell the court who the father is. And for this she is labeled as an outcast and sinner. She is publicly humiliated and for the remainder of her life must wear a scarlet letter on her garment that identifies herself as an outcast. And you know people, the jealous woman who love to see others humiliated, the ignorant that may not even understand the nature of the so-called crime but are quick to follow the herd mentality.In the meantime, her prior husband, Roger Chillingworth, is seeking revenge to the father of her child, who turns out to be the most well respected man of the Puritan town, the ever so idolized and admired preacher himself, Arthur Dimsdale. But Hester maintains complete dignity through out the entire novel. And it is only in the end that the poor mentally distraught hypocrite preacher finally admits his Christian sin, this due to the internal guilt and hypocrisy that Christian insecurity so often does, as it almost always debilitates a person's courage to be with self-beating analysis and repression from externally determined codes.And today, there it is, watch the news programs and you will see more than one Hester Prynne who will receive just as bad treatment, if not worse. Currently there are two women who had sex with minors, one being jailed, her beau still loves her and is waiting for her, the other, a young 23 year old, about to be punished severely I'm sure.I can just imagine the severe beating other societies, such as the intellectuals of the ancient Athenian Greek culture, would receive in our modern day Augustinian society. Puritanism lives in the right wing conservative morality that is permeating our present culture. Please Mr. Dimsdale right wing conservatives, Mr. & Mrs. Evangelical Christians, let go, admit your hypocrisy, cease judging others, and let's evolve to higher levels of human consciousness, not regress."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"i strongly advise you to skip the entire introduction. it is boring and pointless. it explains the author's inspiration to write this...let's say...not-so-good book. in fact, this book was probably the most boring and uneventful book i have ever read. i only did because it was a &quot;required reading&quot; assignment for school. actually in my opinion it starts out interesting and gets worse as it goes along. this is most likely due to the fact that it contains so many useless pages of description that i quickly lost interest. if the author removed these extra pages, the book would probably be half the size, but much better nevertheless. there really was nothing in the plot that made me want to finish the book, maybe with the exception of why the minister kept his hand on his heart. ON THE OTHER HAND, the message was somewhat interesting and got me thinking. i'm sorry if i offended anybody who enjoyed the novel with my negative feedback. i mean, it might be a good book to some, but extremely boring to others. it really depends on ur tolerance level and how easily amused u are. also, this book and is quite hard to comprehend because of the old english and difficult concepts to grasp. that may be another reason why some find it not amusing; the story is boring because it might not make sense to them."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I hated this story. It was long. It was preachy. It was boring.

The word &quot;ugh&quot; summarizes my experience.This book was written in the 19th century, and that's where it belongs. It wouldn't be nearly as bad if someone were to modernize the language used in the book, but reading through &quot;dost thou&quot; after &quot;dost thou&quot; isn't any fun.However, I highly recommend reading Richard Armour's take on SL in his book &quot;The Classics Reclassified&quot;."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I know that saying the book is dumb nullifies all the hard work put into it, but I just did not like it. Sure the main idea and a well written summary makes the book as a whole good, it doesn't help the actual context one bit which was very hard to follow and comprehend."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I am a third year law student who read this work in the tenth grade (11 years ago) so I am working from memory here. I did not enjoy it, despite the grand themes that the author addresses. Frankly, I felt that the work was entirely too dense to be an enjoying read. I get the same feeling now when I am trying to dissect some obscure statute...in other words, it needs to be done, but it isn't any fun. I feel that some reviewers on this page are unfairly haranguing people who could not read the book without a dictionary. I feel that this is the wrong attitude. When I am writing a legal brief, it is expected that my work be crafted in such a way that it is READABLE [e.g. tell a good story]. If you do not write in such a way as to engage the greatest number of people, you will be less likely to get your audience to appreciate the merits of your case. The same is true with this book. The author does not allow our minds eye to fill in any blanks. His prose is dense and he fills in so many of the details that it is impossible to let your imagination add the finishing touches to the work. In the end, most students are drained and bitter at the author for pushing us into his overly descriptive morass. This has nothing to do with the fact that there are so many &quot;dictionary words&quot; in the book. That is another matter entirely. However, I would note that most people who are complaining about the difficulty of the individual words would probobly not be complaining if the author had not so totally preempted the reader's imagination. The words individually are not so difficult as the density. There are those who love this work anyway and i have no problem with that. But I assure you that If one of the senior attorneys here refers to my work as &quot;dense&quot;, I am bound to have to do a rewrite. That said, i still believe that this is a worthwhile book as much for the revolutionary readings that are possible as the traditional themes for which it became famous. Who has re! ad this book with an eye toward dissecting the nature of the subordination of women in western culture? Or to examine the ways in which Hester rebels (however modestly) against the strictures of her station? Anyone who has will find new layers to the book that speak as much to the modern day as they do to the audience of the author's times"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I thought the book was good, but it was way too descriptive and wordy. It is about the consequences of a woman who committed adultry and has to suffer the conseqences of bearing an illigitimate child. It deals with the feelings of guilt and isolation. It gives us a history lesson as to how this type of crime was dealt with in the late seventeen hundreds (I think that's when it took place). The problem was that it was very wordy and overdescriptive. The author used huge words and I had to have a dictionaory with me at all times. The length of the book could have been cut in half if the author had been more direct and to the point. It was a good book, but it probably should not be read by a high school student like me. I say this not because of the subject matter, but because of the vocabulary and long sentences. It has some Shakspearian language in it (thou, art, thee) which make the simple plot even harder to understand. I would recommend that you wait until college before you read this book, unless you have a very large vocabulary."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I don't think that the first review did it justice.

Hawthorne's text, The Scarlet Letter, requires concentration and thought to comprehend some of the wording. This book has a copious amount of run-on sentences which makes it seem way too drawn out. I also found it challenging to follow the plot and theme because of the ample amount of detail provided about each character and the various situations.

Although it has received over 500 reviews I feel it is my duty to help bring the average star level to where it belongs, at zero. Where to begin... perhaps with the run on sentences, the failure to create significant rising action, the flat two dimensional characters... This novel is full of things which not only bore the reader, but frustrate them as well.The fatal flaw in this piece of literature is its inability to stay relevant. Post-modern society does not really care about, \\"Baby daddies,\\" and the revelation which is made at the end, and beginning, of this novel is reproduced daily on morning television a la Maury. Unfortunately, Nathaniel Hawthorn you are the father of this literary disaster."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"So I heard about this from a friend at Comi-Con.

It was nothing like I expected, and unless shame is a super power (which is unlikely) Hester is just some puritan lady before radioactive spiders even existed!Seriously, I don't think \\"BANG!\\" \\"POW!\\" or \\"ZORT!\\" show up anywhere in the book! I almost gave this one star, but Roger Chillingworth is an awesome super villain name.

Re-read this and remembered how much Hawthorne's style irritates me. There is an interesting story within but he takes WAY too long to tell it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"When people think of a \\"scarlet letter,\\" we immediate think of a person outwardly branded for something they have done. Credit Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" for that -- it's an intense, impassioned (if slightly hammy) story of a strong-willed woman in Puritan New England, who is branded for her sins and her love for one weak man.In the mid-1600s, a passionate young woman named Hester Prynne has been accused of adultery -- she recently had a baby, even though her husband was abroad. Just as damning to the elders is the fact that she won't name baby Pearl's father. Even her estranged husband -- a cold-hearted older man calling himself Roger Chillingworth -- wants to know her lover's identity, but Hester steadfastly refuses to even hint at the man's identity.We learn early in the book that Pearl's dad is actually the local minister Arthur Dimmesdale, who is wracked with guilt, hallucinations and sickness because of his secret adultery. Chillingworth slowly deduces who his wife's lover was, and begins to scheme revenge on Dimmesdale. Will the former lovers manage to escape their guilt-ridden lives, or will they reveal the truth to everyone?It sounds like \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is JUST a story about guilt and sin, but it's also a story about love and steadfastness. Hester remains strong and kind throughout her life despite others' cruelty to her, and her love for Dimmesdale and Pearl is what gives her that strength. Chillingworth (symbolic name!) is a cuckold, but it's impossible to like him because of his lack of love -- he loves no one, and lives only for revenge.And at the same time, Hawthorne reminds us that goodness can overcome your past sins. Hester slowly overcomes the Puritans' loathing for her by simply being charitable, kind, helpful and loving, until eventually her sin is eclipsed by her virtues. On the flip side, Dimmesdale is annoying because of his weakness and cowardice -- I know he's supposed to be wracked with guilt, but he's so pathetic compared to Hester that it's just infuriating.Hawthorne's writing may take a little while for modern audiences to get used to. It's very 19th-century in style, with staid, slightly stuffy prose gilded with hauntingly poetic moments and intense passion (\\"Never, never!\\" whispered she. \\"What we did had a consecration of its own\\"). At times Hawthorne's story gets a little... hammy (such as Dimmesdale revealing his \\"A\\" burn scar), but the power of his story keeps this from getting silly.\\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is used to describe outward signs of guilt, but Hawthorne's novel is actually about strength and love, and how they can blot out misdeeds."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Introduction (Custom House) was too long and boring for my taste, if only its purpose was to let the reader know how the author got hold of the manuscript of the Scarlet Letter, and the scarlet letter itself.Nathaniel Hawthorne tackled a very sensitive subject dealing on both the shame and triumph of a woman. It's a pity for women of the 1700s to be treated the way Hester Prynne was. Equality and understanding between the sexes, women's liberation and empowerment have indeed gone a long way since that time, though there are still societies in the present that place a low regard to women. The situation of the society at the time being so, it was remarkable of Hester to be very resilient and faithful - either that was her nature as a very unique woman of her time or probably more because she was a mother looking after the sake of her child.Though short, I took time reading this book as I had to go back not a few times for better understanding of a very dated prose. That notwithstanding, it was very well written as to hold the interest of the reader; it is full of timeless lessons about faith, forgiveness, judgment, humility, love, resilience...the list is endless."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Read it for the first as a school project and fell in love with it.

While I did enjoy it eventually it does have a very slow beginning. It has a good plot though and is a great way to understand the period in which Hawthorne wrote.In my opinion this novel has one major flaw; metaphors. Yes most novels employ literary elements yet Hawthorne goes over board. He will give you a metaphor, give you another metaphor the same thing in case you didn't understand the first one; he will then flat out explain what the metaphor was. After a few chapters of this it gets very tedious and continues on through the book. The metaphors are not difficult to understand, yet he will often give long drawn out metaphors that may take over a page."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"the daughter was a brat. as abusive as the puritans were they really dropped the ball when it came to her. seriously, what ever happen to \\" better to beat the child then let them be damned by the devil\\"?. the story itself has some interesting ideas. such as if the \\"A\\" came from the inside out or the outside in. ultimately, because of the way you choose to answer that question, and who you apply that answer to , does make it a classic. over all, even with its interesting ideas, i didn't find it a very good read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This is required reading for my 16 yr old son...book arrived quickly & in great shape!

Whenever she had to go into public she described her goings as torture, for every single person in town was looking down at her with shame and disgust. As Hester deals with her punishment and her troublesome child, Pearl, Hester learns to use her skills with crafts to help those in need. Honesty is also shown as an essential lesson in Scarlet letter as seen through the downfall of Pastor Dimmesdale, who refuses to tell anyone that he was Hester's partner in sin, in fear that it would ruin his prestige. His evil secret eventually drove him mad and he soon became cursed with visions and serious health problems. He eventually was unable to take the guilt of lying to his congregation and confesses to his followers who became shocked at such an unbelievable confession of such a \\"holy\\" man. Read this book and experience the plot come alive with its dark imagery and masterful writing! I highly recommend this book for those who are interested in historical fiction, and the message of the book will never be forgotten, it encourages the need of forgiveness for the regretful and proves that redemption can be found by anyone."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Written in 1850, The Scarlet Letter is a work of art and brilliance. Hawthorne's intricate writing and entrancing plot make this novel a classic in American Literature. The characters and the symbols they represent can keep even the most critical readers lost in thought. The book itself seems not to be written as merely a story, but rather as a lesson for the reader, often leaving one lost in thought for days after finishing.The book opens with a long, somewhat unnecessary introduction. If you are an impatient reader, skip this. It is not necessary to the overall plot. However, once you move into the actual story, the novel is hard to put away. I spent two weeks reading a novel that I usually could read in two days. The language is dense and the ideas masked and I often found myself re-reading the same paragraph, page, or even chapter just to ensure that I had found the real meaning.The main character, Hester Prynne, is found to have had an adulterous affair with an unknown and unannounced lover and to be with child. Living in a puritan society, her punishment is harsh since the Bible is their law. She is forced to stand on a scaffold with her illegitimate child and bear the discrimination of the town. Furthermore, Hester is required to wear a letter \\"A\\" on her breast to show the extent of her sins for the rest of her life. The priest of the town, the Reverend Dimmsdale, takes pity on her and tries to console Hester and her daughter Pearl. To further complicate things, Hester's husband, a man now known as Chillingworth, returns to the town after a two-year absence. Disgraced by his wife's actions, he pretends to be a physician to avoid any relation with Hester's scandalous acts. The novel progresses through the drama and effects of the psyche on the characters.Overall, the writing style, while sometimes dense and difficult to comprehend, is unique and entrancing to read. A bit forward in his approach, Hawthorne lavishes in detail and thought of the characters, acting as God and narrator. The book, admittedly, is hard to read and often simply confusing as to what Hawthorne is trying to get at. Despite all of these shortcomings, I still find that the novel is one worth reading over and over again. It is one of those books that can be read thirty times, yet still manages to hold another surprise the thirty-first."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I was quite skeptical when my teacher told my class to read this book, as I knew it was another \\"Hawthorne\\" book that the English Department required the students to read. But as soon as I read past the intro where the narrator introduces himself to the readers, I actually found this book quite fascinating and quickly began to appreciate Hawthorne's writing. The Scarlet Letter revolves around the life of a young woman who is branded as an adulteress who must wear a scarlet letter A on her chest. She is ostracized by her town and also has an unforgiving husband who wants to do much harm to her lover. It goes on to chronicle how the young woman, Hester Prynne, overcomes the odds of being ostracized and accepts her sins and grows as a person.One hesitation readers might come across when trying to read this book is its language used by Hawthorne in the book. This was one of my biggest challenges when reading this book because there were times when I did not understand the language and thus could not understand Hawthorne's purpose in writing a certain phrase or sentence. But other than that, I thought that this book was extremely well written not in the sense that it is by a \\"famous\\" writer, but that it teaches readers to question their own morals and ideals. This book is a book that cannot be read only once, as the first time, it is read to be understand but the second time it is read to be enjoyed.Though The Scarlet letter was written in a time where women did not have much say in their societies, it is evident through the narrator's tone that Hawthorne had much respect for women and illustrated Hester as someone who was strong and independent. Because of his illustrations of women as courageous, individual figures, Hawthorne not only depicts one side of the society, but rather two. I understand there are many of you that may find this book boring or just another assignment to be finished, but I strongly suggest you to read The Scarlet Letter because not only does it have a story that is entertaining, it contains lessons that teach us about our own morals that can be applied even 100 years from now."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Hester Pryn is a flawed selfish vain young woman who at the beginning of this novel has been caught by the Puritans for the Crime of Adultery and punished by being forced to wear a scarlet letter, the letter A, for all to see so they may know her crime Adultery which she will have to wear until she repents and names the man with whom she sinned (he turns out to be the colony preacher). She has also born a child as a consequence of her misbehavior.Her husband offers to reconcile If she repents and names her seducer. (He's ready to believe she is a victim).Her vanity prevents her.This is a novel of flawed people. Pryn's vanity. The parson's moral doubts. Chillingsworth's fury.A nice period piece. It is really hard to sympathize with anyone other than Pearl, Hester Pryn's daughter.Ironicy I find myself wondering about Chillingsworth, once he gets his revenge he just ages up and dies but before he dies he makes Pearl his heir giving her a vast fortune."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"It is not as much about adultery as it is about the corruption of unconfessed and unforgiven sin. Adultery is simply a vehicle for the author to deliver the underlying message and compare the lives, minds and souls of two sinners and the secret they share. The writing is in the Puritan style which befits the time period and the mindset of the characters. Some have complained about the language as being outdated but this is not a valid concern. The book should be read as the author intended. The style becomes easy to read with exposure to other period works. The Puritans preached much about sin as the evil of evils and how it corrupted the entire being. The true scarlet letter is the one worn within that sears the soul and not the one worn without. Hester's sin leads to redemption. Her public humiliation and shame is simply a mirror of the sin hidden within the people she lives with. Her public punishment is an expression of other's fear of contamination by sin as self judgment turned outward. The error of the townspeople is in their hardness of heart in failing to pray and help bring the sinner home. Here, piety itself becomes religion rather than love of God and fellow man. Such outward piety without true love is a stumbling block to salvation and is paradoxically sinful. Shame and fear of public humiliation and becomming an outcast stands in the way of confession of sin and ultimately forgiveness and salvation. Hawthorne hangs the millstone around the neck of false and self-deceptive piety. This is timeless lesson and the stuff of great literature."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I liked this book as I was reading it. It was really interesting to see Puritan life through Hester Prynne's eyes. I think one reason that I liked it has to do with the fact that I skipped reading the first part, \\"The Custom House.\\" I didn't read it when the teacher told the class to read it, and I wrote a paper on it and got an A.All in all, a good book, but I don't think I would've gotten through more than half of it if I hadn't been pushed into it by my English class. Looking back, though, I'm glad I read it because a lot of other works have some thing(s) in common with \\"The Scarlet Letter,\\" and it would be a shame to graduate with a degree in English without reading it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"While it's true that Hawthorne's style requires concentration, one is rewarded for one's efforts with total immersion in the alternately stark and lush atmosphere that permeates The Scarlet Letter, in both emotional and physical terms. The narrator makes his observations as an outsider, not pretending to know exactly what is going on, but nonetheless giving us many spot-on psychological insights. As a modern reader I wonder is Pearl autistic? Is Dimmesdale bipolar? Hawthorne's non-judgemental observations on shame and avoidance are especially poignant. Personally I love Hawthorne's style, but I love learning new words in my lucubrations. :)My main reason for writing this review, however, is to warn people that this edition includes copious typos. As noted above, I like to look up words, and I had the dangest time finding the meaning for 'daim' on pages 9 and 121 before I compared them and realized they were typos for 'claim'. By the time I got to 'sweemess' on page 252 I knew it must be a typo, as many other such instances had occurred throughout the book. Typos are always annoying but they are pernicious in a book which contains much archaic language. Shame on the editors at Everyman's Library. I will not purchase their editions in the future."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I think that the book was ok. The only thing that I didn't like about it was the fact that there wasn't enough talking amoung the characters in the book. Even though I couldn't understand some of the words in the book, I recommend this book to people who like a good, challenging book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I thought this book was an excellent piece of writing. The symbolism surrounding such objects as the &quot;A&quot; itself, the blacken weeds, and the sign in the sky make the story deep, and leave much of it open for interpretation. Hawthorne's use of details was also very good. His descriptions added so much to the plot and setting, but mostly to the symbolism of the book. I think the book is definitely a &quot;must read.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Having to read this book over the summer was not the right atmosphere for a high school student. I appreciated the book's deep symbolism and rich emotion. These aspects had a great impact on me, especially the significance of Pearl who connects the two adulterers. Unfortunately, reading this book was a summer assignment and I would rather do other summer activities. The diction in Nathaniel Hawthorne's works are noted among high school students as having a syntatic permutation. We usually do not understand the point of his works until we have read it over a few times or until the teacher has given us the explanation. It is a great book, especially in the right atmosphere, but high school students should also look at the Cliffs Notes if they have a difficulty in understaning it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter is one of the most fascinating and interesting books I have ever read. It questions people's integrity and standards, along with forcing people not to underestimate one's capability of being infalliable. Hester Prynne is a perfect example of how one can have a ruined reputation and still choose to do good."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I imagine that people who read this book in the days it was first published had mixed views pertaining to the story of a woman who is scorned for committing adultery. There were those who likely condemned the book (priests, conservative high-class citizens), while others heralded its many themes and praised its originality (women, other authors, and open-minded beings). I give this book five stars for Hawthorne's ability to move people to so many feelings, including myself, with his diction, his syntax, and his endless use of literary devices to convey Hester Prynne's suffering, the downfall of a minister loved by his parishioners, and a man whose lust for revenge feeds on itself time and again. Speaking from experience, in reading this, one must look over each sentence very carefully and shred it to pieces in order to gain the fully intended information which Hawthorne wished for readers to digest. While not the easiest read of one's life, it is certainly one of the most enlightening, with its naturistic and societal themes that set it apart from other works of any time period. This tapestry of Puritan life stands as a brilliant example of a novel that will touch many more in years that follow."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote a prolific and profound novel. Who couldn't feel Hester Prynne's pain, Arthur Dimmesdale's shame? Was I the only one who felt hatred towards Roger Chillingsworth? As a 16 year old sophomore, I was not happy when I was told I had to read this book. I am glad that I did. My honors English teacher told our class to read the book, write an essay, and take a test on it. I wish she would have spent more time examining the characterization, setting, and symbolism that Hawthorne used to create his stunning novel of sin, guilt, and redemption."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter is not a dull book if you get into it. It is true that it's language can be hard to read and understand at times, but that does not make it uninteresting. The main story, may not be considered exciting, but the novel is full of literary elements that make it a good book. Several faults are pointed to in this &quot;perfect&quot; Puritain town in which the story takes place. The book uses good elements like foreshadowing, foil characters, and a lot symbolism. A main point of the book is Hester's admiting her guilt as compared to her &quot;lover's&quot; hiding his guilt. I'm not going to tell you who she had the affair with, but it will be soon figuared out when you see the signs of his scarlet letter. The book may not be as exciting as some, but don't let this keep you from reading it, because it really is good."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Call me a sucker for classics, well I am. This novel brings forth issues that are still with us today. Yes, the book was written over 100 years ago, but it deals with Single mothers in a two-parent society and how the outsiders to the situation (townspeople) deal with Hestor Prynne and her daughter, Pearl. Even today we seem to look down upon single mothers as nothings, even though they are doing the best they can to raise their child(ren) and to survive themselves. Nathaniel Hawthorne seems to be writing about not only the early settlers, but also about HIS time and OUR time all in the same book. I give it five stars because of it's beautiful discription of the trials and tribulations of single-parenthood."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter is a good book, although it can be difficult to read. It is a book in which a young and beautiful woman, Hester, has committed a very serious sin of that time and is being punished by wearing a scarlet &quot;A.&quot; The letter begins to take on new meanings throughout the book and this shows a unique way in which bad things may come to represent some good things. The book also represents opposites. Chillingworth and Dimmsdale live under the same roof and are totally opposite from one another. Both have different goals that they are trying to achieve. Dimmsdale is trying to find happiness, forgiveness, and strength to confess. Chillingworth is like a leach to Dimmsdale in that he is trying to draw the life out of him and every means to happiness that he may ever have. The book showed symbolism through different aspects that really made you think about what the author was trying to express to you."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I read this book for English class and liked it, here is the essay I wrote on it. The scarlet Letter is permeated with polarity and duality. polarity is the existence of doubles. In the Scarlet, opposites exist side by side and doubles exist side by side. In accordance to the foreshadowing, &quot;No sensible man, it was confessed, could doubt on which the victory would turn. The people looked with an unshaken hope, to see the minister come forth out of the conflict transfigured with the glory which he would unquestionably win,&quot; good will eventually overcome evil. Dimsdale and Chillingworth live side by side under the same roof; yet, they are different in many ways. Each looks very different from the other; whereas Dims is a pale and attractive young man, Chill is a dark and ugly old man. Hetser's feelings towards the two men foil. Hester stays in the land where she is scorned just out of love for Dims; however, Hester depicts her feelings for Chill as, &quot;I hate him! He betrayed me! He has done me worse than I did him!&quot; Even the townspeople view Chill as the healer of the body and Dims as the healer of the soul. Dim's words &quot;affected them like the speech of an angel&quot;; however, the people would probably be cautious of Chill's words, &quot;a large number affirmed that Chill's aspect had undergone a remarkable change,&quot; maybe into something demonic. By being opposites who live under the same roof and exist in the same story, Dims and Chill is an example of polarity. Hester and Dims living in the same colony in the same story is another example of polarity since they are opposites of eachother. Hester is justified, she had the courage to announce her sin even though she knew she'd be publicly scorned; Dims, on the other hand, is not justified, he was too proud to admit his sin and so should not have been idolized by the people. - i'm goin to stop now though i'm not finished"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I will never understand why they force this book on school children, I'm sure there are many other \\"classic\\" stories that could be included in the curriculum."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I ordered the Penguin edition for this book five weeks before my grad class started.

Actually, I didn't find it necessarily boring, just not very exciting. However, like many people I had to read it fo high school, and while I can't say I agree we should have to read it in high school (since even Honors students have trouble with it), I can see why it's a classic. It's just a more adult classic, that's all.It can be hard to understand, and it is extremely slow-paced. But Hawthorne, in my opinion, has an insightful and intelligent way of writing. He spends lots of time describing and it seems like almost nothing happens. For that reason, this is definitely not a book for everyone."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book was very boring. Only at the end was I somewhat interested in who the father was and what Roger Chillingworth would do.

It is full of metaphors."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Although The Scalet Letter is superbly written and there is no denying the greatness of Nathanel Hawthorne, I must admit that the book was, perhaps, a bit on the dry side. Hawthorne, himself having grown up in Puritan Salem, writes from first-hand experience of the unwavereing rigidity and intolerance of Puritan society. Hester Prynne, having committed the unthinkable sin of adultery and conceiving her illegitimate child Pearl, becomes a veritable pariah as she is forced to live on the outskirts of town and wear the ignominious scarlet letter A on her bosom for eternity.In sanctimonious colonial Salem, Hester's impropriety is tantamount to murder in today's society. She, however, should not have to bear the guilt alone. As they say, it takes two to tango. Reverend Dimmesdale, in his absolute cowardice, is just as, if not moreso, guilty than Hester. Furthermore, the biggest coward and hypocrite proves to be none other than her spineless husband, Roger Chillingworth. I must say that the reading was at times a bit laborious, but a good read nonetheless. I must further confess that the movie version with Demi Moore is much more rewarding, although the book should undoubtedly be read first."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Well I read this book and it amazed me.

I consider this cruel and unusual punishment. I believe there are some consitutional laws that prevent schools from giving kids this big slop of boring inside about 300 pages. Its the reason why kids these days hate reading, because before they have time to read anything exciting and interesting they have to read stuff like the Scarlet Letter. The only reason Nathaniel Hawthorne is a classic is because he wrote fancy and he is dead. In fact Hawthorne never wrote an interesting word in his life. Its like he went out of his way to bore people to death. Now I know there wasn't much around to inspire good stories back than but I didn't think it was this bad. He drags on a plot that shouldn't of lasted more than 30 pages into a whole freakin novel! Pure insanity that kids are forced to read terrible bore fests like Hawthorne."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book was awful! Now I'm sorry for the length of the next paragraph, but I feel it is important for you to understand who is writing this review.OK...I read this book in my High School American Literature course, like many of the people posting reviews, and I can safely say it is the worst book I have ever read. I wasn't a \\"big\\" fan of reading when I read this book, but I am alot more interested now after having read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" and \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" (If you want an ACTUAL masterpiece, read the aforementioned two books...especially \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\".) I also didn't HATE reading either so DON'T take my review as that of a stupid HS kid who just hates reading anything!Now, back to The Scarlet Letter and why it is so overrated. 1. The writing style is terrible, the book is nothing but run-on sentences filled with buzzwords that an idiot would use to make himself sound important, describing some insignificant detail you (the reader) didn't care about in the first place!!! THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF WORDS PER SENTENCE IS 22.1! THAT IS IN THE 80TH PERCENTILE FOR RUN-ON SENTENCE STATISTICS! also every character speaks the same way, whether it's a stately politician, a valued clergyman, or a 3 year old child, every character speaks with a sophisticated vocabulary, flawless grammar and perfect syntax...How dreadfully unrealistic! 2. The symbolism in the book is written at a 5th Grade level at best. The use of symbols is so shallow I wondered why Hawthorne even put them in! 3. {HUGE COMPLAINT} The plot is very \\"intangible.\\" This is a bit hard to explain, but I'll do my best. In most books, something is actually happening (ex. the characters are trying to get rich or are caught up in a war or looking for a whale or something.)In this book, nothing is physically happening...the main character is just going through hum drum daily activities (that are hardly mentioned in the book) while the whole book is written about the metaphysical changes and such. EVERY CHAPTER is about somebodys \\"soul\\" or their histrionic emotions or whatever, it made me want to puke! I am a very logical, unemotional person and having to read fifty paragraphs about the inner feelings of the main character and every petty character she casully walks by on the street was not my idea of a page-turner. I like books that show how a character is feeling because it adds depth to the character, but in this case there wasn't enough character interaction to emphasize the thimble of plot this book contained. 4. {Another big complaint) The story is about the struggles of a woman named Hester Prynne...alright...let me just say that by the end you are \\"supposed\\" to be in tears over what a courageous-hero this women is for putting up with all her hardships (this emotional response the author hoped the invoke is the WHOLE point of the book). NOW let me tell you why this sentiment is flawed. HESTER PRYNNE IS A CHEAP FLOOZY!!! I have no idea why people can't understand this point. The woman is married to a good professional man and she goes and decides to have a one-night-stand with the town minister, gets knocked-up, and the town realizes she is an adulterer when she bears her misbegotten child. Now the book is set in Puritan society, a strict, religious society that was prone to burning/hanging people out of fear of witchcraft or sin, and instead of being executed in the name of the lord (as one who broke the ten commandments surely would have been in those days) She gets a letter embroidered on her dress to make her an outcast! To make her punishment (if it can so be called a punishment) even more lenient, about halfway through the book the townspeople begin respecting her again! Meanwhile, her husband has been driven insane by his lust to find her secret lover who has also gone masochistically insane with guilt. AFTER ALL THIS I AM SUPPOSED TO FEEL SORRY FOR THIS NYMPHOMANIAC!?! Well I didn't. She got off easy for an act that ruined the lives of every other character in the book. 5. There are to many complaints about this book to list! The Scarlet Letter doesn't have a resolution!!! Instead of thinking up an interesting ending to the book, Nathaniel Hawthorne (probably bored to tears from typing this crumby world of plot holes and spelling errors) decided to save time by having nearly every primary character die in the last couple of chapters! LITERALLY, The last chapter just describes what happened all the characters (Animal House style) and nearly every one of them randomly died. Wow what a deeply brilliant ending, he must have let his dog write the last chapter.Please save yourself the agony and leave this one on the bookshelf. By the end of reading this I felt angry at the school for having violated my precious mind with this boring waste of paper. If you want to simulate reading this book why don't you stare into your toilet for a few hours.

As a 10th grade student in American Literature who personally enjoys reading, I was throughly disgusted. There are much better classic American works that would have served the same purpose. The novel also holds little relevance in today's world, for example religion is not the law of the land. Hawthorne's elegant and complicated style frustrates and maddens the reader. After spending long hours reading I had hardly made a dent in the book. Normally, I am pretty fast reader but this book just took forever. I had to look up so many words because I had no idea what they ment. Even then, many of the words were not even used in today's english. Thanks a lot Webster! Not only that, but every character spoke exactly the same. I don't think a 3 year old is going to speak like a very gifted orator like the Reverend Dimmesdale. It was very difficult to tell who was speaking. The story could be summarized in about 10 pages but instead rambles on for about 220 more than it should. A simple action such as Pearl looking at Hester's &quot;A&quot; includes 10 pages of explanation. I know many kids that actually fell asleep while reading the book, during the middle of the day. Yes, its that boring. Also, the need for Hawthorne to credibilty to his story makes me think. I would have never questioned it if he hadn't felt the need expalin it. I feel as the book is simply a way for Hawthorne to clear his conscience by writing a subject that is near and dear to his heart. Its no secret that Hawthorne was suspected to have had incestous relationships during his lifetime. This fact alone makes me sick, as does the whole book.

The entire \\"custom house\\" introduction lacks any significance whatsoever, and instead of leading readers into the story, the introduction is downright confusing because readers cannot understand what is going on. It takes several reads of the introduction alone to actually understand that the introduction basically has no additional effect on the story itself. In addition, after the story begins to play out, readers have no idea the story has already begun and the introduction is over because Hawthorne continues to bore readers with useless information. Lacking any significance, readers are quick to drop the book and leave it for some other time.Hawthorne uses drawn out paragraphs and sentences, which lure readers to sleep. He focuses on extremely minor details which would be awesome if they did anything to help the readers. Yes Hawthorne can create the somber mood and depressing settings, yet nothing goes on in the actual plot to really capture the readers' interest. The action is dull as readers wait for something profound and exciting to happen; however, Hawthorne continues to tease his readers by making them think something drastic will happen in the end. Unfortunately, even the most pivotal parts of the story are downplayed as they do not really do anything or affect other characters in extreme ways. Along with the actions, the character themselves are too one-dimensional and boring. Each character has an uninteresting personality, and few readers can even connect with any of them, making each character appear distant and detached. It is as if they are not human and the readers tire out quickly trying to understand the purpose of each character. In essence, readers tire out trying to understand the story at all.On a brighter note, Hawthorne does incorporate a great deal of symbols. Readers can be fasinated by the purpose of each symbol and how it affects the story. Sadly, Hawthorne may try to emphasize the symbols to much and are no longer subtly entwined into the story itself.For any reader, The Scarlet Letter is a complete and utter bore, as many would be able to find any quality substance in the work itself or comprehend the story for what Hawthorne was trying to say."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"In all honesty, this book was really hard to understand. Then again, I've never really been a big fan of the classics. But I got bored way too easily, and I honestly thought the last thirty or forty pages were the best part."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I'm not giving The Scarlet Letter 3 stars because I think it is a mediocre book; I'm giving the book 3 stars because it is NOT FOR EVERYBODY. This is not a Jon Krakauer book that you can pick up and be gripped cover to cover. It is, however, masterfully written. Characterization is very deep and relevant, and symbolism is huge. One major flaw in this novel's symbolism is that its elements are not as relevant to society as they used to be. However, there exists no better primer on the lessons of guilt, sin, repression, and repentance than The Scarlet Letter.By the way, I'm a high school student who was forced to read this, and let me say this to all the other such people who bashed this book for being boring: Please recognize this as a work of LITERATURE and not as a basis of comparison for RL Stine books.The reason for the 3 stars is because this is not the type of book I reccommend you buy for an airplane trip or anything of the like. This book is masterfully intricate, artistically complex, and worthy of more than just a passing glance over the words on the page..."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"...I looked at the back cover and saw that Henry James called this \\"the finest piece of imaginitive writing yet put forth in the country.\\" For those of you who have read James and find him tedious, prepare yourself for much of the same here. Like James, the prose is robust and at times almost poetic. And like James, it is amazing how a 250 page novel can easily feel like 500 pages.That said, this is a must read for anyone trying to check off the list of American literary classics. Hester Prynne and her scarlet 'A' are cultural references so recognizable that you will surely feel like an outcast among the literary cognoscenti if you happened to avoid this one in high school. There is a reason, however, that they force us to read this in high school, and it's because no reasonable adult would actually choose to read this book of their own free will. Well, except me.It's actually somewhat amusing, in our era of rampant adultery and other forms of sexual promiscuity, to read of a time when a seemingly victimless transgression would cause so much of an uproar. Hawthorne has created quite a period piece with this novel, a vivid, if unidimensional, portrait of the Puritanical roots of our country. Oh, how far we've come..."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"In answer to your first question, yes I was forced to read this book by my Literature teacher.The Scarlet Letter, in its whole, is a metaphor for the urges we experience everyday, and the consequences for indulging ourselves.While this book may be listed as Historical Fiction, I believe it is a Romance. It has elements of both, but its just interesting enough not to be Historical Fiction (Boring being the the most important criterian.)The Scarlet Letter is a Romance because of, simply, urge. Adultery is the word (contrary to popular belief, it is not Grease.)Personally, I thought the Scarlet Letter was mediocre. A book written 150 years ago isn't fared to do well in a modern-day English class (most of my class didn't like it). I think, that when it was written, it was a good book. If my mindset were set some odd century and a half ago, I probably would have appreciated it more."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The author added so much feeling and description in this novel which was very appealing. The way that symbolism, description, suspense, revenge, and romance were all rolled into one wonderful literary piece was excellent. Many books have a lot of description but do not have such an effect on some people's emotions as this story did.Some say that this book is hard to understand. The thing with this novel is that you either have to really get into the book or be used to reading old English. They only thing that was slightly confusing is when the author would add his point of view and the reader would not know who was talking. The language was perfect for the times.This novel is worth reading. The novel is never boring. The author always finds a way to catch attention. The story kept getting more and more complicated. When one of Hester Prynne's problems would seem not as significant, something else would arise. This book has a sad truth for many humans. When we have a problem and suddenly they go away, there is always some other thing that accompanies its end.This book is just right for the high school reading level. The reading can be challenging for some students while others will like the pace. High school students should be presented some challenges with such readings. Education and literacy are the backbone to this country. To get a good job when you are older, we should be challenged."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"One ofthe greatest novels in all of literature, The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, tells of a life vastly different from those that we live today. Rejecting the present permissive lifestyle to which we were accustomed, the reader is entrenched in the gloom and doom of Puritan society. It is an exposure to a law that tells what to wear, how to think, and whom to love. The Scarlet Letter is a story of law versus human nature, hypocrisy, and of undeniable passions.Enlightening and refreshing, the reader is taken on an adventure and fully understands the risks of living passionately, beyond the limits that society sets. A novel that can be enjoyed by all ages, The Scarlet Letter is a masterpiece of its time."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"While the life of a modern person of Christian faith may not be well-reflected in this book, the ideas are.The struggle of legalism vs. liberality... truth vs. lies... faith vs. fear. Boiled down, in one respect, is the question of what makes a true Christianity, the sort who has as much integrity as claimed. Living as Christ would live is a high standard, and Hawthorne demonstrates the multi-layered issues fallible people deal with.True to the genre and period of writing, Hawthorne is as much of a character as the ones he writes about. While today's novels are embroiled in myopic first person narratives, &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; enjoys the psychological unravelling of characters through analysis, observation and deduction.&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; asks questions we no longer ask, and draws out intrigue as the reader page-by-page wonders what is the best response to a Christian woman who has given birth outside of wedlock, and what response is appropriate for the dodging minister.

When I finished the book, my expectations were fulfilled. The book is written in puritan plainstyle and has virtually no dialouge for you to enjoy... But the book creates great emphasis on sin and adultery.Hester Prynne commites adultery and is condemned throughout society. Basically this book deals well on the subject of bravery, courage, the Puritan ethic, and the way society ran in New England (it also implied how women are strong enough to brave humiliation and condemnation in society and how men can be spineless cowards). Even though it's not a book you can absorb and finish in one reading, after I read it I got some insight on the Puritans and why Hawthrone wrote the way he did.

Soon her husband returns, very much alive, yet hidding the fact of being hesters husband. Hester is forced to wear a scarlet letter A, A standing for adultry, on her clothes for the rest of her life.

The specifics are nonsense to just about any other time than those of the Puritans, but the humanity is still the same. It's a story so easy to relate to because we have our own scarlet letter or letters. Our own scarlet letter might be our appearance or our lack of education. Read the book and do not concern yourself of those who say the book is difficult. It is not.

This book is an absolute masterpiece and one of the great pieces of Art by an American--and I thought that in 9th grade when I read it for the first time.People who don't like the book are not immersing themselves in it. You have to shut out all distractions because every word and scene is so critical.

It's message is subtle, yet pervasive: that people we punish as &quot;sinners&quot; are often far more noble than their punishers. Judge not, lest ye be judged.

It also has a very believable moral message, which makes it the classic known around the world. Classic is a repulsive word though, this book doesn't contain all the boring and repetitive characteristics of classics written 6,000 years ago. The book isn't just some ancient work written in an Italian province either. It was written here in america, maybe a little under 200 years ago. Classic maybe, but this is the only classic I'll read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne is a superb writer of American history with an interesting story to tell. When he first wrote this story he was told, probably by the an editor or publisher, that the story needed to be longer so that it would be considered a novel. So he went back and incorporated filler and massive detail into his story and that is the book you have before you today. If you don't read this, you are missing out. It may not have dinosaurs eating people on a remote island or worse yet San Diego, or any other worthless s***, but it was written with actual talent.

The subject matter is deep for its time, I doubt too many books were written about the topics of sex and adultery in the mid 1800s! Hawthorne was ahead of his time. But adultery and lust are not the only sins on display here. Greed, vengenence, jealousy, hypocricy, shame and guilt are all touched on in great detail. I always thought this was a brave choice for the curriculum of my all-girl Catholic high school honors English class! The class was not taught by a nun, thank goodness, and it most likely would not have been, given the subject matter. We were uncomfortable enough to have our male English teacher address the topics of this book! All that aside, though, the book is a timeless classic and I hope that it is still on the high school curriculum reading lists across the country. It gives us all something to think about and it does teach us, indirectly perhaps, how to deal with the fall-out of our actions and choices. We are mere humans and the flesh is weak -- that's a given. How we deal with the consequences and the guilt determines our character and our destiny, as much, if not more so, than our acts themselves. To commit adultery like Hester, and OWN it, by admission (or accusation), is HONORABLE -- because Hester didn't cover it up or lie to save face for herself or her child. They both held their heads high, or learned to eventually, which is why they were able to live their lives. Hester's lover, however, hid behind his act -- lived in shame and tried desperately to cover up his (and Hester's) actions. This is the same as denial. He therefore denied Hester and their daughter. His outcome was not so good. And the Puritan community revealed their own dirty laundry in how they treated Hester and Pearl. Life lessons for us all -- I think the worst anyone could be is a hypocrit. Don't pretend to be something you're not. Hypocrits are among the worst of sinners. (and THAT can be found throughout the Bible! Sinners who admitted their sins and owned up to them were always saved. Those who hid behind their sin and acted self-righteously, were almost always condemned). There's a bit of Hester in all of us, no one is without sin. Hester had enough dignity to admit it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I bought this as a present for my dad and he really loves it. It shipped very quickly and I had no problems at all with the order."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This classic novel holds up extraordinarily well more than 150 years after it was written. A staple of middle school and high school reading lists, it carries lessons for both youth and adults, despite being premised on a notion that is completely foreign to our present culture, even the religious wing of the culture.The plot centers around Hester Prynne, a beautiful young woman who has a romance with an unknown man and becomes pregnant. Since this takes place in Puritan America, roughly the 1650s, in Salem, Mass., Hester is shunned by society. Physically, she is unharmed -- though author Nathaniel Hawthorne makes it clear that branding her or killing her would not have been out of the question at the time -- but she is made to wear an embroidered \\"A\\" on her clothing for the rest of her life. In a defiant move that few women would have dared, Hester refuses to name her lover before a public inquiry.Over the next seven years, Hester goes about her business as well as she can. She moves to a hut on the outskirts of the city; she suffers the scorn of preachers and townspeople; and she does not even seek any playmates for her daughter. Gradually, she earns respect from the citizens of the town for her remarkable embroidery skills, her willingness to accept her punishment without complaint, and her dedication to the poor and downtrodden.Meanwhile, Hester's husband -- to her shock and dismay -- arries in Salem. He was presumed to be lost at sea, and it was, presumably, why Hester had her romance with another man. Her husband swears her to secrecy, and he becomes a respected doctor in town. Quickly, he realizes that a brilliant young minister in town was the man who loved Hester -- and that minister is withering away from guilt. The doctor befriends the minister and becomes his physician, yet it is apparent that the doctor is really bent on torturing the doctor for his sin.Matters eventually come to a head. I won't reveal the outcome. But I will make a few observations about the lessons in the story.1. The idea that an affair would leave a person an outcast is hard to imagine in our culture. But, of course, homosexual affairs have ruined the careers of many religious and political leaders (those who made their marks with anti-gay rhetoric). And other countries and religions still punish adulterers viciously: see Iran, for example.2. While the book's premise takes some work for today's teens to understand, it delivers other lessons nonetheless. The first is that a secret, a betrayal has a strong emotional component. It hurts people, regardless of whether it is \\"right\\" or \\"wrong.\\" That's a lesson that all teens should learn as they start dating. Second, nobody is perfect. Though we don't learn about sins of other people in the town, Hawthorne makes it clear that there are other adulterers and sinners of other types. The third lesson is that a person who is wronged (the doctor) cannot use his hurt to then hurt others (the minister and Hester). Ultimately, the doctor is the least sympathetic figure in the book; and that's a remarkable perspective for Hawthorne to provide 150 years ago.3. The book feels contemporary because the narrator (Hawthorne) regularly interposes his comments that, to paraphrase, state, \\"In those old, unenlightened days, the following was done, but we have moved behond it today.\\" However, as savvy readers will note, there's more than a touch of sarcasm in Hawthorne's comment, as he is using the past to comment on the problems of contemporary society, too. And those problems are still with us, albeit in altered form.So, read the book. Work with the difficult language and compound sentences and lengthy allusions to how our appearance and the random events of nature reflect our inner emotions. Revel in the descriptions of dress, architecture, speech, and daily life that are so far from our own -- and yet, raise the same emotional issues that we face today."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Much to my amazement, this book has been placed on banned lists in several states. It's an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt. Although the story does allude frequently to adultery, there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom. Both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Is \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" worthy of being considered a classic? Why do some love it and some hate it? These are questions that played through my mind when I picked up this book. I'm a fan of some of Hawthorne's short stories--\\"Ethan Brand,\\" \\"The Bosom Serpent,\\" \\"Young Goodman Brown,\\" among others--but I found his novel, \\"The House of the Seven Gables,\\" long and plodding.Boy, was I in for a surprise!Yes, this book employs an antiquated style of English dialogue and sentence structure. True, the introductory chapter about the Custom-House can seem tedious. (And, if your edition comes with a modern introduction, please skip it till after you've read the book, since many of these misguided pages give away the book's key twists.) Once I got into the actual story, though, I was hooked. I took my time. I invested in each page, each paragraph, giving myself to the story of Hester Prynne, a woman whose child out of wedlock has revealed her adultery and subjected her with a lifetime of wearing a red A upon her chest, a fair warning to all, a constant reminder of her sin and shame.Hester faces her guilt and tries to amend her ways. Hester's husband, who was thought lost at sea, makes an anonymous appearance in the community, even as the man responsible for Hester's child tries to bear the weight of his own sin in secret--and begins to physically and emotionally wither beneath that burden.Despite Hester's reputation as a worthy seamstress, the town leaders want to take away her young daughter and give her to parents who will set a better example. Hester confronts the leaders head-on, feeling that her daughter is the one thing she has left to live for, and the one good thing that has come from her mistake. This issue becomes minor as her former husband sets into motion his own plans for revenge, and as her former lover faces the loss of his position and title, if not his very soul and breath, should his identity become known.This is a novel full of symbolism, dealing with the legalistic, harsh world of the Puritans, and the religious mindset that can become focused on shaping lives for God instead of letting God shape lives. It was written around the time of the Salem witch trials, a time when stocks and pillories were still in vogue. It is a world unfamiliar to most modern readers, particularly high school students forced to read this cumbersome style, but it shows stark parallels with the fundamentalism that still rules in much of our world today.Can sin be paid for by personal shame and humiliation? Can sin that remains hidden dissolve, or does it eventually come to light? What happens when family secrets become public? Even worse, what happens when they are buried?I loved this book, once I committed myself to enjoying its older style and prose. Hawthorne creates unforgettable characters in Hester, Pearl, Mr. Dimmesdale, and Mr. Chillingworth. He imbues his writing with a respect for faith, yet a disdain for the religious guises that often try to walk hand in hand with it. He shows great respect for women and their struggles, far ahead of his time. He challenges readers to move beyond the harsh judgments of others and look into our own souls. Who does not bear the stain of wrongdoing? Is it better to bring such things into the light, or to hide them in darkness and await the results? These are still timely issues in politics, church, and homes, issues that Hawthorne addresses with much courage considering his own setting and upbringing.Should this be considered a classic? Yes. Will most high school readers appreciate it? No. This is a story to be savored by those who will invest their time, as well as their mental and spiritual energy, to its ideas. If that's you, then you will come away richer for the experience. I certainly did."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"In seventeenth century Boston, scholar Roger Chillingworth returns to the Puritan colony after two years in England. He is stunned to find his much younger lovely wife Hester Prynne with an illegitimate daughter Pearl, a resident of Prison awaiting trial for adultery. Hester refuses to betray her lover for his condemnation for violating one the God's Commandments. Her punishment is to wear a capital Letter A on her breast for the rest of her life. Roger vows to expose the cretin who dishonored him. For refusing to reveal her lover's identity, she is condemned to wear a letter 'A' sewn onto her clothes. Driven to madness, Roger resolves to discover and destroy the man who has stolen his honor. Over the next few years, Hester does her best by her daughter while suffering poverty, humiliation and guilt for what she cannot offer her beloved Pearl; while the two men not in her life fail to cope with crippling guilt, remorse and cowardliness.As he did with another classic Jane Eyre, Wayne Josephson provides a modernization of the syntax of the language while adhering to Nathaniel Hawthorne's powerful moral message that rings true today with for instance the abortion controversy. Purists will insist if it isn't broke don't fix it, but Mr. Josephson makes a strong case that the 1850 published novel is going the way of the Canterbury Tales (let the purists read that in ye olde English). The re-touch is a bit more than desired, as part of the original is the overdrawn atmospheric background of a martinet paternal society invoking God's wrath. Still Mr. Josephson does a super job of making this great classic starring a brave heroine much easier to read and very entertaining while enhancing the strong message of forgiving oneself as well as others for \\"sins\\".Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's famous book THE SCARLET LETTER has been transformed into cinematic versions both for television and for theaters, having been written about one of the first feminists in history! But how many have actually read the 288 page Hawthorne original? Few, likely, for as interesting and classic the story is, it is a bit inaccessible to the modern reader who finds Hawthorne's prose bogged down by interminable sentence structure and heavy paragraphs. Yes, there is charm in reading the original, basking in the old version of English verbiage, but many readers feel the bulk of the narrative burdensome, making the very original tale of a blighted female's courage a strain to discover.Enter Wayne Josephson who has taken the devotion to the classics and the drive to make the great novels once again part of every learned reader's library to heart and is in the process of editing the great books (his JANE EYRE is remarkably fine!). Here Josephson has gently removed the weighty verbiage that stops the eye and what results is an immensely readable, still atmospheric, 208 page version/condensation of Hawthorne's THE SCARLET LETTER. Now, without the unnecessarily redundant adjective and references too heavy to dissect, is a version of a novel that reads even better than the original - as though Nathaniel Hawthorne had submitted his manuscript to an editor of his times, this being the revision that results in publication for the public. This version is some eighty pages shorter than the original, a size that allows the reader to comfortable digest the book in one evening. That is the joy of reading Josephson's intelligent, sensitive editing: none of the pleasure of the novel is removed, but the story now flows smoothly and is far less stilted. Hopefully Wayne Josephson will continue his quest of resurfacing the great books. These versions should be attractive to all types (and ages) of readers. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, December 09"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Through Hawthorne's dynamic characters, he portrays the harsh Puritan society of the 18th century. This story is more than a social commentary though. The struggle of good and evil within the human soul, the concept of right and wrong, love and hate are all addressed as Hawthorne delves into the darkest recesses of the human soul. This is a classic."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Sin, guilt, shame, jealousy, dignity, reputation. These words describe the sinful past of Rev. Dimmesdale and Hester, and the aftermath of its torment and ignominy. In a Puritan Society, adultery is punished by carrying the burden of one's sin- wearing a humiliating scarlet letter.While Hester sees her sin as an opportunity to personally grow and develop sympathy toward human nature, society views sin as an obstacle that will prevent one from reaching heaven.The ironic character of Hester demonstrates her strong will and personality. Given the option to leave her town and resume a normal life, Hester prefers to stay and to wear the Scarlet Letter. She also gets upset when she is informed that she might be officially redeemed from wearing the scarlet letter. Hester's behavior demonstrates her desire to determine her own identity rather than let others determine it for her. To her, running away or removing the letter would be an acknowledgment of society's power over her: she would be admitting that the letter is a mark of shame and something from which she desires to escape.The book touches on the theme of concealment versus visibility. Dimmesdale is a great orator and respected Reverend yet no one sees the hidden scarlet letter he bears under his religious garment or facade. Hester conceals the identity of Pearl's father and thus she carries the burden of society's punishment on her own.The novel criticizes the interpretation of symbols by gradually making the scarlet letter of less importance. Despite her shameful letter, Hester is able to find a job and raise her child as she wishes. The symbol has no power over her but rather she is proud of wearing it. Even the Native Americans interpret the letter as a sign of distinction and reverence. Hawthorne criticizes the Puritan society and how labeling individuals as redeemed or sinful does not guarantee their salvation or doom."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"In high school I switched English levels, which left me lacking in a lot of classic high school reads. This includes authors from Twain to Salinger and just about every generic book that someone says: \\"Oh, I read that in high school.\\" This weekend I finally gave in to read Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlett Letter and it was brilliant. His short piece The Custom House precedes the story and it was so descriptive and funny and that's certainly one adjective (funny) that I've never heard paired with Hawthorne. Most everyone seems to be familiar with the plot (especially after the 1995 film) and it all together is a rather simple story line: a married woman whose husband has disappeared has an affair and becomes pregnant. She's forced to wear the letter A in scarlet on her bosom as punishment.

I'm sure high school kids all around the country are still reading this book today."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter\\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a story that takes place in the Boston, Massachusetts in the seventeenth century in a Puritan settlement. The story starts off with a young woman by the name of Hester Prynne being lead from the town prison with scarlet colored embroidery A on her chest and a newborn baby to the center of the town to be judged and scolded by the town's ministers. Hester had been sent to Boston by her husband whom she was to later meet up with however her husband never arrived with many thinking that he was lost at sea. During the time that Hester was waiting on her husband she met someone, had an affair and now had a baby out of wedlock and she was being punished for adultery. Hester's punishment was to wear the scarlet A and public shaming because she refused to tell the identity of her child's father.When Hester was taking the shameful walk to the center of the town an elderly man by the name of Roger Chillingsworth wanted to know what the young lady was in trouble for and one of the crowd bystanders told him that it was for adultery. Soon it is revealed that Roger Chillingsworth is the husband of Hester Prynne that everyone thought was lost out to sea. Roger Chillingsworth was now in Boston practicing medicine and set on getting revenge on his wife. Roger then revealed his true identity to his wife Hester however he makes her swear to secrecy and not tell his true identity.The puritan community tried to take Hester's daughter Pearl but with the help of a young minister by the name of Arthur Dimmesdale Hester is able to keep her daughter and live on the outskirts of town. Arthur Dimmesdale however had suddenly come down with a heart problems and health was steadily declining. Chillingworth moves in the Dimmesdale so that he can provide around the clock care for his patient while at the same time trying to see what information he could get from out the minister because he had suspicions about the minister and Hester.One Night when Hester and her daughter Pearl were returning home the found Arthur Dimmesdale standing on the scaffold in the center of the town trying to punish himself. Pearl, Hester and Arthur held hands and during this time of the story we find out that Arthur is the father of pearl. Pearl asked her father to publicly acknowledge her and when he refused a dull red A light up the night sky. Hester then asked Chillingsworth to stop adding to Dimmesdale torment that he was taking himself through and Chillingsworth so filled with anger and revenge refuses to. Hester planned a meeting with Dimmesdale in the forest because she figured that Chillingsworth knew she was going to tell Dimmesdale that Chilllingsworth really was her husband. They planned to go to settle in Europe and raise their daughter Pearl there and live as a family. They were supposed to leave in four days and the day before they were supposed to leave Dimmesdale delivered his best sermon and Hester found out that Chillingsworth had found out about their plans and had bought a ticket on the same boat to follow them to Europe.After leaving the sermon the minister saw Pearl and Hester standing on the scaffold in town so he went up there and joined them revealing a red A on his chest and publicly announced that he was Pearl's father. Then Arthur falls dead after Pearl kissed him. Chillingsworth was so angry with revenge that he died a year later. Pearl and Hester left Boston and many years later Hester returned alone to live in her little cottage on the outskirts of town still wearing her scarlet A. When she died she was buried next to Dimmesdale and they shared one headstone that had just a scarlet A on it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The classic psychological romance novel, \\"The Scarlet Letter,\\" offers panoply of moral dilemmas that make the book influential today, but Nathaniel Hawthorne presents a detailed, if unfavorable, portrait of Puritan society in the 1650s that makes the novel engrossing to buffs of American History. The challenging vocabulary and obscure historical references make this story a bit harder to for today's readers to digest, but this classic is worth the effort to read.The Chamberlain Brothers edition from Signet Classics is loaded with extras. The ten page introduction from a professor of Modern Literary and Historical Studies at Union College gives the reader some insights into Hawthorne, and explains the Preface and The Customs House that precede the actual 24-chapter symmetrical novel. The signet version concludes with a short story, \\"Endicott and the Red Cross,\\" which introduces the scarlet letter punishment and provides the basis for some early scenes to the \`Poverty Row\\" movie that accompanies this book.The DVD of the 1934 production of \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is a nice accompaniment to the novel, since it is largely faithful to it. A short afterword by a screenwriter, film producer, and teacher compares and contrasts the movie's adherence to Hawthorne's story, and provides interesting insights into the actors that star in the movie.TheCliff's Notes to Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letterserved as a useful companion to the story. Rather than lug around a dictionary to look up complicated words, the Cliff Notes made it easy for the reader to look up the challenging vocabulary in the story. In addition, the obscure historical references are explained in the context to the story. The chapter summaries were also useful, particularly in deciphering the middle chapters (9-11), which focus on the psychological battle between the two male main characters of the novel.Hawthorne's portrayal of Boston in the 1650s includes several real-life characters who were Puritan administrators, such as Richard Bellingham and John Winthrop. The Puritan Clergyman John Wilson was also a real-life character, as was the Puritan Missionary to the Indians, John Eliot. Even the character Ann Hibbins was the sister of Governor Bellingham, and was executed by the colony for witchcraft. Although Hawthorne's use of these real-life characters was a literary device to make his story appear more real, they also help the reader understand some of the important personalities in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.Reading classic novels such as this one help the reader obtain useful cultural details that the history books don't necessarily provide."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I thought this book would be much better.

Hawthorne does an excellent job of describing every nuance of this story, and that is why at times it is a little hard to follow. But the very heart of the story is one that we all can compare with. Hester Prynne has committed a terrible sin, and bears The Scarlet Letter on her breast. This classic tale begins with Hester on the gallows platform, alone with her baby, Pearl. Throughout the course of thise novel, Hawthorne weaves his way through characters so that you feel you are a part of this story, and by the end you have no doubts in your mind how you feel about each character. This is a book that you will either love or hate, and it really depends on when you read it. Try to take your time through the book the first time you read it, then everything will make much more sense, and you won't throw down the book in disgust. On a side note, you can really skip the introduction chapter entitled &quot;The Custom House&quot; because it has little to do with the rest of the book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Hawthorne's novel of sin and the quest for utopia is sublime. The language is rich, and the novel is filled with religious symbolism. No work of American literature quite captures America's search for 'the Holy Land' while showing the affect that such a myopic quest can have on the individual. Hawthorne, while roundly criticizing the more zealous of his faith, never leaves us wondering whether or not forgiveness is possible for the penitent. Through the strength of the lead character, Hester Prynne, the author conveys to us the power of love that exudes those of us who have recognized our own faults and worked to heal the wounds our ill deeds have caused. This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in American literature."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"\\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is one of those books you start out reading because you had to finish it for a class assignment; or because you never got around to reading it in school but you feel you should because it's a so-called \\"classic\\", and end up getting hooked and realizing it's a classic for a good reason: it's a timeless story that resonates as much in our own time as when it was written, centuries ago. At the center of the book is Hester Prynne, a young wife in puritan New England, trapped in a loveless marriage with a man old enough to be her father, sent ahead of him to the new world while he takes care of business in the old. But before he can join her, she falls in love and into an affair, and nine months later, the result is born for all to see. In colonial New England, where religion controls every aspect of everyone's life, Hester and her lover have committed a horrendous crime, never mind a sin, for which they could both be executed; the powers that be feel they are being lenient with her by condemning her to wear a scarlet letter A, for adultery, prominently displayed on her clothes. Hester shocks the whole village by embroidering the scarlet letter with gold thread and wearing it like a badge of honor. Is this her way of spitting into the eye of the village, or is she making her public dishonor deliberately more shameful as a penance?And who is Hester's lover? The village demands he show himself; Hester, out of pity, love, or contempt, or more probably a mixture of all three, isn't saying. We know early on it's the reverend Dimmesdale, a young preacher beloved and respected by all, but if he doesn't have the courage to come forth himself, Hester will keep his secret. The story isn't a whodunit, who done it is obvious almost from the beginning. The book is about love vs. lust, courage vs. cowardice, and the hypocrisy of public piety covering up a shameful secret. Reverend Dimmesdale can flagellate himself all he wants in private; we can't help but feel contempt for him for not having the guts to share Hester's public humiliation.But as bad as things are for Hester and Dimmesdale, they are about to get infinitely worse with the appearance of Hester's husband, Roger Chillingsworth, who arrives in the new world to find he has been cuckolded by his wife, who has given birth to another man's child, and wants his honor avenged.Hawthorne tells a compelling tale which captures our imagination as much as it did when it was written. We realize these star-crossed lovers don't stand a chance in the uptight society they lived in. The book moves slowly, but in doing so it gives the reader time to think about the timeless issues of love, betrayal, deception, and the social mores that controlled the protagonists lives. Hawthorne raised plenty of questions; the readers will find their own answers."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"\\"All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,\\" might well be Nathaniel Hawthorne's theme in The Scarlet Letter. Certainly, by all community standards Hester Prynne's adultery is a sin. Worse yet Arthur Dimmesdale has triply sinned since he has had carnal knowledge of a member of his flock, and through a deep and abiding cowardice has failed to acknowledge his sin; and what is even worse yet, he allows Hester to bear the weight of public condemnation alone.However the worse sin of all belongs to Roger Chillingworth, Hester's husband who is not dead at all, but returned in disguise as a physician who has learned the efficacy of various medicinal concoctions from the Indians during his captivity. He pretends to befriend Dimmesdale in order to extract his long and torturous revenge. But it is Chillingworth's character itself more than anything that marks him as the worse of the sinners. He lives only for revenge and to give pain and suffering. He cares nothing for his wife and her child. He cares nothing for anyone, not even himself. He lives only to avenge.Dimmesdale's sin is that of a weak character. In a sense Dimmesdale is Everyman, the non-heroic. We see the contrast between the proud bravery of Hester and the all too human weakness of Dimmesdale who cannot bring himself to confess his sin, but looks to her strength to do it for him. We see this in the first scaffold scene as he pleads along with Chillingworth for Hester to reveal the father's identity. \\"Reveal it yourself!\\" we want to say.While some have seen Chillingworth as the devil incarnate--and indeed I suspect that was Hawthorne's intent--it might be closer to the truth to see him as the vengeful God of the Old Testament with his lust to mysterious power and his desire to see the sinful suffer. At any rate, Hawthorne's masterpiece--and it is a masterpiece, one of the pillars of American literature, to be ranked with such great works as Melville's Moby-Dick and Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn--is about sin and the effect of sin; and this is only right since the central tenet of Christianity itself is sin and the forgiveness of sin.By employing and investigating deeply three types of sin--Hester's from love and even something close to innocence; Dimmesdale's from lust, pride, neglect and cowardice; and Chillingworth's from hate--Hawthorne came up with a most felicitous device for examining the human soul.The Scarlet Letter is regularly taught at the high school level, but surely this is a mistake. The novel is difficult and challenging even for honors students. The architectured sentences, with their points and counterpoints, their parallel construction, their old school rhetorical cadences are strange and even wondrous to the modern eye. It is a good practice for the teacher and for the student to read aloud Hawthorne's prose so as to grow accustomed to his words the way one must for Shakespeare. If this is done and the edifice of Christianity and especially the fatalism of the Puritan mind brought to bear, then with leisurely pace and a steady concentration, the terrible beauty of Hawthorne's novel might be made immediate.Although the story itself is compelling, and the prose rich and poetic, the real strength of this great novel is in its characters. How true to life are all of them including even little Pearl who is defiant and willful in her beauty and her promise, so like a heroine-to-be of a modern novel. And how despicable and loathsome is this bent old man who embodies the very soul of the despised! And how attractive on a superficial level is this pretty young pastor whose actions are not the equal of his looks. And how strong and faithful and heroic is Hester who invites both envy and admiration, something like a flawed goddess of yore.What stuck me when I first read this, and remains with me today, is that it is those who presume to punish sin who are the real sinners. Chillingworth's life is one devoid of human feeling, devoid of any real joy as he lies in the stone cold bed of hatred and revenge. And to a lesser extent so it is with Dimmesdale who cannot forgive himself, who secretly flagellates himself so that his life becomes a hell on earth. On the other hand there is Hester who finds forgiveness and love with good works and in the joy of her beautiful and precious Pearl and in her unstinting love for Dimmesdale and her hope and faith that a better life will come.This is a deeply Christian novel although it is usually seen as a criticism of Christianity in the sense that the Christian community condemns the least of the sinners while the hypocrisy of its clergy is made manifest. Looking deeper we see that it is forgiveness of sin and the redemption that comes from good works that is exemplified. Hester knows the joy of life because she is a loving and giving person; and on another level she is forgiven because we the reader forgive her. How could we not? And most of the Puritan flock also forgave her since it came to be said that the scarlet \\"A\\" she wore upon her person stood not for \\"Adultery\\" but for \\"Able.\\"It is also good to realize that when Hawthorne published the novel in 1850 the scene of the story was nearly two hundred years removed. Thus Hawthorne looked back at Puritan America from the standpoint of a more secular society greatly influenced by Jeffersonian deism and the transcendentalism of Emerson and Thoreau. In some respects, Hawthorne's brilliant treatment of the ageless theme of sin, guilt and redemption was a serendipitous, even unconscious, artifact of his literary skill. No artist composes a masterpiece without some deep talent at work independent of his conscious efforts."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"A story about the eternals: passion and love, compassion and hate, hope and fear, forgiveness and revenge, strength and weakness all qualites of the human heart, set in Puritan times, times not known for its love,grace and forgivness, for its humanity.Much like \\"Les Miserables,\\" a story of grace set against a story of the unforgiving law with a strong element of revenge. This one also pulls at the human heart. After all these years, the reader still mourns the tragedy, the grief, the unnecessary senselessness of it all.Features a heralded but weak man of the cloth, a good hearted but strong woman and a villan, a villan equal to any in literature, even Shakespeare's Iago.Action and emotion are riveting and strong, but writing style and word usage, products of the time in which it was written, slow down the read at times. It doesn't matter. A good, good book, a great book, a classic that has withstood the test of time, one for the ages. The \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" of its time."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The novel has been in the household since I was a child. At some point I undertook to read it, though my mother wisely suggested I wait a while. I did not and got puzzled what the letter A stood for. Oh, adultery, what's that? A boyhood friend explained. I read it again in my late teens and appreciated it. Today, at age 77, I finished it again with tears in my eyes. The human qualities surmount the brittleness of Puritan Boston and still impress me. Hawthorne's ambivalence about his ancestral Puritanism (which caused him to change the spelling of his last name)comes out powerfully.High school readers, many of them at least, should put it aside until they grow up a bit. Reading Amazon reviews evokes moments of cynicism when I want to suggest that high school students should be banned from reading serious books, such as this one, which hasn't got a single car chase in it, but then I note that there are perceptive reviews by high school readers and clueless reviews by adults who have technically reached the age of maturity."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"On the positive side, the story is O.K. (the plot hangs together structurally) and the language is rich and flowing (if not repetitive; witness the clumsy word &quot;ignominy&quot; and its variants). On the negative side, I have the following criticisms:(1) The narrative style is uninvolving. The best writers SHOW their readers what is happening; mediocre writers TELL their readers what is happening; and, bad writers feel they must explain what they are telling their readers. Hawthorne, in this novel, falls in the mediocre category for the most part. A good writer tells a good story; a great writer makes you feel as if you are there as the story unfolds.(2) The settings are sketchy. I was not able to reconstruct the layout of the town, its situation with respect to the forest, or even the precise location of the main buildings (the church, Hester's house, etc.). I kept contrasting this element of Hawthorne's style (unfavorably) with Austen, Proust, Nabokov, Tolstoy, Flaubert, Melville, Robbe-Grillet, etc.---with these great writers, I become so familiar with the settings that I feel as though I grew up in their make-believe worlds where everything seems to be one of a kind. In The Scarlet Letter, the settings are seemingly taken off the shelf.(3) The story and its characters are one-dimensional. Virtually every single scene (covering about seven years in the story) concerns the scarlet letter and its impact on the main characters (it's like watching a prize fight where the boxers only jab---tedious!). While the primary characters are fuzzy and ill-defined, the secondary characters are all but nonexistent; we are told what impact they have on the main characters, but rarely allowed to witness the specific actions of the supporting characters so that we can appraise their influence for ourselves. In other words, the character development stinks.(4) Finally, the symbolism is abstract and obvious. The silly &quot;forest=freedom&quot;/ &quot;town=oppression&quot; school of symbolism always annoys me. In the best novels, the words (after all, that is what literature is about) pull double duty: they inform and evoke. Great writers use all of the various qualities of words (rhythm, tone, secondary connotations, etc.) to create mood and imagery, allowing the attentive and imaginative reader to sense the story. Bush-league scribblers use only the literal meanings of words, devising dreary word-equations (abstract, or literal, symbols) to manufacture connections when their artistic talent comes up short.I know my less than enthusiatic review may be further evidence of the &quot;dumbing of America&quot;. But, I like dumb people more than I like middlebrow parrots, with their enthusiastic but empty cheerleading, hand-me-down sensibilities, and tiresome blather. You go!...and take this book with you!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Set in seventeenth-century Puritan New England, Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter is the story of an adulteress, Hester Prynne, and her struggle to maintain a functioning relationship within the Puritan orthodox community she lives in. She must cope with the wild nature of her imp-like daughter, a physically and emotionally twisted husband, and the adulterer, Reverend Dimmesdale, who remains unknown as Hester's lover and the father of her child until late in the novel.After giving birth to a daughter she names Pearl , Hester is punished with the scarlet letter \\"A\\" which she must wear on her breast and marks her as an adulteress. The shame she bears is immense. The village looks upon her with scorn and ridicule. Her husband, Roger Chillingsworth, whom Hester had presumed dead at sea, sent her to Salem, Massachusetts two years previously to await his later arrival, but sent no word after. He appears unexpectedly as she is being publicly displayed upon the scaffolding in front of the church, which serves as a punishment for criminals. He sees this public humiliation and is enraged. He sets out to find her lover and get revenge...Hester must deal with her husband's evil nature and with her own daughter, who's erratic behavior doesn't improve the village's view of her.The scarlet letter is a symbol for the shame which Hester Prynne is burdened with. As a confessed adulteress she deals daily with public humiliation while the Reverend Dimmesdale is left to bear the shame inside his heart, shut away in the confines of his lodgings, living out each day as a lie. Hester is depicted as being strong, self-reliant and courageous in contrast to Reverend Dimmesdale who is weak and guilt ridden. He is a hypocrite, a man of God , living a lie.Hester's suffering is easier to bear than Dimmesdale's. She is hardened , refined, made almost heroic by her punishment and all the ordeals it brings with it. Dimmesdale is irreparably broken apart, suffering his own judgment, living in a daily personal hell. I was impressed by how Hawthorne managed to convey so many truths about contemporary society in general by focusing on one incident in Salem Massachusetts that transpired a hundred years in the past. I would recommend The Scarlet Letter to anybody who is willing to face the character of human beings that remain unchanged throughout time. The truths about evil, lies, love, beauty, courage and the heroism of the human spirit which can not only survive, but endure for generations."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Said to be one of the first psychological novels ever written, The Scarlet Letter still captivates its readers. Nathaniel Hawthorne knew how to characterize his characters beautifully. Reading his work is like experiencing that character's life.The story is set in colonial New England. The plot of the story revolves around the lives of three individuals who lived in Puritan Boston. Hester Prynne, a brave, fierce woman bearing her sin in silence, Reverand Arthur Dimmesdale, a very respected member of the community who suffers with his guilt, and Roger Chillingsworth, Hester's husband who wants revenge, are the three characters of Hawthorne's novel. As the story unfolds, so do the intricacies of the characters and in the end the truth is proven to be the best solution.Reading this classic novel was harder to accomplish than I expected. The story starts off slow and, from my point of view, the wording of the book is hard to follow and understand. What I liked best about the novel was the underlying meanings you can take from reading the book. A person's passion for revenge and the clash between a person's private life and public life are hidden meanings shown throughout this story. The portrayal of human nature was also done wonderfully. Sin, guilt, pentinence, and lust are some of the main feelings in this book. The Scarlet Letter is a classic that continues to be read by all ages of readers and the story can teach people valuable lessons about life if read carefully."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I don't understand why this novel has such a low customer rating, except that I can see how many would find the subject matter and elevated writing style extremely difficult and dislikable. The Scarlet Letter is not to be (nor is it possible to be) read lightly; it is actually, in the way of many 19th-century classic novels, quite painful to read. I loved it, and I still trudged through it.The subject matter, infinitely grim and distasteful, is not enjoyable in any way. It centers on the nature of morality, sin, corruption, hypocrisy especially concerning morality, and all that hackneyed bag of themes. You probably already know the general plot of the novel, so I need not reiterate it. Ironically, while criticizing the hypocrisy and sternness of the Puritans, Hawthorne seems very puritannical himself, and displays those same characteristics, including a kind of absurd self-righteousness and a pompous, austere, rigid, very Christian sense of morality. I got endless irony out of this; it seemed as though he, as the narrator, was condemning the Puritans for their harsh, hypocritical actions while endorsing Puritan principles and expressing views just as severe and ridiculously religious, if not more so, than theirs. I have to warn you that it's pretty disgusting the way he is wholly obsessed with the ideas of sin and guilt. Honestly, I think all he wrote about in his lifetime were Puritans, morality, sin and how we are all horrible sinners, etc. I imagine he could have been a fire-and-brimstone-preaching evangelist if he hadn't chosen the path of literary genius instead. And yes, despite all this, he is still a literary genius.What makes this such a wonderful piece of classic literature, and one of my favorites, is how beautiful, eloquent, gorgeous, and sophisticated the language is. Rarely have I seen such an astounding mastery of the English language and literary devices, with perfect fluency and coherence, depth, insight, passion, intensity, and power of expression. Of course, I'm sure the style of prose is not for everyone; but I find it remarkable, magnificent, admirable. I loved the rampant symbolism, the ingenuity of little metaphors found everywhere. I loved the character Pearl, who is so strange and otherwordly and complex. Dimmesdale is, well, so very pathetic; he is the epitome of the once-righteous-now-fallen, guilt-torn, utterly miserable, wretched, squirming, feeble, tortured soul, and his abject, wallowing despair adds to the overall gloomy and tormenting atmosphere of the novel.I know I ranted quite a bit in this review, but honestly, it's a superb work and triumph of English-language literature, and you should at least be able to appreciate it to some degree, in some aspects, and concede its exceptional use of language. I have a feeling that a lot of the reviewers expressing negative opinions are malcontent high school students grumbling about a \\"stupid, boring book\\" assigned to them for class. I myself had to read it for my junior-year English class, but I am very glad I was forced to do so.For those whining about how \\"verbose\\" it is - please get over your own short attention span or lack of taste or whatever it is that impedes you from recognizing and appreciating good literature. An example of verbosity is: \\"I waded along the flooded bank of the river that had overflowed its banks and along which I now waded in flood water,\\" not a sentence of graceful structure and expressiveness like (randomly selecting): \\"Continually, indeed, as it stole onward, the streamlet kept up a babble, kind, quiet, soothing, but melancholy, like the voice of a young child that was spending its infancy without playfulness, and knew not how to be merry among sad acquaintances and events of sombre hue.\\""},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This is a review for not the novel itself but the various Franklin Library editions available.The Franklin Library issued a number of different editions of the Scarlet Letter.

The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is one of those classic tales. Although the book was written in 1850 and set in a 17th century Puritan Society, the issues of morality, deceit, romance, and guilt make the novel an interesting and captivating read, even in modern times.The work of Hawthorn illustrates the question of humanity and morality. His vivid use of language and third person narrative style allows the reader to have insight into the lives of the main characters. He allows the reader to sympathize with both Hester and Dimmesdale. Although society has deemed their sin immoral and made Hester an outcast, Hawthorne is able to capture the reader's humanity and empathy toward the human condition.Hawthorne is also able to capture the essence of the Puritan society. He skillfully utilizes language, such as this, while Hester speaks to her daughter she states, \\"We must not always talk in the market-place of what happens to us in the forest.\\" This symbolizes the shame that is forced upon those who are judged and the need to escape from public scrutiny. Most readers will be able to relate to the characters and understand the tragedy of the times and circumstances.I highly recommend this book. Although the introduction may seem slow and somewhat disinteresting, the storyline will prove to be enticing. This novel challenges the reader to question his/her own moral views and values. The reader will see why this novel is a timeless classic."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is certainly one of the most famous American novels of the 19th Century, and though maybe not as accessible as works from the likes of Twain or Steinbeck, it rightly belongs in the same realm of great American literature.The book begins with an introduction called Custom House. It can be skipped for all but the most enthusiastic readers of classic literature.The main story begins in a Puritan village in Massachusetts with a woman named Hester Prynne being forced to stand on a scaffold in front of a crowd as punishment for the sin that resulted in her child she is holding. She also must permanently wear a letter A as a mark for that sin. Hester continually refuses to disclose the name of her child's father. Back in prison she sees a doctor, a deformed man named Roger Chillingworth, who has a significant connection with her past unbeknownst to others in the village. Another man, a young frail minister named Arthur Dimmesdale, is also a significant character in the story in respect to his connection with Hester and his close but uneasy relationship with Chillingworth. Hester's daughter, Pearl, is an elfish mischievous child and becomes a symbol as much as an actual character; a symbol of Hester's past and hope for the future. Hester spends in the years afterward being a seamstress, doing charity, and eventually becoming an excepted if not beloved member of the community.The book deals with sin and redemption, religion and revenge in beautiful but often ambiguous ways. The story itself is simple, and the book is not long, but the inner emotions of characters are explored with rousing detail. The novel hardly ever meanders needlessly, though as I mentioned it's not the most (though certainly neither the least) accessible book, especially to an audience not well verse in classic literature. Do not be intimidated though because it's an experience well worth having. It's Hawthorne's masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Unlike every one else that was forced to read this in English class.

Hawthorne truly captures the senses and amazes by expressing the battle of moral punishment vs. understanding.As the scarlet letter burns upon Hester Pyrnne's chest, one truly feels as if they are thrusted into the same situation of having to wear their own sin in plain sight. Still the question remains to the reader: who has done the most wrong, Hester or those that punish her so harshly? But as the book reads on, the main question becomes unimportant, and the true question hidden in the text is seen: It is not who has done the most wrong, but are the morals of the time too strict and in need of progression?"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I highly advise rereading books after a decade or more. Why? Because what you think you read and what you really read is not always the same. Especially when you read it in high school or college under duress. That is what happened when I just read The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne after more than twenty years. What I thought had happened was very distorted over the years.If you have forgotten what the book is about or just simply never cared, let me summarize. The whole story starts off with a young woman who has recently given birth being taken from the dark prison of a Puritan colonial settlement and placed upon the scaffold of shame along with her newborn girl. Upon her breast is a scarlet letter \\"A\\" that proclaims all that sees this mark that she is an adulteress. Her husband had disappeared over the last few years which does not help her cause. She is asked to announce who should be on the scaffold with her, but she declines out of love for the man.The story gets more intricate as unbeknownst to all but her the husband that has been reported missing has shown up on the same day as her public shame is announced. He desires to keep his identity secret as he hunts out the man who shamed his wife. It is not long in the story that the reader discovers the agony a young minister has in hiding his part in the shame while longing to be with her in exile. It is a passionate story of secrecy, laws, social acceptance, piousness, revenge, and the dark currents of man's evil nature.First of all, this is not a long book. It is relatively short. The version I read only had about 170 pages of the actual story. The rest of the book was comprised of introductions, notes, commentary, and a large bibliography.What turns many off from this classic is the fact that it was written in the 1800s in early America. It is always assumed to be dry and boring as it is not written in the fashion of today. No, you won't find long dialogues where a character pours out their heart and soul. Instead you will find descriptive narratives to give us these feelings.For example, the minister who should be on the scaffold with the woman shows the reader his guilt through the decline of health and the constant covering of his own breast where he knows another scarlet letter resides that only God can see. The innocent comments of a child over the years brings attention to the seen letter on her mother's bosom and the unseen on that of the minister.In all honesty, I found it hard to put the book down as I was drawn in with the poetic language of Hawthorne to the souls of a young woman who longed for love, a man who was torn between two worlds of love and obligation, and a man who gave his soul to the devil just to exact revenge.This is a true classic that gives someone a glimpse into the world of Puritan colonial America and into the social and religious order it abided by. In addition to that, it gives one a glimpse into their own souls and has them pondering which character represents themselves.I highly recommend that you read this classic. If you have read it once, do it again. Read it with more mature eyes and the ability to connect with the characters within the book.Note: This book was provided as part of a class on American Fiction."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Unless you have the correct size font, you will have a difficult time reading this book on the Kindle. It is not set up to have the text wrap correctly and therefore has a full line of text, the next line has a single word, then another full line and so on."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I hadn't read this since high school, so going in I anticipated something like this: Boring, boring, boring. Sudden intensity! The End.Rereading it as a married mother with a few adult relationships under my belt, I had a very different response than I did at 15. I can now appreciate the story of the pretty young bride, the disfigured, neglectful older husband, the smart, charismatic young minister.I empathized with the whole single mother situation, and could imagine the added pain of being alone, a social outcast. I also could understand better why Hester wouldn't reveal her illigetimate child's father.The scene in the woods when she bares her soul to her baby-daddy (I won't spoil it in case anyone on the planet hasn't read this book) was particularly poignant.Hester was a young girl in love. And she glamorizes her otherwise mundane life with her protection of her co-conspirator. At the same time BD still irritates me. He's ambitious and allows Hester to hide his guilt so he can go on pursuing his career goals.Yet he's so weak, his hypocricy literally kills him. He can't muster the strength to leave it all behind and take Hester and Pearl away. Even after confessing his love for her.Wow. Hats off to Hawthorne. I think I've met that male protagonist. And I know I've been guilty of playing Hester before in at least one relationship. Forget my needs, I love him! (*snort*)So no wonder it's a classic. Now here's my question: Is this book wasted on a 15-year-old audience?I taught 15 year-olds, and I guess my answer would be, \\"Not if it's done right.\\" And alternatively, if they're not made to read it then, will they ever? And then will books like these be lost?Doubtful about the lost part. It's a good book. I recommend picking it up sometime, and feel free to skim the lengthy, dense descriptions of minutiae. I did."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Without a doubt this is one of the must-read books for American Literature. Therefore, I do not have problems with the story itself, but the version of the book.Pros: Thin, easy to carry around, pages are easy to write on (it's REAL paper, not the flimsy ones many other versions have), pages not too bright, durable, simpleCons: Not enough space to really be able to take notes within the book because there is little space between one chapter and another(post-its recommended), \\"THE CUSTOM-HOUSE\\" is NOT included!!! (it is however, easily accessible with a simple google search)If you are just looking for a copy to read, but not analyze, then this is a really good copy. Even if you are looking to analyze (not too deeply), this is still a great choice because it's simple and the introduction essay is only a click away. If you are lazy to recognize symbols and themes, then I would suggest the Barnes and Nobles edition (they have their own version, and then they sell another one with analysis of themes and motifs), as they have the essay, analyses, but is around three~four times thicker than this version.I am satisfied with my buy. :) Great classic! Please have a version of this book somewhere in your house because it really reveals a lot about the Puritan society at that time period (although it is biased) and is interesting to read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I completely agree with most HS students that this book should be optional reading for them because HS teachers should very well know that there are many different minds that need very different kinds of reading material and exposure to variety is not always a good thing that's why you end up having reviews of books like this by some HS students who puke on it rather then have savored it like I did. My reasons for really loving this book is because of the historical/puritan life and manners I like to read about, I love human struggle and the need to understand inner feelings of character, and I like knowing about how communities deal with religious matters. Can you blame me for being such a sentimental person? Yes, the book is written at the 5th grade level, and some people still do read at that level so this may be a reason why it's survived for such a long time. In any case, don't have it on your book shelf if it's not your cup of tea; with me, it will always be a treasure."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"First and foremost, this book felt long and drawn-out. The convoluted prose that Hawthorne uses as with his excessively long sentences help add little relief when one is lost in the mist of a page long paragraph. Written in the middle 1800s, The Scarlet Letter contains sentence structure and phrasing typical of that time, meaning there are many instances that felt unnatural or forced.The beginning of this book is anything but enjoyable. Not only was the first chapter a tedious read but it contained no relevance to the rest of the book. It is just hard to continue reading a book that begins with such a sour taste, in fact most reader would mistaken the entire book to be of the same low quality as the first chapter. Another major low point for the story is the long complicated description that Hawthorne seems to love. Even a description about a barren jail door could constitute an entire chapter. Ordinarily, details allow the reader a vivid image of the scene, but excessive details just slow down and decrease the enjoyment of the novel. It is said that Hawthorne's writing requires a great deal of concentration, effort, and strength to read and understand, and that is true.However, even through all the fog and haze that Hawthorne manages to include in his book, the overall plot of the novel is decent. It is by no means gripping but it is passable. There are moments where the reader will feel attached to the characters but those moments are few and far. For the most part, many of the characters feel static, almost as if their entire actions are scripted. It is almost as if one were watching a play conducted entirely in monotone. The reader cannot feel the outbursts of emotions, neither crescendos nor decrescendos of joy or sadness from the characters. With his convoluted, or some would say overly sophisticated style, the average reader will have a hard time connecting with the characters and in turn, will feel detached about the novel. The meaning of this novel may be deep and worthwhile to decipher, but for the average reader, this classic will provide nothing more than headaches and anguish."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter gives an excellent portrayal of not only the inherent evil of mankind but also the fatal consequences of revenge and the pains of a guilty conscience. The emotional and psychological aspects of the story provide the depth of this novel and are characteristic of Hawthorne's writing style. In addition to the riveting storyline, Hawthorne includes the psychological thoughts and reasoning behind each character, making the characters seem more realistic and allowing the reader to relate to the characters. Although the reader may not have experienced the exact events, the emotions of dread and fear, of guilt and shame, are familiar to the reader as Hawthorne expresses each emotion in his characters. When Hester argues with Governor Bellingham to allow her to keep her daughter, the emotions and thoughts that Hawthorne attaches to Hester clearly portray the mother's protection of her daughter, a natural characteristic that readers can understand even if they have never experienced the same situation. The psychological aspects of the story go beyond the plot, delving into the heart of each character. The emotions expressed in the novel allow the reader to clearly understand what the characters are going through.Hawthorne's depiction of the relationship between Pearl and her mother Hester Prynne creates a vivid description of the sufferings of a guilty conscience. Hester, burdened with the guilt of committing the sin of adultery, is forced to wear her sin, presenting herself to the world as an adulteress. The scarlet letter burns her constantly, secluding her from the rest of society. In addition to this suffering, Hester must live with her child Pearl, who continually reminds poor Hester of her sin. It is as if her sin has materialized into a child, a living memory of the guilt Hester must carry. By setting numerous scenes and conversations between Hester and her child, Hawthorne's unique style of writing clearly presents the great sufferings of a guilty conscience.Although Hawthorne's sentences may seem to drone on forever, the novel as a whole is filled with vivid images and descriptions that imprint themselves into the reader's mind. The Scarlet Letter is recommended for those who enjoy the blend of psychological and emotional aspects of a novel that provide a powerful connection between reader and character."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I don't understand why this novel has such a low customer rating, except that I can see how many would find the subject matter and elevated writing style extremely difficult and dislikable. The Scarlet Letter is not to be (nor is it possible to be) read lightly; it is actually, in the way of many 19th-century classic novels, quite painful to read. I loved it, and I still trudged through it.The subject matter, infinitely grim and distasteful, is not enjoyable in any way. It centers on the nature of morality, sin, corruption, hypocrisy especially concerning morality, and all that hackneyed bag of themes. You probably already know the general plot of the novel, so I need not reiterate it. Ironically, while criticizing the hypocrisy and sternness of the Puritans, Hawthorne seems very puritannical himself, and displays those same characteristics, including a kind of absurd self-righteousness and a pompous, austere, rigid, very Christian sense of morality. I got endless irony out of this; it seemed as though he, as the narrator, was condemning the Puritans for their harsh, hypocritical actions while endorsing Puritan principles and expressing views just as severe and ridiculously religious, if not more so, than theirs. I have to warn you that it's pretty disgusting the way he is wholly obsessed with the ideas of sin and guilt. Honestly, I think all he wrote about in his lifetime were Puritans, morality, sin and how we are all horrible sinners, etc. I imagine he could have been a fire-and-brimstone-preaching evangelist if he hadn't chosen the path of literary genius instead. And yes, despite all this, he is still a literary genius.What makes this such a wonderful piece of classic literature, and one of my favorites, is how beautiful, eloquent, gorgeous, and sophisticated the language is. Rarely have I seen such an astounding mastery of the English language and literary devices, with perfect fluency and coherence, depth, insight, passion, intensity, and power of expression. Of course, I'm sure the style of prose is not for everyone; but I find it remarkable, magnificent, admirable. I loved the rampant symbolism, the ingenuity of little metaphors found everywhere. I loved the character Pearl, who is so strange and otherwordly and complex. Dimmesdale is, well, so very pathetic; he is the epitome of the once-righteous-now-fallen, guilt-torn, utterly miserable, wretched, squirming, feeble, tortured soul, and his abject, wallowing despair adds to the overall gloomy and tormenting atmosphere of the novel.I know I ranted quite a bit in this review, but honestly, it's a superb work and triumph of English-language literature, and you should at least be able to appreciate it to some degree, in some aspects, and concede its exceptional use of language. I have a feeling that a lot of the reviewers expressing negative opinions are malcontent high school students grumbling about a \\"stupid, boring book\\" assigned to them for class. I myself had to read it for my junior-year English class, but I am very glad I was forced to do so.For those whining about how \\"verbose\\" it is - please get over your own short attention span or lack of taste or whatever it is that impedes you from recognizing and appreciating good literature. An example of verbosity is: \\"I waded along the flooded bank of the river that had overflowed its banks and along which I now waded in flood water,\\" not a sentence of graceful structure and expressiveness like (randomly selecting): \\"Continually, indeed, as it stole onward, the streamlet kept up a babble, kind, quiet, soothing, but melancholy, like the voice of a young child that was spending its infancy without playfulness, and knew not how to be merry among sad acquaintances and events of sombre hue.\\""},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"200-300 worddI really liked this book because of Hester.

Adultery is not right, but we learn from mistakes.I really liked to read about the time period because it was so different from our own. It is hard to believe that Hawthorne was only a writer for his time period."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The best book that I have ever been assigned to read for school by far. The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser , the wearer of the scarlet letter, feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak Dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with Hester and the revenge ridden character of Chillingworth is spectactular.The way in which Hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding. Hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader. Since Hester the main character concieved her daughter Pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet A on her chest for the rest of her life. The story starts on the day Hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of Boston starts from there. A must read for any American."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I recently read this book for my English class. Overall it provided a good read.

I enjoy books like The odyessy, and I am currently reading hitchikers guide to the galaxy, i even dont mind shakespeare (sometimes they can be dry), so dont judge me as a ignorant highschooler, Even though it is what I am. Seriously, STOP PRETENDING THIS IS SUCH AN AMAZING BOOK. It is not, period. Hawthorne has a peculiar cliche way of writing and im sick of it. If you ever are forced to read this book...dont. How does Hawthorne write of puritan society when he didn't live through it. The reason so much of this junk is overlooked is because this is a \\"Classic\\". I dont see why its so classic, we have seen many other writers do this, and much better. This bok is a false antiquity, I mean Rappucinis daughter was not bad, but this is junk.

Once i knew more about the story, reading became much easier. (some parts, though were just plain tedious.) the imagry that was used was amazing and the plot was excelent. i would have given more stars but some of it was just too complicated and i couldn't follow it.Bottom line: everyone should read this book because it is a classic for a reason.

I just don't like Nathanial Hawthorne. I think the plot is brilliant, but I find his method of telling the story annoying. I'm afraid this isn't an assertion I can back up with a lot of concrete examples, it's just that his writing gives me a vague feeling of malaise. I find this true of his short stories as well, so I never bothered with the other novels.

I absolutely love this book! I had heard of this novel, but never considered reading it because the plot simply did not interest me. Then we read it in our academic English class (10th graders) and I was absolutely astonished!! Not only by the magnificence of the book--its themes of guilt and redemption are powerful and heart wrenching--but by the ignorance of some of my peers. It was obvious that their dislike sprung from the fact that they did not understand it! Please, please--read this book! You will not be sorry! I promise."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This is one of those novels that everyone feels they &quot;ought to read&quot; to be a well-read, educated reader. Well, that's certainly true. It can be dense, and it can also be a hard read-- Hawthorne's characters are not really &quot;likeable&quot; and we have to pay close attention to the language of the novel to really appreciate the richness that has earned this book a firm position in the &quot;literary canon.&quot; When I have taught this book to non-English majors, one of the most important pieces of advice I have given is, at first, skip the Custom House sketch in the first chapter-- then go back to it. It's unclear until you've read the whole thing why the Custom House sketch is there-- and since the chapter is there first, you don't get right into the &quot;meat&quot; of the story. This is what makes an awful lot of people put the book down. Skip that, and then you'll find an engaging story. (Do go back to the first chapter, though!)But the classic novel of betrayal, of sin and redemption and of society's focus not on 'people' but on 'behaviors' it considers wrong is definitely worth more than one reading.Also, the history behind the novel is important-- check out some of the history of Anne Hutchinson-- a real life &quot;Hester Prynne&quot; type... you'll learn that Hawthorne's imagination wasn't as fanciful as we'd like to think."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This novel is a very intriguing story about an attractive young woman living in a Puritan society, where she is put in compromising situations and must maneuver herself out of them. Hester Prynne (the captivating young puritan woman) has allowed herself to be put in one too many situations though, when she gets pregnant by a man other than her husband. This terrible sin caused the Puritan society to punish her for her sins against god and her husband. In doing so the community sentenced Hester to live the rest of her life wearing the letter \\"A\\" on the bosom of her dress. This entire scenario is described extremely well by Hawthorne, by using elaborate sentences with great descriptions, both of the people's opinions and of the scenery, to provide a very full and vivid picture in the mind of the reader. This story has great twists and surprises in it which draws the reader into the story, to where the reader feels as if they are actually in the society and watching how every one acts towards Hester and her daughter. Hawthorne uses advanced vocabulary to describe the settings, people, and the people's opinions. The descriptive sentences and complex vocabulary of this novel make it very attractive to any reader wishing to expand their vocabulary and even part of their history, by learning a little about how the Puritan society's belief system worked and how the society viewed people and their actions. Now granted all the information in this novel is not all factual however the reader gets a real feel of strict and moral the Puritans were during that time. This novel by far with its advanced vocabulary and wonderfully descriptive sentences is one of the best novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;Nathaniel HawthorneReviewer: Marion LaganaThe classic novel &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; by Nathaniel Hawthorne was written in the 1800's about a small Puritan town in New England--the town is now known as Boston. This was awhile before America was free from England. In this is town everyone knows everyone and their beliefs are all the same. nothing out of the ordinary happens until one Puritan girl, who has just moved to Boston a couple years past and has been waiting for her husband to join her, has a child with another man. This baffles the community to say the very least.The book goes on to tell about her pain; the pain of adultery and the pain of her other secrets that she has kept throughout the novel. The story brings you on a sad trip through one woman's pathetic and lonely life, from the loss of love and friends to being finally respected as a person and being &quot;able.&quot; I put quotes around able because in the book, the letter A turns from showing shame and a sin, into showing a womean who is able to do something despite what she has done.Although the book sometimes seems rather long, and there are things that you may feel are not neeed, or understand, you learn to enjoy it in the end, as well as understand it. It is a book that you will want to pick up and read again to understand it that much more. It's a touching book of forgiveness, hatred, love, and deceit."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"(...) I groaned when I heard that my AP English class would read The Scarlet Letter - it seemed so overused, out of date, and boring. Well, that's what I thought until I started reading. This is an amazing novel. The themes explored - sin, guilt, revenge, cowardice, bravery, compassion, intolerance - apply not to just Puritannical society, but also to today's. I questioned my own morality and integrity - what would I do if I was Hester Prynne, Arthur Dimmesdale, Roger Chillingworth, or a member of the Puritan community? Can a sinful act of passion be purged through repentance and self-sacrifice? Or is it forever damaging to accountability and integrity? This has become one of my favorite books - the ability to explore morality beyond surface characters is a stimulating experience."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I liked the book. It incorporated many different angles into a fairly short novel (its about 250 pages.) Despite what you might expect, and what some might tell you, it is not at all difficult to understand the book. Its language isn't so different from today's as to be unreadable, or need footnotes, such as Dickens and Shakespeare.As far as plot goes, it was very good; straightforward, yet not overly simple. Hawthorne also managed to sneak commentary about the Puritan lifestyle, especially regarding the view of &quot;sin.&quot; One of the book's flaws however, was its characters. The villain was relativly passive, yet he was portrayed as this horrible, detestable person. His victim, who was probably worse than his &quot;tormentor&quot; was portrayed as sympathetic. The &quot;bad guy&quot; was fairly unrealistic in his passiveness, as the victim was highly exaggerated in his suffering. The two come off as rather contrived. But, some more real characters, such as the daughter, serve to make up for this.Overall, this is a very good book. I'd recommend it for anyone interested in reading the classics, or who enjoys 19th century literature."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel, and learned a lot about thePuritan way of life in the colonies from it. It was verysad, but a good read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I have had the displeasure of reading this book twice so far in high school. Before continuing with my actual review, I should note that I am a little weary of romance novels in general. First of all, anyone eager to read this book for its romantic theme, forget it! In the modern sense, this is not in anyway associated with romance or (for the most part)love. In reality, this book is more about Christian motives, betrayal, and depression. I cannot nor do I wish to reveal anything specific about the plot, yet let me emphasize that this novel centers more around hate and contempt than love. Although I despise stories with a lustful or romantic appeal, I would have been far better satisfied had that been the case of this novel. Don't misinterpret me, Hawthorne is a terrific and classical writer, but this novel IS NOT CLASSICAL! Having read some of his other works, I must say how uncharacteristic this novel is of him.It does have its merits, however; it is full of imagery and symbolism that can greatly improve a reader's reading and writing skills, but so do a lot of other &quot;real&quot; classics.I'm not trying to hammer this book into the ground, I'm just being as objectively honest as I can. The truth is that this novel is very tedious and deep (as are all of Hawthorne's works), yet unlike is better works, there is virtually no action or interesting plots to the story. I can't put it any better than to say that it is just plain, old-fashioned BORING. I like to think I have an open mind, but you sit down to read this book and you get through the first chapter (if you get through it) and then through the rest until the end; and then it's like &quot;it took 250 pages to tell a one-paragraph story?&quot; Not to reveal anything, but the ending is a terrible let down, though not at all shocking either.Although I didn't like this book, it has its merits; and if you are thinking about reading it yourself, do yourself a favor and get a short synopsis of the book and really see if it's something you wish endeavor into. E-mail me freely if you have questions."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"One would expect a novel written in the 19th century about the subject of adultery, penitence, conscience, and puritanism to resonate far less with the modern reader than this one does. Granted, the language is somewhat stilted to a modern ear, but not nearly as much so as most of its contemporaries, and while the characters are made to suffer for their &quot;sin&quot;, it is clear that Hawthorne feels that the punishment far exceeds what is just. The novel is more a condemnation of the sort of society that the Puritans were, rather than a condemnation of Hester Prynne. And while her paramour is not a very sympathetic character, it isn't because of his part in the &quot;sin&quot;, but rather because he's coward and hypocrite enough to allow her to bear the full brunt of the punishment, while keeping his own good name and reputation intact, up until the moment of his impending death.All in all, a surprisingly good read, and a very worthwhile book to discuss; there are many concepts involved which are capable of being seen in more than one light."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I'll admit right up front that I am stupid. I would rather enjoy a book instead of try to find my way through the maze of confusing, endless prose that Hawthorne uses. I found myself empathizing more with Chillingworth than Dimmesdale. A book should NOT have to be dissected and disscussed to be understood!!! It should clearly portray its thematic structure without having to resort to a smokescreen of vague symbols and the word &quot;Classic&quot; stamped all over it to force people to appreciate it. Yes, it was heavily thematic and full of symbolism; and it was &quot;meaty&quot; (whatever that is), &quot;deep&quot;, and &quot;powerful&quot;; but it was dry, slow, and boring. Even someone as myself, who generally enjoys the classics, will fall asleep (as I did everytime I tried to read this book). Do NOT try to speed-read this. This book has no place in a high-school English course; it needs a span of several years to muddle and plod thru, and then try to unravle."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter is an American tourist trying to ask one of the locals for directions; it speaks loud and slow, making gigantic explanatory hand gestures and nodding enthusiastically when it thinks you're catching on. What it doesn't seem to notice is that you speak English, you understand exactly what it's saying, and the hotel is just down the street. What could have been a meaningful, succinct five-second exchange has instead become an annoyingly elaborate, tediously awkward, and unnecessarily long social ritual. What could have been a poignantly rendered meditation on sin, redemption, and society winds up choking on its own ambitions. Indeed, had Hawthorne approached this novel with some sense of subtlety, allowing his narrative to unfold gracefully and naturally, ensuring that his characters and plot are compelling, allowing his themes to intertwine gently with the story itself, The Scarlet Letter would probably have struck me as the masterpiece that everybody else seems to think it is. But no; Hawthorne has a Grand Statement to make, and he'll be damned if anybody misses out on even a fraction of it! He loads up on symbolism, ensuring that every object that his characters might encounter is a metaphor for something or other. Nothing wrong with symbolism, of course, but Hawthorne uses it like a fire hose in a burning orphanage. He beats readers into the ground with the stuff, making painstaking effort to ensure that we don't miss a second of figurative goodness. He even goes so far as to explain what some of his metaphors represent. A bit like a magician explaining how he does his tricks, if you ask me.All of which occurs at the expense of the usual indicators of literary merit. Hawthorne structures his novel like the most didactic of parables, glossing over plot, characterization, dynamics, tension, and emotional resonance while beating readers to death with the moral. The story itself could be compelling, but it's a missed opportunity: Hawthorne describes the actual events in the novel as if he's writing a general summary of something he heard elsewhere. The prose is distant, ponderous, and dry, without a sense of sympathy or suspense. Hawthorne doesn't give a damn about his characters, doesn't even want to craft a compelling narrative. He's too busy Writing A Great Novel to write a great novel. As a result, the novel comes off as hollow, pretentious, and condescending, not to mention painfully boring.It certainly did have potential, though; the three main characters all have seeds of greatness in them, while the story itself is, Hawthorne's stumbling prose notwithstanding, a compelling one, and the author's thoughts on sin and redemption really are pretty interesting. Call it a good idea ruined by poor execution, then."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter.Good story, but long-winded.

This simply means that a life of love builds plentiful character & is joyous in the end, no matter the hardships, & that such a thing constitutes a revelation. Also, I've never quite used the kindle dictionary the way I used it while reading this book.The plot isn't all that magnetic but the writing brings out many flavours of the puritanical life in Boston around the 17th century. The character development, except perhaps that of Roger Chillingworth, is first rate. Its brash historicity, according to me, is a wonderful thing & matters your learn about the society at the time are very insightful. Since romance underpins the themes of sin, guilt, revenge, & the psychological implications of these primeval human emotions, I'd have to say that the plot is more dramatic than you might expect at times - but this could be an aspect of my own sensibilities than that of the novel.Its a good work to read, so I'd recommend pressing on with the page long sentences & phrase long words.@souvikstweets"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This is a review for not the novel itself but the various Franklin Library editions available.The Franklin Library issued a number of different editions of the Scarlet Letter.

In the story Hester Prynne had to deal with her sin of adultery.Hawthorne described how things were in that day and time. More than likely Hester would havebeen killed for her sin, but she was not because of the child. The era of time that Hester lived inwas very strict on actions and were very religious about every thing. \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" was astory that revealed a life lesson in it. I believe that Hester was treated wrongly by the people ofthe town because all the people treated her as an outcast.Ms. Prynne had been in prison while she was pregnant. Hester had to stand among the townspeople and they all wanted to know who the father was, but Hester would never tell them. Hesterhad committed the sin of adultery with Reverend Dimmesdale. When Hester was standing beforethe towns people she noticed that her husband was in the crowd of people. Her husband had sentHester to America before him so that she could find them a place to settle, but Mr. Prynne nevershowed up so Hester thought that he was dead.Nathaniel Hawthorne described how the towns people were by what their actions.Hawthorne let us read to find out the characters and how they were as a person. Hawthorne letsus know that religion was very strict in the lives of the people. The people followed the laws ofthe bible and if you sinned you had to deal with the town. Some of the punishments were cruel,but the punishments that they had to deal with then is much different from today. Some of thepunishments may have not been fair, but the people did what they thought was right. HesterDethloff 2Prynne was isolated from everyone in the town except when she had to go to the marketplacebecause she did not go to church any more after her sin. It could have been a good thing forHester and her daughter, Pearl, to move out of the town. The move was good in different ways,Hester would not have to put up with the humiliation from the towns people and Pearl would nothave to deal with being the child of sin.I have different views of the treatment that Hester and Pearl. Hester should have beenpunished if she did not know that she was doing wrong, but Hester knew she had sinned. HesterPrynne had sinned and she knew her consequences. Pearl was just a child and the people of thetown treated her as if she was a made of the devil works. Pearl was a child without friends andplayed by herself mostly outside. I believe most of the women of the town wanted Hester gonebecause she was very beautiful and even when she got out of jail Hawthorne describes her asbeing as beautiful as ever. By Hester being beautiful that made the women jealous therefore theywanted her punished. I believe that Hester's looks had some to do with her punishment.In conclusion Nathaniel Hawthorne points out the importance of religion and sin. Religionhad a large impact on the \\"The Scarlet Letter.\\" Religion had to do with most of the punishmentthat Hester Prynne received by the people of the town. Also sin was one of the main focuses ofthe story. The sin of adultery that Hester Prynne and Mr. Dimmesdale committed was the reasonfor the whole story. The sin that was committed acted out to be more of a life lesson to people.Hester's punishment was made some what upon her looks along with her sin.

I'll admit that I did not come to the book by myself - it was assigned to me over the summer - but that hasn't stopped me from appreciating Hawthorne's command of the English language, his sensitivity and astute view of humanity, and his extensive use of allusions and images to carry his story beyond Puritan times and into all time. Hawthorne's writing style, while dense and very literary, isn't impenetrable; and once you break through the shell of our own modern prejudices, it's easy to see what a wonderful and important novel this is."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter has endured for over a hundred years and will continue to do so, because it tells a powerful story well. Though many may find Nathaniel Hawthorne's writing boring or too descriptive, I think that every sentance serves to bring the book to life even more. The story itself too is fascinating, especially since the characters of Hester and Dimmesdale are not clearly good or bad. They've sinned, but they are still good people, or are they? Is Chillingworth really truly evil or are his motives justified? And then there's Pearl, the strange little girl who posesses unusual thoughts and character traits while still being the scarlet letter come to life.

It's a great book for teaching symbolism, foreshadowing and some of the themes of the romantic movement. However, as an adult, I pretty much found it to be an excruciating reading experience, and I'm not just talking about the fact that the language is dense and dreary. The very things that make it a valuable teaching tool can be very annoying to a more experienced reader. As I was reading I kept wanting to scream every time Hawthorne talked about the scarlet letter burning, glowing or being like a painful brand. I got it already! I can put up with slogging through the nineteenth century prose if I'm going to be challenged a little, but this book no longer did it for me."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter By Nathaniel HawthorneHere's a book that Monica Lewinsky definitely hasn't read but perhaps she should have. Nathaniel Hawthorne's classic masterpiece, The Scarlet Letter , explores the shame, isolation, and ostracism that a woman, Hester Prynne, endured as punishment for her transgression in Puritanical New England. Hawthorne's criticism of Puritanical society is a constant theme that runs through his writings and is a reflection of the scorn he felt for his ancestors who played a crucial role in the Salem Witch Trials in 1692. This common thread is evidenced in his other works such as his short story, \\"The Minister's Black Veil\\" that once again focuses on a character who is isolated from society due to a personal indiscretion. In The Scarlet Letter , Hawthorne's depiction of a shunned woman reveals his insightful understanding of this complex character and the shame she had to endure for her transgression. One can't help but notice that such punishments are outdated in today's desensitized society, a society in which, on the whole, hardly an eyebrow was raised in response to the modern-day Hester Prynne character, Monica Lewinsky."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This is probably the most confusing and worst book I have ever read! The author uses incredibly large words and you constantly have to use a dictionary or else you most likely won't know hat you are reading. From my point of view as a high school (with mostly A's and good at English) student I would not recommend this book to any other high school age students. The author needs to get to the point and not drag on for pages about things that are not important at all. Long setences also makes the book drag on. If I didn't have to read this book for a book report I would have put it down after the first page or two and usually I finish every book that I start.

There are much better classics than this."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Three words to describe my feelings of this book...I HATE IT.Hawthorne's writings are dull, dry, and other words that mean bad that start with D. The character's a boring."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"In this powerful and moving piece by Hawthorne, he reveals the presence of societal pressures which affect character judgment. Set in the late 1840s and published around that time, Hawthorne's story takes place in Salem and Concord, Massachusetts. He writes in an omniscient point of view, revealing the thoughts and prejudices of each character while interjecting his opinion along with the side.After the rather boring and tedious introduction which made me almost not want to read the book, the story opens with Hester Prynne holding an infant begat by immoral means emerging from the prison door and onto a scaffold for all to bear witness to the letter \\"A\\" for adulteress on her chest. Throughout the story, the focus will be on this symbol, and how it evolves over time with different perspectives.I won't get into much detail as that may ruin the book for your readers, so I'll move on to Hawthorne's awesome and abundant use of imagery used as symbols for the hypocrisy of the times and so forth. With his use of imagery, he criticizes the mankind for their ignorance In addition he adds transcendentalist views into the story the show the ability of nature being able to outlast and survive over some of the whimsical presumptions of man, such as what the symbol represents.Much of the book rely on symbols and what the characters represent. Reading and deciphering their meaning is not hard, but is not entirely obvious. What makes Hawthorne so clever is the way he shows the attributes of each character that define their symbol.Initially, I almost gave up on the book due to the rather long and tedious introduction about the narrator of the story, but I stuck through since it was part of a reading assignment for my reading class. When I finished, I can honestly say that I thoroughly enjoyed it, as I provides an insightful view of mankind's ways and our faults. Hawthorne created a timeless masterpiece and I suggest you guys to read it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"BrittleeMs. Self's English HonorsKickapoo High SchoolJunior11/21/05Warning: The book has a very high level of vocabulary!The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a book about sinning and dealing with the internal and external consequences of natural sin in a society of Puritans. The book is about a woman named, Hester, who commits the sin of adultery. Adultery is not acceptable in the Puritan society. They view it as a sin. To punish Hester for her wrongful acts, they place a scarlet A on her chest to let everyone know that she is an adulterer. Hester has a baby girl and names her Pearl. Pearl soon starts to grow up and realize why her mother has the A on her chest. Pearl starts questioning her mother about the A.

Upon reading it, however, I found it to be a wonderful novel which still makes valid points today, almost 200 years after it's publication. Hawthorne was deeply insightful in this novel about the intricacies of human nature. The entire novel is a perfect view of all of the flaws in the human race including the vices of jealousy, passion and cowardice. Through the actions of the Reverand Dimmesdale, Hester Prynne and Roger Chillingworth, Hawthorne was able to portray all aspects of emotion. Chillingworth's actions can all be justified by his love for Hester and the intense jealousy he felt for Dimmesdale. Hester's strengths and weakenesses were shown through the great courage she had in staying where she was hated and also in never making her accomplice own up to his actions. I loved this book and even though it was tough to read, it was well worth it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Being in high school, it took a little bit to understand it, but after a while, I was able to get the basic point of the story. If you know you'll have to read this for school in the future, read it ahead of time. That way, you won't be reading on a deadline, which makes it worse. Read it at your own pace and you will understand it more. Also, the second time through, when you have to read it, you will see many things that you missed, and the story will be much more meaningful to you. (You'll do better on tests and quizzes, too.)

Hawthorne creates a masterpiece of social commentary, cross-applied symbolism and overall beauty. The chief virtue of this book is the question posed by the line &quot;what we did had a consecration all its own.&quot; It is this line which continues to spark discussions among English teachers everywhere. The implications of these words also seem to elude students across the country. The issue is this: did Hawthorne imply, in paroxysms over the sanctity of nature, that the adultery committed by Hester and Dimmesdale was holy because it was wild like the forest beyond the austere village of the Puritans? The symbolism associated with the product of their sin, Pearl, seems to support this conclusion. The book is worth the read merely to contemplate that question, let alone the fact that The Scarlet Letter is a near-perfect example of American Romanticism. I do have to admit that it would be a bit more enjoyable if Hawthorne had used a synonym for &quot;ignominy&quot; once or twice...."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"We have just finished reading this book in school and I for one loved it. Hawthorne is showing how one sin, adultery, changed the lives of Hester, Dimmesdale, Chillingworth and Pearl. There is so much more to this book than what appears on the surface. On the surface, Hester had an affair, was found and had Pearl. But what is hidden below is Hawthorne feeling about the novel. Hawthorne defines sin as &quot;the falsification of human relationships&quot;. While adultery jumps out at us, there is more hidden underneath. Dimmesdale is one who falsifies being a father, lover and friend. He denied Pearl the joy of having a father, could not come forward to admit his part with Hester and lied to Chillingworth who was supposed to be his good friend. On Chillingworth's part, he committed the biggest sin. Once he found out who Dimmesdale really was, he tried to do everything in his power to take over the minister's soul. He hurt both Dimmesdale and Hester, which in Hawthorne's eyes was the biggest sin of them all. Hester never married Chillingworth because she loved him; she did it because she had to. Once she found love with Dimmesdale, she realized that it was real and she made a huge mistake by marrying the leech. It is a great book, which is hard to read, but once you get below what is obvious, it turns into a story that is still real even after all these years."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; is a superior book that explodes in emotion, passion, love, hatred, and crime. Hawthorne's choice of vocabulary is absolutely perfect to suit this novel. However, like all great classics, the reader must be patient. The story is very powerful, like an iron fist, telling of sins of adultery, and the great Dimmsedale, a character in this book, &quot;who keeps is hand over thy heart.&quot; Full of fierce yet excellent story telling, this book is a must for all lovers of classics and American Literature"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter is one of the more famous books in American Literature.

As one of my English teachers once commented, \\"The Scarlet Letter is a piece of crap. It almost single handedly made me want to stop studying literature.\\" Given that this teacher speaks six languages and has probably taught in twice as many countries, I defer my judgment of what constitutes good literature to him.I am not attacking this specific edition of the text. It seems well annotated (though i prefer annotations as footnotes rather than as appendices in the back). However, the original text remains the same. If you die in a horrible car accident and burn off your face while loosing all your limbs, the mortician can only do so much.Thus, if you are planning on reading this book for pleasure, I assure you there is something better to read. If you can't find anything, then obviously you are completely inept at reading and need a new hobby. May i suggest knitting?"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book literally put me to sleep.

It is considered one of the classics, hence the reason that we read it in AP Lang. But I was most impressed with the price, quality, and speediness of the delivery and book. I was also very happy to see that it was the same version that my whole class had, despite that version's absence from numerous bookstores in my area. Thank you Amazon!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Those who read THE SCARLET LETTER tend to take its message about the evils of sin and their consequences at face value and therefore literally. It is understandable that readers of Hawthorne's dark fable think like that since he places such heavy emphasis on the letter itself, which no one has trouble labeling as the \\"a\\" in adultery. However, since sin and its ramifications have been analyzed and interpreted in nearly every manner possible, it then seems reasonable to assume that the sin of the scarlet letter is more flexible than previously thought. This flexibility of the meaning of sin does not reside within the concept of sin, which according to Puritan conventions, was pretty well fixed, but rather it lies within each person who either carries sin within her heart like Hester, or rails against those who are accused of carrying it, like the Puritan church leaders. What emerges after hearing Dimmesdale's closing sermon against sin is that in any comparison with its evolving meaning from the beginning of the book to the end with the three major characters, one is struck with the unsettling notion that the very concept of sin is infinitely elastic.The church leaders who branded Hester had no difficulty labeling Hester's affair as worthy of the letter. To them they saw an affair and compared it to their collective notion of sin and placed an equal sign between the two. It did not occur to them that they might have created a greater sin by choosing one of their own as a scapegoat--as Shirley Jackson would much later do in THE LOTTERY--and cast off their own foibles on a woman who did not deserve such branding. Nor did they consider the indefinite period of time that would inevitably accompany the branding. Finally, they made no provision for redemption or rehabilitation, which to them meant no more than the victim's extorted shouts of approval of the public shaming. In the person of the Reverend Dimmesdale, Hawthorne shows us a man with even more subtle shades of sin that Hester possesses. He sins and then tries to cover it up, clearly not what one would expect from one who supposedly belongs to the same social group as the branders themselves. If it is difficult to rationalize Hester's silence concerning the paternity of their child Pearl, then it is far more difficult to do the same concerning his own. When he agonizes over his own participation in the affair, he balances a weak desire to be honest against a much stronger one to cloak his weaknesses under his clerical collar. If Dimmesdale cannot perceive that the root source for his painful process of self-flagellation lay in the harshness of his religious training, the reader has no such problem. Had the Puritan concept of sin and adultery not been synonymous, then his pain and Hester's pain could not exist. And then there is the master manipulator of the two, Roger Chillingworth. In his own way, he twists the meaning of sin to accommodate so many hues that the word is stretched into a linguistic pretzel. Even after multiple readings, one cannot tell to what extent the desire for revenge poisons his mind, or how much his own inner demons drove him on. It is this continuous ebbing back and forth of the meaning of sin that both drives and undermines Hester, Dimmesdale, and Chillingworth that causes each new generation of reader to ponder whether sin is a quality external to them or is somehow hardwired into their collective souls. The scarlet letter then emerges more as a mirror that reflects the conscience of all concerned than it does a poor woman who must endure a few hours of personal horror in the village stocks."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"A lot of reviews here are claiming that this book is so amazing, and others that it is the \\"worst book ever.\\" I disagree with both of these.On the positive side for the book, it introduces a lot of social questions. Not just about the morality of adultery and of punishment, but others that may have been missed by high school readers just hoping to get through the book. It describes the human tendencies towards forgiveness and towards selfishness (\\"It is to the credit of human nature, that, except where its selfishness is brought into play, it loves more readily than it hates. Hatred, by a gradual and quiet process, will even be transformed to love, unless the change be impeded by a continually new irritation of the original feeling of hostility.\\") It shows how Hester's actions, along with societies response, ruined lives. It showed how sometimes it's best to move on from problems. A lot of questions about the nature of society, that can even be applied today, are posed, and some are answered.Unfortunately, the book is wordy (probably as a result of when it was written,) and it lacks action. The plot is kind of hokey, and much of the time it seems like he is writing parts of the story just so that the narrator can go on a monologue giving commentary on human nature. The monologues that follow aren't really bad, but take up much of the book. The charachters are developed, in a way, but the reader is never given the chance to really identify with the charachters. Hawthorne uses a lot of symbolism in the book, some of which is good, and adds another dimension to the story. Some, however, is pretty elementary, and generally not necessary. Oh, and The Custom House is just terrible, there's no defending it.This book provides some interesting topics to discuss, but isn't very interesting as a novel. The narrator is dry. He is rather believable (though, he kind of admits that he's making up much of the story, which makes some of the really detailed parts kind of absurd) but he is not a great story teller. Basically, high school english teachers need to stop assigning this book to read unless they are planning on having some in depth discussions about society, and not just adultery, either. I had this book covered with two english teachers (one went on leave right before we started, and came back for the end.) The better one gave it some depth, but the other seemed to think that the purpose of the book was to contain a lot of worthless symbology and just quizzed us on stupid stuff."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I've never heard of this author before so reading this was a bit of a gamble with me but I liked the sound of it. Well, I'm glad I took the risk. I was sucked into the characters lives and anxious to discover thier outcomes and fates. The plotline fell into place so well and wonderfully. Despite the fact that it wasn't full of suspense it was still SUCH a page turner. I loved the way the book was written, each line meant something and each line was meant to be there and each new page was like a new poem.It made me concentrate too.

During the couple years that she is alone, she becomes pregnant and gives birth - proving to the entire Puritan colony that she has been unfaithful to her husband.The Puritan elders madate that she wear a scarlet letter, the letter \\"A\\", upon her bosom. The story tells of how this single event works in the lives of the three, and symbolism is everywhere.This story is the story of Hester Prynne, and of her (once) husband, her paramour, and of her child. The turn of phrase is fantastic, and eloquent. The book has many memorable and quotable phrases, and more than a few colorful characters.Flo Gibson's reading of the story is exquisite, with all the nuance and emphasis one could hope for. Her character voices are splendid, and there is little doubt as to who might be speaking at any time. She never hesitates, and never sounds as if she is plodding, but rather is acting as story-teller and muse.I fell in love with this book, and Flo Gibson gives it voice."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This is the first truly great American novel. When I read it years ago I was not the ideal reader. The whole atmosphere of sin and guilt was difficult for me to take. There was a gloom in it which I wanted to escape from. It was hard for me too at that age and time of life to give full attention and sympathy to a female protagonist. What did I have to do with this Hester Prynne? Chillingworth the avenging husband was cold and unsympathetic as death . And Dimmesdale too standing hypocritically on the pulpit and preaching a morality he himself violates also did not appeal to me. In some way I did not even understand what Hester Prynne did so wrong , and why they were tormenting her so. A backward and benighted society, a narrow morality a lack of love and tenderness. Well these of course are all of Hawthorne's points as he pits the traditional, narrow morality which becomes immoral and inhumane in persecuting the person who has done wrong, Hester, but who in response to the wrong acts with nobility and humanity. I too must admit that I could not understand how Hester could give up the child, Pearl. In any case with the years it seems to me that when I read this book I was not really ready to understand it. I could not do it justice.Hawthorne's sentence,\\" Until the heart is touched we do not begin to be\\" seems to me a lesson illustrated powerfully here through Hester's 'evil ' deed and its redemption in her noble conduct thereafter."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Although I enjoyed this book, I sometimes found that the language that Hawthorne uses in this novel to be confusing and somewhat excessive. The descriptions were vivid, but sometimes were taken to the point where they take away from the story. Especially in the beginning when I was still trying to figure out what was going on, I would often read a whole page just to realize that I had no clue what it had just said because of the confusing Elizabethan words. The language does add to the portrayal of society in the mid 1600's, and maybe I had trouble understanding because I have a small vocabulary.Once I was able to follow what Hawthorne was saying, I quickly got into the book. The differences in the characters and the many twists and turns that the story takes keeps the reader entertained and guessing what will happen next until the last line.This was a great book that I think everyone should read, but I think that it would be a whole lot easier to grasp if a couple \\"thou\\"s and \\"thy\\"s were replaced with more modern language."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The beauty of this book rests in its simplicity. On the surface, the story might seem dated (even out of date) and a cliche, but it's not.

I also enjoyed Harper Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood&quot; by Jackson McCrae, and &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet LetterSet in Boston in the 1640s, The Scarlet Letter is the story of three people who suffer for their wrongs and a strict Puritan community which enforces obedience. The author, Nathaniel Hawthorne, writes the story of Hester Prynne, Roger Chillingworth, and Author Dimmsdale who each commit wrong and suffer for it.The Scarlet Letter begins before the door of a jail on a gloomy day in Puritan New England. Hester Prynne, a woman who has committed adultery, is being led out to public view on the town scaffold. According to Puritan law, Hester should have been burned on that scaffold for her wrongdoing, but the townsmen have been merciful to let her live. However, she must always wear a scarlet letter A, made of her own needlework, as a symbol for adultery unless she tells who her partner was. She refuses to divulge this information and is dispatched to live awall the town in a cottage in the nearby woods. There she keeps herself busy working as a seamstress and raising her daughter, Pearl. During the same day that Hester was viewed on the scaffold, a physician named Roger Chillingworth appears in the town. The townsfolk immediately think him to be a blessing, for their well-loved minister, Arthur Dimmesdale, seemed to be growing weak, and a well-learnt physician was what they thought he needed. Unknown to all the townsmen, Chillingworth was Hester's rightful husband. When he sees her on the scaffold for committing adultery he vows to revenge her partner. This kind of revenge reduces him to a kind of demonic work which he begins on the minister once he becomes his live-in physician. The minister seems to be suffering from something more than physical infirmity. Hester Prynne begins to feel bad about her own quietitude and tells Dimmesdale who Chillingworth really is.I think that this a good book for anyone interested in reading an exciting story that has a moral lesson too. It contains some particular information about Puritan Boston although it is not an in-depth study on this matter. Nathaniel Hawthorne also wrote The House of the Seven Gables, a novel that takes place in the Regional New England era. It is also a good book and contains a moral lesson."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I first read The Scarlet Letter in high school-required reading of course. Even though I enjoyed other works by Hawthorne (\\"Rappaccini's Daughter\\" for instance), getting through \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" was true drudgery. At that time, the book's wordiness and description density got in the way of the plot. Also, I thought the Rev. Dimmesdale was a dwerb (I still do). It wasn't until my son transferred to a new school and complained about having to reread the book that I picked it up again. If he had to suffer through it twice, I figured I would too--and it was worth it.This time around I listened to the book on tape. It was a much better experience. Yes, the characteristics I had complained about earlier remain-the density of description relative to action, the seeming irrelevance of the long prologue to the body of the book, and the antique language and culturally alien setting. But hearing the words rather than seeing them on the page gave them an immediacy and an impact that I had missed earlier-there were even (gasp!) occasional hints of humor in the turn of a phrase. In fact, Hawthorne seemed strikingly modern in his understanding of the subtleties of character; notions of guilt, repression, and revenge; and even his thoughts on the role of women.As a writer, Hawthorne frequently made use of supernatural themes and references to convey psychological truths. \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is no exception. Chillingsworth's researches are those of an alchemist; Mistress Hibbins believes herself a witch; and Pearl, Hester's preternaturally perceptive and occasionally perverse child, is compared to an elf. These Gothic elements are descriptions of the exterior world, but they help form our understanding of the interior world of the characters on which the plot of the book turns. Chillingworth's vengeance, because it-like the work of an alchemist-- is undertaken by choice, is seen as far more evil than Hester and Dimmesdale's adultery, a sin of nature and love. Hester's acceptance of her crime and its punishment becomes her strength. Dimmesdale's decline, in contrast, results from his own weakness and guilt in not acknowledging his role in the illicit affair. Hawthorne's description of his descent into a madness that destroys both mind and body is a stunning and even clinically relevant piece of writing.All in all, \\"The Scarlet Letter \\"is not an easy book and definitely not a book for everyone. But for those who are willing to undertake its complexities of language, allegory and symbolism, it is an extremely rewarding one."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Had great packaging and within 4 days.

If it had been assigned in school I don't think I'd have made it through."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"*Spoiler Alert*I really enjoyed this book. At age 41, I decided it was about time I read \\"the book\\" I somehow avoided reading in high school. It is interesting to find that it represented something entirely different from what I believed. This is not a social commentary on single parenthood or adultery. Rather, it is a comparison of choices and their effects.Regardless of who we are, each of us has something we believe in. We don't have to share the values of others to see how their beliefs drive the consequences of their choices. We can learn from them, even if we don't agree with them.This story contrasts the choices made by the three main characters: Hester Prynne, Reverend Arthur Dimmsdale, and Roger Chillingworth. Each sin against his/her own puritanical beliefs then make choices that profoundly affect their lives.Hester has an adulterous affair with another man. With the birth of her child and an absentee husband, her sin is laid bare for everyone to see. As punishment, a scarlet \\"A\\" is fashioned that she is always to wear upon the breast of her gown. This letter was to represent the stigma of her crime and compel others to treat her as an outcast. Hester lives her life and never stops trying to atone for her sins. In fact, near the end of the book we find that others have started to look upon the \\"A\\" with another meaning, \\"able.\\" She tended the sick, gave assistance to the poor, and offered comfort and relief to souls on their death bed. The \\"A\\" became as Mr. Hawthorne said, \\"the symbol of her calling.\\" (p183) Once rejected and ridiculed, she was now a respected member of her society. Hester, openly, took responsibility for her actions and never again sinned against her beliefs. She found true healing to her soul through service and compassion of her fellowmen.Reverend Arthur Dimmsdale, Hester's pastor, is compelled to pass judgment on her soul. In addition, he is called upon to persuade Hester to give up the name of her fellow-sinner. From his words to her, it is obvious that he is the guilty party. His words, coming from the depths of his soul, confess his part in her sin. He, in effect, is begging her to help him out of his cowardice to stand, once again, in the light. He says, \\"Take heed how thou deniest to him--who, perchance, hath not the courage to grasp it for himself--the bitter, but wholesome, cup that is now presented to thy lips!\\" (p77) After Hester refuses to speak his name, he makes the decision to secretly retain his guilt and gives his soul over to darkness. In the seven years that Hester transforms into a respected member of society, Arthur's guilt causes him to physically become very fragile and weak. In the end, though he finally frees himself from the burden and reveals his secret, he dies. He throws away everything he believes in, and preaches about, to dishonesty, cowardice and fear.Roger Chillingworth, the absentee husband of Hester, shows up the very day she is publically shamed in front of the community. She sees him, while she stands publicly humiliated on the scaffold. Mr. Chillingworth is an old man and admits to Hester that marrying her was wrong. He does not condemn her for her transgression saying, \\"Between thee and me, the scale hangs fairly balanced. But Hester, the man lives who has wronged us both! Who is he?\\" (p85) When she refuses to tell who he is, Roger promises her that he will find out. In addition, he demands that she tell no one of his true identity as her husband. She agrees. Thus, Roger sets in motion his plan of revenge. He recognizes that the pastor is gravely ill and moves in with him. As he investigates he is certain that Reverend Dimmsdale's illness is connected to Hester. He learns the truth one day when the pastor is sleeping. He discovers the \\"A\\" burned onto his chest. With satisfaction, he turns his plans for revenge directly on the pastor. As he comes to his greatest moment of triumph, he is robbed of it when the pastor confesses publicly his sin. Kneeling on the scaffolding, with the Reverend close to death he says, \\"Thou hast escaped me!\\" For seven years Roger's life has been consumed with revenge; after being robbed of it, he dies within the year. Hatred and revenge steal the life he could have known.The purpose of Hawthorne's text is to show that we become a product of our choices--choices governed by our own beliefs. No matter what those beliefs, if we violate their laws, the consequences will be profound. Our strength of character will shine through as we respond to the consequences of our actions. Through those responses we have the potential of gaining or losing many things, including: our self-respect, our reputations, our souls, and even our lives. In short, how we respond to unfavorable consequences will make us stronger or eventually destroy us."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Well, I didn't like this book too much at all. All of the other reviews that I have read say that it's great, it's a classic, a timeless tale! And maybe it is. For me, I found it really hard to get into. There's not much dialogue, or action. The only exciting part comes at the end, with the Reverend Dimmesdale &amp; his confession. Maybe I'll enjoy it when I'm older. I'm only 13 right now, and I don't think I could stand reading it again. My friends know me as a generally fast reader, but this book took me 8 weeks, maybe more, to finish! I found it very boring. I've been reading several books at once, and after a couple pages, I found it too much to keep reading, so I picked up another book that I had previously thought boring, and it seemed like non-stop action! And a lot easier to read, too, than the wording of Nathaniel Hawthorne. However, I will admit that The Scarlet Letter DOES convey a message of guilt, revenge, cowardice &amp; bravery, and the terrible wrong that is sin. For that, I give it 3 stars. I would rate it higher, but, like I said, I found it extremely boring and tiresome. I recommend this book to people who love to read, who don't get too frustrated with tough language, and who have a LOT of time on their hands!:) I'm sure I'll try to read it again someday, but as of now, I need a break from Hawthorne's beautiful, intricate, meaningful, yet difficult words."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This is an easy to read and comprehendible modified version of the novel Scarlet Letter that is read by high school students.

You must focus on the things said instead of the things done. With that in mind, I was profoundly moved by Mr. Dimmesdale's fears and worries, Mr. Chillingworth's cunning complexity, Hester Prynne's quiet silent attitude, and Pearl's devilish actions. Each character in the story was so amazing 3-dimensional.Yes, there are parts in the book that are more verbose than I would have liked, and that is why I rated it a 4. I just learned to ignore those parts that didn't really seem to pertain to the major ideas of the story, and instead focus on those words and feelings that Hawthorne so amazingly expressed. These ideas far outweigh the verboseness. And I actually must admit that I did not find it an extremely long book. If you focus on the reading, it doesn't take long at all (compared to many longer novels of the same class).My advice: Wait until the right time. I tried to read it three times before, and never really got very far. Finally, this summer, I was able to enjoy it immensely. If you are not looking forward to reading it now, then just wait a little longer."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"\\"The Scarlet Letter\\" gains its stature as a great work of art because Hawthorne has selected a historical-social issue, and going beyond the historical and social context, has explored and dramatized the issue in terms of its fundamental social, moral, philosophical and psychological meaning and implications - weaving an intricate pattern in which all the themes are inextricably intertwined and proceed from each other. Further, this novel becomes exceptional because it deals with such complex phenomena in a rather short story and a rather simple plot.To the theme of : \\"The conflict between the individual and society - in context of the consequences of the transgression of a well-established moral norm of society, by the individual\\", Hawthorne has integrated the theme of man's struggle to attain equilibrium-a harmony-with his own self, with society and the supreme source of morality (i.e. God - here I'm speaking from Hawthorne's perspective).Finally, he has further integrated the fundamental (and I think THE most important) theme, which I'd put as: \\"Man's struggle to come to terms with, and glorify the truth.\\"Concealing the truth, faking reality- Hawthorne has denounced all these and above all - the man who fakes the truth about his own character.Note how every event of the story dramatizes all the three themes simultaneously-the integration is impeccable.Guilt, revenge, love, hatred, rebellion, non-conformity, penitence, the nature of sin, the spiritual and psychological condition of the isolated individual - Hawthorne has delved into the nature of all these aspects of human nature and the human soul, which makes reading this novel a psychological tour de force.I'd state the plot-theme of this novel as : \\"The story of four individuals-a priest guilty of adultery-who has concealed his deed from society, thereby earning false esteem and respect of his parishioners; the married woman who partook in his sin and who has been ostracized by the society; the husband of the adulteress, consumed with hate and anger-seeking revenge; and her daughter- a living embodiment of virtue, morality and duty violated - of how their relationships with each other and the society in which they live, help them seek true penitence, glorify the truth-and achieve a proper understanding of their errors, both in terms of their values and their actions.\\"The greatest literary merit of this novel is its plot-structure, which is the most tightly constructed, superbly economized and concentrated plot structure - in fact THE BEST - I've come across - especially in terms of Aristotelian aesthetics, given in \\"The Poetics\\". Hawthorne hasn't included a single character, situation, event, scene or description which is not relevant to the meaning and the plot of the story. Not a single word can be overlooked. Every sentence is condensed such that it can be elaborated into pages of explanation.(I am not including the chapter \\"The Custom House\\" which is very boring and can be conveniently ignored and which I myself did not complete - but according to many, it is also related to the meaning of the novel).Another merit is the terrific symbolism - the deep, dark and wild forest; the beautiful & brilliant rose bush outside the prison door, and a lot more, especially the character of Pearl who symbolizes non-conformity, independence and aggressive rebellion against society .One flaw of this novel is that it is TOO gloomy - which may repel some readers who'd look for some sparks of humor or wit.Also, Hawthorne himself says too much, often coming between the reader and the characters of the story.But I think these flaws are very unimportant in comparison to the merits of the novel.In conclusion I'd say that \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is one of the greatest novels of the 19th century, in fact, one of the greatest of all times. In a story of less than 200 pages, it will give you moral lessons (which you may or may not accept or approve) and insights into human nature and human life which several books may not successfully deal with. Your library and your literary experience are incomplete if you haven't read this novel."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter was quite an adventure through a troubled outcast's mind. The characterization, descriptions, and the story its self made this book one of the best I have read. If it were not for the very advanced vocabulary and the lengthy descriptions, I might have considered this book the best I have read. Hawthorne really allowed the reader to understand every thought of an outcast in a Puritan town. The book takes the reader through interactions with very cruel, sympathetic, and forgiving people. Each encounter brought with it one surprise after another. The book not only examined society and its changing views, but it also gave a rather historically correct account of Puritan life. Before taking this book on, I recommend doing a bit of research on the eccentric Puritan culture. Hawthorne's descriptions of Hester Prynne's thoughts and feelings gave the reader a personal relationship with her. He drops little pieces of information about Hester that make the respect the reader may have for her grow. As the book progressed, Hester's character began to bloom right in front of the reader's eyes. These factors allowed the true cleverness and boldness of Hawthorne's story to shine through. There were only a few aspects that got in the way of true enjoyment of the book. The vocabulary was a bit hard to comprehend when paired up with Hawthorne's inclination to extend his descriptions of a situation for pages. Overall, the book held my attention well and made me think about society in a different way. I would recommend this book to anyone who was willing to take some time interpreting extremely advanced vocabulary in lengthy descriptions."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Emily Queenp.5One may scorn another's action, and participate in the punishment while he is guilty of the same wrong doing, resulting in mental anguish until one confesses, this is the case in \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Hester Prynne is a young woman who has a baby, Pearl, while her husband is away. She is brought before the town for all to see, and Reverend Master Dimmesdale, a clergyman of the town, with disturbing passion, reveals the wrongdoing of Hester. As a punishment for this act, instead of death, Hester has to wear the scarlet letter A on her bosom. She beautifully embroiders it. Even though she feels shame, she appears to wear it with pride. On the way to the scaffold, Hester makes eye contact with her husband, who has recently returned from England. Later he comes to her jail cell and speaks to her. To keep him safe from humiliation, she swears to not reveal his true identity, but to refer to him as Roger Chillingworth, a man of medicine. Hester passes the next seven years with little exposure to the world. She lives off her embroidery to meet the demands of the wealthy, yet she finds time to lend a helping hand to the poor. As she becomes a young girl, Pearl develops somewhat of a devilish disposition. Pearl taunts her mother about the scarlet letter thinking that her mother is a witch. She asks her mother to admit to signing the Black Man's book and that the scarlet letter being his mark. Hester doesn't want her daughter, her only companion, to despise her like the rest of the town so she never tells Pearl why she wears the scarlet letter. One day delivering a pair of gloves to Reverend Master Dimmesdale, she learns of his infirmities, and that Roger Chillingworth is his physician, who seems to be cruel to the minister. Reverend Master Dimmesdale is not only dying from a physical impairment, but also from that of the soul. He has done wrong, but refuses to tell anyone for the shame of the people. He who had so cruelly spoke of Hester's wrong doing in front of the town was guilty of the same. In order to free his troubled mind, he comes before the town and reveals the truth of his relationship with Hester Prynne. This brings a tie between the Hester, Pearl and Dimmesdale that leads to a great event.Throughout \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", Nathaniel Hawthorne uses symbolism to hint a connection between the characters without revealing answers to the questions that build suspense. The scarlet letter \\"On the breast of her gown, in fine red cloth, surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold thread\\" symbolizes much more than just Hester's adultery. Pearl has always been attracted to the scarlet letter, and the way Reverned Master Dimmesdale always has his hand upon his heart. The reader knows Hester's crime, but wonders how the minister has sinned. Then Reverend Master Dimmesdale's guilty conscience leads him to the scaffold where he consequently runs into Hester and Pearl, he asks them to join him; \\"And there stood the minister with his hand over his heart; Hester Prynne, with the embroidered letter glimmering on her bosom; and little Pearl, herself a symbol, and the connecting link between these two.\\" At this point there is no doubt that they are all connected by the sense that they are the product of sin, yet there seems to be a greater tie. Then while looking up to the zenith, the minister sees \\" the letter A-- in out in lines of dull red light\\" The reader may now be wondering if the minister is suffering from guilt of being Pearl's father, and not confessing when he had helped with the punishment of Hester. It has not yet been directly revealed to the reader or any other characters, so the reader is still in suspense, and will be until nearly the end. \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is an intriguing book because of its symbolism."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I just read this book for the second time, at age 43. The first time was at age 15, as a school assignment, and boy, did I not get anything from it back then!But this time, I was enthralled. I gasped, cried, jumped up out of my chair.

Afterword, I could not start another book for days while I thought about the experience I had just had.Read this book as an adult. It is a true great of literature. It is a life experience that everyone should have.And now some warnings: It is set in Puritan America -- not the most relevant setting for modern readers.

It is also irrelevant to our modern times.

I didn't, instead of reading classics such as this, my teacher had us reading books like Go Ask Alice and Jay's Journal. Did I miss out by not reading this book back then, I think I did, and I think it's a shame that teachers are taking books like this out of their curriculum.There were times where the story seemed to drag a bit, and at times it was hard to follow the dialect, but that's to be expected with a classic. I did have a hard time getting drawn into the book, as the first part of the book is a mini-autobiography of the author and how he came to write the book. Once I got past this section though, I was drawn into the story of Hester, Pearl, Roger, and Mr. Dimmesdale. How strong Hester must have been to have endured the critisism of her fellow towns people, and not allow it to stop her from being charitable to others in need. My first thought of Mr. Dimmesdale is that he was quite the weak man, but then the guilt of his secret was probably much harder mentally then what Hester went through publicly. Evil doesn't even begin to describe Roger, however a man in his position is probably not going to be thinking straight to start with. Then there was Pearl, her character was the hardest for me to accept. I think the author went a little too far with some of her persistance and insight into thing beyond her years.

Hawthorne, in this novel above all, is a master of character development. Hester, Roger, and Arthur are all powerfully depicted, and the moral conflict facing each of them is, for two of them at least, overwhelming. Hester is a strong person, stronger than Zenobia in The Blithedale Romance, and, unlike Zenobia, not manipulative. She carries the greatest burden of the book because were she to tell the truth, she would destroy the father of her child. Back when I read the book, and now also, I admired Hawthorne for depicting the evils of strict, damning, religion, which tortures and shames those who don't conform to its dogmas. And I found it ironic that in order to have a better life, Hester leaves the New World and goes to the Old.

While reading the book I was filled with many feelings about it. I enjoyed some chapters, but loathed the ones describing the characters.

I made so many trips to get the dictionary that my legs got tired. I enjoyed the general story-line, but I could have left the adjectives behind.

The roots for this novel can be found in Hawthorne's short story &quot;Endicott and the Red Cross.&quot; This exquisite work shows us a harsh and brutally realistic picture of Puritan America. Hester draws much sympathy as the woman who suffers way too much persecution for her crime of infidelity. Dimmesdale is memorable as the guilty lover who tries to advocate for Hester when the authorities want to take Hester's illegitimate child away. He also offers a very moving passage in XVII when he openly confesses to us (the readers) his guilt. Pearl is captivating as the product of Hester and Dimmesdale's affair. While as a child she can not figure out exact details, she CAN make connections between facts. Roger (Hester's husband) is perhaps Hawthorne's greatest creation. He offers a very chilling and memorable passage in IV when he confronts Hester and reveals his identity to us. He is by far the most intelligent character in the book. Furthermore, his careful investigations contrast strikingly with the other characters breakdowns and outbursts. Hawthorne increases the complexity of this phenomenal character when Roger leaves his wealth to Hester despite her affair. Another fine aspect of this book is the way in which Hawthorne gradually unfolds the major facts and gives us time to figure them out before he flat out tells the crucial happenings."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Where does one begin ? how does one begin ?

The prejudices, superstitions and institutions of the society are expressed so well that contemporary readers, who have little knowledge of New England's history, are able to feel the oppression and religious pressures that were common in that society. Indeed, this work is comparable (if not superior) to Arthur Miller's Crucible."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Most people of todays time don't seem to be able to really get this book. It is written for the time of old when women were homemakers and men ruled all. If things were a sin it was likely a womans fault and everything that happened that wasn't typical was considered either a sign from God or the devils work. So, here we have a story of a very naughty girl who got pregnant out of wedlock. So, by custom she was inprisoned and judged because of her sin. This is where the story begins. She keeps her mouth shut about who helped create this heathen child with her, which shows her own character. Then the story goes through the details of what becomes of her life. The town gossips have their hayday and later in the book people from out of town come to town just to see the girl with the scarlet letter. You see how many people treat her because she chose to not move away but to stay and face her persecutors head on. The whole time she also has to keep seeing her thought to be dead husband who is imitating someone else. All the while she faces many more trials and triumphs them all. She almost gets to run away with her love who fathered her child but circumstances keep that from happening. However slightly sad the ending is, it also ties up many loose ends.

Not improbably, this circumstance wrought a very material change in the public estimation and at marriageable period of life, might have mingled her wild blood with the lineage of the devoutest Puritan among them all.'In sharp contrast with Puritanism, the ultimate message of the author is crystal clear: 'Be true! Be true! Be true! Show freely to the world, if not your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred.'A magisterial human novel."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne proves to be particularly convincing in his ability to convey the hidden adulterous habits that corrupt a small Puritan community in colonial Massachusetts. Through his extensive use of lengthy diction, Hawthorne examines how so-called \\"pious\\" people immediately close their minds when faced with the \\"devil's work.\\" Hester Prynne, an average everyday Puritan woman, finds herself in a set of unforeseeable events as she is excluded from the rest of the town. Hester has given birth in a prison cell to a daughter named Pearl, whose father remains nameless. While Hester's previous husband was deemed dead, she found comfort in her romance with the town's minster Dimmesdale. The resulting child is forced to grow up apart from the rest of the children. She and her mother are now considered outsiders and Hester must wear a Scarlet-embroidered \\"A\\" upon her bosom. Dimmesdale, as the town's minster, is viewed by most as a man free of sin. By deceiving his followers with his hidden identity as Pearl's father, he maintains his high status in society. As public shame becomes an imminent part of Hester's life, Dimmesdale must face the burden of guilt as the love of his life is forced to endure such dreadful circumstances while he remains completely righteous in the eyes of the town.The Scarlet Letteris an excellent source of literature for students who are looking to enrich their curriculum with high-level diction. Hawthorne shows us how superficial impressions give us false portrayals of how life truly becomes as individuals in a \\"caring\\" society suddenly turn against one certain individuals in the moments of their greatest needs."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"When people think of a \\"scarlet letter,\\" we immediate think of a person outwardly branded for something they have done. Credit Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" for that -- it's an intense, impassioned (if slightly hammy) story of a strong-willed woman in Puritan New England, who is branded for her sins and her love for one weak man.In the mid-1600s, a passionate young woman named Hester Prynne has been accused of adultery -- she recently had a baby, even though her husband was abroad. Just as damning to the elders is the fact that she won't name baby Pearl's father. Even her estranged husband -- a cold-hearted older man calling himself Roger Chillingworth -- wants to know her lover's identity, but Hester steadfastly refuses to even hint at the man's identity.We learn early in the book that Pearl's dad is actually the local minister Arthur Dimmesdale, who is wracked with guilt, hallucinations and sickness because of his secret adultery. Chillingworth slowly deduces who his wife's lover was, and begins to scheme revenge on Dimmesdale. Will the former lovers manage to escape their guilt-ridden lives, or will they reveal the truth to everyone?It sounds like \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is JUST a story about guilt and sin, but it's also a story about love and steadfastness. Hester remains strong and kind throughout her life despite others' cruelty to her, and her love for Dimmesdale and Pearl is what gives her that strength. Chillingworth (symbolic name!) is a cuckold, but it's impossible to like him because of his lack of love -- he loves no one, and lives only for revenge.And at the same time, Hawthorne reminds us that goodness can overcome your past sins. Hester slowly overcomes the Puritans' loathing for her by simply being charitable, kind, helpful and loving, until eventually her sin is eclipsed by her virtues. On the flip side, Dimmesdale is annoying because of his weakness and cowardice -- I know he's supposed to be wracked with guilt, but he's so pathetic compared to Hester that it's just infuriating.Hawthorne's writing may take a little while for modern audiences to get used to. It's very 19th-century in style, with staid, slightly stuffy prose gilded with hauntingly poetic moments and intense passion (\\"Never, never!\\" whispered she. \\"What we did had a consecration of its own\\"). At times Hawthorne's story gets a little... hammy (such as Dimmesdale revealing his \\"A\\" burn scar), but the power of his story keeps this from getting silly.\\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is used to describe outward signs of guilt, but Hawthorne's novel is actually about strength and love, and how they can blot out misdeeds."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel HawthorneThe deep and controversial tale of The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne, was first published in 1850 by the company Ticknor and Fields. From there it became more and more famous and made many people reflect on what is right or wrong. Nathaniel Hawthorne was born on July 4, 1804 in Salem, Massachusetts. After being laid off from his surveying occupation, in 1848, he wrote The Scarlet Letter in the free time that he then had. Unfortunately, he died at age 60, on May 19, 1864, due to failing health. Throughout his life, his mother, who was widowed, had an impact on his life. She made him realize that it was better to make something out of his life, rather than stay in solitude. Many of his life experiences, like this one, contributed to quite a few of his stories. The historical fiction book, The Scarlet Letter is no exception. While the interesting plot shows lessons, such as sinning, it also shows how, that although it may be bad, it's really up to you to choose the way to handle those mistakes. Although there are no illustrations, this tale is certainly not lacking in vivid descriptions and the play of emotions. It is a page turning tale of love, sin, guilt, and self respect.In the middle of the seventeenth century, in Boston, Massachusetts, the intriguing characters of The Scarlet Letter unfold their tale. The main character is Hester Prynne, who is a young woman originally from Europe, was sent ahead of her husband Roger Chillingworth to go to America. He was delayed a long time and while he was still in Europe, Hester had an affair with a man who is known as Arthur Dimmesdale. Together they had a child who Hester named Pearl. The moment that society heard news of the crime Hester had committed, they out casted her, looked down upon her, and shamed her for what she had done. Hester, who is inside a strong and loving woman, must endure the shame and guilt that she has put on herself. In the beginning she is ashamed of what she has done and wishes, more than anything, that she could provide better for her baby. Although, she is doubtful that she'll be able to endure herself, Hester proves she is willing to make the most out of things. By the end of the book, Hester comes to grips with herself and realizes throughout that she is a good mother and caregiver. Her husband Roger Chillingworth is a frightening man who attempts to take revenge on Dimmesdale. He torments Dimmesdale, who begins to develop a heart condition from his self torture and heavy emotions. Dimmesdale, too, has a burdened heart. Pearl is a mature little girl, who is caught in the middle of things. She is very intellectual and painfully is an outcast because of her mother's actions. She tries to help her mother stay strong, although she is aware of the red letter \\"A\\" on her mother's breast. The main characters create a triangle of dismay and emotional strain, which leads to a moving plot.The conflicts and plot of The Scarlet Letter are painful as a reader to hear about. Hester Prynne is sent to America before her husband Roger Chillingworth. While waiting for her husband to arrive, who ends up taking a long time, Hester has an affair with a man named Arthur Dimmesdale. Hester gets pregnant with a baby girl and when the town finds out, the leaders decide that as her punishment, she must display a red letter \\"A\\" on her chest indefinitely. Everyone in the town condemns her for her actions and they outcast her. While Hester takes all the ridicule for the sin she undeniably committed, her lover takes none, however he is slowly eating away inside because of his extreme guilt. Hester keeps the identity of her baby's father a secret, but soon her husband Roger Chillingworth gets the feeling that Dimmesdale is the dad. Chillingworth begins to torture Dimmesdale emotionally. Towards the end, Dimmesdale develops a heart condition and is fated to die. The feelings within the story, rise and fall, because of the difficult conflicts that must be faced.The theme of The Scarlett Letter is intertwined with the climax of the story. Throughout the majority of the book, every thing is a secret. You know that Hester has a husband, but for some time, it is unclear who it is. You also know that Hester Prynne had an affair and a child with some unknown lover. Over the chapters, you begin to get apprehensions of who might be the father and who is her husband. When you find out that the cold Roger Chillingworth is her husband, it is quite surprising. Although, when you find out that Arthur Dimmesdale is the father, it is even more astonishing. These are very exciting moments in the book leading up to the big climax, when Dimmesdale publically announces that he is the father of baby Pearl, who is Hester's baby as well. This climax corresponds with the theme of the book. I feel that the theme is about sin, and if you sin, then it is truly best to be honest about it. Dimmesdale took part in the crime that Hester also committed and while Hester had to publically admit to it, Dimmesdale didn't. He kept his secret sin to himself for a long time, when eventually it became too much for him to keep inside and he had to come clean about it. He felt better that he admitted to it, although it brought along some difficult problems. Inside, though, he felt as though it was needed. He couldn't see Hester suffer from the crime he equally committed. The climax teaches us a lesson about life because of the way in which characters admit to their mistakes.I personally found this book very interesting. I thought that the characters all had unique and specific characteristics that made the story more complicated. I loved how the plot was told in such a way that was able to keep secrets from the reader, yet give clues about who plays what role. That was my favorite part. It kept me turning the pages because I wanted to know how things would unravel and come together in the end. The ones who would enjoy this book the most would be people in their late teens or early adulthood. You can make comparisons to the way life is today and how it was then and it teaches valuable lessons about sinning. When I started this book, I was unsure about how it would be, since it was a hard read. The Scarlet Letter was written quite awhile ago, so some of the terminology is hard to grasp. I'm glad I read it though because it was a book that I could choose how deep I wanted to make it, which are the type books that hold my interest. Overall, I feel that this was a very good book, with an interesting topic, and I would suggest it to lots of people."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"i am a seventh grader and i think this book is amazing... i absolutly loved the story and the descriptions of the book. this is an awesome book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I love this story!

In a moment, however, wisely judging that one token of her shame would poorly serve to hide another, she took the baby on her arm, and, with a burning blush, and yet a haughty smile, and a glance that would not be abashed, looked around at her townspeople and neighbors. On the breast of her gown, in fine red cloth, surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold-thread, appeared the letter A. It was so artistically done, and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy, that it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the apparel which she wore; and which was of a splendor in accordance with the taste of the age, but greatly neyond what was allowed by the sumptuary regulations of the colony. - Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter.You can always tell a patriarchal society from a matriarchal society. A patriarchal society, one ruled by males, is almost always more cruel, punitive, and coarse in general. A matriarchal society, one ruled by females, is usually more nurturing and accommodating in general. Male dominated societies are fearful and violent in most cases. Female dominated societies tend to be trusting with caution. Where even you see children suffering and women being abused, there are men in complete control. The unfortunate fact for us is that all societies today are ruled by men, at least all of the societies that I can think of are. I sure would like to see a female ruled society, just once. -"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I will admit that shipping did not go as planned but that was not on the sellers part.

I do not recommend reading it at all. The introduction is incredibly long, and incredibly boring. Also, it doesn't really have the sort of plot that would make it a book you can't put down.

If you are looking for a classic to read, I would recommend The Count Of Monte Cristo, not this book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I had to read this book, which I had heard quite a bit about, for school but after reading it I had no idea why it is considered such a classic. There is no question that the language is old-fashioned and difficult, but that isn't the only problem I found with it. The whole story was rather boring. It seemed that the author tried to make a lightweight story about an affair and the child that was a product of it deeper or more important by describing how the characters felt. The book was not exactly bad, but, like many other books, it does not really deserve its status as a classic. I saw it more as a book that showed somewhat the morals and ideas of the Puritans. While it is good in that sense, I don't think that it is very important in modern times, and it certainly wasn't a fun read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I feel that the Scarlet Letter is one of the most instense novels I have ever read.

An excellent novel!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"First of all: those who found the book to be dull, such as me, listen to it on tape (it's abbreviated yet still dangerous = boring to listen to while driving, as I found out). Indeed, Hawthorne introduces some advanced ideas for the times, such as writing about a single mother, as well as musings about women's rights. His obsession with Victorian themes, such as the deification of children, fixation on bodily sins, as well as overdramatization and simplification of the plot equals predictability and annoyance to the reader. While this book could probably be considered &quot;a classic,&quot; such as Tolstoy's &quot;Anna Karenina,&quot; both are better classified as carefully crafted literary exercises rather than engaging stories."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Aghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, this the worst book i've ever read, I consider myself open to all fine lterature but I absolutely hate this book. But the writing is superb!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Yes the writing is poetic...but the book says the same thing over and over. I didn't feel like I learned anything from reading this book, the characters are rather flat and the symbols are far too obvious and there is too many of them. It's like Hawrthorne had a contest with himself to see how many symbols he could cram in."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The two missing stars are the result of Hawthorne's abuse of repetitions throughout the novel.At times, the novel is redundant - while it might have served to emphasize the author's purpose, Hawthorne's repetitiveness is an overkill. His point could have been delivered in one piece even if he cuts multiple parts out from the novel. Like Korean dramas (Hawthorne even captures the love triangle and illegitimate aspects of said dramas), this book is a complete drag - but only in the beginning and ending. The parts that connect the two are at times, either intriguing and twisted or completely dull and uneventful. These sudden, drastic changes are often hard for readers to adjust to when trying to focus and decipher what is going on.Despite Hawthorne's verbosity, the novel should be merited for its moral conflicts posed of the society. The ostracized, as Hawthorne portrays, can be good and unaffected by the majority; the community, on the other hand, is unforgiving and hypocritical of what they say. The characters in the novel are set to explore the moral boundaries of human nature - the community, in fact, is a microcosm of the world. This sets up the entire novel to be an example of man vs society, with Hester and pearl representing man and the Puritan society as society.There is heavy symbolism in the novel: from the letter A to the entire community or even Pearl, each little detail carries a double meaning that contributes to the build-up of the book's climax. Because of Hawthorne's repetitive style, these symbols are easy to notice and hard to overlook. They are motifs that keep recurring throughout the novel as Hawthorne relentlessly inserts one every now and then.The denouement is in many ways disappointing. Of all possibilities, I could not imagine an ending less exciting than what Hawthorne has chosen. Otherwise, the story overall is worth a read for its in-depth analysis of the hypocrisies of the society."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book was purchased for my daughter for a class. I remember reading it in high school and yeap, still almost as drawn out as it was back then. We both think the same thing. But, a good read nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter weaves a tale about the implications of sin and how we deal with the past. In an early colonial Puritan setting, Hester Pryne, the main character, must overcome extreme adversity to raise her child while persecuted by her community. Her struggle to cope mirrors that of another character: Arthur Dimmesdale. However, the introductory section of this book was repetitive, horrendous, and did not contribute any additional background to this book. Hawthorne's style, particularly the introductory section, is difficult to read because he expands his sentences until they seem only long complicated strands of words. It is confusing to understand. The sentences are protracted to the point that the readers are thrown off from the immense length of a single sentence. The plot drags very slowly and is not very exciting throughout the entire book. Though it has its moments, this book is difficult and extremely lacks flavor and uniqueness that distinguishes other books.The beginning of the book, excluding the introduction, seems typical of most books. The author sets up the settings and introduces Hester Pryne and her child. While setting up the situation, the book was remarkably easier to read than the introduction. Already, Hawthorne starts to weave out the theme of sin that consistently stays with this novel. The opening of the book was intriguing enough to continue reading as Hester's life unfolds. Hawthorne details the reasons why she is condemned and marked with the Letter A. Her encounter with Chillingworth is an impressive moment as he administers draughts and does greatly contribute to the plot. Hawthorne, indeed, has his redeeming qualities. However, by the end of the novel, his language and style wear down the reader's interest in the novel. Through a third-person view, Hawthorne distances Hester Pryne and her situation away from readers. It is this distance that hurts how readers interpret this book. Hawthorne's style seems to not stir any emotions. Hester's actions and her conflicts do not seem engaging. There is a general lack of emotional appeal.His style is another issue. His sentence structure is quite complicated due to his long sentences. He enjoys describing certain moments with symbolism. With Hester's departure from the jail, he points out to certain religious groups how saint-like she appears. Although this enriches the book, he continues to tag on additional references that eventually are overwhelming. With engorged sentences, he blandly creates 228 pages that are confusing, choppy, but occasionally entertaining and understandable.Overall, the book was quite interesting but was extremely complicated in its style as a whole. The plot does not stimulate readers to continue reading because of Hawthorne's complicated and distant style but the story itself is quite amusing. Hester and Arthur's struggle with their inner secrets and sins evokes sympathy. Though Hawthorne has a very complicated style of writing, he successfully manages to convey his main points. This book does not meet the specifications of being strong but neither is it weak. Though difficult to understand Hawthorne's style, the main theme and plot are easily understood. It would require some conviction to read this book but it is worth it. Readers will be able to enjoy this book based on their background experiences and though Hawthorne is a great writer, this book was occasionally too dull to excite many readers."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"In general, I enjoy how Nathaniel Hawthorne singles Hester out and makes this book about psychological isolation, rather than a physical isolation. He sheds light on society, unafraid to advocate the cause of free thought and humanism, whether it be mankind's feats or flaws.The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne explores the human flaws of an intricate Puritan society, in which Hester Prynne is victimized; however, through a different point of view, she is actually fortunate to gain great insight and wisdom, as she triumphs over societal expectations. The Puritan community requires its citizens to act proper with decorum. When Hester violates that very belief, she becomes shunned from society. Devastated in the beginning, but she is quick to realize that it is not she that is odd, when in fact, it is the whole community that is at fault for treating her with malice. Instead of perishing in despair, like the town expects, she actually grows stronger everyday mentally. Contrary to what the town believes, Hester boldly opposes the norm, which in this case is a subtle flaw. As a result, Hester gains insight and wisdom, a gift that the town will never be able to attain. Thus, Nathaniel Hawthorne takes a stab at human flaws in the Puritan society, by revealing its foolishness through the eyes of Hester Prynne.In my opinion, Hawthorne is adept at pointing out society's flaws, and he writes what he truly believes so his audience would see the obscured flaws of society. Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter investigates the human flaws of a Puritan Society through the eyes of Hester, who ultimately triumphs over societal expectations; Hawthorne argues that in order for one to truly perceive flaws of an entity, one has to be boldly detached and thus objective of that entity. Hester is the epitome of a bold individual, who cares less about societal expectations, when she learns that it is not she that is peculiar, but it is the town that is unusual. It is not until then that she truly takes an objective stance and explores and studies the Puritan community. Able to overcome the initial despairs of desolation, Hester ultimately prevails through her eventual apathy towards the town's views. She does exactly what society does not expect her to do. Instead of diminishing, she stands even stronger than before, an attitude that annoys the rest. It is then that an individual truly defies the norm and understands societal flaws.I find that Hawthorne's theme in this book is much like that of The Catcher in the Rye. The idea of completely transforming a weakness into a strength is illustrated in both The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne and Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger demonstrated by Hester Prynne and Holden Caulfield, respectively. Both protagonists are shunned from society because of their inability to demonstrate \\"normal\\" behaviors; however, it is that very individuality that rewards them wisdom and insight of the societal flaws."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"It's important to realize that Hawthorne grew up in the same atmosphere as his protagonist Hester does in The Scarlet Letter. In this powerful novel, Hester is forced to wear an emblem of shame after having an affair with an unknown. Out of suffering the town's hatred and ridicule, Hester isolates herself and her new child away from the intolerant town. Yes, Hawthorne condemns the ignorant nature of the town as Hester is a walking symbol of strength. Hawthorne depicts the towns members of doing evil things against her such as conspiring to take away her child in response to her refusing to reveal her lover's name. But then, the novel takes an interesting turn as Hester questions the eternal state of her soul. Is she a true sinner for having this child out of honest love? Would a higher being punish Hester for such a thing? The characters in the plot will all beg for your sympathy, and you will want to give each character as much as you can. Hester's husband may be sadistic and completely unsympathetic, but he has nevertheless been a victim of her affair. Hester's lover is constantly in a pitiful state. In addition to garnering sympathy, it's interesting how Hawthorne manipulates the roles of each character in the plot so that they serve as symbols of Hawthorne's greater purpose. This is the case particularly with Hester's child, Pearl. As you read this, pay close attention to her role as the catalyst for all of what happens in the plot and the transformations she causes all the characters to experience towards the end. This was an extremely moving tale, though not completely perfect. It lagged on after the beginning to a point where the reader wasn't that active in the plot anymore. For me, I felt that the focus was shifted away from certain aspects I thought were more important. Overall, I've read Hawthorne's other short stories and this wasn't his best but he had a fascinating obession with religion and its impact on American society."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"wow, this book was a hard one to start, but in the end it was rewarding.Many of the scenes drag on forever and it seems like there are descriptions of every little speck of dust flying in the air but trust me. You'll get throught it. The worst part is the beginning when all the scenes seem to be one long monotonous picture that won't change. Nothing seems to happen.But, actually something does. The understanding of this book starts at the beginning and for the reasons above, that can be easily missed. As Hesther walks down with everyone watching her carry her baby, her ties to her husband as well as the father of the child are revealed. There is symbolism with every element of nature that is examined and this all completes the story. Without this you will suffer much confusion or you might just feel like you are left out of something in the story.both authors reveal the effect original sin has on one's soul and the different ways of dealing with that sin.My advice to you...read the book to understand it and to cherish, not just to get it done. This book doesn't deserve that. It teaches many morals, such as the struggle within one's self over sin as Hawthorne reveals the effect original sin has on one's soul and the different ways of dealing with that sin."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Hester Prynne is a young woman who has committed adultery. As punishment for what her Puritan religion considers being a crime, Hester is branded with the letter \`A'. Hester must wear the letter, which has been beautifully embroidered in scarlet onto her gown, to remind her of the burdens she carries because of her sin; a second husband, Mr. Dimmesdale, a daughter, Pearl, and a town full of enemies who consider her irrational. The commotion that Hester's affair caused was not pleasant. Many shunned and abandoned poor Hester. She was left to fend for herself and newborn daughter with no help from her husband or anyone else. Even Mr. Dimmesdale, the local Puritan church leader who was involved in Hester's affair, turns against her by charging her of the crime! Dimmesdale tries his hardest to cover up his mistake but Hester endures more sorrow and feels even more damaged than him. Although Hester Prynne's decision to betray her husband and her religion may not have been a good one, Hawthorne proves that she is not the only one who deserves to be punished. He criticizes the Puritan ways and shows that sometimes punishment isn't necessary; when the person being punished has learned a lesson.Pearl is in a way punished as well, for something she does not know about. Although the young girl grows up happy and almost carefree, she really isn't. Her mother learns to love her even though she was born by a sin and eventually she meets her father who loves her as well.Even after Hester has showed her town she can raise a child \\"the Puritan way\\" without any trouble, it takes them awhile to realize that Hester really shouldn't have had to suffer so much pain and sorrow for something that was not any different from things they had done. Hawthorne's novel is stunningly well written and teaches a valuable lesson to the reader; be true to everyone, even yourself. \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" is a timely classic that should be remembered always and forever. The last sentence of Nathaniel Hawthorne's amazing novel sums up the entire book perfectly: \\"On a field sable, the letter \`A' gules.\\" This is a great book for anyone who loves suspense, drama, love, and authors who write with a passion that allows the reader to visualize what's happening and feel the heartache that Hester felt."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I was very pleased.

The author treats the readers as if they completely lack a brain by stating the understood and by completely beating concepts to death (note the reference)."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Pretensions of public morality is what Hawthorne aims at--his story shows the hypocrisy of Puritan leaders imposing a legalistic, rigid morality on the community, and lifelong shame on one woman's indiscretion, to the extent that their judgmental rigidness can almost be deemed a sin in its own right. You can see the ending coming a mile away, and it's a bit too melodramatic for my taste. Even so, the real story is not just the actions of the characters but rather how guilt works itself out--Hawthorne's storytelling keeps you absorbed right to the end such that you don't want to put the book down. Very interesting food for thought on the relationship of public and private morality.

What good is it to deny a woman love when her husband is lost at sea? What good is it to deny a child a father because of the \\"sin\\" of her parents?Hawthorne skillfully explores the psyche of people living under the burden of an oppressive system: a lady burdened with the guilt of being a single mother, a minister burdened with the guilt of his secret love, and a child burdened with a wild temperament untamed by a father's love or a mother's discipline.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"'The Scarlet Letter' is a beautifully written and perfectly balanced classic of American literature, addressing in a lean 251 pages countless issues of the human experience: love, the nature of sin and shame and repentance, revenge and mercy, civilization and wild, society and ostracism. In bald terms, 'The Scarlet Letter' is absolutely one of the best pieces of writing ever, um, written.A lot of people seem to take umbrage at Hawthorne's affected 19th-century style. My advice to you: get over it. It's a style, no more or less valid than any other style, and though it is a kind of writing that is out of fashion at the moment, Hawthorne manages to create an extremely deep and moving story much more effectively than most of the modern authors I read. The same advice do I offer to those who complain that they were 'forced' to read this book for a class. Please, skip the next episode of 'Gilmore Girls' and sit down with a book like this one.

The strength of Hester Prynne is unusual for novels composed during the time this was published, and is therefore a revolutionary literary work. My only complaint is the length of \\"The Custom House,\\" however horrible this sounds, I would just skip it, it does not add to the plot of the novel anyway."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I read Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter for my Advanced English 11 class. This is not a book I would normally have picked up and read, but I am glad that I read it.The Scarlet Letter deals with themes of love, society's oppression, secrets, a character finding herself, as well as numerous other classic literature themes. I found the book itself to be challenging to read, but I liked the story. Hawthorne explores when feelings and passion conflict with religion, which was fascinating to consider from a religious perspective.Although I did not enjoy the book much at the time I had to read it, it proved to be quite useful when I took the AP Literature and Composition Test this year. When I had to choose one book to frantically review the day before the test, this is the book I chose. Sure enough, this is the book I used for the AP test as a reference.This is an essential book for anyone taking AP Literature."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot, once I got past the slow parts. Hester Prynne is found pregnant out of wedlock. Since she won't reveal the identity of the father, she is forced to wear the Scarlet Letter \\"A\\" on her chest for the rest of her life. She gives birth to a girl and she changes her life around, so at the end of the book, people refer to her as \\"Angel\\" instead of \\"Adulterer.\\"This is a timeless tale because the situation could easily happen in any time period. When we do something wrong, the way we live our lives afterwards is the determining factor of our moral character. One event does not define us. It's our entire lives that should be taken into account. I think that is Nathaniel Hawthorne's point. Redemption is possible for anyone, regardless of their sin. Also, the father who remained unknown to the society but not the reader, suffers enormously because he doesn't confess. This is a good point. When we hide our sins, the only person it ultimately hurts, is us."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"After the short introduction about the Scarlet Letter, the story unfolds with Hester Prynne, the protagonist, beginning the second part of her life, branded with a Scarlet Letter A for adultery. Standing on a scaffold garnering public humiliation, Hester is questioned about her partner-in-sin -Arthur Dimmesdale. However, Hester refuses to answer, preferring to bear her sin and punishment alone. Dialogue between the townspeople before the questioning depicts a harsh community, unforgiving with sin and falling out of line. However, Hester painfully endures all this and readily accepts her sin, portraying her strong character already. At the beginning of her punishment, Hester is shunned from the rest of the community. Eventually though, she contributes to her society more by volunteering. She integrates her scarlet letter, a constant daily reminder of her wrongdoing, into her life, and moves on. Interestingly enough, the protagonist -depicted as a strong independent character -is a woman. Hester's child, the only pure and innocent character Pearl, is also female. Ironically, Pearl was created through adultery, a severe sin, and therefore would not be considered pure in anyway. However, her name suggests the most beautiful form of purity and cherishment. Contrasting, the morally weak, unable to move on from the past are males. Nathanial Hawthorne ingeniously establishes this female versus male motif, praising the woman's strength of suffering while denouncing the men's weakness.Through Dimmesdale's character, Hawthorne explores guilt's destructivity of human beings. Beginning as a strong revered preacher, Dimmesdale's guilt of sin eats him away inside, leaving him only an empty shell. Hawthorne carefully depicts this deterioration, masterfully capturing each emotion felt by Dimmesdale. Hawthorne creates yet another round character with the physician -the leech - Roger Chillingworth. Driven by an injured pride, Chillingworth sets his life goal to ruin his adversary. His internal overwhelming anger hidden by a calm composed countenance only furthers his horrifying intrinsic nature. Still, Chillingworth's character is weak, unable to forget the past and accept the present circumstances. He wastes his life away, attaining happiness from another's misery -a creepy yet temporary way of life. Able to extend his characters to the deepest of human emotion, Hawthorne develops his characters, though unrealistically, to form an impressionable memory in the reader.Symbols scattered throughout the story render The Scarlet Letter a clever, well-thought-out book. The most obvious symbol would be the physical scarlet letter, a shameful A representing adultery. However, it is described as wonderfully embellished, glittering with a gold outline -a symbol of beauty and confidence. The reader wonders what Hawthorne's opinion about sin really is -an unforgivable crime or an ignition sparking personal growth. Also, Hawthorne's naming perfectly matches each character's personality. For example, Dimmesdale, is the most gray, melancholy and miserable character (although we do not pity him for his character is weak), garnering the name DIMmesdale. Chillingworth is, from \\"chill\\", a cold character, distancing himself from everyone and whose only purpose is to ruin another.In all his stories, Hawthorne's writing style can be best described as ambiguous and delightfully detailed. The ambiguity establishes a sense of curiosity in the reader -leaving the reader wanting to know more about Hester's story. At the end, Hawthorne speaks about the Scarlet Letter -has it become a symbol of hope or failure? Also, his long detailed sentences places images after images in the reader's head, transporting the reader back to Hester's time. Thus, the reader is more involved in the book, no longer in his present but the past.The Scarlet Letter uses a variety of hidden clever symbols, and implements an ambiguous but detailed style into his story. Setting his story in a strict Puritan community, Hawthorne presents a strong feminist view of a male-dominated society. My favorite though? The character development."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"In high school, which was quite some time ago, I \\"had\\" to read this story and if I needed a quick nap all I needed to do was pull out Scarlet Letter. Many years later I read it again. I knew there was a reason that Hawthorne had this grip on me. His writing is so dark, yet wonderfully illuminating. No one utilizes symbols better than Hawthorne. The idea that Hester lives on the edge between the city and the woods is a great example of how that represents her situation. It's absolutley brilliant. Also, there has to be a connection to Hawthorne's anguish through the character of Pastor Dimmesdale. The idea of living with so much guilt in a community that was intolerant of 'mortal' sins reveals the soul of Hawthorne and the quiet cry of a man tortured with his past.I would highly recommend other stories of his, novels or short stories, in order to better understand his anguish and desire for perfection. Once I read other stories it made this novel so much easier to understand. This is on level with Romeo and Juliet without the feud.Scott A. Reighard, author:Jamestown: Journey Back in Time"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This novel is a very intriguing story about an attractive young woman living in a Puritan society, where she is put in compromising situations and must maneuver herself out of them. Hester Prynne (the captivating young puritan woman) has allowed herself to be put in one too many situations though, when she gets pregnant by a man other than her husband. This terrible sin caused the Puritan society to punish her for her sins against god and her husband. In doing so the community sentenced Hester to live the rest of her life wearing the letter \\"A\\" on the bosom of her dress. This entire scenario is described extremely well by Hawthorne, by using elaborate sentences with great descriptions, both of the people's opinions and of the scenery, to provide a very full and vivid picture in the mind of the reader. This story has great twists and surprises in it which draws the reader into the story, to where the reader feels as if they are actually in the society and watching how every one acts towards Hester and her daughter. Hawthorne uses advanced vocabulary to describe the settings, people, and the people's opinions. The descriptive sentences and complex vocabulary of this novel make it very attractive to any reader wishing to expand their vocabulary and even part of their history, by learning a little about how the Puritan society's belief system worked and how the society viewed people and their actions. Now granted all the information in this novel is not all factual however the reader gets a real feel of strict and moral the Puritans were during that time. This novel by far with its advanced vocabulary and wonderfully descriptive sentences is one of the best novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"Scarlet Letter was rather dry and not very intresting at the beginning, but overall, the book was pretty bearable, if not interesting at times. Hester's daughter, for example, was quite intriguing with her &quot;witchy- sinful?&quot; characteristics and I felt really sorry for Hester. The ending was kinda predictable, but still, if you want to read it, check it out from the library."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The whole time reading The Scarlet Letter I thought that it was just extremely interesting. The characters were well-developed and at times, endearing. The way that Hawthorne is able to describe the torture that Reverend Dimmesdale undergoes is very believable. Although I am only thirteen years old and have never committed adultery, I find it easy to relate to Hester Prynne. And Pearl, my most favorite of all the characters, just adds a very interesting touch to the story. Despite the good characters, I did not like the fact that during most of the book, parts of the main plot are dismissed for chapters at a time to describe something not always commpletely relevent to the story. But, overall, I thought this book was very interesting, and would definately take the time to read it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The scarlet letter was one of the best books i've ever read, and the only reason i'm putting in my 2 cents is because i've noticed the negative reaviews and i just want to clarify something - this is NOT a boring book at all - if you are in any way intellegent. This isn't dick and jane people. don't expect it to be a walk in the park. yes, the language does talk a little while to get used to, but once you do it draws you into the story. this book is anything but boring, but if you did find yourself falling asleep it probably wasn't the book that was bad, just your reading level. I highly highly highly reccomend this book. the characters are fully and beautifully developed and the symbolism, foreshadow, and imagery are all delicous."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"It is no secret that Nathaniel Hawthorne is a household name of our time, mentioned in almost every book group, every school, and has touched every American's bookshelf at least briefly. When writing a review on such a classic masterpiece, it is hard to evaluate the faults in The Scarlet Letter. I started thinking about what in the novel I could detract points for, I thought of nothing. Ornate detail, reflective thoughts, chapters that literally push Mach 6 and an example of irony that defeats all other novel's attempt to insert the literary tool into their work(s). Some complain about the Shakespereon language used, but one must consider that this was the toungue in the time the novel was set. To base critisism soley on that would be similar to rejecting The Beatles for not sounding like Eminem. Hawthorne did not write this novel overnight, many revisions were made and the work itself reflects that. Many subtle details are hidden between the lines of almost every sentence, and the reader never knows first hand which sentence can possibly foretell another event in a later chapter. One is constantly guessing at outcomes of the novel until the bittersweet end and it is this, above all else, that gives The Scarlet Letter it's place on the throne. Definatly pick up the novel, but buy it, there are so many notes one must make in various chapters in order to fully comprehend the magnitude of the piece. It is, without a doubt, five star reading and will continue to carry that rank in my mind and in the mind of many other reviewers as well. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"One of the greatest novels in all of literature, The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne tells of a life vastly different from those that we live today. Rejecting the present permissive lifestyle to which we are accustomed, the reader is entrenched in the gloom and doom of Puritan society. It is an exposure to a law that tells us what to wear, how to think, and whom to love. The Scarlet Letter is a story of law versus human nature, hypocrisy, and of undeniable passions.Enlightening and refreshing, the reader is taken on an adventure and fully understands the risks of living passionately, beyond the limits that society sets. A novel that can be enjoyed by all ages, The Scarlet Letter is a masterpiece of its time."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"The Scarlet Letter is an excellent book. Hawthorne spends so much time discussing the characters' thoughts and motives that by the end of the book, you can understand why the people act the way they do. It makes them seem almost real. He relates nature to what the character's are experiencing that makes the story even more powerful. In one place he told of a rose bush that grew by the prison so it seemed Nature was saying that even though other people had abandoned them, someone could always count on the nature's love. It's very beautifully written. The story of adultery and jealous spouses happens in our own day which makes The Scarlet Letter relate to the reader. It's just a great book all over, and I feel that it's one of the best ever written."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"This book is one of the greatest classics of American literature, and my personal favortie. It is the story of Hester Prynne, a strong woman who struggles between her society's austere piety and the callings of her heart. She must hide her beautiful fire beneath gray simplicity, yet she has a badge with which she can proclaim her true spirit to the world. Through her scarlet letter and her illegetimate child Pearl (who herslef is a nonconformist in the true Emersonian spirit), Hester is a mirror of truth in her smothered and pious surroundings. Hawthorne proves his skill through exquisite descripions and proves his wisdom as he explores the impossibilities of feminine nature. This is a book that everyone should read, not only as a classic, but also as an extraordinary piece of literature that rings true even today."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"A short novel portraying the life struggles of a young woman named Hester Prynne who is shunned by the rest of her society by commiting the crime of adultery. The product of this crime was her daughter, Pearl. Pearl is stuck in the middle and sometimes even seen as evil by the town's people because she was the product of this crime. Hester, however shunned, still stands tall and proud. She's a strong woman that doesn't really care what people think of her. The only other person that sticks by her side is her lover, Arthur Dimmsdale. I liked this book, but I did not enjoy the way that Hawthorne refers to &quot;the reader&quot;. It pulled away from the story. I do, however, still recommend that one reads this book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Letter A Romance","review":"By reading the title of my reviw, most would probably not believe that I am an 11th grade student who was initially 'forced' to read &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; for an assignment. I knew of the book before I read it, and had been interested in it and its plot for some time before, as, for some reason, I'm utterly infatuated by the American Puritan period. I read &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; on the day I recieved it, and found it amazing, one of the best books I've read; very true to its title of &quot;classic&quot;. They don't write books like this anymore; pity. The &quot;copious style&quot; of Hawthorne is not for everyone, but it certainly was for me; as, being an 'aspiring writer' myself, who loves to explore language, I found the style inspiring with incredibly beautiful discriptives. Some also find the book to be slowly paced, but, then again, what is the pace your teacher is making the class read it at? If they told you to sit down and read it as a normal book, it would pace itself much quicker. The plot is timeless, and a change for those involved with today's plot-driven and bland tales, the language is masterful, the characters thought-out and filled with emotion. I truly enjoyed this book.

Shelly is not a fan of the opposite sex, believing facetiously that God performed a cosmic joke when she created males. She thinks even less of marriage. Thus, she wonders if the loot is worth standing at the altar on Valentine's Day marrying her DEAD SEXY cyber mate Kit Kincade just because if they make a go of it, the duo receives a ton of cash.Chaperoned by a horde of Desperate and Dateless employees, Kit and Shelly go on their honeymoon to Reunion, a former French colony tropical island paradise. As the balmy island turns nasty with everything going wrong, Shelly and Kit begin to share real feelings for one another except that nothing about him is real.Though much of the wit is HIT AND MS, chick lit fans will receive plenty of laughs especially with Shelly's one liners that make her seem at times more like a Vegas stand up comic (sorry that's Shecky Green). The story line is a lighthearted frolic that focuses on degrees of fabrication between the lead couple as a cornerstone of the relationship. Kathy Lette provides a fun romp that proves opposites attract (even when the participants are both intelligent).Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"\\"Eagle forgotten.\\"","review":"The title of Harry Barnard's biography of John Peter Altgeld was inspired by Vachel Lindsay's poem &quot;The Eagle That is Forgotten,&quot; which commemorated the life of Altgeld--the former governor of Illinois. In this spirit, Barnard presented a highly sympathetic account of the governor's life and contribution to American politics, and at times exaggerating his accomplishments.Sometimes mistakenly branded as &quot;one of those German revolutionists of 1848,&quot; Altgeld was born in southern Germany December 30, 1847. His family arrived in a farming community of Richmond County, Ohio when he was three months. After serving as a substitute in the Civil War at the age of sixteen, Altgeld was filled with new aspirations and ambitions that prompted him to travel west where he soon would enjoy a rapid rise in American politics.Algeld was the governor of Illinois during a very important period in its history. He is best known for pardoning the three surviving Haymarket defendants and quashing some of the labor unrest of the 1890s. Barnard described Altgeld as a &quot;law and order&quot; governor during the Pullman strike. Altgeld encouraged labor to strengthen itself through organization, however, he would not tolerate any threat of violence on the part of labor agitators. Altgeld also palyed a pivitol role in the 1896 Democratic convention. Barnard maintained that every plank in the 1896 Dmocratic platform was revolutionary and entirely the achievement of the Illinois governor.Barnard presented a clearly-written account of John Peter Altgeld's political career. He effectively placed Altgeld within the context of the general issues facing the nation. These issues included the Granger movement, economic depressions, the labor question, and the debate over currency.In considering Altgeld's role within the general history of the United States in the 1890s, one can find many problems with Barnard's analysis. Barnard credited Altgeld for the demise of President Cleveland, however, the 1893 depression and Cleveland's role in the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act were, most likely, more instrumental in the decline of Cleveland's influence in the party then were his ongoing tiffs with Altgeld. Cleveland's defense of the gold standard alienated him from the southern core of the Democratic party. Moreover, Barnard admitted that Altgeld cared little for the currency question until 1894. Altgeld may have dominated the 1896 platform; however, he was unable to prevent the nomination of William Jennings Bryan (Altgeld supported Richard Park of Missouri). In addition, the role of the Illinois governor may have been elevated because the convention was held in Chicago.Barnard presented convincing arguments to refute a number of traditionally held views regarding Altgeld. Chief among these views was the belief that the Haymarket pardons ruined Altgeld's political career. Barnard clearly demonstrated that Altgeld remained very strong in the Democratic party during the 1896 convention. He cites poor health, a desire to leave politics, and the hard work spent on Bryan's presidential campaign at the expense of the gubernatorial race for Altgeld's failure to gain re-election. The fact that Altgeld died only eight years after the pardons may make it difficult to access the actual effect the pardons had on his career.The biography is, for the most part, well-written with an excellent use of primary sources; however, it is often overburdened by long quotations which interupt the flow of the reading. An exchange of these long quotes for more information on Altgeld's day-to-day gubernatorial record would make this work more complete. Still, it is an essential source of information on an important figure in American Progressivism."},{"Title":"\\"Eagle forgotten.\\"","review":"The life of John Altgeld was, as the cover of my copy of this book says, \\"turbulent\\". Harry Barnard does wonderful job in this book of portraying Altgeld as a hero of the working class. In my work on my undergraduate thesis this book has been extremely helpful. I am attempting to define Altgeld in my thesis and this book provided much evidence for Altgeld being a progressive leader in an era that was filled with corruption. This book was written in 1938 which is both a blessing and a curse. It is awesome because it was written by a man who lived in the same time period as Altgeld, but it also makes it a little harder to read and fairly dry. The biggest qualm that I have with this book is that it only paints Altgeld as a hero and touches very little on some of the more sinister things that he did. Overall, the book is a very good read and provides a very detailed telling of the life of a controversial figure. It is written by a man of authority in the area of Illinois history and would be a very helpful addition to anyone studying Altgeld or even the Gilded age in general."},{"Title":"Arnold's Bodyshaping for Women","review":"I came across this book at a used book store and love it.

(...). If you wish to write a bad biography, the guide:* Base your work on the officially published and easily reached autobiographies by the subject. Besides a few obvious interviews and a couple of web sites, look no further. Make no attempt to uncover the things the writer of the autobiography tried to hide.* Don't bother with even the most rudimentary of fact checking, so that your work will contain many egregious mistakes. My personal favorites: according to Karen Judson, Asimov made more money writing non fiction than fiction (p. 53), and 'Golden Age' SF was character driven (p.50). Both of these claims are not just false: they're absurd. Asimov wrote more non fiction then fiction because he enjoyed it more, even though he made much less money writing it. The main feature of Golden Age SF was a focus on scientific literacy. SF before the golden age was relatively scientifically inaccurate, and the Golden Age contained many working scientists who wrote more vigorously about science.* Do not look into any of the dark corners of your subject's past. Although Isaac Asimov lived a comfortable bourgeois existence, there are several controversies worth looking into: his conflicts with his superiors in Boston University, his infidelities, his atheism, and the way he treated his eldest son, David. In his writing career, later Asimov seemed to have sold his soul to the industry, allowing his name to be put on dozens of titles on which he did practically zero work (Stuff like: Isaac Asimov presents Superquizs) We now know that Asimov died of AIDS he received from a blood transfer in the early 1980s - all of these deserve discussion, but are hardly even mentioned.* Spend inordinary amount of time on issues of no importance. The author spends the better part of two pages discussion Isaac's World - a largely forgotten shared world anthology in the late 80s, now defunct and forgotten. She spends no less then three pages making dull summaries of books by other authors, who have very little in common besides being influential books on the developing SF scene in the 1930s. It seems like no thought was given as to what is essential and what is peripheral in Asimov's life.Despite being a homebody who lived very ordinary life, Asimov was a fascinating character, brilliant, witty, arrogant and eccentric. As a writer, Asimov revolutionized Science Fiction, and his work has influenced thousands around the world. As a Jewish Liberal and the son of an &eacute;migr&eacute;, Asimov is a representative of a class that had a disproportionate influence on American Life in the 20th century. But you won't know it from reading this book.If you're interested in Isaac Asimov, I recommend reading his memoir, I, Asimov. It is deeper, more reflective, better written, and much, much more interesting."},{"Title":"Isaac Asimov: Master of Science Fiction (People to Know)","review":"Pretty much geared for younger teens.

Addressing the reader in personable Victorian fashion, his prose is clear and beautiful. Consider this sample:&quot;Within the verge of the wood there were columbines, looking more pale than red, because they were so modest, and had thought proper to seclude themselves too anxiously from the sun. There were wild geraniums, too, and a thousand white blossoms of the strawberry. The trailing arbutus was not yet quite out of bloom; but it hid its precious flowers under the last year's withered forest-leaves, as carefully as a mother-bird hides its little young ones.&quot;But Hawthorne is also equal to the task of less genteel, more vigorous images:&quot;At this sound the three heads reared themselves erect, and belched out great flashes of flame. Before Bellerophon had time to consider what to do next, the monster flung itself out of the cavern and sprung straight toward him, with its immense claws extended, and its snaky tail twisting itself venomously behind.&quot;Adding to the pleasure of these retold tales is the gorgeous art of Arthur Rackham, both in black-and-white drawings and full-color plates, which captures the unearthly beauty and the unexpectedly surprising humor of Hawthorne's work. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A wonder book for girls and boys","review":"Once upon a time (I was about 8), a family friend handed down his Collier's Junior Classic series to me - each volume is a glorious hodgepodge of short stories from here, there, and everywhere. I got to be very fond of Greek mythology, especially \\"The Chimaera\\" and \\"The Miraculous Pitcher\\", since the Collier retellings of their respective legends were much more lively than the ordinary.Alas, I forgot the name of the author of \\"The Chimaera\\", and even that my favourite versions of the myths were all written by the same person. Some talented guy writing for the series, no doubt, I would have said, if I'd thought about it. A couple of years ago, I started browsing through an impressive-looking illustrated volume of mythology in a bookstore (which you now see before you). Whoa. \\"Scarlet Letter\\" Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote *THESE*?His retellings of Greek myths were originally spread over 2 volumes (the other being _Tanglewood Tales_), but they can be obtained in a single volume these days. I can personally do without the gang of Tanglewood kids providing the official audience for the stories-within-a-story, or the defense against critics put into the mouth of the storyteller Eustace Bright, but then I want more space for more myths. :) Each myth in _A Wonder Book_ has an Introductory and After the Story section where the storyteller leads up to the tale, then fends off any awkward questions from his young audience.\\"The Gorgon's Head\\" - The story of Perseus, from his infancy through the quest for Medusa's head. Hawthorne skates delicately past the question of who put Perseus and his mother, Danae, in a chest and abandoned them on the sea, let alone why (toned down for kids, and all that), and of course doesn't go into detail about what mischief Polydectes might intend if Perseus can be got out of the way.Hawthorne is otherwise thorough about details: he even includes the Three Gray Women, who share the use of a single eye, who had to be persuaded to reveal the location of the monsters whose gaze turns living creatures to stone.\\"The Golden Touch\\" - The Midas legend, of how a king, blinded by a love of gold, foolishly asked Apollo that he be given the gift of turning things into gold with a touch. Be careful what you ask for...\\"The Paradise of Children\\" - The story of Pandora's box. Hawthorne's version, much as I like his other mythological tales, has been prettified a little too much: everyone in the world was a child who never grew up, before the box arrived.\\"The Three Golden Apples\\" - The 11th labour of Hercules, wherein the king sent him to fetch the apples of the Hesperides. The tale begins with Hercules meeting a band of nymphs, who hear his account (only briefly summarized, alas) of his preceding labours before directing him to the one person who can direct him to the garden: the Old Man of the Sea...\\"The Miraculous Pitcher\\" - Philemon and his wife Bauchis have grown old together - the only kindly folk living for a good way around a prosperous village, whose inhabitants delight in tormenting vagabonds (although they'll fawn on wealthy-looking strangers). Then one day a ragged youth called Quicksilver and a taciturn man with an appearance of great wisdom are driven out of the village...\\"The Chimaera\\" - Bellerophon's pursuit of Pegasus, whom he seeks because only in the air does he have a chance of killing the monstrous chimaera. Bellerophon's long wait beside the fountain of Pirene, where Pegasus descends to drink, is enlivened by several characters living round about: an old man who can't even remember his glory days, an overly timid maiden who'd run from anything unusual, a yokel who only appreciates plowhorses, and a little boy (the only one who really believes in Pegasus)."},{"Title":"A wonder book for girls and boys","review":"In the spring of 1851 Hawthorne wrote to his publisher, James Fields (of the renowned Ticknor and Fields), proposing a children's book retelling six well-known stories from Greek mythology. He planned to adopt \\"a tone in some degree Gothic or romantic.\\" In addition, he wanted to make the fables suitable for young Christian children: \\"of course, I shall purge all the old heathen wickedness, and put in a moral wherever practicable.\\"I am usually not a fan of sanitized tales--even when written by someone the status of Nathaniel Hawthorne. But, in spite of their overt preachiness and their occasional preciousness, there's something charming and original about these adaptations. Even adults might enjoy these six tales: Perseus's slaughter of Medusa, Midas and his golden touch, Pandora's box (stripped of Prometheus's role), the apples of the Hesperides (or Hercules's Eleventh Labor), Baucis and Philemon and the magic pitcher (which, in my opinion, is the best of the lot), and Bellerophon and Pegasus's battle with the monster Chimaera.Threading these stories together is Eustace Bright, Hawthorne's college-age narrator, who relates his versions to a gaggle of local children (a couple of whom taunt him for his bumptiousness). Hawthorne uses this framing device to insert himself as his own critic. Overhearing one of the stories, the father of one of the children is not amused, finding Eustace's taste \\"altogether Gothic\\" and advising him \\"never more to meddle with a classical myth.\\" To this critique, Eustace petulantly responds that \\"an old Greek had no more right to them, than a modern Yankee has,\\" and he accuses classical writers of forming these tales \\"into shapes of indestructible beauty, indeed, but cold and heartless.\\" If anything, Hawthorne has certainly brought warmth to these old stories.Still, the reading level might be a tall order for many children under 8 (although an adult can adapt them for reading out loud). Hawthorne sprinkles his prose with salutatory references to his real-life neighbors in the Berkshires (there's even a line about Melville writing \\"Moby Dick\\") and with puns and quips that have lost their context. And he gets carried away with his descriptions of the countryside. Hawthorne's evocative passages will surely strike modern readers as hopelessly old-fashioned, although the author realized that he was trying the patience of children even from his own day. After three florid and nearly insufferable paragraphs describing a meadow, for example, Hawthorne apologetically interrupts himself that \\"we must not waste our valuable pages with any more talk about the spring-time and the wild flowers. There is something, we hope, more interesting to be talked about.\\"What's more interesting, of course, are the stories of Greek gods and monsters and flying horses. Fortunately for readers young and old, Hawthorne mostly stays away from the scenery and sticks to the legends."},{"Title":"A wonder book for girls and boys","review":"One day last week, I could not, even after hours of deliberation (the snow had made engagements scarce), decide what book to read next. I finally came upon this little volume on the end of my parent's bookshelf and decided to give it try. How could I have known what charms were in store? I felt like a little girl again, and as Eustace Bright, the ambitious college student who narrates these tales, held his little auditors in awe, my eyes, too, were wide with wonder. It truly is a &quot;wonder book,&quot; full of high fantasy, thrilling action, and the inimitable imagery of a master. Though geared towards &quot;boys and girls,&quot; Hawthorne explains in his introduction that &quot;children possess an unestimated sensibility to whatever is deep or high, in imagination or feeling, so long as it is simple . . . It is only the artificial and complex that bewilder them.&quot; Indeed; the book hardly condescends, and so will gently stretch the middle-grader's vocabulary. But readers -- or listeners -- of all ages will delight in this collection of tales, for I was equally, if not more, entertained by the introductories and postludes to each story, which relate the antics and dialogue of Eustace and the little children he entertains. These interludes also expand the stories by slipping in commentary and interpretation.Don't pass this one by; it will truly win your heart, whoever you may be!"},{"Title":"A wonder book for girls and boys","review":"I ordered this book as part of a third grade curriculum for my son. These Everyman titles are really wonderful-- beautiful binding, heavy pages, amazing illustrations. I was not disappointed with this book. It is the kind of book we will read again and again and hopefully pass on to the next generation. Hawthorne's rendition of the myths and fables is classic and engaging, and Rackham's illustrations are worth the price on their own."},{"Title":"A wonder book for girls and boys","review":"If you've read Hawthorne's longer works, you might be surprised by the storytelling fun and energy he puts into this shorter book aimed at boys and girls of all ages, 8 to 80, who love a good yarn. Imagine yourself on a whispery, wintery day, sledding on the hillsides with friends. Or imagine yourself gathered with the kids on the front porch on a golden, summery afternoon. Now add to these settings Hawthorne's inventive narrator, Eustace Bright, who gathers the children round on that hillside or porch and gives them the classic myths with his own unique spins.If you think you know the stories of King Midas and his golden touch, of Hercules' exploits, of Medusa, you have here the chance to rediscover them in child-friendly, yet fully adventurous form, through the skills of Mr. Nathaniel Hawthorne. He gives the old tales a lot of charm, makes them palatable for younger kids, and weaves in lessons of ethics and morality and courage. I have always appreciated Hawthorne's more thought-provoking writings, but here I find another side to the man and the writer that is magical and light. To add to the wonder, I not only have the paperback version but also read this in an e-book format, enjoying the beautiful drawings of Arthur Rackham.I've long been a fan of Hawthorne's short stories. While he plays out some amazing themes and characters in \\"A Scarlet Letter,\\" \\"House of the Seven Gables,\\" and even \\"The Blithedale Romance,\\" he excels in his shorter tales, where the prose has less room to run off track and the themes are better addressed. He seems serious in most of his writing, with only hints of his humor and playfulness, but in \\"A Wonder Book for Boys and Girls,\\" we find a side of Hawthorne that's hard not to adore."},{"Title":"A wonder book for girls and boys","review":"As good as this book may be, the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it.

It's well organized with country introductions which told me almost everything I wanted to know. Michael's sidebars are intriguing and I especially appreciate the city walking tours which have led me to many hidden little places I might have missed otherwise. The maps are better than those in the other guidebooks because sites are labeled right on the maps themselves rather than coded in a key which is impossible to read in dim lighting (a fault with the Lonely Planet series). Michael has provided not only the usual city and country maps, but also detailed inner city maps and even maps of the individual temples around Angkor Wat. This book covers three countries and sure beats having to buy and lug around individual guides to Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. I've found that the coverage better than adequate and certainly head and shoulders above the general Southeast Asia guides which are surprisingly sketchy about these countries. Indochina is changing so fast that much of the practical information in any guide is bound to be out of date before the book reaches the shelves and this 1998 edition does require updating, but so do all the other guides to the region. You usually end up getting that kind of information from other travelers anyway. Of the three countries included, the coverage of Cambodia is the weakest, obviously because that country is only now opening to independent travel. Next edition Michael needs to get to places like Kampong Cham, etc. Meanwhile I recommend this handbook highly over all its competitors."},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks: Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, Third Edition","review":"Adequate rather than good, this is no Lonely Planet guide.

Aside from Tom Brosnahan's Turkey guidebook for Lonely Planet, I think it is perhaps the best written one out right now. And I find his particular humor makes light of what can be trying circumstances and boring details.By the way, the current edition has been updated with a lot of information from as recent as 1997 (about as recent as you can get in any guidebook of the area published in 1998 I am afraid)."},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks: Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, Third Edition","review":"I used this guide for travel throughout Cambodia and in Saigon in the summer of 1999.

Moon travel beats the major competitor (the main travel-trail eye-sore creator) in almost all respects, but not all.Moreso than other travel guides, the Moon travel guide for Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia has tons and tons of recent political, social and economic history in addition to significant cultural notes that a visitor *must* be aware of. (i.e., what does a South East Asian smile mean?) The maps of the cities and provinces are excellent. the all-important overland border-crossings between 'Nam, Laos, and Cambo are cleary marked. This is one of the many reasons that Moon can't be beaten at the moment. This guide's overland itineraries are the best. Example: you want to go into China overland fron northern Vietnam. How can you get up to Kunnming, China? It tells ya. And, we learn, that the one way flight into Bangkok from Kunming is the same price as the one that flys from Hanoi. (This price equality of course must be verified).The information regarding the pricing and existence of certain establishments that cater to travelers is outdated. However, where to eat or sleep has never been an important part of a book anyhow, just the general information about the area in general and how to get there is all a visitor needs. Does someone need to read a guidebook to decide specifically where to eat? Where to specifically sleep? If it does for you, do everyone a favor: stay home.The underlying story that provides the \\"general-informational\\" foundation is enough. When we come through town, understandably we don't know much, but that is far better than knowing absolutely nothing at all, which is quite common now from my conversations with tourists, and especially now among \\"backpackers.\\" The purpose of why backpacking started has been lost for most.By the way, it is a fact that the communist government censors this guidebook.

Based on the multitude of inaccuracies in this book, I would not recommend it. I bought the book because I wanted to try Moon Handbooks.

In addition, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos are changing rapidly and thus frusterate any travel writer's ability to fully and accurately cover the countries.Having said that, this book's inaccuries and inadeqauate coverage clearly are below the expected standards of travel handbooks. At each location, I was continually frustered by the book's amateurish maps, poor recommendations, and shallow coverage. Worse was the author's discussion of the US involvement in Indonesia. In one area of the book, he states that the US bombing of Cambodia killed 50,000 and in another area the US bombing caused 100,000 deaths. Well, which is it? Kind of a big deal to get that right.One exception was the coverage of Anghor/Siem Reap. I felt the maps and the discussion were strong enough that I did not need a guide while going through the ruins.Overall, this book needs a complete revamping.

What we may read of Christmas in ancient days finds its full flower in the past and present customs of our ancestral homes in Europe. There is not an American home that does not color its Christmas with some European observances---gift-giving, trees, greenery, food, games, or ritual.\\" (Pg. 10)He notes, \\"It was a much changed St. Nicholas which the Dutch settlers brought to the United States... The lean ascetic is now a fat, jolly old fellow, more humanist than saint. Laying aside his canonical robes, his miter, and his pastoral staff, he has chosen an ermine-trimmed red cap and suit.

Ike and Mem enjoy the fun stuff, but the grandkids-especially Ike-aren't very happy about the difficult farm chores. It's a fairly prosaic story but younger readers will identify with complaints and rewards around work, and may enjoy the subplot about the mysterious sounds emanating from the cornfield.The dialogue and description convey personality and setting, but the author overplays his hand. The grandparent characters border on stereotypes: the mischievous, joke-telling (bad jokes, of course) grandfather, and the nurturing (especially with food), but stern and sometimes very gruff grandmother. The two constantly insert the word \\"best\\" in their demands (e.g., \\"Best get on out to the cornfield.\\") and forever talking in \\"rural\\" clich&eacute;s. Apparently, farm folks always speak the same. This provides some humor, as Ike begins to copy the best phrase. (The cynical among us would believe that his word choice is sarcastic.) Some other spots of humor will promote interest. I don't think that the suggested age range of 9-13 is right; this book is perhaps more suited to a younger age range.The black and white drawings are adequate but largely unimaginative, and the period farmhouse looks like a modern condo in the mountains. Early readers will enjoy the word repetition, the feeling of reading a grown-up book (55 pages, with un-numbered chapter breaks), the conflict over tasks, and the mystery in the cornfield. However, the dialogue feels contrived, and the surprise ending is fairly predictable (although there is a very clever twist that may require re-reading to make sure the author didn't trick you. This is the fifth \\"Ike and Mem\\" book."},{"Title":"Practical Business Math: An Applications Approach","review":"I was afraid to order this but the book was great.

The story's hero remembers with gentleness and humor the incidences of his boyhood and early life, including his war experiences and long marriage, that guided and shaped him into manhood. He struggles to understand how it can be that others -- some more deserving, others less -- managed to become 'members' of that elusive club: those who find meaning in their lives and a sense of connectedness to their families. Brilliantly written with insight, nostalgia and a self-deprecating humor, VOICES OF A SUMMER DAY illuminates not just the events, hopes and reactions of a single man, but of an entire generation."},{"Title":"Voices of a Summer Day","review":"Since Amazon hasn't posted an editorial review, here's the description from the cover to help you decide if this book is for you: &quot;Four decades of American life are re-created through the dramatic reminiscences of Benjamin Federov, a typical yet very special man, son of Immigrant Jewish parents, a husband, a father, an admirer of women, a one-time soldier ... and finally, and always, his own man. Federov's story is relived while watching his teen-age son play baseball in the sunshine of a summer day. It tells of the intrigue and exultation of his first love affair, his war experiences, the volatile warmth of his marriage, and the special meaning of his infidelities. Through it all is his quest for a point of balance as he stands on the edge of conventional society, desirous of entering, refusing always to do so.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Reader of Handwritten Japanese","review":"What a shame to find out that this book is out of print! I picked it up at a used bookstore near my home a year ago, and it rapidly became an indispensable resource. This book is a collection of actual handwritten Japanese letters sent to Prof. O'Neill and his careful, detailed translations of them. Anyone who has learned enough Japanese to write a letter in the language knows that the structure of a formal English letter is quite different from that of a Japanese one. This text, with a collection of formal and informal letters on a variety of subjects, is unparalleled as a guide to letter-writing in Japanese, and is also valuable as an intermediate- to advanced-level supplementary textbook. I would also recommend _A Reader of Handwritten Japanese_ to students of any level interested in improving their handwritten Japanese, as Prof. O'Neill has recieved some letters written in beautiful hand. If you find a copy of this book, by all means buy it!"},{"Title":"A Reader of Handwritten Japanese","review":"O'Neill'sA Reader of Handwritten Japaneseis a beautiful book that would benefit intermediate and advanced learners of Japanese.CONTENT--------------------A brief, well-written introduction to Japanese letters and the book.-25 introductory texts.

More correspondence with transcriptions and notes, but NO translations.-20 higher level texts. More correspondence with transcriptions and notes, but NO translations.-20 advanced texts.

One-hundred different models of writing gathered together in one place with transcriptions. Working through the book definitely improves your ability to recognize characters and patterns. I am struggling with sixteenth-century texts at the moment, and I have revisited this text to help deepen my familiarity with handwriting.+ The translations are very excellent, there is a thorough glossary at the back, and he provides occasional notes as well. This is all invaluable to language learners who want to be able to correspond with others in Japanese.CONS-------------------- The book is outdated. Let's face it. Most of our correspondence these days is done by email, so there is less and less of a need to read and write like this. Instead of just correspondence, maybe a new edition could be published with a wider range of handwritten Japanese that we are likely to encounter.- How are we supposed to use the book? I would like more discussion of the patterns found in each letter, alternatives, and so forth.- I would like translations for all of the texts. This is tough stuff, even for advanced learners.

It may not be republished, and I doubt it will be revised, so it is a rare commodity."},{"Title":"A Reader of Handwritten Japanese","review":"I have used this book, it looks like copies of some correspondence between O'Neill and some of his business associates and friends--primarily having to do with his research trips to Japan. I compiled a list of the more useful openings and closings to letters, with appropriate seasonal greetings, but I believe many of these may be available as canned openings in MS Word. They are no doubt also available on the internet.Aside from these timeless items, this book is dated. The handwriting is also very neat, not like the chicken scratches I often have to translate from barely legible faxes or the notes someone has scribbled on a greasy, cafeteria napkin.

But it provides a mirror that let's you inside the mind of one of the classic leaders of THE MOVEMENT.Entitled to his opinions, his self absorbion on the experience of leadership itself, may lead others to think this work in itself lends much insight into Harris motives or Method - but it surely provides a big clue on what it meant to a 'baby boomer' to be elevated to national prominance.

That reflects the pace of the explosion of brain research studies. The outdated Triune Brain Theory is no longer mentioned. We have: new insights on the dynamic interplay of both nature and nurture; stages of learning that responds to the crucial question of &quot;When has a student learned something?&quot;... For the serious student of neuroscience applied to learning, this is one of the best books. It contains so much interesting, useful and up-to-date information. Just look through the detailed Table of Contents. Rewards, motivation, creativity, meaning-making, discipline... are all seen in a new perspective. It gives a biological basis to respecting individual differences and learning styles. This new edition, with additional drawings, illustrations, outlines, tips and boxes of key ideas, makes the book attractive and easier to read. The author is gifted in integrating a lot of research studies and making them relevant and palatable. He has done a great service to all educators and learners.

The print was readable and the illustrations were helpful. I did also find some grammatical errors as an earlier review said. But mostly it was very specific and practical. The chapters most helpful were on &quot;emotional states&quot; and music. It's hard to find a book on this subject that's across the board, dealing with many different issues and this one addresses nearly every brain-related research issue from nutrition to memory. As a scientist who also works with high school students, I found his translation of brain research into the classroom to be thoughtful, if not enthusiastic. It's a tough subject to translate, but I did get more than I thought I would out of the book. Mostly it helped me get past the hype and get into the real practical meat of the material.

Some of the concepts presented are interesting, but since Mr. Jensen (no, he doesn't hold a doctorate) provides almost no citations for his claims, there is no way to check his assertions or determine where the theories come from. The book reads like a multilevel marketing sales pitch.

So far, though, it is interesting but seems fuzzy. The writer makes a lot of claims but I was rarely sure if they were proven or just speculation. This is the kind of sentence that makes me queasy:\\"Given all the activations happening at once [in the brain], physical performance probably uses 100 precent of the brain\\" (p. 39).Probably? Why?

The first subtle error is on page 11, chapter 2, when Jenson offers a bar graph comparing relative amounts of brain cells in humans, monkeys, mice and fruit flies. Of course smaller animals have fewer brain cells than bigger animals, they have smaller numbers of ALL kinds of cells because they are so small. Why would you compare the number of brain cells in a fruit fly with a human?! At least a hundred fruit fly BODIES could fit in a human brain! Why not show a bar graph comparing the percentage of brain cells for each organism?! I confess I quit reading the book fairly early in, especially when I noticed the same set of inane &quot;reflection questions&quot; (like, &quot;What from this chapter was new to you?&quot;) had been reprinted, word-for-word, at the end of each and every chapter."},{"Title":"Brain-Based Learning: The New Science of Teaching and Training, Revised Edition","review":"I am currently reading the Kindle version of this book.

Here's just one of the innumerable examples, which contains an error in punctuation and grammar: \\"The brain sits in a state of stress; and the learner's self-esteem, confidence, and peer acceptance is at stake,\\" (p. 300). What is more astounding about the horrible state of the text is that this is the \\"revised\\" edition of the text, which makes one wonder what the first edition was like. All the errors--which, by the way, a high school freshman should know how to correct--make me wonder about the integrity of Jensen's knowledge of the science of the brain--how careful a scholar is he likely to be, when he shows so little familiarity with standards in scholarship? On page 186, for example, he claims that if you look up and to the left, you will have superior access to stored pictures in your brain, while if you look downward and to the right, you're experiencing feelings. Up and to the right is where your eyes go to create new images, he claims. Yeah, right. In another book of his, he claims that students are taking Nimidopine as a memory drug, a statement that has to be absolutely false.

As the years went by I realized how unrealistic such a task was, I can't judge cinematography and what not, and more than half the films aren't on video. So I cut down to a number of categories. Frankly as time goes by I realize how political the whole Oscar game and don't consider the phrase \\"Oscar nominated\\" to mean the film can be any good. But I still look forward to it every year.The author takes care of the wrongness of the Oscars by adding an eligible film that should have been nominated category after every year. His tastes are broad too and not snooty as he puts Mommie Dearest even as a candidate.

Now, fifteen years later, I own the latest edition of Inside Oscar. It is a constant source of amusement and information. The writing is skillful and clever, and the categorical listing at the back is an invaluable reference. Every year during Oscar season, I will pick up an article by some journalist whose grasp of Oscar history is minimal, and I wonder why they don't just look up who REALLY won in Inside Oscar. I know Mr. Wiley is no longer with us, but I hope Mr. Bona and company continue the great work for future editions. I know I'd love to be a contributor to this tremendous work."},{"Title":"Inside Oscar: the Unofficial History of the Academy Awards","review":"If you enjoy the hype of the Academy Awards, this is the book for you. Plenty of behind-the-scenes action that you're not going to find by simply watching the Academy Awards. It's gossipy, dishy, and dirty...a definite guilty pleasure. Great index of past Academy Award winners and nominees as well."},{"Title":"Inside Oscar: the Unofficial History of the Academy Awards","review":"Wiley and Bona have created the premier reference work on the Oscars - the complete list of nominees and victors, taking up the book's final 200 pages, is reason enough to buy it. It's the liveliest reference work you'll ever read: Each annual essay contains bite-size recollections of the impact (or lack of same) of movies big and small, at the box office and in the press, full of dishy reviews and catty responses. Each essay year has info that the most dedicated movie buff won't remember or never knew, particularly the fascinating narrations of Tinseltown Oscar campaigns. The level of detail is astonishing, down to which '90s ceremony participants did and didn't wear AIDS ribbons. Lovingly detailed descriptions of ceremony attire, highlights of speeches and host schtick - good and (much more often) bad, and follow-ups to big wins, failed campaigns and Oscar night emabarrassments never fail to fascinate. The book is more than 1,000 pages long, and once it's over, you'll be begging for more. Guys, write about 1995-99! If you have the first edition (which runs through 1987), buy the latest edition (which runs through 1994). The new essays are even more exhaustive, since the source material is contemporary, and, presumably, contains the authors' firsthand reporting. Only one quibble: In a book stuffed with deliciously nasty commentary from film reviewers, Wiley and Bona beg off from relating John Simon's &quot;too cruel&quot; criticisms of Sofia Coppola in The Godfather, Part III. Mason, Damien: You don't pull a punch anywhere else in your masterpiece. WHAT DID HE SAY?"},{"Title":"Inside Oscar: the Unofficial History of the Academy Awards","review":"For everyone who gets 'movie madness' every March by eagerly anticipating Oscar night, this is a must-own book. It is the bible of Oscar knowledge and includes every nomination and winner from 1927 until the mid-90's. It is by far the greatest Academy Award reference tool that is available and just by paging through the nominee list in the back for a few minutes, your video rental list will grow by the foot.The first portion gives the reader a quick history lesson including how the illustrious Academy began and how the golden statue got his trademark name. Following that, every year gets its own chapter in which the authors tell of the studio campaigns to get their films nominated, what the critics and gossip writers were reporting at the time, and who got a nominee and who got screwed. The chapter ends with an &quot;Oscar Night,&quot; section, which goes down to the most minute detail of each Awards ceremony from the lame jokes the host tried to crack (&quot;U-ma, O-prah!&quot;),to the most flubbed speeches, embarrassing dance performances (Rob Lowe and Snow White?!), timeless quotes (&quot;You like me, you really like me!&quot;) and hideous dresses. It also gives the list of presenters and the highlights of the post-Awards parties.The back though, with the nominee history, is easily my favorite and one can spent countless hours paging through and remembering the classic films of years past or debating with friends about who got robbed in the best supporting category in 1962. I like to use the back as a checklist of what I've seen and need to see next.My paperback edition is thoroughly warped and I hope the authors put out a new edition or else mine is going to fall apart soon. A warning though, the book does get rather depressing in April because that means there's 11 more months until next year's big show!"},{"Title":"Inside Oscar: the Unofficial History of the Academy Awards","review":"Baseball has the World Series. Football has the Super Bowl. Movie freaks have the Oscars. We sneer at them, challenge them, and forget who won a week later. But we watch, not only to bask in the reflected glory of the annointed ones, but also for the rare opportunity to see them disappointed, as four out of five nominees are, year after year.Now, in this age of media saturation, we know the Oscars are more than a one night affair. The Academy Awards are a contest as competitive, and sometimes just as dirty, as the race for the White House. Mason Wiley and Damien Bona's \\"Inside Oscar\\" is the \\"Gone With the Wind\\" of Oscar books, the only one that fully details the tasteless and sometimes cutthroat tactics that have been employed to impress Oscar, Hollywood's most enduring superstar.This mammoth volume covers the show-biz ritual from the very beginning at a small ceremony that attracted little notice (\\"Wings\\" was named best picture) through the era when Oscar emerged as a superstar of the small screen in the 50s, right through to the crowning of \\"Forrest Gump\\" as best picture of 1994.There's the inside dope on such controversies as George C. Scott's refusal to accept his Oscar for \\"Patton\\" (shamelessly calling the ritual a \\"meat parade\\"), and Sacheen Littlefeather's speech on behalf of Marlon Brando who turned down his Oscar for \\"The Godfather.\\" Wiley and Bona are lively writers who never pass up an opportunity for an amusingly scathing observation. Their behind-the-scenes exploration of what really goes on in the battle for Oscar glory is more entertaining than many of the films honored.For Oscar junkies, this book provides the most thorough coverage available. Wiley and Bona follow each potential contender through the entire awards season, starting with the prestigious awards from the National Board of Review, to the New York Film Critics Circle, and on to the Golden Globes, right through to Oscar night and its aftermath. There's also the complete list of winners and nominees for each category, a full list of the presenters, and a step-by-step coverage of the Oscar ceremony, complete with the most memorable moments."},{"Title":"Inside Oscar: the Unofficial History of the Academy Awards","review":"For those with a love for both film and trivia, this book is indispensable. Its the definative examination of the annual mixture of the heartwarming and the gauche known as the Academy Awards. Going year-by-year, Wiley and Bona carefully detail what ruled the box office and amazed the critics as well as giving all the gossipy details on the mostly forgotten men and women who were temporarily declared to be Hollywood's &quot;next great star.&quot; Each years ends with a description of that year's academy awards ceremony. Though this might not sound extremely exciting, Bona and Wiley are not shy about injecting their editorial opinions as far as the ceremonies are concerned and several of their sarcastic descriptions of various misbegotten dance numbers and confused presenters, while bordering on being rather snide, are also laugh out loud funny. No matter how savvy and cynical you may consider yourself to be, after reading their behind-the-scenes take on the Oscars, you'll never be able to look at Hollywood the same way as before.As well, Wiley and Bona have compiled perhaps the most accurate and complete listing of Oscar nominees and winners in existence. They even include lists, for each year, of notable films and songs that were passed over. These lists are probably my favorite part of the book, though I do wish they'd include some explanations of why they selected certain films as overlooked. (As just one example, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls placement as an overlooked 1970 best picture possibility, has always perplexed me.)No matter how much you may think you know about film and celebrity trivia, this book will have something to surprise you. This is a book I've never tired of reading because I know with each look, I'll discover something both new and hilarious.In short, this is my desert island book."},{"Title":"Inside Oscar: the Unofficial History of the Academy Awards","review":"I'm a HUGE Oscar fan, and this is the greatest Oscar book I've ever seen. But it just doesn't get updated and reprinted often enough. The last printing looks like it was in 1998 - that means it will be missing any information about the past couple of years. If they're still involved in the book, I'd guess that the authors will have to release a new edition sometime soon, so wait for that. If they updated the book every year, every year I'd buy a new one and throw out the old one."},{"Title":"Inside Oscar: the Unofficial History of the Academy Awards","review":"A great resource for the film critic or movie fan, or even the film novice who wants to expand his or her knowledge about the history of the medium. The book takes the reader on a tour of Oscar nominated films, year by year, then reveals the films that were nominated and those that were shafted for nominations and documents all the important happenings during awards night. Also handy is the appendix, listing all the nominees and winners, even in the technical categories. An indispensible guide to the most famous award in the world."},{"Title":"Inside Oscar: the Unofficial History of the Academy Awards","review":"It's not really meant to be read from beginning to end, though you certainly can. It's a handy reference that will draw you in. You may begin by looking up the last year Bob Hope hosted, but an hour later you'll realize you're in the Billy Crystal era. Lots of fun -- dishy but accurate. Pick it up, turn to any chapter, and enjoy."},{"Title":"Itten The Elements of Color","review":"Itten's analysis and application of color is thoughtful and scientific. As a practicing art director, I have successfully used the theories and methods explained in &quot;Elements of Color&quot; for over twenty years. I also teach them to my design classes. Whether you use a paintbrush or a mouse, his &quot;seven color contrasts&quot; will prove invaluable."},{"Title":"Itten The Elements of Color","review":"I have been a professor for 15 years. &quot;The Elements of Color&quot; has been required reading for many of my courses. It is not only enriching as a color theory document, but it helps expand the artist or designers possibility of using, arranging and conceiving color."},{"Title":"Itten The Elements of Color","review":"I took an art course to learn about colour and learnt nothing. Then I read this book...It answered all my questions and informed me about areas of colour theory I had never dreampt of. Now I paint with knowledge and confidence."},{"Title":"Itten The Elements of Color","review":"It's been difficult to give a balanced critique. On one hand, \\"Elements of Color\\" has a wealth of information, but on the other, it takes serious committment to fully understand and comprehensively apply the information Itten presents. There is much valuable data, but it's interspersed with almost stereotypic, outmoded \\"Teutonic\\" concepts; e.g. assigning \\"Blond Types\\" springtime, bright, vivid colored topics, while \\"Dark Types\\" should be assigned \\"Night, Burial and dark room\\" topics. There is much valuable, technical information, but it is like digging through hard stone to find the gold; overwrought and culturally centered, judgemental statements are very common (\\"red expresses intermediate degrees between the infernal and sublime\\"... what's this?!?!). Other statements seem value-laden, i.e., \\"sentimental blue\\", \\"angelic pink\\", \\"blue reigns supreme\\"... Some excuse may be found in realizing the concepts in this treatise may have been developed before the Post Modernist Age, which accepts cultural and ethnic diversity, that accepts art and the use of color as being open to various interpretations, that color is certainly relative and greatly subjective, that many statements about color are only opinions... and that there is no absolute truth as to what color is \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\". Unless the reader is studious and very serious about trying to unearth the information contained in this book, he or she is much better served by studing Albers or others. Too bad there is no editing, no index, and no glossary. What would Itten think of the book, \\"Chromophobia\\"? ... Pablo Tellez"},{"Title":"Itten The Elements of Color","review":"Itten, himself is one of the greatest color theorist of our century, and the masterful mind behind the Bauhaus School.In this book Itten describes his color theory and the facts of his famous \\"Color Star\\", which is one of the most strongest tools for color harmony for designers and alike.Most color books have samples of color harmonies you choose from when you design, or talk about complementary colors, but cant tell you why u use such combinations or so.If you have an analytical approach to design, rather than just copying what others do, you will love this book. You will begin to understand the language of colors.Have u ever heard of \\"the Seven Color Contrast\\", if not then it is time for you to get familiar about it.This book is an evaluation of Ittens masterpiece \\"Art of Color\\". The chapter on subjective experience of color is very limited in this book.If you are willing to invest more on color matters buy \\"Art of Color\\"If you are happy to stay with the basics then this book is adequate for your purposes."},{"Title":"Itten The Elements of Color","review":"I purchased this book because I wanted to understand colors, color schemes and theory(ies) better in order to apply to my necklace designs. It's a good book to have in your library, but it won't answer all the questions you may have about some applications. Itten's other books however cover pretty much everything; try The Art of Color, for example, if you'd like learn more about color effects on moods/feelings."},{"Title":"Itten The Elements of Color","review":"Although witten for artists who mix colors for an effect, this small book has a wealth of information for fiber artists and quilters. How do translucent colors interact with other colors? Illusions in color? Which colors can be used in conjunction with other shades and tints? It is all here in this book. Many illustration,color plates,and well written text.Very scientific, but easily readable. Good reference book on color."},{"Title":"Itten The Elements of Color","review":"I've seen printed versions of this book and I've been thinking about getting it for a while. Never in my wildest dreams did I think the kindle version would be in black and white. When discussong color and showing diagrams showing the actual colors really helps.

My instructor called this her \\"bible\\" of color theory, but I honestly didn't understand much of it. Way too detailed, written in language that may be appropriate for someone who has a degree in fine art or art education, but certainly not for a beginner."},{"Title":"Itten The Elements of Color","review":"This is a fabulous book, making an intellectually rich subject palatable for the more right-brained of us!Needs to be read in conjuncion with The Art of Colour. I wish I had realised that when I ordered it.However this study provides a reliable and essential foundation for the serious student of colour."},{"Title":"Itten The Elements of Color","review":"as Tellez noted previously, this isn't an easy read. fortunately, the reward is worth the effort. Itten does not dumb down his perspectives for the sake of the reader, rather he puts it all on paper for the devoted color theorist to decipher.that said, it is for the most part approachable and relatively short reading. I re-read this book every couple of years to keep my busy mind fresh and focused when working with this most essential component of my work."},{"Title":"Itten The Elements of Color","review":"The information in this book is interesting, but the color in the color wheels and all color samples are very pale and washed off. Very disappointing.If you need to use the color wheels or scales as references, this book will not be helpful."},{"Title":"Itten The Elements of Color","review":"It is too bad that this is practically the only one of the kind. The aim is great, the contents are great, but the author does not know how to write a technical book. The author refers to concepts and terms that are yet to be defined or never defined at all. For example, at the very beginning, the author talks about \\"violet\\" and \\"purple\\". Am I the only one who did not know \\"violet\\" means a color of a single frequency, whereas \\"purple\\" is a color of combined frequencies? This is a No-No for mathematicians and scientists. For those of who are already familiar with Color Theory, the book must be a great assurance, articulation or enhancement of their existing knowledge, but for those who are new and try to learn as an artist, this is a nightmare. I am the latter kind. The only reason I could finish it was because I am familiar with fundamental physics and optics already."},{"Title":"Itten The Elements of Color","review":"A great reference book that supplements in more detail the color theory class that I am taking.Will be using this for many years."},{"Title":"Itten The Elements of Color","review":"Much less expensive than Albers' book on Color and quite as good.

Every day for 10 straight months we worked on at least one lesson from the book. I checked the book out from my local library and renewed it each month for 11 months.

The book is especially good from the first day you get your puppy up until about a year. He covers questions at the end of each chapter that are typical of new retriever owners: What if pup eats the bird?, what if pup runs away from me with a bumper, etc. Advanced topics like drills for blind retrieves (swimby, casting and lining drills,pattern blinds, etc.) or hunt tests(multiple marks, retired guns, holding blinds, etc) are not covered. The book cautions against using an electric collar. I agree. I've seen too many pups with great potential totally confused by a newbie incorrectly using the ecollar.

While this dog is written for retrievers, I use many of the steps for training my pointers. I think this book would be just as helpful in training even a house dog.

It really should be the foundation of your collection of dog training books."},{"Title":"RETRIEVER TRAINING FOR THE DUCK HUNTER","review":"I bought a Chesapeake Retriever and purchased this book to train her for duck hunting.The book was very well outlined for each day and the corresponding training on that day. Not only did it teach you how to give proper training, but safe guarded you from using improper techniques that could damage your dog. As outlined I spend the 15 minutes every day with the designated training. Soon my dog progressed at a fast rate. Now she is a loyal companion at my side during cold duck hunts VERY excited to retrieve ducks.Negative side about the book are the old pictures which were taken over 15 years ago. The advance training outlines the need for equipment that was either to difficult to build or expensive to buy (dog ropes leading into water, toe lines which cause pain to dog etc...) Also I wanted to finish training with a electric collar (for field use the first couple duck hunting trips) and the book gave no information on how to use one saying basically you are too incompetant or stupid to know how to use one properly so don't try. I did get a electric collar and it fine tuned my dog into a excellent retriever (and I no longer use the collar).

Needs to spell check his work also."},{"Title":"\\"Our Brown-Eyed Boy\\"","review":"This book took me inside what the McAndrews are coping with. I found it extremely moving and, while I do not have any first-hand experience with autism, felt that it illuminates the joys as well as the challenges of living with autism. Although McAndrew needs to find a good editor, the personal &quot;journaling&quot; style of his writing is accessible and heartfelt."},{"Title":"\\"Our Brown-Eyed Boy\\"","review":"I found the book thoughtful and enlightening. It provides a view in to the life of a family with a child at need. The book engenders a feeling of understanding and compassion for children in need. It also made me more appreciative and understanding of my children. I suggest all parents read the this though provoking book."},{"Title":"\\"Our Brown-Eyed Boy\\"","review":"I was deeply moved by Jeff McAndrew's book, \\"Our Brown Eyed Boy\\" on many levels. Since my own son's diagnosis of autism recently, I began the desperate search for material to answer the numerous questions that plague a parent's mind. For me, the quest for knowledge is a healing one usually. What I find most difficult of all, however, is that this quest is often confusing or unfulfilled. That's what makes Jeff's book so unique.\\"Our Brown Eyed Boy\\", while informational and educational, probes the autism issues from an entirely different perspective. Rather than focusing on the issue in a clinical and inhumane fashion, Jeff tackles the issues from a parent's perspective. He makes it clear time and again that feelings, not theories, are the important part of understanding autism. Through my own experience, I can relate to the fact that this is often the case. Many people, in the desire to seek a \\"cure\\" or coping method for autism, attempt to tackle the symptoms rather than addressing the person behind the symptoms. This theme recurs time and again throughout this personal account, and often leads to disillusionment between parents and other family members.The basis for Jeff's approach to discussing autism is honesty. The tone of this book is refreshing because Jeff brings to life that which we are often afraid to say. This models precisely the type of advocate parents must be for their children with special needs. This honesty is particularly poignant when Jeff discusses what effect their son's autism has had not only on their marriage, but on their typical son, not to mention those in the community. In one passage Jeff discusses a trip to Burger King for his sons and his wife at which another woman commented on how his wife handled the outing saying she couldn't control her children. Jeff responds by suggesting that anyone in the community should begin by stepping, even if only for a moment, in the shoes of that parent, and see if that makes a difference in their perception. As I read this portion, I, like many other parents of autistic children I'm sure, wanted to stand up and say Amen to that.Above all, however, Jeff points out that unconditional love for the child and for other members of the family is vital to maintaining a recognizable family life. The strength of this message is not in suggesting love, but in his understanding statements regarding how difficult that unconditional love can be in any family, not to mention those dealing with special needs. This is a powerful message for many parents who are often caught up in the crossfire between love, frustration, and guilt, and it is a message that, as astronaut Deke Slayton once said, needs to be said again and again with fierce conviction."},{"Title":"\\"Our Brown-Eyed Boy\\"","review":"Jeff McAndrew tells the story of living with and loving his son Stephen, who happens to have autism. The straight-forward, open approach to a wide variety of topics should be of great help to other families dealing with this condition. I especially appreciated the addition of comments of others - parents and professionals - who also are concerned about children with disabilities. It's important to remember that interventions which are effective for one child with autism may not be at all helpful to another, and vice versa. Finding interventions that work, as well as a strong support network, can make a critical difference in a family's ability to enjoy and appreciate a special child such as Stephen."},{"Title":"\\"Our Brown-Eyed Boy\\"","review":"As a parent of two children with autism spectrum disorders I am extremely dissappointed with the results of this book. First of all, the author of this book decided to use this book to whine about his life difficulties. We are all stricken with difficult situations/events in our lives. It is what we make of those situations that is important. The family of Stephen deals with it by complaining and \\"writing\\" about thier struggles and disappointments. This book does nothing for parents of children with autism. It offers no strategies or ways of dealing with the diagnosis. Instead we just hear about how they have been treated unfairly or are embarrassed of their son. I for one have been blessed by the people who entered my life due to my children. Furthermore, my children have blessed me in so many ways I can't imagine life without them including the diagnois of autism. So, I say to the McAndrew's get over the \\"poor me\\" attitude and start dealing with what life has dealt you.In addition, this book is edited terribly. It has so many typo's and poorly structured sentences. It is very obvious that this was written by somebody who does not have a strong educational background. People need to take pride in their work and if this man does then he is not nearly as smart as he makes himself out to be."},{"Title":"\\"Our Brown-Eyed Boy\\"","review":"I am learning more about my brother reading \\"Our Brown Eyed Boy.\\"When I read the book, I find out that my parents have a very tough job to do sometimes with my little brother.

If you are a parent trying to deal with the daily struggles of having a child with a disability, do not read this book. It does not offer any advice for parents, just helps fuel negativitiy. Please do not put yourself through reading this book. If you are still in the grieving stage, this book will not help you. As parents, please try surrounding yourself with positives. Children with disabilities can bring such joy to your life. They can help you learn, help you become more empathetic, help you become stronger, and bring wonderful caring people into your life. Please remember those things when trying to get through this time in your life. Do not waste your time listening to a families stories of frustration, anger, sadness, and embarrassment instead surround yourself with positives."},{"Title":"\\"Our Brown-Eyed Boy\\"","review":"Written by the father of a severely autistic boy, this book attempts to take the reader through the experiences of a young family stricken with the diagnosis of autism, and their attempts to look at the glass \\"half-full instead of half-empty.\\" The birth of Stephen takes the McAndrew family on a journey of learning, pain and revelation as they struggle to understand the meaning of this jolt to their family constellation. Jeff and Debbie realize that each of Stephen's steps in life(e.g. learning to walk to wave) is a huge accomplishment. Stephen's father Jeff quotes a friend of his who was paralyzed from the neck down..\\"It's not about the 900 things Stephen cannot do, but rather, it is the 9000 things he can do.\\"This is the attitude the McAndrew family lives each day with. Jeff also reflects on friends of his who have medically fragile children and how lucky Stephen is to be able to walk and to eat on his own...some of the basics we all take for granted. The theme of the book also carries a deeper tone. That is, never take a moment with your children for granted, and accept your child for what he or she is. The author spends time with the reader emphasizing the term of one of his favorite role models, the late psychologist, Dr. Carl Rogers. That term is \\"unconditional positive regard.\\" So many parents spend hundreds of hours and perhaps thousands of dollars on blood tests, urine tests, dietary methods or other experimental trial with their kids. The irony is that some parents want to change their children, but fail to love them for what they are...\\"right here, right now.\\" The key concept here is balance. It is important, the author says, to balance what your child is(the child's soul if you will) with what they can perform....and to learn to appreciate both. McAndrew also interviews a pediatrician and childhood friend from Sheboygan, Dr. Steven Pizer, whose comprehensive and logical answers also are filled with compassion for children and parents. Dr. Darold Treffert, who did the forward to the book, was a consultant to the movie \\"Rainman\\" with Dustin Hoffman. He has dedicated his life to the study of autism and autistic savants and his book \\"Extraordinary People\\" has been widely read. Treffert very eloquently describes the challenges that autism theorists face and postulates that \\"until we call things by their right names,\\" we remain in somewhat of a classification quandary in the field of autism. In the conclusion of the book, the author tells us about the hope that is always possible and is hopeful that more genetic answers can be found in his and his son's lifetime. McAndrew adds his own poetry about his son at the end of the book along with pictures of his handsome son. He also talks about his typical son Ryan and what struggle a seven year-old sibling has in trying to understand his special brother. McAndrew dedicates the book to his wife, who bears the brunt of therapy schedules, school meetings, insurance calls, etc. while Jeff is at work. A chapter called \\"A Mother's Voice\\" is dedicated to all mothers of autistic children and their profound challenges. The book is highly applauded by local community leaders who Jeff let read his rough drafts. School board, city officials and county officials all have high praise for this original and heartfelt work. This book is a great read for all parents of special children and well as all parents. Jeff also writes and speaks for a living. He presently works as a news reporter and talk show host at WHBL Radio in Sheboygan.A little more from Jeff's bio page....he has won 16 broadcasting awards during his 16 years in journalism including two statewide awards for a documentary on the \\"First Step Autism Program,\\" the first early intervention public school autism program in the state of Wisconsin."},{"Title":"\\"Our Brown-Eyed Boy\\"","review":"I really enjoyed this book and found it wonderful to hear from a parent how they are coping with a difficult situation. My child is not autistic, but has another disability, and while we are doing our very utmost for our children, these situations are also unique to parents and families who live with a child with issues. Many parents of children without problems cannot understand the extra issues that we must deal with. It was nice to hear someone describe feelings and thoughts that I know I have had. The whole family structure is affected, not just the child. It was very helpful to hear from a parent how they deal with this. We need to be able to support each other. There are many books out there about the children who are directly affected by disabilities, but little for the parents who cope with this. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"\\"Our Brown-Eyed Boy\\"","review":"I found Jeffrey's book an eye opening account of autism and what families have to go through to survive. I also found interesting the classification quandary that exists and how much of the alternative treatments(such as chelation and dietary methods) are hit and miss.

Although it has some minor editing problems, the content has character and vision. This parent's insights will be respected for the honesty and love that underlies the effort.

I was inspired by his honesty."},{"Title":"\\"Our Brown-Eyed Boy\\"","review":"The author, Jeff McAndrew, seems to imply that those families who seek outside interventions, like the GFCF diet, do so because they are not able to accept and love their child because of his/her disability. As a parent of a son with autism right around Stephen's age, I know that this implication couldn't be farther from the truth. Many parents with children with a wide range of disabilities do seek outside interventions. They love their children just as they are, but strive to have their children reach their maximum potential. It is complacency that bounds these autistic children to their own self-imposing worlds and these children need extra help to see the beauty of the world around them. It is a shame that the author is embarassed by his child's disability. My child, too, often deviates from social norms but I vowed a long time ago never to apologize to society for his disability. I love him just as he is but would like to strive for him to see the world on which he often closes the door. My son's disability has altered my own world. Sometimes it is difficult, but often it has brought me a greater appreciation for even small steps forward. Because of our ability to relate to each other, some of my greatest friends are other parents of disabled children."},{"Title":"Shackle and Sword","review":"Whoops. I'm not under 13. I am 13.

Or will his love of the animals he tends lead him to a different choice? Ms Morland's characterization is excellent, the plotting is much improved (from good to even better).

I feel the author has real talent, and I will definitely buy her next book."},{"Title":"Shackle and Sword","review":"I liked a lot of things about this book. I liked that the plot was not entirely predictable. I liked that the fey did not just immediately accept Farris when he encountered them. I liked that his reaction to being enslaved and brutalized was to get angry, rather than &quot;rising above it all and being extra-noble&quot;, the way that too many fantasy novel slaves do. I liked that characters in the book were complex, with very few of them being all good or all bad.What I did not like about the book was that the writing *was* predicatable. The plot was not very interesting or intricate, but with the strong characters, that might have been okay, if the writing were more intriguing. (I also thought that the author lost her courage when it came to the resolution between the main character and the man who sold him into slavery.) In this book, we have a moderately interesting plot, workmanlike writing, and very interesting characters. This book is worth reading if you have the time; it will not demand much from you as a reader, and it is enjoyable. It's also pretty forgettable."},{"Title":"Shackle and Sword","review":"This book just grabbed me.

Then the differennce you see from Farris-to-Bantam is wonderful. If you like reading books that don't hold back and make the characters seem above everything, but sound realistic but also adds magic in with that then, this is a book for you. This also isn't one of those constant blood-bath books or romance all the time books or the main \\"character gets the girl everything turns out in the end\\" books. It also doesn't have a tragic end were you begin to wish you'd never wasted your time on it. No when you finish reading this book you will NOT regret reading it. I've said to much. Oh, well.

Miller and Miller make a few points and have certainly done their homework to back up those points, but I fail to see where any new information is being revealed, nor do I see any interesting new thoughts or theories on Ag Terrorism.After reading the author's bio, being a Ph.D. in ag science myself, I was interested to check out the numerous achievements listed in Miller's author bio. I searched ad nauseum for any information I could find on the \\"hundreds\\" of courses he has taught and came up with nothing. I found equally as much when searching for any media appearances, editorials, or other contributions. I found he has some scattered experience in middle management positions in various farm bureaus, but nothing to indicate the extreme scope and depth of experience and expertise his bio claims.My experience was much the same when I looked for any other work he has done to back up the claims made in his author bio related to his law experience and frankly I found very little. What I did find was nothing of significance.If his education and experience are truly what is stated, he has done a good job of covering up his tracks. It does not reflect in the work nor does anyone in this field seem to know who this author is.In a nutshell, I believe this self-published term paper would get an \\"A\\" in a college course on modern ag issues, but it serves no purpose to anyone who is close to the issues discussed in the book. The author's bio and creditials are inflated and largely unsubstantiated. Look at the price of this \\"book\\" - it seems a shameful attempt by the author(s) to make money on a compilation that any college sophomore could put together, and then misrepresenting its value with a misleading bio and questionable (at best) creditials.May I suggest a worthwhile book on this subject?\\"Terrorism, Radicalism and Populism in Agriculture,\\" by Luther Tweeten.Tweeten is Professor Emeritus of Agriculture Policy and Trade at Ohio State University.

Every day, it seems like we read in the papers or see on the news that someone has chained themselves to a tree, or there are people in rubber rafts blocking whaling efforts on the sea, or destroying ski resorts to stop development from encroaching on forests. I wanted to research the subject in depth, and this book is the place to start!This book is written like a master's thesis. It carefully makes its case against ecoextremism and ecoterrorism, and presents facts, figures, and incidents fairly. Several very interesting court cases are explained in this book. EarthFirst! in particular is examined quite closely as being one of the key movers and shakers in the eco-extremist movement.All outside sources cited in this book are carefully footnoted, which is a big help for people like me who need more sources for their bibliography!The authors draw on conservative and liberal publications alike. They discuss how government regulation on the environment has become a nightmare for some public citizens, while other citizens feel that the government has not gone far enough in regulating the environment. Everything is covered, from Julia Hill's living in a tree called Luna, to the Earth Liberation Front's destructive acts at the Vail Ski Resort and at Michigan State's agricultural labs.There are chapters on the forest industry, agriculture, genetically modified foods, government interference in the private sector, almost every area of the environment. Al Gore's book in particular is addressed and de-bunked. There is a WONDERFUL chapter on how the media is manipulated by extremist groups when the media doesn't even begin to understand the subject of the environment.This book is a good place to start on the subject of ecoterrorism. It is a good read and chock-full of top-notch info ready-to-use for research. People in the media, people who work for environmental causes or agencies, and individual environmentalists would do themselves a favor to have this book for ready reference.My only complaint was the binding. It's a spiral notebook sort of setup but the cover page is regular paper.

It is valuable as an information source for research.While the author makes some excellent points about the ineffectiveness of environmental legislation, his argument against environmental extremism is flawed for this very reason. Extremists and activists are motivated by the very ineffectiveness of the legislation that the author himself points out, and many people who are concerned about our quality of life are often driven to take extreme measures to simply be heard above the din of corporate-controlled politicians and the advertising of over-consumption. The author does not seem to realize that if the natural world was not being destroyed at such an alarming rate, extreme measures would not be needed. Some would say that advocating temperance in a time of extreme crisis would be irresponsible.The British called the American Revolutionaries terrorists, while we remember them as freedom fighters.

For decades, he as the art critic for the New York Tribune and was able to witness the rage for the Barbizon School, the acceptance of Impressionism (which happened more rapidly in the United States than in France), the birth of American Impressionism, Realism and then the Armory Show and American Modernism. Although thought of as a traditionalist, Cortissoz championed Du Bois, Davies and some of the early American painters of the modern school, he was a foe of abstraction and non-objective painting. Although he socialized with many of the artists he wrote about, his assessments were generally quite fair, seldom cruel or cutting. Although this book is titled \\"The Painter's Craft\\" it ranges more widely than that with essays on Velesquez, de Ribera, El Greco, Goya, Flemish painting, Fragonard, Chardin, David, Manet, Renoir, Antonio Mancini (who is seldom written about), Houdon, Carpeaux, Geroge Bellow, St. Gaudens and American Architecture.

They even detail the history of the Gardnerian Book of Shadows and point out the changes it underwent throughout the years. The initiation rituals are all included here - 1st degree through 3rd. There is even a self-dedication ritual for those who have not been able to find a teacher, do not belong to a coven, and want to began practicing wicca.

I found this book very thought provoking/inspiring, and thought it was a real wealth of information without being condescending or austere. I also don't understand what is so offensive to some of these reviewers about a single comment noting that the Farrar's believe that humans always reincarnate as humans and how animals have an entirely different soul structure from humans; it's one small section that, as an animal lover, I did not find even remotely offensive (even though I did not agree with it).

One theory is that on phisical death the non phisical elements in an animalare reabsorbed into the group soul of the species, which \\"buds off\\" new individuals from the common pool of physical manifestation.This ludicrous theory reminds me of the attitude Christians have had throught the years, postulating that animals have no souls and exist only for our consumption, use and benefit, as written in the spiritual exercises of a very well known saint.This attitude has lead only to exploitation, cruelty, and ecological imbalance,having had multiple cat households since I was a child, it is very easy to see, even for the non-psychic, that no two cats are alike, they have a definite individuality, and if someone is so callous, insensitive and bruttish, not to realize this, I really doubt they have any psychic powers whatsoever, so how can this authors claim to teach a skill they do not have?A wiser, more logical approach is to be found in books of theosophical literature, in which they acknowledge the fact that animals will eventually incarnate in humans, (and my own observations seem to corroborate this fact) and that our present attitude towards them will be reflected in the kind of humanity that they will make.Another major problem I found in this book is their approach to magic, amongst other things, they seem to raise power and direct it towards individual issues as different as \\"Bridie's persecution compex\\", \\"success in an interview for a job I applied for\\", \\" my sister's missing cat\\" etc.Bridie's paranoia, a successful interview, and the sisters missing cat, are very different problems which require the aid of very diferent aspects of deity, and in consequence, diferent incenses, colours, candles and ritual arrangements. I remember Dion's fortune reference to the parable of \\"the pearl of great price\\" regarding this topic, in which she mentions only one magickal goal is possible to be attained per ritual. And this is the same approach I've found in all books except for this one.Their disregard towards animal rights is evident throughout the book. In one of the plates they proudly display an athame made with a deer's foot!!???"},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"This book doesn't even come close to the quality I have come to expect from Maeve Binchy. The story lines never come together. Basically, the entire book is a set of character sketches. Yes, it kept my attention and I did finish the book, but by the time I was finished, I regretted spending the time on it and fussed at my mother who told me in advance that this was not one of her favorites. (She should have been a bit more forthcoming!) I would not recommend this book; on the contrary, I would discourage someone from investing any time on this book. There are many, many better books out there, including all others by still-a-favorite Maeve Binchy."},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"This book was a good read until the last chapters. The story line begins to unravel a bit toward the end. There are pieces left unfinished and the ending itself was so poor that I thought my copy must be missing the last chapter. Most of Binchy's novels are beautifully polished. Unfortunately, this one leaves the silver somewhat tarnished."},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"Another great book by Maeve Binchy ! I love most of her books. This one is no exception. The characters become real to you, and you tend to miss them when the book is over.

I'd have liked a little more of an ending, not quite so sudden an ending."},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"Most of the characters were annoying in this book.

They are helped by their daughter Anna, who is just getting over an unhappy love affair. Less helpful are their other two children, Helen, a hopeless bungler who is hoping to be taken on as a nun, and Brendan, who has escaped his childhood home and family to take up farming with his Uncle Vincent in Ireland. Other guests include the best man Frank, who has become much more successful than Desmond and the maid of honor, Helen, both of whom have their own problems. Deirdre is extremely concerned with appearances, since she married &quot;beneath her&quot; 25 years ago, and her gentle falsehoods and nervous posturings effect her children and others around her. Each of the eight main characters is introduced in a chapter and they all come together for the celebration at the end. This book does not have the depth of other Binchey novels, nor the redemption of all of its characters, but it is an interesting read, nonetheless."},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"Maeve's forte is character development, dialogue, and interaction, and Silver Wedding was far below her usual standard."},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"Maeve Binchy continues to explore in depth the characters of her writings with Silver Wedding.

This is the second Binchy book I have read this summer and was sad when I came to the last page."},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"This book did not give the depth that Binchy usually has.

I love her detailed character observation and how it lets the reader recognise bits of people in her characters. Silver Wedding centres around a 25th wedding anniversary and the plethora of dilemmas such a seemingly straightforward celebration can cause. Anyone who has ever organised a family event such as this will love the descriptions of family politics, and I'm sure many will sympathise with the heroine's family traumas and how being 'the responsible one' can lead to all sorts of complications, not to mention that vaguely disquieting feeling of being put upon.

I was looking for entertaining summer reading and couldn't resist reading Silver Wedding (read it before, years ago). Ms. Binchy gets into the characters' heads and takes the reader along for the ride. Following the main female character through the story is entertaining; you can't help but think \\"I'm glad she isn't in MY life!\\" I've read everything that Maeve Binchy has written (I think) and this book is one of my favorites. If you enjoy her writing, then you have to read this one."},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"I seldom keep books after I read them to minimize clutter.

There are secrets involved in everyone's lives and this book is a reflection upon that.There is Anna, the daughter in charge of planning the anniversary celebration, who is in love with an actor still married to his wife and mother of his sons. There is Brendan who fled England back to the Irish farmland that his father had escaped from. There is Helen, the youngest child, bent on becoming a nun in an order that doesn't even want her. There is Desmond, their father, miserable in a management level of a grocery store chain and their mother, Deirdre, who has always tried to maintain the look of happiness and perfection. And they all come to self-realizations in this novel. There is Deirdre's maid of honor, Maureen, who became a successful business woman, and there is Frank, the best man, who is the head of the grocery store chain. And other characters with a delightful insights written by Maeve.This book is nice ~~ it's comfort reading, if you will. It is not, by far, her best book. She has a tendency to string her readers along for more juicy tidbits and end it promptly without revealing any more stories. It's frustrating because it leaves all the questions unanswered. So it's not as good as &quot;Circle of Friends&quot; or &quot;Light a Penny Candle&quot; or her others. But still, it is a comforting read.It is a nice little story of people and friends of a family in England. Though it's not my favorite book, it is still an enjoyable reading.12-2-03"},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"Maeve Binchy is a great storyteller. All of her books are filled with character description and are definately page turners. The Silver Wedding took me by suprise the way each character had different views on the same events which is usually true in real life. This is the seventh book of Binchy's that I have read and everytime I finish one, I can't wait to start the next. The Silver Wedding, although not my favorite of hers, lived up to my expectations of Bincy's marvelous ability to telling a story. Definately recommende d as a summer read. (or anytime!)"},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"Maeve Binchy, in her usual style, introduces us to her characters one-by-one. As we meet each character, their inner thoughts explain their relationships to each other, and to the activities that are happening in each individual's life. This bittersweet tale is very realistic in explaining how and why people act in the strange ways that we all do. As we meet each person, the puzzle comes together and by the end the reader has a complete picture of the event, the thoughts, the preparation, and the cast of the Silver Wedding Party. This beautiful book may encourage us all to realize and respect the reasons for other people's life-choices. We only know part of the story."},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"This was only my 3rd book by Maeve Binchy, and compared to Evening Class and Echoes, Silver Wedding wasn't near as entertaining. I feel that if Binchy made the novel a bit longer to allow for better character development, Silver Wedding would have been quite a page-turner. However, I enjoyed this book from beginning to end, and I will continue to read anything Maeve Binchy has in print."},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"I've just recently started reading Maeve Binchy. Silver Wedding strikes me as one of her more unique stories, one that goes out on a bit of a ledge.The book is comprised of something like 8 different parts; each with it's own narrator & we get a glimpse into that person's life. We start out with the eldest daughter of the anniversary couple, Anna, and then to her two other siblings- Brenden & Helen. We also read about her parents and their friends. In the final part we see them all reunited for the anniversary party.The book was not exactly what I was expecting- it wasn't really a very \\"happy\\" book. In fact, the stories inside it were quite sad & depressing. I did enjoy though what almost seemed like a book full of mini-stories all coming together at the end. So far it's not my favorite of her's, but I enjoyed it just the same."},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"This book takes a typical family, examines its seperate members, and then provides a look at the whole with the knowledge of the secrets each member has.I enjoy Binchy's style of writing interconnected stories that weave together. She pulled it off first in Lilac Bus and now Silver Wedding."},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers that this was not her best novel. I would have rathered her write about only half the characters and go into more depth about those. I would get so into a story and then it would end, and the person wouldn't be heard of again until the anniversary celebration. I did like the part about the various invites to the party which had been answered, (Not a direct quote) - &quot;They would send flowers and a card,but would not attend, and that is the way it should be&quot; It was a quick read, though - great for a rainy weekend or a trip to the beach. Also try TARA ROAD - a good novel as well."},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"Even though I did enjoy this book, I was disappointed in the way some of the characters stories were left hanging, such as Father Hurley's nephew. What happened to him? The character of Helen REALLY got on my nerves. But then, she was probably supposed to. Overall, though, it was a good read."},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"I started this book as I felt in need for something mild and soothing for the heart.Desmond&iexcl;s and Deirdre&iexcl;s silver wedding anniversary was central to the whole story. Through this upcoming event, several characters&iexcl; stories unfolded. Anna, the eldest daughter, blindly in love with an out-of-work author; Helen, the youngest, struggling to become a nun; Brendan, the only son who went against the norms and his parents&iexcl; wishes to work in a farm in Ireland. Also weaved into the story was Frank, the best man, a successful business man, though slightly less successful in the affairs of the heart, Father Hurley, the priest who married the couple twenty-five years ago, and feisty Maureen, Deirdre&iexcl;s best friend.These were ordinary characters, but what would make the reader go on is that each of the character had its own unique tale to tell, from managing family relationships, to hidden and secret affairs of the heart.I felt a slight disappointment, however, at the end of the book as it left me with a sense of non-fulfillment. We were given insights to the problems but were not shown solutions. For instance, Deirdre&iexcl;s uneasy relationship with her children did not appear to be improved and Maureen&iexcl;s relationship with Walter did not develop further. Maybe this is the author&iexcl;s reflection of the real world, that not every question has an answer to it."},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"This was only my 3rd book by Maeve Binchy, and compared to Evening Class and Echoes, Silver Wedding wasn't near as entertaining.

We have Anna the oldest daughter, she is organising the anniversary party, and worried about what can go wrong and whether her brother Brendan will show up at the party. Brendan has all but removed himself from the family as he is tired of the acting that goes on with his mother Deirdre who's always worried about what people will think. Theres also Anna and Brendan's sister Helen a very confused, accident prone and annoying character who is trying to become a nun to get away from it all. There's the parish priest who has his own secrets and other various family and friends.This is a short book which I read in a few hours. I think if you have read the Lilac Bus and liked it you will probably like this one as well."},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"Not one of her better efforts.

I had trouble choosing between a 3 &amp; 4 for the stars but chose 4 because it wasn't bad enough to be a 3. It was good in the sense that there was a section foreach character &amp; it all started to pull together. It did get boring sometimes, though &amp; I didn't like the ending. Binchy does have a talent and it can make you feel like part of the book, sometimes loving or hating the characters. I would say, in the end, it was worth reading &amp; enjoyable."},{"Title":"Larks: A memoir","review":"Yes, everyone has a tale to tell, and it is the standard Binchy tale: someone is a mistress, someone *has* a mistress, someone feels trapped in his/her marriage... I started off with Binchy, relieved that these were not \\"romance novels,\\" but three or four books into her plethora, I find them to be glorified Barbara Cartlands. The difference is, in the more recent ones, they all sell food."},{"Title":"Deadville","review":"I enjoyed the first two thirds of this book as much as any novel of the frontier I have ever read. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with part 3. The whole tone of the third segment was jarringly anachronistic and peppered with little in-jokes, for example, a Delaware indian is named Lenny LeNapier. The actual name of the Delaware tribe was Leni Lenape. I felt like I was suddenly reading a comic book with '90s people plunged into the 1840's. It seemed like Jones wrote the first two parts as a serious frontier story, then said &quot;To Hell with it!&quot; and turned the last portion into a farce. What a letdown, after the excellent beginning and middle, not to mention the author's superb The Buffalo Runners, where the authentic historical tone is maintained throughout."},{"Title":"Deadville","review":"What a beautiful, racous, shoot-them-up, exhilarating, galloping story! The author did his research and spins a most believable tale of the old West. Characters like Pine Leaf, Spybuck and Dade are marvellous and unique. And the Indians truly come to life.

Humanoid aliens have invaded Earth, travelling in vast, intimidating arachnoid vehicles, causing the remnant population of Earth to take refuge in underground shelters. The protagonist is Esther, who breaks the unwritten law and braves the surface world. The result is a good, if rather depressing, story. Fans of Lee and of dark, post-apocalyptic fiction will want to check it out."},{"Title":"Days of Grass","review":"In this stand-alone novel, Lee explores an earth which has been decimated by invading aliens. The surviving humans are forced underground to live their lives the best that they can.Generations after they went to earth, a young girl named Esther defies what seem to her like useless laws forbidding them to go to the surface. When her tell-tale tan gives her away, she is taken to the leader of their community and her real adventure begins...The apocalypse is a convenient vehicle for one of the favorite Lee themes-- the value of the strong and contrary individual will. Esther is able to overcome all obstacles simply by believing in herself and refusing to accept false goals as an end state. While Esther herself is a very well-drawn character, the plotting suffers from its nearly exclusive focus on her stubborness. The aliens are sketchily plotted, nearly to the point of total invisibility. The ending is very poor and reads as though Lee ran out of steam.The book will probably appeal to the teenage reader (particularly the teenage girl?). However, parents should note that there are several reasonably graphic sex scenes, including some non-consensual sex. It should be fine for the older teenager, but should not be confused with a book suitable for a YA audience. If you have not read Lee before, I would recommend beginning with the Flat Earth series in place of this novel."},{"Title":"Days of Grass","review":"&quot;Days of Grass&quot; is a shorter novel, but it packs a real punch. The storyline is dark, with enough twists and turns to keep your eyes glued to the page. The first half of the book is excellent. I found Esther a very headstrong and original character, and I think Tanith does a perfect job of making her characters as different and strange as possible. Her writing style is fantastic.The second half of the book is a bit slower through the turns, as it is the darker half of the book. While the ending was most definetly shocking, I found it a bit of a dissapointment, because I felt more should have happened... yet I would most definetly recommend this book to any reader of Tanith Lee or other readers that prefer darker fantasies or sci-fi."},{"Title":"Days of Grass","review":"The novel was engrossing and it caught and held my attention.

Pero analizado con sentido cr&iacute;tico, este libro presenta numerosos signos de ser totalmente inventado:- Alondra, la primera reencarnaci&oacute;n, afirma estar en el a&ntilde;or 1863 antes de Cristo. &iquest;Desde cuando el CALENDARIO CRISTIANO SE UTILIZ&Oacute; ANTES DE NACER CRISTO? Y dejando aparte este peque&ntilde;o detalle, &iquest;c&oacute;mo Catherine -la persona que supuestamente Weiss estudi&oacute;- puede llegar a saber el a&ntilde;o al instante? &iquest;realmente se piensa Weiss que la humanidad ha tenido siempre tan presente el A&Ntilde;O en el que viv&iacute;a? - otra cosa son las estaciones dentro de un periodo anual- . Decir la fecha parece sencillamente a un recurso narrativo para impresionar al lector, pero que no tiene ningun sentido en el caso acontecido.- El libro cae en t&oacute;picos que en una novela ser&iacute;an incluso detalles \\"malos\\". Por ejemplo, &iquest;por qu&eacute; la vida que Catherine vivi&oacute; a mediados de siglo XX ha de ser, precisamente, piloto de guerra alem&aacute;n? &iquest;Por qu&eacute; no era campesino en la India, o habitante de Brasil, o cualquiera de los millones de europeos que no tuvieron nada que ver con la guerra mundial? Es un detalle que le quita veracidad a la narraci&oacute;n!- La teor&iacute;a de que las almas viajan en grupo es absurda.

Por tanto, estad&iacute;sticamente es imposible que las almas viajen en grupos sencillamente por que hace 30 a&ntilde;os exist&iacute;an la mitad de las personas. Lo mismo se puede decir de las t&iacute;picas encarnaciones en la civilizaci&oacute;n egipcia: Egipto ten&iacute;a varios miles de veces menos poblaci&oacute;n que el mundo actual, por lo que ser&iacute;a dificil&iacute;simo encontrar un reencarnado que hubiese vivido en Egipto!!. En cambio, Weiss parece haber encontrado uno a la primera!!- Weiss se plantea pero inmediatamente descarta la posibilidad de si la memoria es heredada. &iexcl;&iexcl;El simplemente hecho de plantearse tal aberraci&oacute;n muestra que no tiene ni idea de, ni c&oacute;mo funciona la memoria, ni c&oacute;mo funciona la herencia!! Aparte...las vidas pasadas NO son de hijos o nietos... Por tanto, no podr&iacute;a tener nada que ver con la herencia!- El calendario cristiano, actualmente, es seguido por 1/5 de la poblaci&oacute;n mundial. Por tanto, estad&iacute;sticamente de nuevo, s&oacute;lo un quinto de las vidas pasadas podr&iacute;an haber expresado las fechas en este calendario. En cambio, TODAS las encarnaciones que son capaces de expresar la fecha lo hacen en este calendario.Hay mas detalles que hacen dudar much&iacute;simo de la veracidad de lo que cuenta Weiss. En numerosas ocasiones es traicionado por su falta de visi&oacute;n del mundo, de lo que es y de lo que fu&eacute;. Tampoco fu&eacute; el primero en hablar de regresiones mediante hipnosis: a principios de siglo era una pr&aacute;ctica de moda en c&iacute;rculos esot&eacute;ricos.Lo siento, pero si por un remoto casual existiesen vidas pasadas, creo que Weiss puede aportar al asunto menos que yo: yo no puedo aportar nada, pero &eacute;l s&oacute;lo confusi&oacute;n."},{"Title":"Muchas vidas, muchos sabios","review":"I am satisfied with this product and service.

John Schaefer, the host of radio's program of the same name here provides an insight into all forms of new music, though admittedly it is a bit weak in the rock arena.

This cookbook has had it ALL for me... when I wanted to make pancakes from scratch, I had it all. When I needed a bread but had no yeast, Navajo Fry Bread awaited me. When my hubby wanted doughnuts, I was able to give him New Orleans Doughnuts that were so much like the beignets I remembered from a family vacation.I have never failed to be able to find the perfect recipe for what I was looking for. The illustrations are nostalgic and the text is informative, giving a bit of a history lesson for those recipes rich in culture.The &#34;extras&#34; at the beginning of the cookbook are excellent;* Emergency Substitutions (and who hasn't been there!),* Food Equivalents that let you know how many or how much of a food you have to buy in order to get the amounts called for,* Oven Temperature Guide (how many degrees IS a &#34;slow oven&#34; after all!?),* Deep Fat Frying temps, a guide and explanation of Candy/Syrup temps,* High-Altitude baking tips* Equivalent weights & measures* Herb & spice description and use* Blended Spices* Traditional MenusThe only thing that I would have liked to see would be a section on basic cooking/baking techniques and terms, but back then, folks knew how to do those things. Besides... how big does a cookbook need to be!?This cookbook has followed me from California, to Missouri (2 times), Texas (3 times), Kentucky, Colorado, and now on our way to Bolivia! lol... NO, we aren't in the military... we're in the ministry and now we are going to the mission field of Cochabamba. I once thought I had lost the book and prayed for two years that I would find it... and I DID!

I found the style a bit abrupt and halting, but the most of the stories were interesting enough that I did not mind. \\"Legends of the Outer Banks and Tar Heel Tidewater\\" tells the local tales of this North Carolina coastal area. The stories start as early as the first settlement, continue through until WWII and cover everything from Blackbeard and Hatteras Jack to the fate of Aaron Burr's only daughter.While I think I would much rather sit by a fire and listen to Mr. Whedbee tell his stories, I still think it was worth the time spent reading them. There are some wonderful little gems of North Carolina history hidden in these pages."},{"Title":"Legends of the Outer Banks and Tar Heel tidewater","review":"We bought the first of these books years ago when we were vacationing in the outer banks.

Batschelet has crafted every chapter, section, paragraph, and even sentence with meticulous care and precision in the finest Swiss tradition.If you've already studied mathematics through calculus, differential equations, probability, linear algebra, etc., this book is an especially good resource to review it all via a single coherent book.To illustrate how much I cherish this book, I've bought two copies -- one to read, and the other in case the first is damaged and the book goes out of print.If you love math, buy this book.

For example, The Matchlock Gun, which has been so dearly loved by boys for years was a total yawn for her. However, this story was an exception. I dare other parents to read it to their girls. Although this book is about weapons and war, the author ends each chapter with a teaser that had my daughter begging for just one more chapter each time that we read. There is also plenty of suspense, adventure, and character development to keep the interest of the child that isn't fascinated by weaponry the way that most boys are. It also helps to have handy some pictures of Revolutionary era mortars, cannons, Howitzers, etc. to give the child a visual of the convoy. I'm surprised that there aren't more reviews for this book, as I've heard several recommendations of it in homeschool circles.

With Boston Harbor blockaded, the colonists could not gain any ammunition, so colonist Henry Knox hears of Fort Ticonderoga stocked with ammunition and devises a plan with his brother Will to bring the guns back to General Washington in the middle of winter.

In this book Arie talks about the evolving notion of the organization as a living being, instead of just an &quot;economic entity&quot; whose main purpose of existence is to survive, fulfill its potential, and to become great. Plain talking and cutting free from jargon, Arie illustrates this idea with examples from his career in Royal Dutch Shell and the studies Shell had carried out on long lasting and big organizations (they found only around 40 odd !!). This book needs to read by entreprenuers, business people and academicians to look at their organizations as some thing else apart from a money making machine ! Revolutionary!!"},{"Title":"The Living Company","review":"Arie de Geus is probably the most unique business thinker around. He combines the pragmatism of someone who had a very successful career at Shell with the curiosity of a talented academic. Behind this unique perspective is a deep appreciation for people. Most of us automatically relate to organizations like Newton related to the natural world, as one big physical mechanism. We casually talk about &quot;aligning parts of the organization&quot;, &quot;operating in organizational smokestacks or silos&quot;, and &quot;fixing communications channels&quot;. Mr. de Geus helps us learn to think about organizations from the natural perspective, as living organisms, subject to many of the same limitations and forces as individual people are. When you read this book, you will become a much better and more effective person in all parts of your life. You will also feel better about yourself, and make those around you feel better about themselves. Read THE LIVING COMPANY today. This book is a wonderful gift to us all!"},{"Title":"The Living Company","review":"If I have to stay with only one business book in my shelf( I have more than 300 in the last count), the living company would be this book. My review will be more emotional I think. This is so, because the way this book touched me. I read it three times and some time think I have to read it again.This is a very similar with the \\"Built to last\\", one of the bestsellers of Amazon. If you liked that book this will be an excellent complement of your reading and thoughts.Perhaps this is the book that a Startup's CEOs should had read before launch their enterprise, because one of the characteristic of a living company is that they are conservative in their finances.De Geus wrote a book that it is not limit to a period of time like recent books dot com books. By this I mean that you can go back to it and reapply its contents in your business reality again and again.An import thing to say is that this is a book of principles, not rules or easy steps to success. Although the author is going to show you that there is a pattern in all the living company, he goes beyond that, showing the root that origin these patterns. The principles was constructed by observing companies, specially Royal Doutch/shell, were Arie de Geus worked for many years, but with the help of other disciplines like psychology and biology, which study the behavior and life of humans and animals. To discuss about innovation for instance, you will observe how a specie of bird is very smart to pass a learning to the whole specie. And to understand how we react or anticipate an external change in our business, it will be useful to look some psychology's theories about the human mind, and so on.Don't think this is a book for academic public, it is not. You will find not only theories but many examples and cases of the thesis of De Geus. But it is different, I think, of the recent business book. Some times it seems so easy to look a successful company today and says \\"look, this is what you have to do in your company\\". A couple of years ago you could find many books explaining why Netscape was so great. Where are Netscape now?. It would not pass in the test of time.So if you are only worried to make your money no matter what is going to happen to your company, this is not a book for you. Probably you are Jim Clark type. Read the new, new thing instead. But if you thing that management is more than stock options ( I said more. I am saying that is a consequence not the only objective), if you believe the every company must have a reason to exist, if you believe the people are important, than I guarantee, you gonna like this book, tell me about"},{"Title":"The Living Company","review":"Arie de Geus's premise - that there are two kinds of companies: economic companies (which exist primarily to make money) and living companies (which exist primarily to continue to exist and be all they can be) - isn't novel. The theme was well developed - perhaps more rigorously - in Collins' and Porras' Built to Last.De Geus' contribution is therefore one of providing a human perspective, in some ways giving an idea of what it is like as a person or as a manager to work in a company which is alive. In this he succeeds.I must admit my view was tinged a little by my experiences as a manager in the Royal Dutch/Shell group of the 90's, dealing with the consequences of massive errors in the allocation of capital, many of which happened under Mr. de Geus's watch as Planning Coordinator. Whether Shell will be able to resist the misguided pressures of its shareholders (and of highly paid consultants) and stay a living company remains to be seen.Nevertheless, an excellent contribution, with much wisdom."},{"Title":"The Living Company","review":"This book really resonates with my philosophy that we can all accomplish a lot more by coordinating, communicating, sharing, and preparing together. Mr. de Geus frees each of us to be fully human, and to humanize the organizations we are part of. He successfully challenges the limits of the mechanical view of human interactions, and provides a great vision into what is possible. A good complement for this book is &quot;The 2,000 Percent Solution&quot; -- a book that shows each of us how to tap into our innate talents to create world-class solutions through asking and answering a better set of questions. I also recommend &quot;The Pursuit of Prime.&quot; With these three books, you can accomplish anything!"},{"Title":"The Living Company","review":"Companies die all the time. The current business climate favors short term profit over long term survival, and most companies don't adapt fast enough. De Geus explains why this is, and what we can do about it, but what makes this book an essential read is that he gives us a new way of looking at organizations and the meaning of work.The problem is that, in management, you get what you reward. This is a well-known truth and explains the dysfunction we see in most companies. As de Geus puts it, \\"The difficulty lies in our definition of corporate success...the dominant school of thought in business administration measures success purely in terms of quantity: the maximization of revenues, market share, share value, or proceeds.\\"The solution de Geus comes up with is novel and revolutionary. It is to look at companies differently -- not as machines, but as living beings. In fact, he goes even further than this, saying that companies actually are living beings. It is only because they are living that they can learn and adapt and hence sustain themselves over long periods of time.This view seems extreme, but it is soundly based in philosophical argument and it is preferable to the alternate view that companies operate like clockwork and their employees are simply assets. The complexity of organizations can indeed be understood better by analogy with human psychology and biological ecosystems. And a company is able to survive and learn only because it has an identity that outlives any of the people working within it.de Geus draws on the work of leaders in the fields of psychology, philosophy, evolutionary biology and immunology. He agrees with other management writers like Drucker, Collins and Buckingham on basic management truths, like the need to focus on strengths and develop people continually so as to maximize their effectiveness. However, he provides fresh and original insights on management and helps us look at our organizations in a new way.For example, the natural consequence of thinking of organizations as living beings is that a company's primary goal becomes survival. This in turn leads to a different way of looking at the company's people. The company will survive only if there is synergy and an underlying contract between the company and its members whereby the members are helped to reach their potential in return for support of the company's goals.Many years ago, I read Peter Senge's book, \\"The Fifth Discipline,\\" and its depiction of the learning organization became an ideal for me. I didn't expect to be as profoundly affected by \\"The Living Company,\\" but the ideas are, if anything, even more basic to finding meaning in work, and will likely stay with me. This book is essential reading for any leader wanting to build a sustainable company, but it's also thought-provoking for anyone who wants to make change happen in any organization.Graham Lawes"},{"Title":"The Living Company","review":"This has become a bible in my consulting practice especially the impacts of Economic vs Stewardship models in business. This book provide tremendous insight and motivation for getting beyond the burn out many of us experience in corporate life today.The stewardship approaches discussed and evidence supporting their viability demonstrate how any level of management can have an impact that will far out last their tenure with any firm.One key element that could be developed, is how to utilize the stewardship model within an Economic modeled organization."},{"Title":"The Living Company","review":"I enjoyed reading this book very much - not only from the strategic exploration standpoint.On top of sharing his own personal and professional experiences of applying the strategies in Royal Dutch/Shell group, the author gives an excellent explanation about our innate human ability to strategise, since our caveman days. Once you understand his explanation, you will begin to realise why scenario building is quite a piece of cake.Neverthesless, I would strongly recommend readers to read this book in conjunction with Peter Schwartz's The Art of the Long View. The reason is this: this book gives you only the WHAT? and the WHY? while Peter Schwartz's gives you the WHAT? and the HOW?. Both books complement each other.If you want to be a strategic explorer, - and also to reclaim/maximise your innate ability to build scenarios - buy & read both books!"},{"Title":"The Living Company","review":"To understand more about development of organizations to me its a good book. Fairly good readeble and stil actual. Basic principals never change."},{"Title":"The Living Company","review":"Arie provides a very good picture of companies that have sustained centuries of change. His research reveals what makes them click and what they aare doing that others are not doing. Some of his insights are packaged within the context of a company that truly has life time employment which some of us can not even imagine. His experiences in management and leadership will not necessarily ring true to many of us. Many of us simply will never have the opportunites that he has had. On the other hand, the work that he captures is excellent on sustainability and I highly recommend that if sustainability in business is an interest to you, that you read this book."},{"Title":"The Living Company","review":"This book should be as instructive to economists as it is to students of business.Formal economics has, for a long time, seen the company as a sort of black box which sits uneasily within a neo-classical framework of equations. The joint stock corporation exists much to the frustration of those mathematical modellers who would preferably wish it away.Some progress to it's understanding has been achieved through developments in behaviourable and institutional economics as well as through the work of Ronald Coase but to may the company remains somewhat of an enigma.The imperative behind this work is to examine why some firms exist for longer than others and the author draws on work in Royal Dutch Shell and other business stuies to develop an almost biological theory. Much of the argument is intuitively attractive and matches our day to day experience. We see how the shorter lived companies are closer to an economic portrayal where short-term profits are the top priority and where these are effectively syphoned off rather than invested back in the enterprise. In contrast the longer lasting corporation has almost entrepreneurial attributes where profit maximisation takes second place to profitability over a medium to longer term approach.What I find particularly interesting about this case study, as I perceive it, is the relevance of the notion of catallaxy. \\"Friedrich Hayek used the term Catallaxy to describe as \\"the order brought about by the mutual adjustment of many individual economies in a market\\". (wikipedia) From this perspective, the market is an exchange process which is a much broader conception than the limited notion of economy. From this understanding, any exchange between individuals is part of a market order so that a firm can be properly understood as a network of exchge relations which is in itself involved in a bigger set of market relations.Re-examining the two examples yields, firstly, the profit maximising economic firm where the network is a short-term association of individuals each affected by short-term considerations which result in low wages but low or poor levels of productivity. This type will be a relatively brief participant in an economic cycle prone to changes in developments in technology or to changes in fashion where any innovative ideas will be absorbed through takeover. The factors of production involved will be relatively mobile but cheap in price as they will not have achieved any great learning or embodied knowledge.In contast the long-term enterprise will have relatively high factor values, engage in research and development and will persist in time.What this book illustrates very well, aside from the total failure of the economics establishment to provide a fim analytical framework of the existance of such bodies, is theneed for a broader conception of the reality of the world. This indicates a need for a reappraisal of the view of economics as a hard science to one drawing more from the biological sides and to look beyond the notion that markets are all about a particular limited set of prices.This is an excellent book which is suitable for everyone who has an interest in the world around us."},{"Title":"The Living Company","review":"In reading a business book, so many of us are seeking competitive advantage for our respective businesses in the form of a new strategy, tactic, policy or any combination of the preceding three elements. This book however is bigger than simply the above elements, as it describes a business philosophy. Arie de Geus is a respected business scenarioist and strategist. He developed his craft over many years in a leading multinational organisation and therefore is well equipped to talk about globalism and evolution. This book passes on that craft in the form of a circumspect view from a man consumate in the art of business. He proposes that businesses be: receptive (sensitive) to the commercial environment and opportunity; have an all embracing organisational culture; tolerant of new ideas and have a conservative approach to financing and investment. But above all he proposes that the raison d'etre of companies is not simply profit, rather it is corporate longevity through embracing the above four propositions. He also suggests that today's principal corporate activity is simply a current commercial phase capable of being superseded by some other activity at some later date. In other words, our respective successful business activities and opportunities are only today's fashions!

By taking a look at long living companies, the author has extracted some timeless advice for corporations to pay attention to. The thing that &quot;lowered the score,&quot; so to speak is that there were hardly any statistics or hard numbers involved to back up his claims, regardless of the intuitive excellence of their teachings. If this book is to make a difference and it has the ingredients to do so, I thought some hard results outside of the longevity would have to be produced and they weren't. What I particularly liked was how the distinction was made between living companies and economic companies. More importantly, how people need to realize that you can't run a company with some of one philosophy and some of the other. You'll have to pick this up and read it to understand this, but I think if you do, you'll see that most companies are attempting to mix oil and water today and unfortuneately, I agree that they will be &quot;dead before their time.&quot; Overall, this was a very insightful book and upon reflection to my own life, sarcastically entertaining."},{"Title":"The Living Company","review":"Literally broke the first time I used them.

Since I've had the chance to work with him and learn from him at Shell Brasil, I've been wondering about how his ideas could reach other people that weren't as lucky as I was. This book is the missing opportunity for those who face organizations as something more than a money-making machine; for those who care about the future, although linked to the current reality; for those who, although must survive, perceive humans as the main assets of mankind; for those who, besides everything, perceive human life as an infinite process of knowledge searching as a road to a never reached wisdom."},{"Title":"The Living Company","review":"Really hits home with a clear explanation on why companies fail.

Lundberg's writings mentally transport readers to experiences and places that quickly spring to life. The book engendered mental pictures that demanded my attention and created a storyline that melded both old and new into an experience that evoked strong memories and visions of bustling cities, ancient fortresses, and brightly colored umbrella topped tables lining village streets . I could almost feel the humidity and heat as he revealed a place and a time that has reverberated throughout history. Ulysses has never been recounted like this! And, the story with its modern approach to describing the people of Greece and the 'Greek Experience' is right on the money!"},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"With the exception of the movie \\"O Brother Where Art Thou,\\" I hadn't thought about Homer and Greek mythology since I had my own unpleasant odyssey through Margaret Hamilton's classic in high school. At the time, I thought it was torture. I didn't care to hear about the gods ever again. Now I know that reaction was one of youthful ignorance. Dr. Lundberg's book was a tantalizing invitation to revisit my thinking. I have only traveled as far as Italy, but I am now determined to get to Greece. I hope that Dr. Lundberg is in the midst of writing his next book. I want to know more about Phodas, Angela, Minos, and especially Vasso and the children. Now that I am hooked, tell me more!"},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"I like the mainstream of travel books, but I've never seen one designed quite this way. The author has woven a plain-language retelling of parts of Homer with descriptions of the modern Greeks as he came to know them. Fair play to the author: he has given us something refreshingly different.Lundgren writes clear, quality prose with above average descriptive talent. His deep affection for his subject is evident throughout, which warmed my heart as it deviates from the accepted journalistic principle (one I despise) of pretending to have no real human feelings. I tend to believe that a traveler learns more about a people when s/he tends to like them, and the author clearly does.Recommended for the travel reader willing to try a novel approach to the subject of culture study. For the travel reader with any interest at all in Homer, feel free to add a star."},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"David Lundberg takes the reader on a magical and mysterious tour ... first, into ancient mythical Greece and after that, into her vibrant cities, dry arid countrysides and verdant colorful islands. The author reveals the unique and distinctive characteristics of this dynamic Mediterranean country. The reader visits tavernas, drinks a glass of retsina, nibbles on delicate honey sweetened pastries, rides the ferry boat from mainland Greece to nearby islands, soaks up the warm Mediterranean sun, marvels at the many shades of blue, azure and aquamarine colored waters of the Aegean Sea ... dips the toes into its cool clear water and even dances a zeibekiko. The reader meets lively people of all ages on this amazing tour of an ancient land and learns many fascinating historical and religious truths. Most interesting to this reader was the settlement history of the island of Cephalonia and the conversion of the Corinthians to Christianity by St. Paul. The author is well read and intersperses carefully gleaned information and insights from such authors as Edith Hamilton, who wrote \\"The Greek Way\\" and Nikos Kazantzakis who wrote \\"Zorba the Greek\\" and \\"Journey to the Morea\\", two of his many famous works ... The author reveals how the nation weathered many storms literally and figuratively which strengthened the spirit of the people who developed an almost fierce optimistic independence balanced with humor and faith.This superbly crafted book captures the essential nature and qualities of the Greek people and their dynamic personalities. Like the captain of a sailing vessel, the author navigates the reader through the calm and tempestuous waters of Greece's past and present through carefully chosen words and photographic word images which describe unique people and places. The reader is taken on a historical and pleasure tour of places such as Cephalonia, Lefkas, Zakynthos, Corinth, Aegina, Corfu, famous parts of Athens, and also to northern Greece, to Edessa and Kavala. After finishing this book, this reader has a desire to share the photographic impressions and wonderful discoveries learned on this magnificent argosy ... the experiences and events are unforgettable.The marvelous Greek legend about Ulysses, who goes to Troy to fight for Helen, because he pledged his word while he leaves behind his wife and child, who must fend for themselves at home, during his long absence is an allegory which many modern day Greeks live and relive one generation after the other. They have a deep longing to return home after any absence no matter what the cause for their leaving. The desire to return home was the main driving force responsible for Ulysses survival during his ardouous journey and meanderings on different islands. This book will appeal to arm-chair travellers as well as those who have literally visited many parts of the world; it makes no difference if one visited Greece or not. The book provides a distinctive and clear message about the Greek culture but most importantly about the strength, resiliency and friendly independent spirit of the Greek people. Erika Borsos (erikab93)"},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"This book masterfully utilizes historic references as a framework for introducing the reader to modern day Greece and Greek culture. The life and journey of Ulysses as told in Part One is understandable and exciting! It is instructive and pleasant. Having little prior knowledge about Greek history or Greece, this tale allowed me to connect more fully to the unique islands, people, and experiences described in Part Two. After reading Olympic Wandering I am inspired to embark on my own odyssey to Greece."},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"Part One. Troy remains the only challenger to the Greek domination of the seas. However, most believe that the city-state is starting to show flab and the time to end their control of the Hellespont that links the Aegean to the Black Sea is soon. When Trojan Prince Paris allegedly abducts the beautiful Helen, Greek ruler Menelaus has his excuse to take the city. Ulysses agrees to help though he believes that Helen went willingly with her lover. Thus the lengthy Trojan War has begun *(short blip in this book). This is a terrific retelling of Ulysses' Odyssey that Homer and mythological fans would appreciate, as readers tour the islands with the great champion, on his quest, as a guide.Part Two. Author David Lundberg follows much of Ulysses'' travelogue to see how much of the spirit of the great king and his peers still live in modern day Greece. Readers will enjoy the insightful tour that could stand on its own as a fine guide to the Greek islands.OLYMPIC WANDERING is an entertaining unique look at the Greek culture that will elate readers with its use of Ulysses to tell about the glorious past and tracking his trek to relate a deep look at modern Greece. Imitation being the greatest form of flatter; this reviewer expects to see similar combos of tale and a travelogue as the pairing at least by a talented writer like Mr. Lundberg makes sense while educating and entertaining.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"Once in a while, a book comes along that makes you *sigh*.OLYMPIC WANDERING is such a book for me. I spent 3 lovely summer months in Greece when I was too young to appreciate the gift I had been given.David Lundberg shows me the Greece I missed. And he makes me want to go back 'home' again.The Ulysses parallel didn't quite click for me, but it's been a long time since I've read the classics, so maybe the subject was just over my head and beyond my reach.When Lundberg talkes about swimming in the inky blue water, I can feel the sun and the salt and I can see the beauty of the Greek coast.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"It became clear to me reading OLYMPIC WANDERING that David Lundberg loves Greece, or maybe I should call it Magna Grecia as he spends part of the book wandering over to Turkey. The best parts of the book are the sections where he describes his own experiences. The less likeable part from my perspective is the retelling of the Homeric tale. I suspect my prejudice lies in the fact that I am a woman, and as a woman, don't think the Greeks had any business attacking Troy because Helen grew tired of her husband (or was this a trumped up excuse for war?).One of my good friends and work colleagues spent many hours in Greece on a succession of trips over several years. He suggested to me that my favorite spot might turn out to be Crete should I ever make the trip. Unfortunately, Lundberg does not spend enough time with Crete, which I would have enjoyed, but rather discusses the spots visited by Ulysses and his ship mates. Another aspect of the book I would have liked to have seen enhanced would have been illustrations and possibly photos. I have a calendar with plenty of photos showing the blue sea and white stucco filled hillsides. To bad the folks who printed this small volume where not more generous with the pictures."},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"I was told to read this book by a friend and enjoyed it thoroughly. I couldn't put it down. The way it mixes in Homer's works, with his own experiences and travels is very original and works wonderfully. Being Greek I can safely say the author got us just right. He seems to love the country and the people. My only negative(ish) comment is that I wanted more, but I guess that can be said about every good book. Highly reccomended and can't wait to read his next book!"},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"This book is a collection of stories and essays about Greece and the Greek character. Much of the first half of the book is a partial retelling of the Illiad in novel form, focusing on the recruitment of Achilles. The remainder of the book is comprised of short descriptions of islands or people, or anecdotes illustrating different facets of Greek culture. After the Illiad chapters, there is no continuous story line or plot; instead, the narratives are laid end-to-end, almost like a verbal photo album.Lundberg has had a long relationship with Greece, having lived and worked there for a number of years early in his career. He is also married to a Greek woman, and returns to the country often to visit relatives and friends. He clearly cares very much for the country and its people and tries to convey some of his feelings in these stories.Lundberg has a very high regard for Homer and his descriptions of Greek character, so rather than try to improve on Homer's themes, he retells some of Homer's best stories in prose, so as to be accessible to general readers. Unfortunately, Lundberg doesn't have enough room in this volume to tell Homer's stories completely, and the transitions between narrating blow-by-blow the adventures of Ulysses and commenting on the history of the stories are not always easy to follow. For those traveling to Greece, this book may provide some interesting insight to understanding the Greek national character."},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"This was an interesting and engrossing book about Greece (including its surrounding islands) which helps connect the historical world of Ancient Greece with the scenery and people found there today. (Reading it with a map or atlas handy would definitely enhance the experience).The first half retells the story of Odysseus and his journey to Troy, with a special emphasis on the sites as we know them today (great for those preparing for a trip to Greece - especially if you're interested in getting a handle on the names and significance of the various islands). The second half emphasizes personal stories of the author's own travels and visits to Greece which bring to life its land, people, personality and culture of Greece.Fascinating and enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"Like the character Homer Thrace, in the classic 1960 movie \\"Never on a Sunday,\\" the American arm-chair philosopher, enamored of the ancient Athenians, and baptized in the waters of Edith Hamiltonian awe for the Grecian ideal, is, inevitably, in for a bit of a let-down when he finally visits Greece. Rather than the serene beauty and Hellenic rationality of Winckelmann or Keats, he finds Athens, a loud, dirty, overcrowded metropolis and the modern Greek, a vaguely oriental (owing to years of Turkish dominance?) and wildly exotic person of irrepressible passions, more Alcibiades than Agathon it seems. Certainly it is an exciting place and an endearing people, but, he wonders, how does it, and they, relate to the Greece he thought he knew from school-days?David Lundberg draws the connection. Tracing the travels of Ulysses --with some side excursions to the sites and sights made famous in Herodotus and Thucydides-- Lundberg takes us through modern Greece pointing out how the rugged land and never-far-away sea continue to shape the Greek character as much today at in time of Homer. We see that character, as individualistic as the thousand or more Greek isles, in the Homeric heroes, in the inventors of democracy, and in the modern Greek on the street (perhaps driving a taxi) ready to hold forth on his individual pet theories. And we see the modern Greek, like Ulysses, ever restless until he rests in his beloved and incomparable Greece."},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"While reading the book I found myself traveling along every page, visiting the Greek islands and walking alongside Ulysses in his long journey. In this journey, I explored the different sides of Greeks and how even today their strong sense of self emerges in their daily lives. The book creates a bridge between the past and the present revealing that Ulysses journey to come back home represents our own desire to attain fulfillment."},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"Three months ago on my trip to Europe I had the good fortune to take along Lundberg's book, OLYMPIC WANDERING. What a pleasure it was to read this travelogue of adventure! It has been quite a while since I started reading a book and did not want to put it down.The first part of the book depicts historic aspects of how (Odysseus) Ulysses tried to find Achilles, a very important warrior for the upcoming war against Troy, and his ten-year peril to return back home to Ithaca after the ten-year war.In part two of the book, it was a joy to follow Lundberg to the various Greek Islands and other parts of Greece, describing in a very personal and unique manner and with such good taste his travels during the years he resided in Greece. On occasion masterfully bringing us back to ancient times in order to bring a point across.OLYMPIC WANDERING is a must book to read!"},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"This story tells of the buildup, and aftermath of the Great Trojan War, as seen the the eyes of Ulysses. Most of the first part of this short, but interesting book, tells of the search for Achilles, a famed warrior of Greece. supposing that they could not defeat Troy without him, Ulysses, and his fellow Greek warrior seek for him, to accompany them on their merry adventure.What the author lacks in detailed description of the many battle scenes(as I'm sure this was his intent-for that you will have to read Homer's Illiad, and Odyssey) he makes up for, in his description of Greece, it's people, beautiful land, and it's gods, and how they fit into today's modern Greek society.The Trojan War is handled in one short paragragh, and Ulysses' adventures on his return home, and battle to recapture his house, wife, and family from ilicit suitors is also glossed over, which is why I gave this book 4, instead of 5 stars. Even so, he directs you to books you can read in greater depth on this subject, and you still find the story interesting, and more than worth your few hours reading time.Indeed, anyone traveling to Greece for the first time, should read this book on the plane, or boat ride over, if they want to get a great taste of the land they are about to embark upon."},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"Professor Lundberg had me from the first two sentence--\\"The gods ordained this country for individualism. The geography demands it\\"--because I wanted to see how he would prove this provocative premise, and he did. His love of Greece--ancient and modern-- comes through on every page and makes one envious of his passion. Kudos, Professor."},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"A combination of travelogue, autobiography, and retelling of Greek history: The first 117 pages of the 195 give the story of Ulysses from leaving Ithaca to returning. The rest is a set of reminiscences that draw a parallel by describing journeys from the Ionian Islands to Turkey and back, culminating in Cavafy's wonderful poem about life as a journey to Ithaca.I think I understood the unifying theme but the book is rather clumsily constructed (as are the Iliad and Odyssey) and the two halves do not form an unity. There are snippets of excellent writing that bring traveling in Greece vividly to life, such as:\\"Satisfied with a day's work scorching the earth, the sun relaxes on the horizon. The light fades, replaced by a soft blue-gray glow. We pull into a restaurant with simple wooden tables under a canopy overlooking the water.\\"On the other hand some chunks of exposition of the obvious are awkwardly crammed in, such as:\\"Many centuries after Ulysses canals were dug across both stretches of land. Today the Corinthian canal connects its gulf to the Aegean Sea. The Suez Canal connects the Eastern Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean.\\"The descriptions of the less well-known Ionian Islands were good. It might be of interest if you're planning a trip there. It's also worth buying if you've never read Cavafy."},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"David Lundberg skillfully blends classic Greek lit with modern culture and brings the country home to travel fans, armchair historians, and literature readers. A delightful blend of old and new, ancient and modern, historical and contemporary that everyone can enjoy, especially those studying The Iliad and The Odyssey in the classroom. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"Just as no one would try to understand the American character without learning about George Washington, it's impossible to understand the Greek character without knowing something of Ulysses.Lundberg adds a third factor, a wife who was born in Greece where he served after graduating from the US Air Force Academy. The combination serves him well; his first sentence sums up the whole meaning of Greece and the USA, \\"The gods ordained this country for individualism\\".Sometimes we best recognize ourselves in the portrait of another; in this book, the rampant individuality of the Greeks within a strong cultural framework presents an interesting parallel to the US. If it's read merely as a travelogue, the book is interesting for anyone planning a visit. But it is more; again and again, without tiresome comparisons being made, it is also a reflection of American attitudes.Democracy in America was built on two foundations; first, that of centuries of English individualism, and second, a study and appreciation of the basics of Greek democracy from the age of Pericles. It is much more than the spirit of 'Zorba' and 'Never on Sunday', Lundberg delves into the Greek love of personal freedom from the Trojan War to independence from Turkey.Even though he is a scholar, he writes with the calm skill and clarity of a friend rather than the precise obfuscation of a pedant. The usual travel books emphasize objects, from ancient monuments to modern taxi fares; this book offers a clear introduction to the spirit and attitude of the Greeks. It is a nice introduction to the 'Iliad' and 'Odyssey', as well as classics such as 'The Greek Way' by Edith Hamilton.Most books emphasize the landscape and monuments and weather and other such abstractions, with the result the depth of insight for many tourists is limited to \\"saw the Acropolis, it was nice\\". Read this and you'll come home with the warm feeling \\"saw the Acropolis, the Greeks are wonderful people\\".And, for those who don't travel, there will be an increased appreciation of America. Think of the fate of this country without 'Ulysses' -- as in Ulysses S. Grant. Lundberg doesn't offer such comparisons; but, this book is likely to unleash any reader's imagination and insight."},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"Before I start let me warn you that Greece is one of the two nations I wish to visit one day. The other nation is Japan. So I'm already kind of a lover of Greek history and culture even before I cracked open the book.Even if I had known nothing about Greece and its people Olympic Wandering would have been a delight to read. The author, David Lundberg, links the past of ancient Greece to the people of modern Greece by telling us the story of Ulysses's travels. But he uses the story to show us the culture and traditions that Greece has held and kept over the centuries. Greece has been able to keep itself together, even with invasions in the form of real armies and the more troublesome invasion of globalization, over those centuries.It is like exploring the roots of the tree. Ancient Greece, and the legends it brought us, hold the seeds of the warm, living Greece of today. Ruins might stand on the hill tops but the people keep the islands and mainland alive by just being themselves.And he can show it to us because he is now a part of it - seeing it through American eyes but with a Greek heart.I enjoyed, more than anything else, the chapters on the Greek people. Having been to Italy and Spain I can picture the warmth from the sun, the calm sea, the home cooked food and the untouched landscape.The book is not just about history nor is it some kind of tour book. It is a dialogue about the soul, the spirit, that makes up Greece and its only flaw is that one can't truly understand the Greece the author loves without one day going there.Get it new or used, but get it."},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"After reading Professor. Lundberg's book it is difficult not to agree with his love for everything Greek! The author has spent much of his adult life in Greece and has a Greek wife, so he definitely knows what he is talking about.After a brief introduction where he describes the impact Greece had on him when he first arrived Professor Lundberg tells us how deeply rooted modern Greek culture is in the ancient Greek culture of the Homeric heroes. The first part of the book is about the hero Ulysses and how he travelled *to* Troy, and in the second part of the book the author and his family follows in the footsteps of Ulysses in modern Greece. Even though a lot has changed over the millenia, the landscapes and the culture are still more or less the same. The sea, the cliffs, the friendly and curious people, the food, the wine, and the fierce individualism of the Greek people.In Greece, in contrast to the rest of the Balkans, history is not divisive, or a weapon. for the Greeks it is a uniter, somehing that makes them comfortable with their own identity. Remember that Greece has a history at least as turbulent as the rest of the Balkans with foreign occupation, war, civil war, military dictatorships, and politicians as corrupt as any! There should be a lesson for us all here.The book is not a travel guide as such, but it will help a traveller who wants to get more than just the standard tourist sights."},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"There are so many reasons to recommend this fine book that it is difficult to pare them down to a simple review. David Lundberg is a fine writer for starters: his prose is perky and eloquent at times and always atmospheric and full of momentum. Given that the technique behind this intriguing exercise is solid, on to the content.How many times do we begin to quote from mythology or reference Greek myths only to end up frustrated that all the duplicitous names between the Greek and the Roman gods get far too tangled to stay on track? The reason for this hesitancy to pick up a book about mythology is that the gods, no matter how well documented by previous historians and writers, remain aloof and defy recall: we simply can't relate to 'polytheism' we think, and thus we miss out on some truly wonderful stories.David Lundberg 'fixes' that with this delicious little book. First, he retells the major portion of the Olympians by making them real. These are no vaporous beings: these are men and women with problems and delusions and uncontrollable habits and consequences. Part One of OLYMPIC WANDERING is a major rerun of Greek mythology. Then, as if that weren't sufficient, Lundberg jumps into the present and re-walks the trails and paths of the gods in a travel book about Greece that is as useful and entertaining, enriching and atmospheric as any of the finest travel writing. Not only does he share his joy for Greece and its people and culture and food etc., but he also imparts that to us as readers like an addictive siren.Usually when reading books that are lightweight my speed of reading is rapid. Reading Lundberg was an intentionally slow process. A rapid read would have left too many morsels unnoticed along the way. This is a terrific way to re-think Greek history and culture - and to dream/plan that longed for trip to this country. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, January 06"},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"This book combines the mythology/history of the Trojan War and Ulysses' attempts to return to his kingdom with the Modern Greek nation and people. The \\"abduction\\" of Helen is the flash point that leads to war between the Greeks and Trojans, but the geopolitical situation made the war inevitable. Troy was in a position where it could control a lucrative trade route to the Black Sea, which was damaging Greek commerce. The Greeks found it very difficult to agree on whether to go to war and who was to contribute, but in the end, they were united enough to send a fleet.As is chronicled in the Iliad, and recounted here in modern terminology, the war was a long one. Lundberg occasionally breaks in with additional material describing what the region is like now. Many Greeks died before Troy fell and those who survived were permanently scarred. Ulysses attempts to return home and his adventures, chronicled in the Odyssey, are also retold using modern terminology. Lundberg describes the regions where he traveled, making educated guesses about the location if he is not certain.The final segment of the book is about the travels of Lundberg through the modern Greek nation. He describes the people, their passions, beliefs and role in the world. It is an excellent explanation of how Greeks view life and the world.It is impossible to understate the role of ancient Greece in the rise of the Western World. While it was not democracy as we know it, the government of ancient Greece was more democratic than any seen in the Western world for centuries. Greece is also where reason and logic first became paramount in the thought processes of humans. During this time, reasoning became abstract and ideas such as the perfect circle became part of mathematical terminology. This book is a joy to read and a modern recapitulation of two of the greatest works of the literature of Western Civilization."},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"David Lundberg has written a remarkable book. OLMPIC WANDERING is a unique work. It first tells the story of Ulysses, a story we all know from our study of Western Civilization. Then, Dr. Lundberg takes his book on the freshest of twists. He traces the journey Ulysses took, except he traces it in our time. As he travels with us around the spectacular land of Greece, the reader is treated to an amazing experience through the eyes of an accomplished gentleman author. The reader sees Greece as it has never before been revealed. While I have not traveled to that region of the world since the millennium flipped, I thoroughly enjoyed David Lundberg's travel memior/historical novel. It is a fanstatic book that I recommend highly for every reader."},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"For me merely the word \`Greece' elicits a fusion of magic with the mystical. An ancient land where gods walked, a country that delicately balances the sensibilities of the east with the west, a topography of stark physical beauty and breathtaking seascapes ---- Greece invades your soul even for those of us who have not personally journeyed there. The sights and sounds of even a before-Christ Greece echo with familiarity in our minds; we see enlightened men and women in snowy chitons and himations debating politics and proving the existence of the gods in effortless eloquence as they craft the bright citadel of Western Civilization without the boost of technology or advise from either the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times. Perhaps not by grand design, the descendants of these quintessential \`Westerners' have carried in their DNA that special synergy of individualism and collectivism that deems their society an experiment that still succeeds today.In his book, \\"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel through Greece\\", David Lundberg explores just this notion, combining his personal enthusiasm for Hellas as expressed through his admiration for his Greek wife and her family with cultural accolades that he can trace back and be attributed to the people of the pre-historic time of Homer.Part one of this slim volume utilizes character-identifying snippets from the Iliad and the Odyssey where Lundberg's retelling of the stories in his own simple and easy-to-follow language, establishes just why Homer's great king of Ithaca, Odysseus (or Ulysses), epitomizes the ultimate human hero for both the Greeks and all of Western Civilization. For Lundberg, Ulysses becomes the archetypal every-Greek male. As the fundamental father, husband, leader, strategist and athlete, he commands the respect and loyalty of the lives he touches, personifying the human spirit at its best---a spirit that Lundberg contends typifies Hellas and its people now in modern times.With little effort, Lundberg unearths this indomitable spirit as Part Two of the book tracks the footsteps of Ulysses, commencing with Ithaca, traversing the Peloponnesus to Troy, meandering through the wine-dark Aegean and wind-blown Mediterranean until finally returning to the legendary home front of the Ionian islands. While escorting the reader on a modern tour of the Greek mainland and its islands, Lundberg comments on issues and sensibilities that face and affect all of us in the modern world, With each venue change the supercritical survival mechanism inherent in the racial makeup of his adopted people becomes more and more apparent as Lundberg discusses their views on globalization, health, drinking, self-identity, Diaspora, hospitality, age-old rivalries, family connections, and unsuppressed emotion. Lundberg enables the reader to see the multi-faceted nature of the Greeks through a filter of clearly and beautifully described Attic light.Not so clear, however is Lundberg's desire to state the theme of each step of his journey in a more concise format. By interjecting numerous anecdotes and sidebars-an unedited by-product of his own infectious fervor for the subject, &#9472; he sometimes confuses rather than infuses his overall idea for each chapter with too many ideas that leaves the reader with less rather than more. Instead of dividing the book into two parts, I would have liked to have read a retelling of each episode of Ulysses' life complete with Lundberg's original dialogue and then, as introduced by a font change, enjoyed his exuberant comparisons and sincere conclusions as exemplified by his present-day observations and delighted participation in this way of life.Bottom line: The author of Olympic Wanderings is privileged in formulating first-hand the delicate and respectful equation of the Greek mindset, weighted heavily with variables of awareness, survival and joie de vivre. Despite some murkiness in theme and format, Davis Lundberg nevertheless undoubtedly and unabashedly displays his love of the Greeks. And so I recommend this book to all who have felt Hellas in their souls and for any who want to interject a little Homer into their quest for archetypal identity."},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"A beautifully written, easy to read, informative book about a unique country. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy every page, I received an education as Dr. Lundberg explores the Greek islands, the gods from the past including the journey of Ulysses, and acquaints us with the people as he time travels from past to present.I want to thank Dr. Lundberg for recommending his book to me via Amazon friends. This is one country I have not visited during my armchair travels with good books and fortunately I obtained it, read it with pleasure, will share it, and highly recommend it to readers who want to enjoy a \\"different\\" type of travelogue of adventure.The portrayal of Greece with its deep blue skies, numerous islands, independent, hospitable and attractive people, and rich history is a masterpiece. I only wish it were a few hundred pages longer!"},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"I must admit that David Lundberg is very descriptive in his words whether describing a simplified story of the Battle of Troy or Greek Culture today. I enjoy the passion he exhibits in describing family and friends who he has encountered while visiting this intriguing of the world. Some of the events in his modified story of Ulysess are quite noteworthy particularly finding Achillies dressed in womens garb.However the connection between parts one and two is a little vague and somewhat off the mark. Lundberg describes the greeks as passionate and emotional yet Ulysess's safe journey home was due to the fact that he keep his emotions in check. According to text earlier in this book, Ulysess was guided to be this way from his father. Lundenberg also gives many anecdotes of many characters who he met whie touring the Greek Islnds. Some he describes more vividly than others. But nowhere does he describe a modern day person in comparison to someone from the days of Ulysess and Hellen of Troy.Those who have a greater appreciation for Greek Culture might have more insight into what Lundberg is trying to say. I would certainly recommend such an audience to peruse this book and the journey may certainly take you someplace special. I certainly could appreciate some parts myself."},{"Title":"Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece","review":"Olympic Wanderings is an excellent travel book. David Lundberg describes in such detail the geography, history, food, and people of Greece in just under 200 pages. I truly felt that I was travelling through the islands of Greece while reading this book. I pictured myself drinking some Greek wine called restina on the coast of Cape Sounion and eating some sweet pastries at a paticcera or sweetshop on the island of Cephalonia. I imagined looking at the beautiful Zante style arches of the buildings on the island of Zakynthos.The first part of Olympic Wanderings is about the life and travels of King Ulysses of Ithaca. Lundberg explains how Ulysses was recruited to fight in the war against the Trojans by King Agamemnon and Menelaus. His wife Helen was captured by the Trojan prince Paris. This is the central conflict of the Trojan War, and I think Lundberg explains this very easily in a way I wish my teachers did.Dr Lundberg spends half his time living in North Carolina and half his time living in Greece, because his wife is Greek and her family still lives there. I think Lundberg makes very interesting observations between the modern people of Greece and the ancient King Ulysses from the island of Ithaca.King Ulysses was a persuasive speaker who was equally comfortable sailing a ship as with working on a farm. He was a true renaissance man capable of doing many things. Modern Greek people are a balanced nation of people who can adapt and work in many different environments. Another interesting parallel between Ulysses and modern Greek people is the idea of having a love of their home. Home is not a singular central location with four walls to a Greek person. The idea of home to a Greek person includes the entire environment around them like the mountains and seas. Another parallel between ancient and modern Greek times is the social climate. The city states in Greece today have an inability to unite and live harmoniously. In a similar fashion, the Greeks and the Trojans fought in ancient times long ago. I also learned that most of the Greek islands were once occupied by Turkey and that the country was torn between the Moslems on the East and the Christians on the West. I hope to travel to Greece someday to experience the beauty of the islands and the fun loving intelligent people David Lundberg discusses in Olympic Wanderings. This is a very entertaining and informative book."},{"Title":"The \\"Canary\\" murder case (Gregg Press mystery fiction series)","review":"Born in 1888, S.S. Van Dine (the pen name of Willard-Huntington Wright) was a noted critic who turned to writing detective fiction following a nervous collapse from overwork. His first novel, THE BENSON MURDER CASE, was a spectacular success, and throughout the 1920s he was considered among the finest writers of the mystery genre.Many regard his second novel, THE CANARY MURDER CASE, as his single best work. Concerning the murder of a popular New York star, the novel presents Van Dine's hero Philo Vance confronted with the \\"locked-room\\" murder mystery to end all locked-room murder mysteries--and discovering that each new fact makes the puzzle seem even more impossible than before. It would also prove among the most influential of his novels, broaching ideas that would later be elaborated by such notable mystery novelists as Agatha Christie.But time has not been kind to Van Dine's work. Van Dine wrote in a very wordy, almost academic style--something quite new and unexpected when CANARY was published in 1927. Unfortunately, once the shock of new wears off, his work reads as dry as dust, as serious and humorless as a scholarly disertation. It was an effect that readers and critics began to realize more fully with each new Van Dine novel, and even by the time of his death in 1939 Van Dine's work was regarded as more tedious than interesting.Van Dine is often compared to England's Dorothy Sayers, who also used a complex and highly literate style and whose detective, Lord Peter Wimsey, was even more artistocratic than Van Dine's Philo Vance. But Van Dine lacked Sayers' gift for making wild complexities, both in plot and language, entertaining--and he certainly never had the energy that Sayers brought to her work. In the end, THE CANARY MURDER CASE is an exceptionally uphill read, one that will interest only hardcore mystery fans who desire to trace the development of the genre. Three stars for historical significance.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The \\"Canary\\" murder case (Gregg Press mystery fiction series)","review":"If you are a fan of murder mysteries, then you must read Van Dine, who was a pivotal figure in the development of that genre. Unfortunately, if you are a longtime fan, this particular story will seem rather feeble. You will guess the general form of the solution very early on. But, it is of its time. When it was written, both the plot and the writing style would have been fresh and original. Now, it is a period piece. It gives fascinating insights into American 1920s society, and shows where the early Ellery Queen came from.Recommended for serious fans of the genre, but don't expect a 'never would have guessed it' moment.[PeterReeve]"},{"Title":"The \\"Canary\\" murder case (Gregg Press mystery fiction series)","review":"S.S. Van Dine's book was The Canary Murder Case was the second in what supposed to be a trilogy. This mystery centers around with the murders of a sexy nightclub singer known as the Canary and her boyfriend.. It was also originally made into a silent movie with Louise Brooks as the Canary, but then the \\"talkies\\" came into being and it had to be reshot using sound.This is another example of the early 20's - 30's mystery with its art deco atmosphere. Philo Vance is a upper crust maven of the arts with a hobby of helping the New York police solve mysteries. William Powell was also in the early movie, but it would be wonderful if the movie be could shown just to Louise Brooks as the Canary."},{"Title":"You Can Do It!

Cheerleading","review":"I think this book is really good for people who continuously tried to be one of the people out on the court.This is the perfect book to start with."},{"Title":"Riverworld and Other Stories","review":"I am an admitted Science Fiction junkie, but as far as the Phillip Jose Farmer &quot;Riverworld&quot; series is concerned, likes and dislikes of a particular genre do not enter into it. I bought the first book in the series, &quot;To Your Scattered Bodies Go&quot; on a whim, and began it suspiciously as I do any new book or author. Before I had finished a single page, I was completely immersed in Farmer's world, and I devoured the book whole within two days. Two days later, I found myselef back at the bookstore, racing to the shelf and praying that nobody had bought the next book in the series.Shortly thereafter, a colleague asked if I had read anything good lately, and I forced the book on him as a fanatic would force a religious text to a prospective believer... and within a week the Riverworld books were tearing through my friends, my family, my girlfriend, and suddenly everyone was buying and reading them, and a whole lot of people were constantly demanding of each other how soon they could borrow the next book in the series, and if delayed, running out and buying a copy.I have become immersed in many many books before - series like Tolkien's Ring Cycle have drawn me deeply into them, but - and I realize that many will consider this blasphemy- I believe the Riverworld cycle to be far superior.I will end this review by addressing the plot of the series, or at least the most basic concept: Everyone (with a few exceptions I will not explain) who has ever lived and died on planet Earth wakes up at the exact same moment, naked as the day they were born, and in the body they posessed at age 25, lying on the banks of a vast and winding river bordered on both banks by towering and unsurpassable mountains.20th century Americans wake up next to pre-historic homo sapiens, next to 14th Century English lords, next to 8th century AD Mongol warlords... The entire spectrum of the human race - EVERYBODY - waking up alive after their deaths, regardless of their religious beliefs, together in this strange land.Through 'Grails', huge mysterious mushroom shaped mechanical devices spaced evenly one kilometer apart down the length of the River, every human need is provided for; food, drink, cigars, liquor and even marijuana - but this planet is not Heaven, nor is it anything as obvious as what one would expect from any hackneyed twilight-zone episode scenario.Ordinary people from all periods of human history are the main characters in these novels, as are famous historical figures like the legendary English explorer Sir Richard Burton, or even notorious villains such as King John Lackland and Herman Goering.As a friend of mine crassly but accurately put it after reading the first book series - &quot;If that stupid Dianetics book could become the basis for a religion, why couldn't this?&quot; - I think I saw the same sentiments echoed in another review on this site, and I don't know about that, but if the concepts Farmer outlined in these novels were a metaphysical reality, I for one would feel better about going to church on Sundays... buy these books and believe; not in a religion, but in ridiculously good writing."},{"Title":"Riverworld and Other Stories","review":"First things first. Phil Farmer is not always the most elegant writer - often, his prose is clumsy and his characters wooden. In all likelihood, you won't like everything you read by him. He's best known for labyrinthine series (Riverworld, Dayworld, World of Tiers) and 'fictional histories' of iconic characters such as Sherlock Holmes, Tarzan & Doc Savage, which may or may not be your cup of tea. Okay, enough with the caveats: on the plus side of the ledger, he's an unduplicable and inspired madman with no fear and no restraints upon his literary curiosity. I can't think of anyone even remotely like him, ever. We desperately need more writers in his imaginative weight-class....he may be audacious and outrageous, but he never shatters taboos simply to shock and tittilate (as so many Celebrated Prose Stylists do), but simply to see what might emerge from behind this or that Forbidden Curtain. This paperback, long out of print (WHY??), is not only my favorite Farmer, but one of all time favorite books by anyone. It's the initial Riverworld novella which preceded the series (which incidentally works beautifully as a standalone work - in fact, it's so powerfully surreal and magical that the subsequent series might disappoint you, as it did me), along with a number of Farmer's most unforgettably deranged short stories, many of which sping from premises which would never have occured to anyone BUT Farmer (i.e., 'The Jungle Rot Kid On The Nod' came from Farmer's asking himself: what if WILLIAM Burroughs, rather than Edgar Rice, had written Tarzan?) Usually, in a collection of this type, the novella is the centrepiece and the rest is filler; here, nearly every single collected work is equally indelible. A couple of these stories -'JC on the Dude Ranch', 'The Leaser of Two Evils', 'The Phantom of the Sewer', and the two mentioned previously- have been etched permanently in my mind since I first read them over 25 years ago. (And though I've read quite a bit of Farmer since then, none of it has ever quite equalled this incredible collection - though there've been some close calls.) I'm sure that among sf aficionados, this early version of RIVERWORLD might be considered a nonessential larval-stage curiosity - there never seems to be a shortage of RIVERWORLD novels in print, and that may be keeping this neither-fish-nor-fowl book locked away in obscurity. But please trust me on this one - RIVERWORLD AND OTHER STORIES is Phil Farmer's single greatest collection/definitive statement, and the world needs to see it back in print as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Riverworld and Other Stories","review":"This is one of the best short stories I have ever read! Five stars on humor, this story is a stand-out in this collection.Prurient, obscene even, Christians should not read this story, but not being Christian myself, J. C. On The Dude Ranch is one of the funniest things ever set to print. Silverberg coulda done Siddhartha vs. Yama with the same plot.This is not an anti-Christ tract, it's just a hilarious albeit dirty story. Satan appears and is properly vilified, Jesus is definately a Good Guy.But Christians probably ought not read this story, unless looking for ungodly targets to be pissed off at."},{"Title":"Riverworld and Other Stories","review":"I like Philip Jose Farmer's works, or at least I thought I did until I read Riverworld and Other Stories. I devoured Dark Is the Sun when I was in junior high, and read the Riverworld series a half dozen times in high school. As an adult, I was amused by A Barnstormer in Oz. So, when I saw Riverworld and Other Stories at a book fair I picked it up, figuring the price (25 cents) was right.Let's start with the non-Riverworld stories first. Several of them are . . . well, there's no other word for it besides obscene. Farmer himself tells us that one of the stories would only published by a hard-porn magazine, and one can see why. These stories must be what the Supreme Court means when they mention \\"the prurient interest.\\" They're not erotic, just vulgar. And yet, as literary exercises they contain a certain amount of morbid fascination. \\"The Leaser of Two Evils\\" and \\"The Henry Miller Dawn Patrol\\" in particular show Farmer's remarkable ability to lose himself in a character's dementia. But is the cleverness worth the obscenity? One can't help but think that such pieces as \\"J.C. on the Dude Ranch\\" (I'd describe it, but I can't) are better left in Farmer's desk drawer never to see the light of day.There are some pedestrian stories, too, including the amusing but uninspiring \\"The Problem of the Sore Bridge\\" which almost features a Sherlock Holmes cameo. It's the image of Henry Miller on the prowl in a nursing home that lingers in the memory, though, not the pedestrian stories.As for \\"Riverworld\\" itself, the story is not, as the packaging suggests, the first Riverworld story Farmer wrote. His own introduction makes it clear that he wrote the stories that became \\"To Your Scattered Bodies Go\\" first. Nevertheless, \\"Riverworld\\" is an appropriate foray into the Riverworld. Tom Mix, a character I never cared for in the novels, is much more appealing here. Most provocative, however, is Farmer's take on Jesus - who finds himself resurrected along the river bank with everyone else. Farmer's \\"Yeshua\\" is a pacifist in the face of senseless violence, a man struggling to maintain serenity when his life's belief has turned out to, perhaps, be false. There was a reference Jesus in Gods of Riverworld; this story fleshes it out. To my surprise, part of me was offended by Farmer's take on Jesus; yet Yeshua should serve to spark healthy discussion over the nature of Jesus, what he really stood for, and what he would make of the way his teachings have been passed down by Paul and two thousand years. Such spiritual examinations are, in my view, nearly always healthy.\\"Riverworld\\" alone makes this collection worth getting and keeping. As for the other stories . . . . I really don't know. Perhaps if one knows going in that one is going to get X-rated material it would be easier to digest. Perhaps not. Either way, except for \\"Riverworld\\", none of these are stories that one would ever want to read a second time."},{"Title":"Riverworld and Other Stories","review":"Another great yarn from Larry Niven. If you like sf, give this classic a try."},{"Title":"Riverworld and Other Stories","review":"While some short story collections form an organic whole that show the author's strong unified vision, others, like this one, present a hodgepodge of varying styles, personae, and quality levels that show the artist to be wild, unruly, and ultimately, out of control. Certainly it is no coincidence that this volume begins with (and is titled after) the powerful short story &quot;Riverworld&quot;, from which grew the series of novels so well known to readers of science fiction and fantasy. In this story, every human being that ever walked the earth is suddenly resurrected along the banks of the million-mile river that winds through this unknown planet. The friendship between Tom Mix and the mysterious Yeshua strikes at the heart of the religious implications of the Riverworld, yielding a truly unforgettable conclusion. But segueing from the sublime to the ridiculous, the remaining stories are considerably less deserving fare, starting off with the shockingly sacrilegious &quot;J.C. on the Dude Ranch&quot;, where the guests &quot;work&quot; the cowboys. While this story certainly makes a strong impression, some readers might find themselves offended by this ribald science-fiction take on the son of man. And after these first two stories, the remainder of the book is utterly forgettable. Very little of it qualifies as science fiction, and many of the pieces seem more like writing exercises than entertainments. For example, &quot;The Jungle Rot Kid on the Nod&quot; is a send-up of William Burroughs writing a Tarzan story. While this may have seemed like a cute enough idea in conception, the result is almost unreadable, and certainly is of no interest to anyone who is not seriously into Burroughs. Farmer also tries his hand at a couple of detective stories, but both &quot;The Volcano&quot; and &quot;The Problem of the Sore Bridge - Among Others&quot; emphasize style rather than substance; no true fan would even consider these detective stories, but rather science fiction fantasies. Perhaps most disturbing are some of the more scatological entries, including the ultimately nonsensical &quot;The Leaser of Two Evils&quot;, the excremental mess of &quot;The Phantom of the Sewers&quot;, and the sadly wacky &quot;The Henry Miller Dawn Patrol&quot;, which details sexual conquests at a retirement home. Farmer is certainly a great talent, but most of this collection shows him at his playful worst. Don't be afraid to give it a miss. And definitely keep this one out of the reach of children."},{"Title":"Riverworld and Other Stories","review":"IF YOU'VE NEVER READ THIS BOOK, SHAME ON YOU.

For basic/intermediate study, this is a book based on old traditional rules.....Not a health study, more a realistic character study....I consider it the best I have in my Palmistry Library."},{"Title":"Revealing Hands: How to Read Palms","review":"5/25/04 Richard Websters &quot;How To Read Palms&quot; was demonstrated in length in his reading of a palm of a 30 year old guy (Pg 258-261) &amp; the palm of a 40 year old lady (Pg 262-265)/both readings were 'pretty stereotype of' as Gail Sheehy ,author of &quot;Passages&quot; discusses in her book &quot;Passages&quot; , 'the evolution of the human from 'childhood through old age'; the rest of the book scrutinized the lines,mounts,span ,length and texture of the hands the palms,the fingers,the thumbs) with an encouragement to the reader to become better a palm reading by reading that of various friends.The most interesting note to me was that the little finger always known as &quot;the pinkie&quot; is referred to as &quot;the Mercury Finger&quot;/the mount on the right hand palm leading up towards the thumb is &quot;Venus&quot;,linking to mounts on the left of the right hand palm of Neptune,Lunar and &quot;Outer Mars&quot; with the fingers next to the thumb linked by &quot;Inner Mars&quot; named Jupiter,Saturn,Apollo,Mercury."},{"Title":"A grand romance: A play","review":"Who is this guy, David Wiltse? I started with his thrillers, which are simply the best, then read Doubles, a play, a very very funny play, then came to Grand Romance, another play and entirely different from any of the other works. It is a very touching memory play, extremely romantic and perfect for a smallish cast and simple set, I would think, but all it has in common with his other works is its excellence. Is there anything he can't write? Why doesn't the world know more about this man--or am I simply late to discover what everyone else knows?"},{"Title":"A grand romance: A play","review":"See my review for A Dance Lesson in paperback, which is the same book, the same listing. I don't know why it's listed twice, but then I don't know why Undercover Blues, which Wiltse did not write, shows the reviews for the excellent Bone Deep, which he did write. Anyway, this is indeed a play, a very touching, funny play about youth and family and sex and prejudice and more. It's very good and seems so different from the thrillers that Wiltse writes that it's almost as if we've got the mystery of who really wrote the Shakespeare canon all over again."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Will Be Better: A True Story of Love and One Family's Triumph over the Horrors of World War II","review":"Out of gratitude to the American people, the author and her husband distributed this book to public libraries at no cost when they published the book in the early 1990's. That is how the book fell into my hands, as I was employed as a librarian at the time. I am happy to see that over the years this book has developed a following of sorts because it has made a lasting impression on me. Before reading the Kaprals' account of their life in Czechoslovakia before, during and after World War II, I was ignorant of the hardships imposed on the Czech population by the Nazis and the \\"liberating\\" Russians. However, I have never forgotten the events that Zdena Kapral vividly described in this memoir of her family and which left me with a deep appreciation of the pervasiveness of the Nazi hostilities. It is easy to focus on the atrocities committed in the infamous concentration camps. This book conveys the reality that much larger populations lived in the shadow of imminent Nazi threat throughout the war and that, for purely geopolitical reasons, some of these populations were then deprived of the expected post-war recovery for decades to come. In doing so, Zdena Kapral's account not only shines light on less familiar history for the typical American reader but also provides insight into the economic challenges confronting Eastern Europe today."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Will Be Better: A True Story of Love and One Family's Triumph over the Horrors of World War II","review":"I received this book as a present, for attending charitable dinner from the local Sokol. I could not put it down after I started reading it. The story moved me especially because my grandparents were immigrants. The fact that this was not just another story but actually Zdena's personal account of events that happened in her life is absolutely awe inspiring. So much pain but so much more love. I strongly urge anyone who is interested in the Czech Republic or any other Eastern European countries to pick this up and give it a read.For all those misinformed conspirists out there that dare to say that there was never a Holocaust should open their eyes and read this book. The victims died in vain if we do not remember them!"},{"Title":"Tomorrow Will Be Better: A True Story of Love and One Family's Triumph over the Horrors of World War II","review":"The book describes the true story of a Czech family from before World War II, the betrayal of the Allies, the Nazi horror, &quot;liberation &quot; by the Russians, the conversion of the country to communism, escape to India, enduring the bloody revolution of India, and finally safety into Australia. The strength of Zdena throughout this, as well as the countless anonymous strangers that fought the evil, makes this one of the most memorable books made. Unlike many books on the holocaust, the family is not portrayed as &quot;victims&quot;, rather as people who combat the surrounding evil in every way possible."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Will Be Better: A True Story of Love and One Family's Triumph over the Horrors of World War II","review":"I have read many accounts of the horrors of WW11 but this one will stay with me for a long time. The author describes vividly what it was like in Czechoslovakia during this period and how horrendous it was for her and her family and her fellow citizens. Not only does she describe this period but she gives a glimpse into her life pre-WW11 and afterward while living in India, Australia and briefly the US where they finally settled. Her bravely and the love within the family makes the book quite moving. I can't imagine living through what she and her family did. It is descriptive and extremely well written. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in WW11 and life in India when it was in upheaval during its fight for independence from GB."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Will Be Better: A True Story of Love and One Family's Triumph over the Horrors of World War II","review":"This book was recommended to me by my brother who had met the author in Arizona. Her great storytelling ability makes this a fascinating read. The details of the horrific events are related from the view of those coping and surviving these ordeals. While it does not whitewash the inhumane treatment, it relates how the love of family, friends, God and country gave moment by moment strength to get through the days and nights. It leaves the reader with hope that no matter what we face, we can endure knowing that somewhere in the future, Tomorrow Will Be Better. Why is this not a movie?"},{"Title":"Tomorrow Will Be Better: A True Story of Love and One Family's Triumph over the Horrors of World War II","review":"Excellent and well-written book. Recommended reading for young adults and older. We must all remember what atrocities were committed in Europe and other countries. It is a testament to the human spirit and the capacity to survive terrible circumstances. This book will become a permanent part of our family's library."},{"Title":"Tomorrow Will Be Better: A True Story of Love and One Family's Triumph over the Horrors of World War II","review":"I am a Czech and my grandfather was a colleague of Alex Kapral in his endeavor of setting up Biochema company in 1930s. I lived in the places described in this book, well I am actually writing this comment from the room where portion of the book happened (Ricky property), now a scout environmental education centre (www.kapraluvmlyn.cz). As other reviewers mentioned the book is written in the very touching way - you can't stop reading. Moreover if you have firsthand experience with the story and you know it is not a made-up novel but the REAL ACCOUNT. The author frames her personal story into real history events thus giving reader unique insight into the life of the whole generation challenged by turmoils of 20th century.And last but not least it is also a story of a couple that came to USA penniless in 1950s and after 20 years of hard work was selling their enterprise (largest world producer of siliconized paper) to a multinational company.Czech scouts also published 5th edition of the book in 2012 (in Czech) under the title \\"Zitra bude lip\\" enriched of authentic family photos and chapters describing charity activities of the Kapral family in 1990s."},{"Title":"The Mayan Design Book (International Design Library)","review":"If you are even remotely interested in the fascinating culture of the Maya than this book will more than peak your interest. It is not a significant historical document, but rather features some of the most intriguing drawings from the mysterious culture. The drawings themselves are masterful black and white details of Maya life. The drawings are a young educators dream, the pictures would make good reproductions for distribution for students to use. For students, the possibilities are endless, but one thing that can be done is use them for a mural or enlarged drawings. While teaching, I used these drawings for that purpose and students created giant posters that they worked on in groups in their FREE time during lunch and later were displayed for festive occasions celebrating cultural heritage. Anyway, the drawings are really nice and bold and full of ideal designs for graphic artists, craftspeople or any type of visual artist to translate into a new work of art. The exotic pictures are not without some written word as the author gives a brief overview of the culture. The book begins with an excerpt from the Mayan book &quot;The Popul-Vuh. &quot; Each page is numbered in English and Mayan for an addional bonus for students. An explanation is given regarding the number system and the complex calendar as well as the omens associated with each day. Many of the drawings come from details in the huge stellae, thoses monuments to a forgotten time found in the remote jungles of places like Tikal and throughout the Yucatan and Honduras. The drawing are rich in detail and some require extensive looking at to &quot;find&quot; all the elements of exotic intrigue. Bits and pieces can be used to create your own design or for an inspiration for something new. A truly fascinating small book with unlimited possibilities for the creative person to unleash their skills."},{"Title":"The Mayan Design Book (International Design Library)","review":"I haven't gotten to this as a project yet but the illustrations are very clear, and I look forward to working with the patterns for a mural project this winter."},{"Title":"Haiku: One Breath Poetry","review":"Intended for young people, this book is fascinating and informative for both students and adults. Wakan gives historical and cultural background about haiku, and explains things to the reader that other writers about haiku take for granted, and sometimes neglect. She explains traditional rules and devices--and their exceptions--one at a time, in an interesting, progressive format. I use Haiku: One Breath Poetry in my teaching, and for my own writing development."},{"Title":"Get Ready! For Standardized Tests : Math Grade 3","review":"This book has concise reviews for grade 2-3 math. It teaches how to get the best result in standardized tests. It is especially valuable for those students who are lack of test taking experience. My child got better scores after applying the techniques, such as choice eliminations.The math problems in this book are a bit easy though. They are not challenging enough for my third grader. My child also uses the free Beestar online math tests (a nice Houston community web site www.beestar.org) for additional weekly practice. His test taking skills learned from this book has been very helpful."},{"Title":"Get Ready! For Standardized Tests : Math Grade 3","review":"Arrived on time; excellent book to prepare kids for the next level in Math."},{"Title":"The Klutz Book of Jacks","review":"A very easy to read book with many illustrations that covers some basic games with Jacks... onies, twoies etc. Easy enough for an 8 year old to read and follow, though not an exhaustive collection of games with Jacks. The included brightly colored cloth bag and lightweight multi colored metal jacks and ball made this a nice and complete gift."},{"Title":"The Klutz Book of Jacks","review":"I originally bought this book for the \\"real\\" metal jacks that were included.All I could find before was some gigantic plastic jacks.As I was teaching my grandkids how to play using the \\"real\\" jacks, I became addicted to playing jacks again!! What fun!Fellow Baby-boomers, listen up...is your eye-hand coordination faltering?? This is a great way to get some of that coordination back!Grandpa is going to teach the grandkids how to play marbles.I see some challenges in jacks and marbles on the playground (backyard)in the very near future! Now where is my favorite \\"shooter\\"?"},{"Title":"The Klutz Book of Jacks","review":"I bought this book from Amazon in used condition but 'like new'. Little did I realize or even think about that it didn't come with the jacks and ball. Now I have to try to find the right size jacks (not jumbo ones) and a ball. I guess you get what you pay for!"},{"Title":"Martha Black : Her Story from the Dawson Gold Fields to the Halls of Parliament (Northern History Library)","review":"This is such a great book about frontier life by a real frontier woman. Her life was amazing. You get such a real sense of what life was like back then told, first had, not by someone else recounting Martha Black's thoughts, but her real words (I love the words of that time!) about her experiences, triumphs and tragedies. If you ever wanted to know what it was like for a middle class white women of independent mind to live in the late 1800's and the early half of the 1900's, both in the US and Canada, then this is the read for you."},{"Title":"Martha Black : Her Story from the Dawson Gold Fields to the Halls of Parliament (Northern History Library)","review":"Martha Black's story showed her love of the Yukon. She was a pioneer in a country that required unique skills and much courage."},{"Title":"Forging the Prairie West (Illustrated History of Canada)","review":"This book is an absolute must-read!!! The story of the pioneers' unwavering impetus to conquer all the elements of the West was very compelling, I thought. When I read of how North American politicians and other citizens were so preoccupied with an easy election victory of William Aberhart and his Social Credit Party, I questioned what all the contention was about. Perhaps they perceived the Social Credit Party as some radical, left-wing party, and sympathizers to the Communist cause. I read this literature when I was twelve, and at that age I felt an odd obligation to study Western history, for some reason..."},{"Title":"Forging the Prairie West (Illustrated History of Canada)","review":"I thought this book was very informative, although I did not find the history of the political parties during the Depression years that interesting. This book is very in depth about the Prairies political and economic history.I became annoyed at how Prairie residents are so arrogant. Toronto will always be the financial capital of Canada, not Calgary, as quoted in this book.Generally I could summarize this book as a story of the Fur Trade, western migration and farming, farmer political parties, and economics."},{"Title":"Poems of the Pearl Manuscript (Exeter Medieval Texts and Studies)","review":"The Pearl manuscript contains four poems (Pearl, Patience, Cleanliness, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight), all generally assumed to be by the same author and all touching on the same themes - specifically, the beliefs of 'orthodox medieval Christianity and... chivalric social morality' as the (excellent) introduction puts it.Probably written by a Northern contemporary of Chaucer, the Pearl manuscript's poems are nevertheless worlds apart from his work: they combine Old English alliterative verse with the kind of rhyming structures that were in fashion on the Continent and down south to create something unique and beautiful.This edition is a very well-presented one, with a comprehensive introduction to the poems, a glossary at the back containing just about all the words in the poems (with line references), and other glosses intelligently placed at the foot of each page of text for the more obscure phrases. It's a system which gives maximum readability and minimum flicking back and forth to check the meaning of words and phrases - ideal for the student."},{"Title":"Immaterial Facts: Freud's Discovery of Psychic Reality and Klein's Development of His Work","review":"Caper's book is a short, easy to understand and delightfully written introduction to Freud and Klein. If you know a lot of psychodynamic theory, it will probably be too basic for you.Caper starts with the &quot;story&quot; of Freud's attempts to find a scientific theory for psychic phenomena. In chronological order, you are introduced to Freud's basic ideas (such as libido, the psychosexual stages, the ego, id, and superego...)Caper follows Freud's development of ideas, showing his struggle to make sense, the caveats of his theories that led him to find new solutions, etc. This makes the read fascinating (it almost feels like you are reading a detective story) and helps you understand the concepts better, since you can see &quot;where&quot; they came from.After that, Caper introduces the work of Melanie Klein, seeing how it complements and expands Freud's work. It studies her approach to the psychology of children and play therapy. For those who do not know Klein, this may be a good introduction, though I would rather recommend a book on her selected papers.I enjoyed reading this book but I would probably not have spent the money if I had not had it for a class. If you are a psych student, there may be better books to spend your money on. If you are not a psych student and just want a fun intro to psychodynamic theory, this is as fun as it gets. If you are a psych student and have money to spare, hey, why not? Caper knows how to write, which is refreshing in a field in which most books have such a dry style that the most fascinating concepts fail to interest you."},{"Title":"The Monkey's Paw","review":"a monkey's paw are supposed to grant three wishes. sounds good. however, it grants them in the most evil way possible. subtle. outstanding plot. great descriptions. excellent setting"},{"Title":"The Monkey's Paw","review":"The book was great and the drama was even better. I could just imagine myself there with Mrs. White beating on the door anxious for her son to return from the grave. But was it just their vivid imagination or did they really hear someone knocking on the door? It is up to the reader to figure that out. If you haven't read the book and think these reviews will help you do a report I advise you to read it. It's not half as bad as you may think. READ IT!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Monkey's Paw","review":"I had always heard that this short story by W.W.Jacobs was one of the great classic Victorian ghost stories. I was recently reminded of it when Stephen King mentioned it in his new e-book, &quot;Riding the Bullet&quot;. So, alas! - I finally got my hands on it, and it is indeed worthy of it's acclaim. A visitor brings a magickal talisman - a monkey's paw - to his hosts' home; the macabre dismembered simian apendage is charmed with the ability to grant wishes. But the visitor who leaves the object with his hosts, also leaves their premises with a strong warning of the outcome of the things wished for."},{"Title":"The Monkey's Paw","review":"In it's few pages, it conveys such fear that it is almost unbelievable.

Even so, it does contain a few gems that make purchase of this title necessary to Thurber fans.The showpiece of this collection is the famous but somewhat over-rated \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,\\" but MY WORLD also includes a number of seldom anthologized pieces that show Thurber's wit at a high-water mark, including \\"The Whip-Poor-Will,\\" \\"A Friend to Alexander,\\" and \\"The MacBeth Murder Mystery.\\" It also includes several examples of Thurber's acid perspective on the battle of the sexes, such as \\"Death in the Zoo,\\" and several memorable examples of his ability to wring laughter from the perfidies of language, such as \\"What Do You Mean, It 'Was' Brilling?\\" and \\"Here Lies Miss Gorby.\\"But the bulk of MY WORLD consists of much less focused material that Thurber casually produced for THE NEW YORKER--pieces which are mildly humorous examinations of everything from French guidebooks to 19th century copies of the English magazine PUNCH. Thurber's clever prose lends such pieces considerable charm, but they are decidedly minor works when compaired with the side-splitting classics found in other collections. Thurber fans, of course, will be delighted by most of it, but newcomers would likely be happier with such collections as A THURBER CARNIVAL."},{"Title":"My World and Welcome to It","review":"This collection of short essays and stories is marvellous. I have carried it with me on every trip I have taken since I first read it. I have my grandfather's copy, which has been on a longtime loan (say, ten years...)

In most instances, I would wholeheartedly agree with Sue Bender's point of view, and appreciate the time and effort she took to become so acquainted with the Amish families and the message she offers. I knew Sue and Richard Bender when I was a student in Berkeley, visited their home a few times and found it and them to be most admirable, as artists and as people. I was inspired by the way they lived their lives. But I agree with numerous other reviewers that there is an annoying narcissism in the telling. Perhaps the inward-looking story of how she was changed as an artist should have been another book or been more fully declared on the jacket."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"It is absolutely unbelievable this woman IS a therapist, by reading her book, she NEEDS one. She relates to clay more than to children or people. Whatever she was looking for in an Amish community, she never found it and translates that to the reader. Don't waste your time with this very poor read."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"HER BOOKS ARE A JOURNEY, YOU CAN FOLLOWHaving discovered Sue Bender's wonderful book &quot;Everyday Sacred&quot;, I found it necessary to read all I could find by her. I followed with &quot;Stretching lessons&quot; and now &quot;Plain and Simple&quot;, far from the chronological order they were written in. However, this does not matter. I wish and hope she writes more.THE JOURNEY WAS BEST FOR ME, FROM DAY TO DAYI find I have a tendency to read her books in small segments. A chapter or section a day. It feels like you are journeying with her this way. I don't know why I did this, but it is a style all three books fell into. Some books are like that. In fact, I plan to reread them all, something I rarely do. They are those kind of books.FAMILIAR THOUGHTSAll of us have ideas that capture our imagination, from a facination with particular types of books, stories, colors, ideas. These are part of who we are. Rarely do most of us delve in deeper to fully pursue the things that facinate us. Sue Bender does.FOLLOWING YOUR PASSIONSIn this book she had been taken by a quilt she saw that was attributed to the Amish. The artist within felt a certain resonance with this quilt each time she saw it. Finally, she felt inclined to uproot her life, if only temporarily to examine the base of this facination; the culture of the people that made it. We all feel this pull, this draw occassionally. Most of us never act on it.REVEALS NOT ONLY THE AMISH, BUT THE AUTHOR AND THE READER AS WELLWhat is particularly gratifying in this book is that not only does she reveal a portion of Amish life, but also her own. You see the author's perspective and her own preconceived notions of what and who the Amish are. She doesn't just visit the Amish once but lives with them at two different times with two different families. Here you can see, they as any other group of people have their own diversity and conflict. But, more so than any other group, due to their exclusivity, there are the tenets by which they live.As all anthropologists that study a culture must quickly find out, when we take time, to truly understand others, their motiviations, what they find important, how they live, only then do we find ourselves.Sue Bender is still looking, but she is a lot closer than most."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"Sue Bender is an artist who first learned of the Amish through their remarkable quilts. Not satisfied to learn about them second hand, she was able through great perserverance to stay with two Amish families. Plain and Simple not only recounts these visits, it also chronicles Bender's own search for meaning, simplicity, and order.Bender's book was first published in 1989 and is considered a classic. It is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"This book took me on a journey through my own everyday life. I really was able to stand back and look at my life through a plain and simple perspective. Happiness is not about reaching a final all-powerful accomplishment; it is about enjoying each experience in life. Each task, thought, and experience is just as meaningful as the next. Only when we begin to make this realization are we truly happy."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"I wanted to read this book because the simple life of the Amish people intrigued me.I wish this lady would have talked more about the Amish.Instead,all you read about is &quot;Me,me,me&quot;.&quot;What am I doing in my life?&quot;Why do I do this/that?&quot; blah blah blah.By the end of the book the reader really doesn't care anymore!It was scarey for me to find out that this woman is a therapist-YIKES!The reason I gave it 2 stars is that (1) When she does talk about the Amish it is interesting (2) It is a short book and a quick read."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"This book was a great book to pick up and read while waiting for children at music lessons.

A book you could read again, and again and come out with something else learned."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"Ok for what it is but this book was really self-centered around Sue Bender and all SHE wanted to say. I wanted to know more about the Amish and their way of life and this book only grazed the surface. It seemed more like a journey through Sue's life moments to me. Maybe I'm too harsh but I wanted to read a book about Sue's impression of the Amish and her living among them NOT how Sue fit into everything, etc. Ugh! I was glad when it was over."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"I've long been fascinated by accounts of the lifestyles and beliefs of the Amish. As a parent, I am often overwhelmed by unease about our culture. It's obvious that consumerism is the machine that's driving some of us off the cliff, but few of us (especially thirtysomething women like myself) know how to avoid feelings that we must be the best--we must have it all, we have to be it all. Hoping for some insight, I read Bender's book.I think what bothered me the most was that Bender's situation between the lines was almost comically present in the book, like watching someone lip-synch to a stuttering recording. I was disturbed that her &quot;resume&quot; as ceramics artist, therapist, and numerous college degrees were offered up more often than, say, specifics about her relationships with her children and husband. SHE is the only person that's affected by her experiences with the Amish. Her &quot;be a star&quot; upbringing, her overachieving, her dislike of housework--all of this is undermined by the tremendous economic and cultural freedom she obviously enjoys. She jets around the country without a thought, and leaving her husband for months at a time never seems to be an issue. A little inner voice tells her to go back to the Amish &quot;to complete the circle&quot;, and baby, she's on the next flight. I feel this is why another reviewer on Amazon commented that Bender sounds like she needs a therapist herself.Her intensity becomes narcissistic because her gaze is focused so strongly on herself. She talks lovingly about the limited choices that Amish life offers when her own life is an amazing example of freedom. She assumes the reader will have patience with her descriptions of the way she works out some of her feelings through her art when she's home--these are by far the most difficult portions of the book. It's almost as if Bender had to add details of how un-Amish she is to improve the contrast between the two worlds.I feel that we need to rescue our children and families as much as we need to rescue ourselves from being so damn driven to have the best, and have as much of it as possible. There are some insights in this book that I thought could touch a &quot;normal&quot; woman's life, but as I said, you have to be willing to ignore the narrowness of Bender's focus. Bottom line: this book is quick read and the form compliments Bender's observations on Amish life, which are engrossing. However, Bender's &quot;Plain and Simple&quot; message would have been more authentic, more believable, and less irritating if she had been able to show how her insights affected someone other than herself."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"This book is a self-centered piece of random musings. It is not about the Amish. It is about the author, and frankly, she's not someone I would really care to meet and discuss important issues with. She spends SO much time on HER thoughts, HER ideas, that one forgets this is supposed to be a book about the Amish way of life. This is not a journey TO the Amish. It is a boring, breathtakingly conceited journey into the author's confused mind. I suggest counseling for her. Her book just plain stinks."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"I don't even know where to start.If she wasn't so (as we are constantly reminded) well-educated and well travelled I would assume that the author just didn't know how to be a gracious guest. Instead of relishing this rare hospitality (Amish families very rarely invite Englisch guests to stay with them) she repeatedly criticizes her first host family (the wife isn't fit enough, the food isn't healthy enough, her room isn't big enough.) Then when a second family allows her to stay with them she thinks that being their guest for two weeks means she has a right to belittle their plans to expand their homestead to included a much needed birthing center for the community.And to top it all off, when she gets home, she's too special to share her experiences with regular people, and now thinks the people who were previously her social peers are like \\"sharks.\\"This book is not worth your time. There are several excellent books that include far more insight into the lives of the Amish and far less over-intellectualized, self-centered, whining and condescension. See \\"Driving the Amish\\" by Jim Butterfield."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"I was expecting to read a book about the Amish. What I read instead was a very self centered book about a woman searching, rather blindly, I felt, for herself.She had very little in the way of insight into Amish life, even after spending a period of time with them. And her inability to get outside of her own head/her own life was not terribly interesting to read.For someone who always longed to be a 'star,' I am sure publishing a book was quite a thrill for her. Shame she used the Amish as a platform for her own ego."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"I thought this book was a sad commentary on the lostness of the author. Though she sought to understand the Amish way of life, she totally missed what it is all about. Maybe it was because the church service was in German or maybe she was so focused on herself that she could not see beyond to the fact that peace comes from a relationship with God. Her final line in the book stated that miracles take a lot of work. I would beg to disagree and say that God is the one who does miracles and therefore they take no work, just faith. This is what Sue Bender missed and is still missing I am afraid. We use Amish textbooks in our home education program, so the insights she shared were not really new to me. I think her description of the Amish is valid, but her understanding is lacking. I would not particularly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"I hadn't taken \\"Plain and Simple\\" off my shelf in ages, so when I just did, I was surprised that I wrote in the margins my reaction to some of what she herself deems \\"a cloyingly sweet, rosy-colored-glasses rendition of my personal fairy tale, with me cast as the frog princess... with my new friends, the gentle, pious, hardworking, unself-conscious Amish, cast as the heroes and heroines.\\" (Page 82).She also describes herself on page 4 as someone who \\"organized her life around a series of black-and-white judgments.\\"If someone is going to understand the Amish from the outside looking in, they cannot be seeing things in black and white, and they cannot be looking through rose-colored glasses. And, perhaps more importantly, they will not get a balanced or nuanced view of them by living with two different families a few weeks at a time.How someone manages to put a culture up on a pedestal and condescend them at the same time, I don't know, but Sue Bender somehow manages that. Take, for example, on page 41 when she wrote about having met Eli: \\"After meeting his chubby wife, I thought he looked as if he had come from a more modern generation that knew being fat wasn't healthy.\\" On page 46 she wrote: \\"To my horror, breakfast consisted of sugared cereal with a dollop of honey and a few teaspoons of sugar added for good measure.... I was living in white sugar heaven. I mostly watched and nibbled on white bread toast, not ready to give up my regime of freshly squeezed orange juice, granola, whole wheat bread, and nonfat milk.\\" And on page 57 she wrote: \\"'Pass the fat, pass the carbohydrates,' I imagine them saying. Each day we picked sweet, fresh strawberries, but before they reached the table, they'd been sabotaged by mounds of sugar.\\" Bender was clearly judgmental about this Amish family's eating habits.Bender goes on to criticize something that she completely missed as one of the few ways that Amish women get to express themselves -- most of them love to own and display pretty dishes. On page 58 she wrote: \\"In their world they chose well, but when faced with a bewildering array of choices in the outside community, they often chose unwisely. In fact, before the 1850s, when they led a spartan and isolated life, their homes were bare, but handsome.\\" [I have written in the margin here, \\"How do you know?] \\"Now with affluence, many homes had fussy china proudly displayed in living room cupboards.\\"Considering Bender is so judgmental about these issues, it is completely off-putting to me that the more hefty issues are glossed over. This is how she dealt with the Amish limiting education to the eighth grade on page 62:\\"The Amish leave school after the eighth grade because they fear further education might lead a person off the path of humility and toward a feeling of self-importance. Even so, every person I met spoke two languages, switching back and forth with ease, and understood high German that was used in the Sunday service, while I, with two master's degrees, remained mute in every foreign land I ever visited.\\"I have written in the margins, \\"By making this comparison, you make the issue of children leaving school so early simply disappear.\\" In the next paragraph, Bender moves on to another subject, by asking Eli why the land is so beautiful.I have written several posts and a paper on my website about this issue, which I happen to feel quite passionate about: Amish and Education, The Ramifications of Wisconsin vs. Yoder, and the full essay on my website: salomafurlong.com.On page 65 Bender remarked about how Amish people looked so similar to one another with their dress. And she wrote: \\"But they could determine in an instant where someone belonged in their structured society.\\"My remarks to these are: \\"This is not always a good thing; it doesn't leave room for that individuality so important to you, when you are assigned a role. Think of the \\"black sheep\\" family in the community. 'Belonging' no longer has the same meaning when you have been cemented into that role.\\" For more on this, I have written a post, which you can read on my blog aboutamish.blogspot.com called \\"Why I Left the Amish.\\"Sue Bender was one of the first people to make the misinformed claim that the \\"running around\\" period is: \\"... the time for teenagers to make a choice. That was what it was about. Making a conscious choice.\\" I have written in the margins, \\"No, no and NO!\\" I wrote quite a few posts about this on my blog: To Leave or not to Leave, That Sticky Wicket, and Rumspringa Revisited.To be fair, Bender did offer one sentence of commentary when she wrote: \\"I might have argued that the purpose of their early training was to indoctrinate them to make that crucial choice.\\" Then she goes on to give statistics about how many Amish people leave and what their retention rates are. So, she basically left that issue dangling, by not going deeper.Bender treats the issue of shunning in a similar fashion:For me it seemed all or nothing. If you followed the rules, you belonged and reaped the benefits of a close-knit community. If you broke the rules, \\"you were on ice at home and in hot water in the community.\\" If I had been able to talk to Eli about shunning, I could imagine him saying, \\"Standards must be met. If you care about your community, then commitment to the rules is important. Otherwise we'd disappear and just melt into the English world that surrounds us.\\" For him it would be a crime not to support his principles.In my estimation, when Bender changes to Eli's point of view, she completely avoids this weighty issue. She is willing to judge them for the food they eat and that they are \\"chubby,\\" but not the far more fundamental issue of how they treat people who decide not to stay within the confines of the community in which they were raised. For my views on this issue, please see my blog posting, Shunning.About the issue of the women's role in the community, she has to be in a hot air balloon to first mention it. She wrote on page 75:When Gerry, the man who introduced me to the Yoders, invited me to join him and two Amish men in his hot-air balloon, I accepted. I was the first woman to go on the trip and was terrified every moment, but I went. From my perspective high up in the air, looking down at the patchwork of green fields, I thought it might be more fun to be an Amish man than an Amish woman.I have written into the margin, \\"And you didn't realize this the first day?\\"Bender goes on to ask these questions: \\"Was Emma jealous of my freedom? Did she think me brazen to be comfortable around men? Was I having such a good time at her expense? [ ] Did my presence in her home make her question her role or the strict rules that governed her life?\\" I have written in the margins, \\"By dangling these questions out there, you don't have to deal with the gender inequality among the Amish.\\"Bender then went on to describe Emma's lack of confidence in the outside world, and how her home was a sanctuary, and how she had a clear picture of \\"the right way to be.\\" Then, in half a sentence, she finally hit on the real issue, \\"It is true she didn't get to choose it...\\" She then glossed over this by describing how Emma doesn't question and how she knew what she did mattered. Bender clearly had an aversion to grappling with the difficult issues.Bender claimed she \\"heard voices\\" about visiting the Amish. After her first visit, she found another family in a different community who would allow her to visit them. She described the desire to belong, but then there is an abrupt shift when she wrote on page 119: \\"Suddenly, while churning butter one day, I knew part of this journey was over. There were no more questions I needed to ask. This seemingly irrational process that had propelled me first to Iowa, and then to Ohio, was finished. I knew it totally, in every cell.\\"Several paragraphs later, Bender described the voice she heard that told her to write down her story. I wrote this in the margin: \\"If this 'voice' is real, and not just a way of justifying this book, it still does not excuse you of the obligation of getting permission from the people you visited to write about them. As it is, you managed to both exploit these people and romanticize them at the same time.\\"Another aspect of this book that would have been more appropriate as an inner conflict, but was externalized -- Bender was very concerned about keeping her options open, and not committing to anything. After her journey to the Amish, which she described as ordered, plain, and simple, [all the things she wished she was] this conflict intensified. She described this in her struggle about putting together a nine-patch quilt on page 136: \\"I worked without a plan -- letting the Amish take over. Just as I was about to sew the individual nine pieces together, I saw that they didn't need sewing. Even that was too much control. If they were to succeed, they had to just be.\\" On the next page she continued this conflict: \\"I'm not going to stitch them together. Nothing is fixed, and there is no right way for them to be.\\"My response: \\"What would be the worst thing that could happen if you sewed together a nine-patch quilt? Would you be committing yourself to something you might want to change later? Then sew another one! Your desire to keep things open-ended turns out to be ambivalent and a lack of commitment to being yourself. Sew it together, for God's sakes! After all, by NOT sewing it together, you are committing yourself to not having a quilt, but rather having fragments of fabric -- what a symbol of life that is!Towards the end of the book, I thought she was getting it when she wrote on page 141: \\"But there is a big difference between having many choices and making a choice. Making a choice -- declaring what is essential -- creates a framework for a life that eliminates many choices but gives meaning to the things that remain.\\"I thought she finally had it, then on the following page, she declared: \\"Life's all about moving your patches around...\\"My response: No, no, NO! It's about the process and product of making a quilt! You cannot move around the birth of a child, marriages, graduations, deaths. They happened at a given time, in a given place. Our experiences and how we respond to them are what shape us. Don't you see? -- endlessly moving around those patches is the same struggle as you started this book with -- having all your possibilities open, and not committing to anything.It seems to me that an unnamed friend had it right when she said [page 88], \\"You love and admire the Amish, but you cannot live like them.\\" [ ] \\"Maybe you can't bear to believe it... It was a personal and almost perverse quest for serenity and simplicity that is not in your nature to achieve. You are an artist, and you can't be contained like the Amish. You're too rebellious.\\"I have written into the margin: \\"Your response?\\" Bender gave us none. Mine can be summed up in one word: Amen."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"I picked this up because I've been fascinated by the Amish for years,and thought it would be lovely to read a firsthand account from someone who had gotten to spend some time in an Amish household.I walked away from this book with the thought that Sue Bender is incredibly narcissistic and overly critical of others. In the beginning she mentioned that she had been brought up to \\"be a star\\". Let me tell you, she seems to think that she is the SUN and everything revolves around her.At one point, she offers to do the dishes in the Amish household. And then proceeds to tell us how doing the dishes is her least favourite domestic chore blah blah blah. What an angel, to offer to wash the dishes by hand for these people who DO IT EVERY DAY.She constantly reminds us that she's privledged and fairly well off and gets all of these amazing opportunities in life and she's well educated etc etc etc.What bothered me most was her criticism of the Amish wife's weight. The first thing she seemed to have noticed was how chubby the wife was. And later in the book, while meeting the Amish husband: \\"After meeting his chubby wife, he looked as if he has come from a more modern generation that knew being fat wasn't healthy.\\"You can do far better than this book if you're looking for firsthand accounts with the Amish. Don't waste your time or your money."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"I bought this book because it was mentioned in another book I was reading. I have always had an interest in the Amish from an anthropological point of view and this was not a disappointment at all. Sue Bender runs across antique Amish quilts and is fascinated by their unique simple designs and bold colors. For years she has her contacts on the look out for more examples of this beautiful \\"art\\" that is so functional. Then she discovers the \\"faceless\\" dolls that Amish mothers make for their daughters. The dolls have no facial features because the Amish proscribe to the \\"no graven image\\" commandment very strictly. She was delighted with the doll sent to her by an Amish woman with whom she started a correspondence. She then decided she wanted to live among the Amish for a time. She was told they would not take her in; however, a small ad in an Amish paper elicited a response from a family willing to have her live with them for a time. So her journey began. Her impressions did not always fit with her romantic illusions of the \\"simple\\" life and she learned much. After several weeks, she goes home to digest what she has learned. Then, she decides to go back and try the experiment again with a different (very different) family. She learns even more. All stereotypes are mostly shattered as she lives with a midwife, her large family and her chiropractor sister and she leaves much richer (emotionally) than when she arrived.I enjoyed this volume very much. It had an excellent layout and is a fast read. The impressions are honest and introspective and Ms. Bender is kind enough to wrap the most important lessons learned into a nine-patch quilt for us at the end. There are many fine ideas we can take with us at the conclusion of the story not the least of which is how much we have in common with the Amish as opposed to how different we are. It's a book I will return to again and again for insight."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"there are, indeed, answers...try reading this book. Its present day American anthropology, and at the least, a personal experience that you'll relate to, and...yes, not relate to. But this book will give you inspiration, and make you question the basics of your own life.This is personal book. A journal. A journey.It has a distinct artist flavor to it, (I highly recommend it to artists or those of artist nature and intensity). Some people won't like it. They'll not understand the culture which is indeed, highly controversial, even amoung those who are close neighbors to the Amish, and yes, even among the Amish themselves. You might be intrigued, however, if &quot;Amish&quot; is something new to you.I grew up in the vicinity of an Amish community that the author describes, and I still visit the area regularly. My family has always deeply appreciated their beliefs, even though my family was from an entirely different culture/religion. Sometimes, many times, we didn't understand...but we recognized that they could create what we couldn't do. My family has many Amish quilts, we've eaten many Amish meals, purchased many of their wares...one of our favorites being one family's delicious Angel Food cakes (all made without electricity). I've seen the Amish plowing their fields, not long after the snow has melted (the last time was 11 months ago), with a team of magnificent horses on a hand-hewn plow that looks like something from a museum (in our culture)...and the scene...yes, so lovely... a scene like a painting that's come to life.... It is easy for people to imagine Van Gogh standing alongside the wooden fence which marks the boundry between horse-drawn plow and automobiles, painting quickly, watching the spirit slowly fade...how long can the Amish avoid technology?I knew of the Amish, before moving to Boston, and now, that, we're here in Silicon Valley. I happened on this book in the bookshop at Pacific Grove, in fact. It seemed to be a peaceful book, suited for my peaceful weekend getaway.It turned into more than that. I could relate to the author's curiousity; I could relate to the Amish from my own vague experiences; I could relate to the book as a journey of finding out how one really feels about our Self in this world that's scheduled within 15-minute segments on a Daytimer. I could relate to the importance of life's experiences that don't always involve the stock market and money.Its an easy read. Nicely experienced after a cup of tea just before bed, where you can privately sigh with a sense of true relaxation.... Yes, (sigh) slow down...read a while, turn off the light and imagine the world you just read about.But...in the morning...well.... How does it all connect? What is this odd formula that causes these small societies to produce many fine pieces of art? (Or is it, in marketing jargon, just a product?) What is it that pulls these people together? What is it that makes them try something seeming too difficult and seemingly too time-consuming? It is worthwhile, as a bottom-line, to... spend time?Enjoy.I'd love to meet the author...even though we have a library of thousands of books, I've only said that about Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, who won the McArthur Award. I have met her briefly. She's wonderful. (She was the advisor to a dear friend of mine at university in NH.)The &quot;air&quot; of the books are somewhat similar.&quot;Plain and Simple&quot; is a good book, especially if you like &quot;journal, diary-type&quot; manuscripts.

Sue prefers to keep most of the information to herself. She does, however, make sure she gets in adequate writing about all of her 'accomplishments' -- and makes apparent her desire to return to her old life of those accomplishments. (Big hairy deal!)

Knowing very, very little about the Amish and certainly never having read about them before, I was fascinated by the glimpses of their lives offered by the author.I believe that the title is incorrect or at least, misleading. From the first pages of the book, I was under the impression that the book was about quilts and the journey with the quilt not a book about the Amish or women in general.I am surprised that so many reviewers were annoyed by Ms Bender. Even though I did not always like what she wrote, I appreciate her frank and honest comments, which at times read like a private diary.Is it necessary to love the personality of an author, or more to the point, may we simply enjoy writing for writing's sake and overlook the personality of the author?"},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"I enjoyed the author's plain and simple narrative and pictures in this book.

The book is largely spent talking about how incredible she is for having completed such a daunting task and is filled with many backhanded remarks regarding Amish communities.

The author makes the complexe Amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at Nickle Mine school into one diminsional Disney characters.

The author shares a journey that is far from simple, because she doesn't know what she wants or what she's looking for. She is suffering in a vortex of her own making, and earmarks of post-modernist angst abound. (Read: Existence without faith. She has no bearings, having forgotten who and what she is amidst the 'freedom' of no religion.) The portions that reveal Amish life and culture are excruciatingly edited; there is so much more we wish she would have shared about them! The bottom line is that this a story of HER journey, not the Amish she explored or thought she was drawn to. In fact, other reviewers are right: Ms. Bender is tiresomely introspective and self-indulgent. Her family barely merits a mention while she trots around trying to find fulfillment--whatever that looks like, because she hasn't a clue. If you're looking for insight on Amish life, you'll get a glimpse here, but only that. Ms. Bender is neither a hero nor an anthropologist, but as a woman sharing her mixed-up confusion and a well-written insight here or there, she is sympathetic and at times, almost enjoyable."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"I loved this little book.

It was pleasantly vivid, especially when talking about amish food habits (heaps of ice cream and all kinds of fattening food).

It is NOT TRUE"},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"Sue Bender's book &quot;Plain and Simple&quot; is a refreshing alternative to the usual Self-Help pap that overwhelms the genre. Instead of telling the reader what to do or what to believe, Bender simply spins out the tale of her journey to the Amish and then reveals the metaphor that the journey created for her own life.This book is not a documentary on the life of the Amish. It is not a psychoanalysis of these people. It is not about which lifestyle is better. It is like reading someone's journal--the entries are personal and intimate. They relate to the author's life and her struggle to find a common ground between the Amish values and the values that her current lifestyle embraces.I found the book to be very affirming of my own values and very thought provoking. As an artist, I was also interested to read about how her artwork changed as a result of this encounter. I applaud the author for having the courage to follow the &quot;still small voice&quot; and then to write about the questions rather than being tempted to write about the answers!"},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"This book was given to me as a birthday gift by a friend with whom I was in business. Unkowingly, this friend, also named &quot;Sue&quot;, gave me the key to relaxation. When things get hectic and chaotic in my life, I read Plain and Simple. From the time I start reading, there is a peace that comes over me and I feel so calm afterwards. The writing seems to put me where Sue was when she was visiting the Amish...the same quiet peace I feel when gazing over miles of farmland dotted with homes with barns and silos - - and no electrical poles! Unfortunately, I am not surrounded by that environment, so reading Plain and Simple brings me there! Having loaned my copy to an elderly friend who was rehabilitating after heart surgery, I waited for her response. She didn't think she could read it since she was having trouble &quot;concentrating on more than a paragraph of anything printed&quot;. I left it with her anyway, and at my next visit, she not only thanked me profusely, but told me she was adding it to her book &quot;gift list&quot;! So, I knew then it was not only me who benefited from the peace of the book. My thanks to the author!"},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"well, folks, 'plain and simple', the title says the book is A WOMAN'S JOURNEY, not a deep portrait of Amish and their lifestyle. It's an introspective book that begins in 1967, although the actual 'journey' doesn't come about until 1982. Women shape society, and society shapes women. If all women were as modest as the Amish, we would never have achieved the right to vote. It takes all kinds to make a world.In terms of pages, the book is less than a half inch thick, so the journey is a 'light read'. Amish history can be found on the internet with ease.It's always amusing to me when people grab a book in haste, find it's not their cuppa tea, and then blame the author entirely for wasting their money. For that mindset, I recommend the public library.This is a mid-life soul-searching little book about One Woman's experience at One point in time. The author makes the point that American society is neither plain nor simple for most of us, and reveals how trying to strike a balance between serenity and ambitious pursuits is never easy. Most of us can't even write a Christmas newsletter that anyone else wants to read, but we're sure qualified to pass harsh judgement on another person's honest little journal.Personally, I found this a nice little book for a winter's night."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"I read Plain and Simple when it was first published in 1991. I can't believe it took me this long to review it. Sue Bender, a Berkeley artist and mother of two with grad degrees from both Harvard and Berkeley, just up and left town one day and went east to spent time with the Amish. Not as easy as it sounds, folks, because the Amish are intensely private people who don't routinely welcome outsiders. Somehow, however, Bender managed to convince two families to take her into the folds of their farming communities in Iowa and Ohio. She was transformed - and in this book that reflects the plain and simple lifestyle of the Simple Folk, she explains why and how this transformation occurred and what it means to her now.Bender had always lived a life of moving from one list item to another, checking things off from the top only to add more at the bottom. The Amish, not unlike the Zen Buddhists, savor and honor each daily task, finding meaning within the most mundane chores. A book as meaningful and beautifully crafted as an Amish quilt, Plain and Simple deserves to be treasured."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"If you are looking for a book on Amish theology, history, lifestyle or agricultural technique; look elsewhere. A five minute Yahoo search will yield you a veritable library of resources compared to this book. Surprisingly, there is ample information online about this oft misunderstood sect of Christendom.The book did have a modicum of useful information, but not enough to warrant the mandatory single star.I found the author's whining fits, pontifications and raging narcissism beyond nauseating. It was with great pleasure that I found myself at the last page.Ultimately, this book serves not as a commentary on the Amish, but rather that of the disaffected Yuppie lifestyle the author is from. What the author found so utterly alien about the Amish wasn't their anachronistic culture, but rather that their of love of God and family exceeds everything else."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"I felt this was an extremely well written and moving little book, and I have recommended it to many friends. In fact, I bought copies and sent them out. It made you stop and think about your own life and how we complicate and prioritize."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"After reading the reviews of others, I want to note that I pick up this book roughly once a year, especially to read its summary, which Sue Bender calls a \\"ninepatch.\\" It captures what she learned from the Amish - lessons that remind me of Wendell Berry's work, which also comments on what might be called agrarian values. The parts of the book that describe her visits to the Amish are clear and well written. The parts that describe her efforts to absorb what she learned may strike some readers as silly. They struck me as an honest account of the difficulties of transcending one's own background, a problem that is certainly not unique to her. That she kept at it, and then took the time to write a useful book on what she learned, is a contribution, and the book is worth owning, both to get a sense of the Amish and to ponder how one might benefit from their approach to life.- John Parman (Berkeley, CA)"},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"I enjoyed reading what little there was about the Amish women but was not at all impressed with Sue Bender and her \\"journey\\". Get a life Sue Bender and leave the Amish alone.Four stars for what little she wrote about the Amish women themselves."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"After a series of shopping excursions leave her captivated with Amish dolls and quilts, affluent American Sue Bender attempts to impose herself on an Amish family in order to use their community as a personal spiritual retreat. The result: A pseudo-spiritual journey culminating in this short, self-indulgent, ethnocentric work.Sue Bender is not an ethnographer, and PLAIN AND SIMPLE is not an ethnography. However, in between vapid musings, Bender devotes about 40% of her pages to accounts of her experiences living with two Amish families for a few months. This is the part of the book that's actually interesting, because the more the ego gets out of the way, the clearer our view of a fascinating culture and community. During her stay, Bender even manages to cast-off a few of her own prejudgments and sterotypes about the Amish people.Although she admits that she expected a prompt spiritual breakthrough, her introspection yields tidy and conciliatory conclusions. She decides that, tragically, it isn't in her \\"nature\\" to be \\"calm\\", then labels this epiphany a triumph.But there's trouble in paradise. Bender's pap analysis of the Amish identifies several \\"paradoxes\\". In science, the emergence of paradoxes tends to indicate a flawed theoretical model, but we shouldn't let something like that get in the way of convenient, superficial interpretations of a multifaceted cultural ethos. I don't think Bender ever wanted to identify or understand the Amish. Because if she did, then they would cease to be a novelty.When she returns from her first visit to an Amish community in Iowa, Bender remodels her kitchen entirely in synthetic materials, then attempts to explain to us how significant and appropriate this was. Years later--but only a few paragraphs after comparing herself to a \\"Zen monk\\"--she finally admits that cultivating a focused, Amish-like calm might actually require some sort of inward, self-actualized change. At least that's something.Mrs. Bender, please grace us all with a follow-up work when you have your next spiritual awakening while hat-shopping in Tibet."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"This is a lovely little book. It is filled with contemplations on the importance of simplicity and balance in one's life.A busy woman who has focused her life on success becomes enamored of Amish quilts. Her admiration is so great that she takes time out from her life to go and live with the Amish. There, she reflects on her own values and comes to realize that the act of doing is as important as the outcome. She also realizes that being a part of something, rather than standing out from others, is a more cooperative and giving way to live.How the author juxtaposes the meaning of things with the sentiment reflected in the quilts is very lovely and meaningful.I highly recommend this book for anyone who has ever had questions about what is important in life and their own core values."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"After Sue Bender forcefully insinuates herself into an Amish home, she proceeds to criticize and judge the family. She comments on their \\"bad choices\\" - chief among them in my view is their decision to let her into their home. She is rude, condescending, preachy and shrill. She eats the family's food and then criticizes both the food and the woman who prepares it for her. She demands fabric for a \\"craft project\\" and then kvetches when her host doesn't respond. She proceeds to purchase 1/8 of a yard from 25 bolts of fabric from a polite storekeeper. I looked up halfway into this book and told my husband \\"God, I hate this woman\\". I hated this book too. The book mostly focuses on the author, not the Amish community that she invades. We learn that the author is self-absorbed and shallow with a healthy sense of entitlement. The author's fixation on the Amish \\"faceless\\" dolls is telling - they represent her void of self-awareness. More disturbing than the book is the biography listing the author as a \\"therapist\\"."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"As published on my blog: (victoriasreadingalcove on Wordpress)I decided before writing this review for my own blog I would glance through a few of the reviews on Amazon to get some idea of what other people were saying. My, my. Sometimes I wonder if I have read the same book!Perhaps it's me, but my viewpoint on the book was 180 degrees from some of the input on this website. I found the book some years ago when I, too, was looking for a different viewpoint, a different way of seeing things. Since there is an artist hidden somewhere inside of me, I was drawn to the description on the dust jacket that indicated the author was first drawn to the \\"idea of the Amish\\" through their art. Most markedly their quilts. Her first introduction to the quilts was in 1967. Sometime later she was struck by another art form of the Amish; faceless dolls. She sought out an Amish woman that would make two dolls for her since they are not something on the open market. By 1982 her personal haunting found an outlet and she arranged to spend some time with an Amish family. It was sometime later that she was able to arrange a second visit in a different community with slightly different personalities and traditions.This is not a book about the Amish per se. It is about a particular person's search to find whatever quality it is that creates this quiet eye of the storm represented by Amish communities and craftsmanship. She chose the analogy of the quilts because she was able to \\"rearrange the pieces\\" of her mental quilt to find the pattern most fulfilling and intriguing to her. The faceless dolls also gave her food for thought and a basis of inner reflection regarding the way she looked at life. Yes, the book is her book, centered on her beliefs, her experiences and her interpretations. That is the point of a personal journey. It is the reader's choice whether or not to join the author on the journey. Her perspectives of the people she shared her time with bear an honest stamp of, \\"Could I do that?\\" And, yet she shows respect for the way they have shaped their lives around a central idea and body of beliefs. I think her quest was to find some central idea or belief to support her life choices. As it happens, she does find the tools. A later book describes her struggle to implement those tools. Conversion experiences are always uplifting but it is a different thing to take that feeling home and incorporate it in your day to day life.I found the book special to my own thought processes and recognized the struggle she had between the life we usually lead and the one that lives quietly within us."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"A great book that helps get priorities in order.

The \\"journey to the amish\\" can help more than you know."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"This is a little story about a woman who goes on a journey of self discovery. If you are hesitant to believe there is such a thing as &quot;self discovery&quot; and describe such actions as &quot;selfish&quot; instead, then this book is not for you. I enjoyed reading Sue Bender's story about her insights while living with an Amish family. What began as an interest in the Amish quilts became an obsession for her. She eventually finds an Amish family in Iowa who is willing to let her stay with them for a summer as a companion for the families aging grandmother. From the very beginning what Sue notices is not so much the obvious differences in clothing, lifetstyle and religion but the way this Amish community had deeper way of just being. Timelessness or being in the moment was something they displayed with each and every activity. &quot;It was as if they had uncovered a way to be in time, to be part of time, to have a harmonious relation with time.&quot; The author comes to re-evaluate the life she has been living and asks many of the same questions we ask ourselves. There are no easy answers in this book, just observations to be read and pondered upon, to enrich and stimulate. What would be our answer to the ultimate question Ms. Bender asks of herself,&quot;Am I a successful human being and not only a success?&quot;"},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"Really have mixed feeling s about this book. I was expecting that it would deal with her experiences amongst the Amish, but the majority of the book in fact consists of her analyzing her experiences and how the experiences have changed her. Others have referred to this has her being \\"self-absorbed,\\" but I wouldn't go so far; it's only natural that such an experience is going to cause a person to question and contemplate, and the author's intention is to express in writing what's going on in her mind. Still, it was a little too much at times, and I wasn't all that disappointed when I finished the book.The one thing that I found curious about her experiences is the mystical justification that she gives for making the effort to live among the Amish. Such things as \\"hearing voices\\" is a time-honoured device used by cranks, crackpots and charlatans to enshroud their motivations in ambiguity, and it's left me wondering what he true intentions were with the Amish. I notice that she has since published several other books apparently of the same \\"spiritual\\" nature."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"Plain and Simple is a little gem of a book. Sue Bender's search for her inner spirit leads her to examine the life of the Amish community.Her journey begins with a simple quilt that catches her eye in a museum. Something about the stark yet vibrant quality of the quilt speaks to her heart. Sue's busy and chaotic life style has taken a toll on her artistic spirit. In the simple Amish quilt she finds the calmness that she wants to capture for herself.Sue arranges to spend several weeks living among the Amish community, going back to the basics of a simpler time. She is surprised to learn that her Amish friends are as curious about her as she is of them. Laughter, love, acceptance and humility are only a few of the lessons Sue learns. Taking those lessons back to her own life style is her challenge.This is one of those books that will remain within easy reach. When I feel my spirit lagging, I'll reach for Plain and Simple to remind myself of the lessons learned in this book."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"I have read and re-read this book several times. It is a lovely story and written very well. It let's us know that everyone is human and in all communities there are good things and not so good things. Take the good and leave the rest.

How wonderful to be able to read about someone else's experience and feel like you are there by their side."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"This book is a very fast read but perhaps a bit misleading in its intentions. Or perhaps it's more that I felt misled about the contents. Either way, this book wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but it is still a nice, quiet little book that discusses the Amish lifestyle and its effect on the author.Sue Bender became fascinated with the Amish way of life during the 1980s and eventually found her way into the homes of two separate Amish families in order to experience more of their culture. She spends a good deal of time explaining how her journey is an analogy for the Amish quilts she admires. While the premise of the book is interesting, Bender lets us know as we read that her fascination is also a personal spiritual journey into more meaning for her own chaotic life. Expecting to find more on the day to day life of the Amish, I was let down when Bender chose to focus more on herself. However, the parts that do describe the Amish lifestyle are objective and well-done, and Bender shares her surprise at the many things the Amish actually can do within their community. Her visits do sound delightful, and she did seem to receive the peace she was looking for.If you are hoping for a book that delves into the Amish community and allows us as outsiders to see and understand the inner workings, this book only partially does that. However, overall it's an interesting little book that is heavy on personal feeling and light on the Amish."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"This is the story of how one woman became interested in the Amish and decided to try and live with them for awhile. It is interesting to read how an outsider would go about getting into this very secretive world. Her experiences are not representative of all Amish - as she says in the book, there are many variations of belief and practice among Amish all across the country. I was surprised to hear about Amish using a telephone, motorized pumps, polyester clothing, running shoes, and plastic, or using store-bought white bread and cereal that is laced with supplements.The author did not have this experience to become Amish and she returns to her normal life, but with some appreciation for simplicity in the modern world. For those who find resonance in such a concept, I recommend reading Barry Schwartz's THE PARADOX OF CHOICE: WHEN MORE IS LESS, for expanded development of that idea."},{"Title":"Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish","review":"I throughly enjoyed this book!

Higgins knows how to get right into the action of a story and move the plot to adventure. He skillfully sets all the elements in place to give a dramatic story with action and conflict.

The Allied leaders want to gain the intervention of the Sicilian Mafia Godfather, Don Antonio Luca, to give the word to the Sicilian people to support the American and Allied efforts. To accomplish this British Professor/intelligence officer, Harry Carter, is sent to a New York prison to seek the help of Gangster, Mafia leader, Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano. Carter pulls Luciano from prison to meet with President Roosevelt who implies that Luciano's parole would go favorably if he helps his country in this matter.Luciano isn't inclined to believe the Don will be helpful but they pick up the Don's estranged Granddaughter, Maria, a Nun and a nurse, to help gain access and for an extra voice for convincing him. Carter, Luciano and Maria are teamed up with two American Rangers, one of whom clearly hates Luciano. They parachute into a small village in Sicily to join with resistance leaders who have to hide them from Nazi troops as they wait to meet with the Don.I thought the characters were well developed for the roles in the story. This story contains elements of intrigue, danger, arrogance, brutality, loneliness, a touch of romance, stubbornness, forgiveness, sacrifice and \`luck.' I was surprised to learn this bit of history where the American President engages the services of the Mafia. I enjoyed the few meetings described between Carter and General Eisenhower and tried to jot down what may have been quotes but I did not find them so they may be part of the fiction. That is one draw back of audio books that you cannot mark a spot to check it later, especially when you are driving.This particular audio book was a production for Book of the Road and was made with a male and a female reader. The male did a good job with the different accents, British, American, German, Russian, Italian. The woman however sounded rather the same for the two important Italian female characters.You don't have to like war stories to enjoy this story.

Tarot card readings are way more accurate than scientific projections.Sounds familiar? Perhaps with movie blockbusters today, all movie-goers would be familiar with the inexplanable facts of life but remember folks, you read it first in the books, one of those books being Higgin's Luciano's Luck.The unusual title is more unusual considering the central character of the story is not really Luciano, a big-time American mafia who was convicted on a bum rap. As the invasion of Sicily looms, the Allies desperately sought the compliance of the Mafia to reduce casualties and win over the Italian troops weary of Il Duce Mussolini. The most widely respected figure in Sicily was of course not the local governor nor the Italian generals nor the German commanders but the illusive Don Antonio, the capo of capos in Sicily. On his word, the whole island would rally behind the Allies, &quot;encouraging&quot; Italian troops to cease resistance and provide passage over inhospitable terrain from the landing beaches to Palermo.But Don Antonio disliked the Americans, just a little less than the Nazis. Only his estranged granddaughter, the Sister Maria, and the famous Sicilian American &quot;homeboy-made-good&quot; Luciano had any hope to gaining the ear of the Don.Harry Carter who slipped in and out of Sicily countless times found himself saddled with the two &quot;persuaders&quot;, dropping into enemy held territories, where not all Sicilians greeted their arrival with full enthusiasm.At the core of the matter, no one really knew how Don Antonio thought, and whether the mission was futile in the first place.Characterisation wise, there was a good range provided, from shepherds to soldiers to airmen. Higgins played out the full range of human emotions, from love to hate, jealousy to bitterness, pride and prejudices. It was a drama of humanity as much as gunfights and subterfuge.With additional work, Higgins could have made the book longer and even more interesting. But it was tricky, and the wrong move could kill the potential of a better book.

Jason Brannon, Eric S. Brown and John Grover have the potential to write something good, but it seems to be, at the moment at least, unfulfilled potential."},{"Title":"Space Stations and Graveyards","review":"What an interesting bunch of stories! Lots of Zombies and Space Ships. Many of the short stories were entertaining. You have witches fighting ghosts, astronauts witnessing the end of the world from space, celebrities dealing with a zombie apocalypse on the way to the red carpet. The philanthropist trying to recreate the birth of Christ was also a good one. Solid stories from some very solid authors."},{"Title":"Space Stations and Graveyards","review":"There are some good short stories in here that explore some interesting concepts. Others are poor and need some more work. All in all the fiction is good and worth getting but the editing is atrocious. This book is riddled with countless mistakes and misprints that should have been picked up by any half competent editor. None of them get in the way of the stories and it is always clear what the author meant. So the book is still worth buying unless little things like \\"petal\\" instead of \\"pedal\\" annoy you. In that case steer well clear of this book."},{"Title":"Space Stations and Graveyards","review":"I was quite disappointed with this collection. After the first three stories, I basically gave up. Interesting concepts that could have benefited a great deal from a really good editor. This stuff really belongs in 12th grade creative writing class."},{"Title":"Space Stations and Graveyards","review":"This is a great collection of short stories by three of the most talented new horror writers out there. It's a new book just out on the market. Eric, Jason, and John offer a terrifying mix of horror and sci-fi. Once I picked the book up, I didn't put it down except once when I had to leave for work, then came home and finished it. Their writing will chill you, some will leave you pondering the possibilities, and some will just leave you sitting there stunned at the outcome. Great book for horror lovers, these guys are going places."},{"Title":"Guide to Owning a Burmese Cat (Popular Cat Library)","review":"Although books about particular cats/pets are rare and appreciated, I'm afraid this book gave me no further insight into my Burmese cat. Perhaps I am asking too much but I expected to find a plethora of special insights into this special breed. I didn't.Especially in modern cat care I felt this book lacking. My breeders says: Fresh meat three times a week; chicken wings (raw) at least twice for dental hygiene, vary the diet, enjoy the peculiarly dog like characteristics of the Burmese. But mabe that's all asking too much - gotta go, Nero is bringing his beloved yellow wash cloth for retrieval...It is hard to criticise a book that describes the best breed of cat on earth. Let's all write one!"},{"Title":"Guide to Owning a Burmese Cat (Popular Cat Library)","review":"I must agree with the other reviewer that this book offers no additional eye-opening facts in respect to owning a Burmese cat... The history section is specific to the breed (but as a new or existing Burmese owner, you'd probably already know this prior to getting one!) & there is one blurb regarding the Burmese characteristic to yowl when they require attention. Beyond that this book could really be for any other cat out there (feed your cat, give it water, groom it,...). It didn't even specify normal size/weight ranges for the breed and what quantities of food to give them as a guideline. So, in my opinion, useless to a new Burmese owner. Also, I was a bit disappointed that all of the photos are only of Sable & Chocolate Burmese (they are all gorgeous, but a few photos of Blues or Lilacs would be appreciated). All in all this book was disappointing."},{"Title":"Guide to Owning a Burmese Cat (Popular Cat Library)","review":"This book is a great starters guide to owning and basic understanding of the history of Burmese cats.

He concludes with some of the better known modern rhetoricians. In between these two chapters he traces the history of the field and the various contributors. Timelines in the chapters enable the reader to see where the content of that particular section fits in the overall scheme. Sources are clearly identified throughout the book. Sidebars are another asset found in each section.The glossary in the back of the book is a ready reference for students seeking to quickly understand a term. Herrick seeks to combine modern example with ancient methodology in some places. Generally speaking this book introduces the subject well. It is clear and comprehensive. I have used with favorable results as a textbook when I was teaching in Massachusetts."},{"Title":"The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction (2nd Edition)","review":"If you have to get this book for a class and you want a less expensive alternative to the latest edition, this may be your answer.

Of the two textbooks that I purchased, I most definitely prefer this one."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"I've been a long-time fan of the Prospectus. For my money, it's the best of the baseball annuals. Probably nothing will ever quite match the old Bill James Baseball Abstracts of fond memory. But if you are looking for thorough and entertaining reviews of every player's performance from the 2007 season along with projections for the 2008 season, you will not find a better book. In past years, the Prospectus often had big time editing problems. This year the writing seems very clean with only a few very minor goofs. Last year there was also an inconsistency between the PECOTA comparables and the text discussion. That problem was avoided this year. Finally, although the book is still about as thick as the Manhattan phone directory, it appears to be printed on higher quality paper, thereby avoiding some of the blurred print that marred last year's book. In short: Buy and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"The new baseball season will soon be upon us, with hope breaking out all over. Those of us who are Chicago White Sox fan see our team starting off even with every other time and hope abounding. What will the season hold? Only 162 games will tell us.This book is one of those compendia that come out each year, providing information on major league baseball players. This has a sabermetric element to it, so those who love statistics will enjoy this work.There are some nice features, including a listing of the top 100 prospects this season, how base running turns into runs, projected leaders in a variety of categories (e.g., they project Ryan Howard to lead in home runs with 44, Albert Pujols to lead in batting average with .327, Jose Reyes to lead in stolen bases with 60, etc.).Those projections are based on a technique called PECOTA, in which players are equated with many other players--past and present--with similar characteristics. Then, that data base is used to project how well the particular contemporary player is likely to do this year. As an example, let's take a look at one team, the White Sox. Many of the Sox' key players are aging, and projections suggest declining performance among such stalwarts as Jim Thome and A. J. Pierzynski. Paul Konerko and Jermaine Dye, on the other hand, are projected to perform in similar fashion to 2007. By the way, one of the nice features is that each player is compared to those whose career statistics define PECOTA. For instance, comparables to Joe Crede include Dave Roberts, Kevin Orie, Tim Wallach, and Tim Hulett. Just looking at comparables is fun! Jermaine Dye is equated with Dave Henderson, Joe Adcock, Jose Canseco, and Juan Gonzalez. Pretty good company (at least for statistics). Paul Konerko is compared with Kevin Millar, Gil Hodges, Jeff Conine, and Eric Karros. The mainstay of the pitching staff, Mark Buehrle, is linked to Ken Holtzman (the old Cubbie!), Greg Swindell, Jim Abbott, and Curt Simmons.Enough comparisons. Another statistic is called VORP, value over replacement player. This statistic is created by assuming that a particular player would be removed from the lineup and replaced by someone of proven quality (the details are too lengthy to be presented in a line or two). The resulting figures are then used to estimate players who will rise and who will decline this coming year. White Sox fans might want to shiver a bit. Mark Buehrle is one of the projected 15 players who will decline the most.A couple other figures to illustrate what the book provides. Jim Thome is expected to see his home run total decline from 35 to 29 and his RBIs from 96 to 79. If you're curious, by the way, his comparator players include Frank Thomas, Willie McCovey, Darrell Evans, and Cliff Johnson--some pretty good company!Anyhow, this is a book that will be a lot of fun for baseball fans. It's a good way to start preparing for the new baseball season!"},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"Not having seen a Baseball Prospectus guide before, I was assuming this hefty guide would be a dry, stat-filled directory. I was wrong. This is a fascinating, readable guidebook. Once you start looking at it you can't put it down. If you buy this, plan to lose many hours of your life reading it.Each team gets its own chapter. An in-depth article covers the team's chances for the season, including recruits, injuries, strategy, even history. Plenty of tables and figures back things up. Each player gets a paragraph about his abilities and prospects for the 2008 season, with a stat table that reviews his past four years and projected numbers for this season. The chapter concludes with a similar analysis on the team manager.At the end of the book are articles on different baseball-related topics, with a list of the Baseball Prospectus Top 100 Prospects.For help in deciphering the statistics, an introductory chapter called Statistical Introduction very calmly and clearly explains what all the terms in the tables mean. For example, it explains that \\"VORP\\" means Value Over Replacement Level, a cumulative stat that estimates total player value over a period of time.I wish there was a book like this for college football! Then when my 'Noles mess up another season, at least I would know why!"},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"This is my third edition of BP, and the book is consistently excellent. The player comments have softened overall across the years, but they're still not without their humor, and the commentary can be tough (e.g. on Al Martin's transgressions). They're getting closer to a good balance on being critical.Team essays are not the garden variety review of offseason moves that are to be found in most preview magazines; rather, they often go into teams' philosophies of building, scouting, development and so on. I find this interesting in thinking about long-term health of franchises and looking forward to the new year.Some of the material can be pretty high level. Past player stats are all translated to a baseline according to league difficulty, park effects and other factors. This can be a little unsettling or annoying at times when you want to know how someone did at a raw level, but there isn't room for everything. Predictions are given as expected numbers.Such presentation probably isn't for everyone, so I'd suggest anyone looking to buy this book for the first time go to their website, http://www.baseballprospectus.com. Check out some of the essays, transaction analyses and such. Be sure to look at the historical EQA cards page, because this also gives an overview of the way they do their translations and present their stats. This will give you the best idea of whether this book is for you.But don't let the stat stuff scare you away. The detailed player comments and team essays alone make this worth the money for me."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"BP remains the standard for baseball annuals, with zillions of player comments both informative and entertaining, and team comments which are generally excellent.They know more about more players than anyone else.Minor quibble: Every year the back cover exhalts BP's predictive prowess and gives examples, yet for some reason the 2001 edition fails to speak of, for instance, the success of the Minnesota Twins and Jeff Kubenka. But that's just marketing, I suppose -- it is a great book."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"There is no better book on the market for the analytical baseball fan or fantasy leaguer. Some people will be put off by the indepth statistical analysis but this book isn't for statheads only.The Baseball Prospectus covers every player you need to know, period, from superstars like McGwire to 25th men like Jay Canizaro. It also covers important minor leaguers all the way down to rookie ball. It gives objective translations of every player's statistics over the last three years and projections of every hitter's real life 2001 stat line.

The essays and player profiles are still chock full of relevant numbers and piercingly well-considered arguments, but this year they are also somewhat...I really don't want to say it...tedious.What was once a light-hearted romp through some serious baseball thinking is now rather dense and dry. I'll buy again next year, but I hope somebody sends them a keg of Lighten-Up.+"},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"Incredible compilation of standard and original statistics developed by the authors to clear away the distractions and focus on who the good players are and why. Exceptional and comprehensive work that includes all major league players as of the end of the previous season and minor leaguers and free agents likely to be on major league rosters at the end of spring training. This work is without peer, but has many who attempt to do so, to be so, and all with equal lack of success."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"I thought bitting humor and brutal honesty were gone once \\"The Scouting Report\\" wimped out and eventually died several years ago, but upon purchasing this book I am delighted to see the return of analysis - in written format - of MLB players and prospects. Zipperheads can get pure numbers anywhere but objective opinions about defense, arm strength and other subjective areas of the game are a rarity. This book is a gem that I hope continues. And continues to be humorous and brutally honest. I haven't seen previous years so I don't know if it's lost anything but my opinion is it still has plenty left. Check out Jack Cust if you think it has no balls left .... then read on for many more examples."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"This is a great book!

Literally you get this book for $15, and compared with the magazines you get for $8, it is a great value. The book is full of stats you can't get anywhere else. Some in particular that I find valuable are the Groundball Percentages and new 'Stuff' rankings for pitchers.They also don't just give you numbers, but supply you with a scouting report on pretty much any player who is likely to play in the majors in the upcoming season including minor leaguers.Easily worth the $15 if you are trying to win a fantasy baseball league."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"The best baseball reference book by far!

The analysis of the teams and players is fantastic!"},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"If you're a thinking baseball fan you need to read this book. It covers every player you've heard of, and most of those you haven't. After reading this book, your next step is to go to their website ... on a daily basis for more of their top notch writing and analysis.Their team articles are insightful, witty, biting and entertaining. I find myself grabbing one of my three copies from my shelf and enjoying them, even if I pick the one that's three years old. How many other baseball annuals can you say that about?Thanks guys...keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"After years of withdrawal symptoms from missing my annual dose of Bill James, I have at last found a substitute. These guys are not always on the nose -- their obsession with positions is a bit limiting to my mind, for one thing -- but they're right a helluva lot more often than they're wrong, and they've already proven themselves prophetic in many instances (for example, the White Sox's migrating back to the middle of the pack and the Mets' collapse). Plus, they're good writers -- not only are their analyses far more cogent than most sportswriters (admittedly, not a difficult task, since most sportswriters, not to mention analysts, can't tell their rear ends from their elbows), but those analyses are great fun to read for aesthetic reasons.Anybody who really cares about the game will love this book."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"I really like the Baseball Prospectus website and I've been buying these books yearly for a few years now. It features pretty decent write-ups and PECOTA projections for most players. I enjoy the books and enjoy looking at the projections for my favorite players (even though I don't think they've ever projected one of my players to have a better year!).I do wish they'd start adding a little more to the book than they already do though. For instance this year they had a pretty decent write ups on fielder's arm values and pitcher counts. It'd be awesome if they'd throw in more than a few extra pages at the end of the book for stuff like this.That being said it's a good book to have fun with while we wait for spring training to wrap up and the real thing to begin. Just don't be THAT guy that decides to quote PECOTA projections as his only legitimate baseball argument."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"The stats and projections are all fantastic. However, I found the essays lacking and the book as a whole didn't live up to my lofty expectations. Next year, I will probably forgo buying the book and just stick with my subscription to the web-site."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"Statheads and fantasy players know that the value of this book is to be found in its statistics and projections for future performances. Anyone playing in a long-term keeper league will benefit by keeping this near them on draft day as they look for prospects to take flyers on. The stats in this book are as good as ever, as is the top-100 prospect list.This edition falls flat in its essays. In the past the essays read like great magazine articles that mixed stats and narrative in a 1:9 ratio. This year's essays are far more statitically driven, and are written in a 3:6 ratio, meaning that the flow of the articles is interuppted frequently by data analysis.This makes the book far dryer than usual, and more of a chore to get through. It's still invaluable as a reference tool, but as entertainment it falls a little short."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"Baseball Prospectus opens up a new world for the uninitiated and continues to inform those of us who've studied the game.

Gone from the 2008 issue, however, are the hidden easter-egg cleverly humorous player commentaries, which, though entertaining, were often insulting. This year's write-ups were pure vanilla, politically correct and seemly cut-and-pasted from player to player.I miss the occasional humorous commentary, like from the 2007 edition on Tony Clark: \\"His 2005 was regal, impressive, and mighty, like the elegance of a trumpet voluntary. His 2006 season was more like a pack of fourth graders playing trombone for the very first time with no instruction during a locust infestation.\\"Granted, too much humor distracts from the purpose of the book, but being absolutely devoid of humor makes it a boring numbers read."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"No doubt the worst of the many attempts to cop the ideas and success of Bill James, Pete Palmer, etc. over the past decade. Cute names and sophomoric humor aside, there isn't a great deal of meaningful analysis here, and if you take the time to go back and look at the previous year's addition, you will see that these guys are wrong a lot more often than they are correct. Their arcane formulas and measurements totally miss the point of something as simple and palatable as Runs Created, and the result is a dull and confusing mass of EqA's."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus: 2001 Edition","review":"Nothing here that you can't glean for yourself if you have a PC and know how to use Excel. Anyone can run numbers and models, and really that's all you get.The \\"writing\\" (purposeful quotes) is painful.Buying this book is no different than putting a match to your money."},{"Title":"The Birth of Britain volume One","review":"This is a very good book for the eariy history of Britain. Fantastic! It covers when the Roman Legions were in Britain & when the Normans came to stay. The most interestering part I thought was coverage of the civil war there & the crusades (King Richard the Lion Heart). The devastion of the Black Death, which killed millions in Britain & the rest of everywhere else. The war of the Roses was very interestering as well as devasting. The volume ends with the discovery & colonization of the New World. A Very good & fast paced history that helps the reader come to learn about & understand the early part of Britains history. A history that eventually led to the British Empire. A place where the sun never set on different parts of it. Great book. Loaded with information! Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Birth of Britain volume One","review":"This is a classic work of historical research. It is a must for any student of English history. It is concise and to the point. I especially enjoy the early centruies."},{"Title":"The Birth of Britain volume One","review":"I was reluctant to begin this one for which I now feel foolish. In my mind, Churchill is so strongly associated with World War II, that though I know he was a historian, I imagined his historical prose would sound like the radio broadcast addresses he made to rally the nation of Britain during the war. I know, I'm really silly. This book is a masterpiece of narrative history. Churchill is comprehensive in his coverage, easy to read and generous with interesting details and connections.This volume is the first in Churchill's comprehensive History of the English Speaking People. This volume contains three books which cover Roman Britain, the age of the Anglo-Saxon Kings and Vikings and finally, the medieval kings of England. Churchill ends in the 15th century with the War of the Roses.Churchill's genius is in placing Britain and the English in the context of the broader theater of Europe while keeping the focus clearly on the lives of the leaders and common people who populated the British Isles.I'd like to note that this is hardcore history. Churchill covers a great deal of ground with names and dates and documentary references that might make it dense to readers not used to reading this style of writing. I've read far more stiff, less interesting and less detailed accounts of similar material, but that doesn't make this &#34;historical fiction like&#34; a la Alison Weir. Never the less, and particularly in the first book on Roman Britain, this is a readable work and well worth reading. To date, I have not read anything that explains and provides as clear a portrait of Roman Britain. Churchill's tales of war are also riveting. Edward I and III's French exploits as well as his tales of the Henry's gave me chills. Perhaps this is where the Churchill I expected comes through - though rather than a voice out of World War II, Churchill is truly a scholar speaking on the nation he loves in a voice for the ages. Good book!"},{"Title":"The Birth of Britain volume One","review":"For those unfamiliar with Churchill, do not dive into this book looking for a university reader in English history. Churchill is a masterful writer and storyteller, and he weaves a tale for over 500 pages of the rise of England - from the pre-Roman times to the rise of the Tudors. Covering nearly 2000 years in 500 pages is a tall order, but Churchill spends adequate time on the major stories of the period. The book reads more like a novel than a scholarly history and the characters can come alive. A nice background on early English history for the &#34;casual&#34; reader."},{"Title":"I Spy: 4 Picture Riddle Books (School Reader Collection Lvl 1: (Scholastic Reader Collection)","review":"My two and half years old girl likes it so much, and every I want to allure her to bed to sleep, I will say read I Spy in bed."},{"Title":"I Spy: 4 Picture Riddle Books (School Reader Collection Lvl 1: (Scholastic Reader Collection)","review":"Great collection of I Spy books in one books.

This is obviously not nearly long enough to give a full accounting of the life of Napoleon, one of the most extraordinary men in all of history. Still, for those readers who may not know much about Napoleon, this book is an excellent introduction. Being broad rather than deep, it covers most aspects of Napoleon's life.If you want a full and deep study of Napoleon's life, read the works of Vincent Cronin or Andre Castelot. If you want a brief overview, Markham's book would serve very well."},{"Title":"Napoleon (A Mentor book)","review":"In his book, 'Napoleon,' Felix Markham traces the rise and fall of one of the most important men in western history. As a biography, Markham sometimes relies too much questionable references, but as a history, 'Napoleon' ranks among the great works on the subject. The reports of the battles and the men who served the Emperor are first rate. One can almost imagine being at Marengo, Austerlitz or Waterloo, or riding alside Ney, Marmont, or Junot. Perhaps some of the most appealing aspects of this book are the accounts of Napoleon's life after his exile to St. Helena and the events surrounding his death. Markham also shows us how the Napoleonic legend helped to shape post-Imperial France.

It does not go into detail and leaves out particularly interesting passages of Bonaparte's carreer, such as some of the battles and in particular Auterlitz.As can be expected, if you have read about Napoleon before, you will be left with a sense of emptiness, as some critical and crucial events are covered in a single paragraph.The only major shortcomming of the book is that it practically ignores Napoleon's relationship with women (Josephine, Marie-Louise)which as we all know is key to understanding Napoleonic history.The book is very well documented and overall presents a very nice introduction to Napoleon. Also, it is easy to read...."},{"Title":"Napoleon (A Mentor book)","review":"Felix Markham's &quot;Napoleon&quot; is a triumph. It's really a whirlwind history if you consider that within the first 100 pages you've seen Napoleon rise from his fairly humble Corsican origins to First Consul. The pace of the book was definetly something that I enjoyed! Markham details the rise to power, the political intrigues as well as the battles and campaigns that have in so many ways defined Napoleon. Napoleon's decline, exile and the rehabilitation of the Napoleonic legend in France are also well covered.The strength of the book is that it's really well written. It's enjoyable to read, very clear and concise. While the biography may be criticized as being pro-Napoleon, I didn't feel he was unduly so, in fact his description of Napoleon as an enigma seems quite accurate and is probably one of the reasons that Napoleon continues to be controversial and of interest. As for the layout, I disliked having the maps at the end of the book, but that is of course a very minor issue.This is definetly a good introduction for anyone interested in learning more about Napoleon."},{"Title":"Napoleon (A Mentor book)","review":"Markham's book on Napolean is incredibly fast paced. Napolean's life could (and often does) fill volumes, but Markham fits it all in a surprisingly small book. I bought this book on a recommendation from a history professor with the intention of quickly filling in a gap of history that I was less informed about. Essentially, it did just that. You could almost compare the book to a large encyclopedia entry. Not that it's bland or dry, but it is informative and sans literary fluff.Overall, however, I enjoyed the book and would definitely would recommend it to anyone seeking to quickly grasp who Napolean was and how his life shaped Europe. A great introduction to this overwritten topic."},{"Title":"Napoleon (A Mentor book)","review":"For an introduction to or a refresher course in the life of Napoleon Bonaparte, readers would do well to invest in Felix Markham's 270-page mini-biography &quot;Napoleon&quot;, published in 1963. Succinct it definitely is, which means that military campaigns requiring a great deal of detail tend to be a little dry, while Napoleon's coronation (depicted by David as one of the great spectacles in the first half of the 19th Century) is covered by Markham in a few brush strokes. The true value of the book, aside from its synopsis of a dazzling history, is Markham's incisive study of Napoleon's personality and the enormous effect he had on his generation as well as those to come. Junot is quoted as saying: &quot;He is the sort of man of whom nature is sparing and who only appears on earth at intervals of centuries.&quot; Napoleon's wisdom as an administrator is set against his occasional brutality, as when he had 3,000 prisoners shot to death at Jaffa or somewhat arbitrarily ordered the execution of the Duc d'Enghien. (It was the latter act that caused Beethoven to cross out the &quot;Eroica&quot; dedication.) Markham debunks some Napoleonic myths, including my favorite that Napoleon subsisted on only four hours of sleep per day, plus power naps. And for those of us who think of Napoleon's rise to power as an unobstructed arc of triumph, Markham reminds us that in the early part of his career Napoleon came more than once under the shadow of the guillotine. There are 38 illustrations and, like the text, they provide a sort of pr&eacute;cis of this extraordinary life. The portraits of Napoleon from the 1790's depict him in dramatic poses, his hair blowing in the wind, very much like a 1940's movie star. These contrast sadly with the St Helena pictures, the ex-Emperor leaning on a spade in his garden, looking tamed and resigned. From triumphant Emperor to tired exile, Felix Markham presents a &quot;Napoleon&quot; that is short but strong."},{"Title":"Napoleon (A Mentor book)","review":"I enjoyed this quick tour through the life of Buonaparte but thought that the number of names and name places within short proximity and also that of annoying italicized nomenclature scattered on every page was suited for a fellow historian but not a lover of literature. Because this book seeks to encompass all of napoleonic history (including in part, military technology, European industry, politics, etc.)inside relatively few pages, the ride jolts quite a bit. There is not a great deal of smooth transition. I believe the author intended that those who would read his work begin at a mutual level of common knowledge about the subject matter.On a positive note, it is a good introduction at a critical assessment of Napolean. It is from at least my limited point of view on the subject, still a grand story. But despite the historical method and criticism, however erudite, there still remains a charm and mystery and one appreciates the extraordinary force of Napolean's personality and his enduring legend all the more. So in the end, it seems almost impossible to write a bad version of an incredible tale. But I suggest starting another place if you are into polished literature. If a beginner historian--a perfect place."},{"Title":"Napoleon (A Mentor book)","review":"Thousands of books have been written on the life of Napoleon (1769-1821) and his world. Your humble reviewer has read many lengthy accounts of the famous French Emperor. Howeverfor a relatively short (319 pages in the Signet Classics edition) biography I always turn to Felix Markham. Markham, an Oxford professor, published his book in 1963. It serves as an excellent introduction to the life and career of one of history's most importer movers and shakers.Napoleon was born in Corsica in 1769. He studied at French military schools; became a career military officers rising to first consul of the French republic and later the Emperor of the French. He was brilliant, hot blooded and one of the great captains of history. Napoleon fought France's many enemies with genius. Among his triumphs werre the battles of Marengo, Austerlitz, Eylau, Ulm and many others. He was deposed following his defeat by a coalition of European powers. Napoleon returned to France from his exile on Elbe. His 100 days of power ended with total defeat by the Duke of Wellington's forces at Waterloo in 1815. Napoleon suffered major defeats in Spain and Russia. The little corporal was wed twice: to the infertile Josephine and to Maria Louisa who bore him a child. The randy emperor had several illegitimate children. He died in exile on St. Helena in 1821. He was an agnostic who was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church by Pope Paul VII.Napoleon was one of the most powerful military leaders of all times. Markham's book should be a handy reference for any student or teacher who wants toe explore a complicated and vital man. Vive la France! This book is one of those tomes which might light the spark in a student of history's mind."},{"Title":"Napoleon (A Mentor book)","review":"A concise but very complete story of his life and times. It almost reads like a novel as you are anxious to see what happens next. It explains the politics very well and provides very good desciptions of the forces shaping history both in France and in the beligerent countries. A lot of learning in a small book. His desription of the Continental System and its results are first rate."},{"Title":"Napoleon (A Mentor book)","review":"This little little book of about 250 pages of tightly pressed print gives a more than sufficient first overlook at this man's life and era. It covers, I believe, all the facets of his life, from family man, through lover, to war titan, politician and emperor. From his Corcegan cultural inheritance to his Saint Helen exile and even the immediate post-Napoleonic times. The story is not entangled as one might expect from having so much to tell about in so reduced a space, but it is lively and amazingly devoid of any bias or prejudice. To the point, giving each important issue its time and space, if however pithy, and moving forward never losing a bit. Perhaps one should expect a little more ink spent on big issues like the great battles, say Waterloo for instance, dealt with in just a couple pages, which could have been done to the detriment of his years on Saint Helen, and rightly so. In my opinion.But overall a very good place indeed to get started on the times and on the extraordinary man known by history as Napoleon Bonaparte. What comes out of the reading of this book is the plain facts and the plain man."},{"Title":"Napoleon (A Mentor book)","review":"This may be a good book on military history. I am not a military historian, so I cannot attest to how sound Markham's research into that subject is. Just know what you are buying. There is almost nothing here about Napoleon as a person, not compared to most other biographies. And the social context which gave rise to Napoleon is not really explored here. I find the first two chapters of the book that deal with Napoleon's genealogy and his early years interesting and well-written. After that the book got too dense and the writing style rather pedestrian. Everything beyond the first chapter of the book is written for a specialist (a scholar who focuses on the 19th century or on military history). At the time of the publication the book received such glowing reviews that I cannot help but wonder what I missed here."},{"Title":"Napoleon (A Mentor book)","review":"I don't know what Felix Markham was contemplating when he decided not to write more about Napoleon's relationship with Josephine. Relegating her to a mere footnote in Napoleon's life was inexcusable.Moreover, one has to beg to differ and ask the question as to why Markham took it upon himself not to dramatize the wars that were fought, the socio-economic situations that developed, Napoleon's personal life, or his psychological makeup?Unfortunately, there just isn't any attention to detail in this book, and a historically charismatic figure such as Napoleon, whose led a sophisticated yet complex lifestyle needs his story to be detailed in the utmost capacity.So, in adhering to this argument, it becomes difficult to fathom that Markham managed to skip to one event after another with no rhyme or reason, which made his lethargic literary attempt very difficult to ascertain, nevermind follow.Markham also drops many names of so-called main players in the story, but manages not to tell you anything about them.I couldn't fathom how Markham had the audacity to write a 304-page book that should have been well over a thousand pages, or several volumes so people who are unfamiliar with Napoleon's exploits can envisage who these historical figures were and their part in shaping history.There wasn't any background information on the secondary players in Markham's account. And insofar as \\"the Battle of Waterloo.\\" Why wasn't there any mention of Nathan Rothschild's banking/insider trading fraud, which gave him controlling interest of the Bank of England? Nathan Rothschild lied to market speculators about the outcome of the battle, promulgating that Napoleon won the war, which caused the speculators to dump their stocks and assets,leaving Rothschild to purchase their assets for pennies on the dollar, making him one of the wealthest entrepreneur in Europe. Also, Napoleon was in debt to the Rothschilds and he ran out of money and that's why he ended up losing the war. Anyone with half a brain knows you need money to win, and Markham left all of this key information out of his account.So, in conclusion, Felix Markham is indeed one of the worst chroniclers of history I've ever come across, and he had no business writing about Bonaparte. It is painfully apparent that he wrote this book for people who are already pretty savvy when it comes to the Napoleonic Wars, and no one (including Markham) can successfully write a historical account of warfare without exploring the causes, the effects, and motivative passions.So I reiterate that this was a lazy/sad attempt, and I strongly recommend reading something else more detailed."},{"Title":"Napoleon (A Mentor book)","review":"Napoleon is probably one of the most widely written about historical figures. There are many differing views about his intentions and ambitions. Markham takes a somewhat 'unclear' point of view when writting about the French Emperor. At times it seems like he is praising Napoleon for one thing or the other and at other times he is criticizing the ' Corsican Orge'. He laudes Napoleon's form of government as being advanced beyond its years yet he draws on unreliable memoirs which denounced Napoleon with impunity. 'Unreliable' memoirs are those which were written by those, between 1815 and 1830, who wished to regain Bourbon favour and be allowed back into prestigious positions. I feel that Markham doesn't give a very lucid explaination for the intervention in Spain or for that matter in Russia. Towards the end the picture drawn in this book becomes more nebulous, and we are given the choice between two uncompromising pictures of Napoleon."},{"Title":"The Jester's Quest (Winds of Light, Book 7)","review":"The Winds of light books are great!

It's a friendly, compassionate world where family is the most important commodity. Laura Haverstock, a thirty-something newlywed in London, has to have surgery at the same time she and her new husband are planning a trip to Scotland with his oldest and dearest friends. Laura has never fit in with the group, in part because they were close friends with husband Alec's first wife. Not wanting to keep him from making the annual trip, she agrees to recuperate in the tranquil home of his Uncle Gerald, a retired Admiral living in Cornwall.Gerald's new wife, Eve, is never one to turn away a stray, so also living on the grounds are her dashingly handsome son Ivan, a free spirted flute player and her infant son, and Eve's former nanny who is growing more senile by the day. In addition to these characters, there is a lonely neighbor nearby and a long-lost daughter who arrives from America via the Caribbean.It isn't long before poison pen letters start arriving and the accusations in them are damning. Could a neighbor be a promiscuous trollop? Could Laura be having an affair with Eve's stepson? Where is all this leading and who is sending the letters? With a touch of Agatha Christie like deftness, Pilcher leads the reader down a garden path and unveils the villain.As in all Pilcher novels, the reader is left uplifted at the end as relationships are strengthened and we can assume that everyone lives happily ever after."},{"Title":"Voices in Summer","review":"This novel is perhaps, my favorite in my much-loved collection of Rosamunde Pilcher books.

So I bought VOICES IN SUMMER, by Rosamunde Pilcher. Here in Brazil she's usually a huge success among women, reason that I can't understand. She's so so, not as excellent as many of her fellow writers. But I liked that book, an a couple of others by this author, because they're simple and sensitive. They touch on a very old and beautiful feeling: the Human heart. Rosamunde Pilcher make up lovely characters. In this book specificaly, I cried because of the death of a dog. The pet was so real to me that I fought against tears not to cry for the death of an imaginary animal, since I didn't cry even when my real one died. But I did.

It certainly gives believers, in this day, a hearty look at what believers went through, the persecution and martyrdom, that was brutally dispensed back then. It was very interesting to hear the dying words of unbelievers; what widespread sorrow and hopelessness existed in their final moments.I'm a fan of history and I can tell you that some of the dates that are cited by Lockyer are way off. For example, it mentions the war with Britain in 1842 (it was 1812) and U.S. president James Buchanan taking office in 1860 (off by a few years). Since these were so obvious I'm sure that other inaccurracies exist elsewhere in the book. I certainly would take care in verifying the information first, before quoting it in public.A special note: There's definitely an anti-Rome bias that would make it tough for some people to get through this book. Although Lockyer mentions Protestant attrocities, he reserves extra criticism for Roman Catholic ones.

Most are exceedingly brief, and piled one upon another interminably, they soon become quite tedious.Much more could have been given if much less had been aimed at. Had the book been limited to 20 or so accounts of notable believers and a similar number of unbelievers, and more details given of the individuals' lives and importance, it would have been far better. A fact compounding the disappointment is that there is no adequate documentation in the whole volume (though there are scatterings of bibiliography mentioning books he drew some accounts from, but even these are very incomplete, none giving publishers or dates).There are a number of factual mistakes in the book as well. Lockyer argues that the apostle &quot;James the son of Alphaeus&quot; is the same as &quot;James the Lord's brother&quot; (p. 50) which is impossible. He makes Lord Byron (p. 104) and Thomas Jefferson (p. 98) Christians (both were notorious unbelievers) and Thomas Paine an American (p. 132; he was English). He says George Whitefield settled in America (p. 58; he never &quot;settled&quot; anywhere), and gives a clearly erroneous date regarding the life of Bunyan (p. 63; possibly a typographical error). Three erroneous dates are found on pp. 100-1: 1842 for 1812; 1860 for 1857; and February 2 for February 12. He erroneously declares that Lincoln was shot in both the back and side of the head (p. 102; back only is correct). He speaks of 15th century Puritan persecutions (p. 147), though the Puritans did not exist until the second half of the 16th century.

He seemed to go out of his way to point out Catholics who died with less than peaceful words on their lips; if he can even be believed, while apparently every person who died in his faith was a saint. He does mention people like \\"Francis of Assisi\\" in positive terms, seeming to deliberately refuse to point out that he was both a saint and a Catholic.

The book certainly would have been far more interesting (to me) if it had focused on studying the many real, fascinating urban-primitive sub-cultures that thrive in the darkness beneath the surface of most large modern cities.Unless you are a Wiccan and are looking for a bizzare, and silly way to \\"update\\" your beliefs to an urban setting, this book will be of little worth or interest to you.Do not waste your money. It's bad enough I wasted mine."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"I purchased this book because my book club was reading it. It looked pretty lame at first. It turned out to have some useful information in it. It is a good resource item to have in your bookcase. I was originally going to take it to the used bookstore when the bookclub was done with it. I ended up keeping it for future reference."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"I wish that I had had a copy of THE URBAN PRIMITIVE before I moved into my new apartment. I would have used some of the cleansing and blessing rituals included here. This is a useful book for Pagans from a variety of traditions; many of the suggested rituals can be adapted for particular paths. The authors also offer very practical advice for urbanites on a budget, such as seeking out goods at thrift shops and junk yards (after invoking the Goddess Skor, of course). A good gift for someone moving away or moving into a new area."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"Someone commented that you can't just make up dieties. Our ancestors made up their deities to explain their world. If they lived in concrete jungles like we do, who's to say they wouldn't have worshiped Skor. We all worship who ever and in what ever way makes sense and feels right to us. This book helped me connect to the spiritual a lot more than the high ceremonial structured rituals of Buckland. Yeah the names of the triple dieties are a little strange and perhaps the offerings are not quite what the Covenant of the Goddess would find \\"appropriate\\" but not all of us have access to the right herbs or robes or chalices. Some of us need reminders that it doesn't matter what we use to practice our magic, it's in the intention.This book is written by real people, living in the real world, working real magic. And as a witch living in the city, I can relate much more to this than just about any other. Scott Cunningham even said it doesn't matter what tools you use, a butter knife can make an excellent athame. Tannin & Raven are just following that philosophy. Anyone who thinks this is silly should get off their moral high horse and \\"practice what they preach\\".An it harm none, do what you will."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"With so many books going over the basics again and again or outlining complicated rituals and spells, I found Urban Primitive to be refreshing and useful. Pointing out the unique problems inherent in urban living and offering magical solutions in plain language, this book won a place in my heart. In addition, the authors took into account the role of body modification and other modern urban rituals that are being used in the real pagan community. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"This is long overdue. Most people get only so far along in the Modern Primitive scene without \\"going native\\". Here is a book that gives excellent and easily followed guidelines for anyone who wants more from their experiences as a Modern Primitve. Combining Piercings, Humor and Good Spirituality, this is a great buy."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"I snapped this book up because it looked like just the sort of book for me: adapting to life outside the woods and learning to practice witchcraft in my apartment instead of expansive backyard. I was pleased with the amount of useful information, such as affordable herbs and materials for spellwork. I was also fascinated by the chart on the magical significance of piercings.Like any book on witchcraft, though, Urban Primitive isn't without its fair share of cheese. The Urban Triple Goddess and God kind of threw me for a loop, as did their continuous praise of trashpicking. Pagans already get a bad rap as it is; we don't need to add \\"dumpster divers\\" to our reputation!If you ignore the goofy bits, though, this book is really useful. It gives advice on the practical things in life: finding and keeping a job/apartment/car/etc, protection from the chaotic energy of a populous city, even working around roommates and close neighbors. Definitely a good investment for your pagan reading collection - just remember to take some of it with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"Wouldn't it be wonderful if all Pagans could afford to live close to nature somewhere out in the country, or at least have a nice big back yard in the suburbs? As a Wiccan I've been lucky enough to have access to some lovely back yards where my Coven could conduct beautiful outdoor rituals. Not everyone is so lucky (Or even so inclined - some city dwellers would be bored silly in the country or the suburbs). What if you find yourself broke and living in the city? Can you still connect with deity? with nature? with other people? Can do you do magic when you don't have money for all those supplies listed in various books? You bet you can. This writer shows you that you can do magick, connect with the spirit of the city, invoke and evoke the gods and goddess of the urban environment and much more! I loved this book and will be keeping it for a reference."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"This book shows that you can take the Pagan out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the Pagan! The Old Ways can live on in the form of new rituals, totems and dieties. As other reviewers mention, you will need to know the basics before some of these chapters will make sense. The Urban Primitive : Paganism in the Concrete Jungle is very practical for the covert believer. Learn how to keep your power and position in the workplace. My house has the occasional &quot;thievery&quot; spirits who take some of my favorite things and hide them for a few months at a time. This book has a chapter about dealing with mischievous spirits such as this, and describes how to banish them. My favorite things about this book include a very full and no-nonsense chapter on protection, and paying attention to the things you find on the street as having possible magical properties for you. You start to gain a better awareness for what the universe has provided to you as tools, and these tools are often free. I loved the observation for example, of how something as common as a fire hydrant can be used to rid us of certain &quot;fires&quot; in our lives such as anger and divorce. The authors suggest that leaving alters to the opposing &quot;water&quot; spirits will balance situations and redirect the energy into one more peaceful. Urban Primitive reminds us of the spirits that live in everything around us, and gives us the tools we need to speak to them. From the streets to the internet, this book will re-ignite your passions to live the religion every day."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"I am one of those fortunate Pagans who is blessed to live in a more natural setting than I used to, but having lived in the city, I did at least expect some creative insight from this book. And was most sadly disappointed.The perspective on the Goddess leaves much to be desired. Referring to her three aspects as 'Squat, Skor & Scram' is not only gaggingly juvenile, it's completely disrespectful. The God's aspects are similarly insulted as they have been renamed, 'Slick, Screw and Sarge'.I'm leaning toward more Traditional Witchcraft these days, but I'm always interesting in learning about a new perspective and do enjoy the diversity of the different Pagan traditions. Also, the cover art for this book really makes an impression. Unfortunately, the content does not fulfill the promise of perspective implied by the cover. Yes, there are sections about piercings, tattoos and other modern/urban activities, but the actual practice (using the term loosely, of course), seems empty and - for lack of a better term - FLUFFY. Like another reviewer, I wondered if some of the content was meant to be taken as humor. It came off as more 'bad joke' than good witchcraft. Humor as written by a 15 year old dull-normal.Then there's the altar set-up with the toy car...oy vey. To place a replica of one's car on the altar for protection energy is a great idea, but to also put gasoline, antifreeze, etc. is lame and completely dangerous, especially considering that candles and incense are also placed there.In order for Pagans to practice a nature religion in an urban setting we do not need to resort to fluff like this. It insults the Goddess & God and cheapens (and could quite possibly damage) our environment(s). I'd suggest instead finding a nice quiet grassy area in which to sit and meditate or setting up a small indoor garden. Even a jog through the park can be a natural, spiritual and uplifting experience. There are lots of ways to commune with nature in an urban setting. Challenge yourself to find your own unique path and style.Save your money. Even at a discount this book is overpriced."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"So your interested in Wicca but live in a city not the country, then you want this. One suggestion though: skip over the chapters on deities and ghosts, that's where the majority of fluff is found.An enjoyable read, if you can read it to get the most out of it and not just take the face value."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"Let me tell you this: I am an experienced pagan. I have been a part of the religion for many years, publicly and privately, and this book is perhaps as dangerous as many of Silver RavenWolf's.My biggest problem with this book is the mixing of good advice and just plain wrong. Using a bit of glass as a ritual athame, the section on city herbs, tatooing, cheap replacements for essential oils/incense, and internal hygeine, as well as the warnings about city energy were excellent bits of advice for urban Pagans, however, the triple God/ess was just plain stupid. Squat, Skor, and Skram? These gods show no level of wisdom, beauty, or grace, nor does the author's descriptions of them. Invoking a Goddess by telling her dirty jokes? And Skram is simply the idea of listening to your \\"gut\\", which can be strengthened with third eye work. And a god exclusively devoted to getting you laid, one that screams at you to do things, and a god that is simply there to lie/smooth talk you out of things? This is kid stuff.My biggest bit of advice concerning this book: take it with a grain of salt. Research other books on this matter first and foremost, and take what works for you. Pagans as a whole disagree with eachother on nearly everything, from ethics to methods and everything in between. In the end it is your choice, but from the perspective of someone who fairly eclectic, this book comes across as a trap for the unwary attempting to wade their way into modern paganism. Raven's book on BDSM however, I enjoyed a great deal more."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"I found this book to be a refreshing change among the cookie-cutter Pagan books on the market. It is a practical, straightforward description of Pagan spirituality in the city. I like the fact that the authors do not steer clear of subjects that are controversial (like blood letting), choosing instead to offer practical advice.What I like about the book is that it has what many others are missing - it explains how to express *your* spirituality, not try to recreate the spirituality of people outside of your culture, environment and time-frame.There are some hokey things I didn't like, like the urban triple goddess and god, as another reviewer already mentioned. I would not suggest that people read about them and adopt them as their own manifestation of divinity, but choose instead to do as the book tells you to do in other places - communicate with the energies around you and accept the ways it manifests on its *own* terms.The topics covered include practical advice on spellcasting, getting the feel for the energies around you, working with them and cleaning up, clothing and body decoration (with a very good description of the various spiritual purposes behind piercings and tattoos), Pagan children, exploring your under world, small list of resources, and much more.In general I think the book is extremely practical and relevant. It does not recreate old religions, or create new ones, nor does it tell you things must be done a certain way. Good read for everyone I think.Medium sized paper back 255 pages (minus index) 19 chapters."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"I liked this book, for many of the reasons that those who gave it poor reviews disliked it.First some disclaimers:1. I'm not a Wiccan. I follow a very different magickal/spiritual path, but I see value in learning insights from other traditions2. I'm a dyed in the polyester urbanite. The raw natural world gives me hives.3. I have academic degrees in folklore, semiotics and mythology and regard things from these perspectives as well as my spiritual experiences.First, to those who object in general to the introduction of \\"urbanism\\" or technology into \\"earth centered religions\\": do you use a knife in your rituals? Metal doesn't grow on trees or lay about waiting to be found. It's manufactured using a very technological process from raw ore. Use a wand? Manufactured too, unless you just point a stick you found at things. It is in our \\"nature\\" as a species (wordplay VERY MUCH intended) to alter our environment through the use of tools. That does not remove the things we make from nature. (Gasoline? Just a long-dead dinosaur run through some tools, my friends. A lot of hard-to-deal-with waste products, but it's basically recycling!). Unless your version of earth-centered translates to going back to an australopicathine level of technology (and if it does, I pity you), you've modified nature to practice your art. And so it should be, as that is our role as a species -- to interact with our world in this fashion (while maintaining respect for the unity and essential sameness of all). That we've been out of balance in the past, implementing our technology without regard for its impact on nature is wrongandshould be redressed. But let's not throw the baby away with the bathwater. (BTW, use soap? Technologist!)However, I do agree with the reviewer who pointed out that you shouldn't have gasoline on your altar if you're lighting candles. Spiritual should not equal stupid.Next, as to the three aspects of god and goddess in the modern environment: I freaking loved them. Why? couple of reasons. First, let's point out that the historical forms of these entities (Diana, Isis, the Horned God, etc.) aren't REALLY their essences. They're representations of principles of masculine and feminine traits and energies that make it easier for people to relate with (whether we believe those essences have an existence independent from ourselves or not). I think most of us don't live in an egyptian-flavored environment, so it's probably easier for us to relate to an urban, modern female archetype than, say, Isis or Hathor (unless you're one of those fantasy-fiction inspired, fluff-bunny, historical reconstructionist/re-enacter types. Which would be silly.)Next, why the hell do you think people worship gods (or in my case bargain with spirits) in the first place??? Certainly we want to express gratitude and admiration for the world they manifest, but we also want their help in our everyday lives! And so did our bucolic ancestors. Praying for a good harvest is less important in my life (and the lives of most urban folks) than praying for the inspiration to get a job/clean my house (Sarge), finding good parking spot when I need one (Squat) or getting laid (Skrew). Different representations of the same essences for different contexts and needs. Simple, really. And doesn't at all prevent one from calling on the historical representations of these entities when their intervention is more appropriate. And, if you think about it, how is calling on the goddess of dumpster-diving different than a hunter-gatherer calling on his/her spirits or gods of hunting to find a straight stick in the forest to make a good spear? Different jungles is the only difference I see...I'm not saying this book should be taken word for word -- some of it I find goofy, but endearingly so. I AM saying that it makes an important contribution to pagan/earth-centered/whatever spirituality -- as our environment has changed so has our symbolism and our daily concerns. As they change, so must our understandings of how universal principles act on us and how we relate to them. The book is a roadmap (or perhaps travelogue) of how the authors did just that. And it should betaken for being just that, as well as inspiration for each reader to start his own trip through the simultaneous realms of city and spirit."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"look, i dont want to be \\"that guy\\", but lets be honest here. i have been practicing magick for, at the time of this writing, about 11 years now. im no master, but i do like to think i have learned enough over the years to recognize books that are not (to put it nicely) necessarily sound in its theory. i do like some of the ideas in principle such as using a cup of a strong herbal tea (one could presume it to be sage tea which i enjoy) as a discrete smudge for ones office. its nice and could work temporarily. however the section on car dragons (yes, i said car dragons) is a little far fetched. to summarize you are encouraged to drive around in circles with incense in your grill waiting for a dragon to fuse itself with your radiator. ok. then, once you have one, you had better take good care of the car or the dragon will get pissed off and leave. WTF? look, if i could afford to take my car to the shop everytime it made a funny noise, i wouldnt be using magick to attract a dragon spirit to the car to take care of it would i? unless i need the dragon to scare off some idiot who wants to leave my car sitting on blocks because i parked in a bad neighborhood its a waste of my time and the dragons- which would probably piss the dragon off more than not changing the oil every 3,000 miles or whatever its supposed to be. moving on to the goddess and god version 2.0 we are offered, i would like to say that these are not new ideas. they are as old as the gods themselves. except for getting a parking space, that is new. yes, the goddess loves you but i dont think getting a parking space is the best use of her time and energy, is it? and screw? WTF is that about? yes \\"all acts of love and pleasure are my rites\\". i dig that. yet i still dont think that the god is overly interested in helping you get a series of random bj's from drunk women at the bar and only recieving tidings of condoms and rubber gloves tied to phone poles and fences in return or some kind of diluted heiros gamos. dont get me wrong, im a thaumaturgy fan, but wouldnt it be more prudent to cast a spell or create an egregore for these functions, not harass the high gods?anyhow, i guess i said my piece. if you want to read it, go ahead there are some decent ideas to work with once you sift through WTF material. if you want a book that is a little more respectable on this subject, check out city magick by chris penczak."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"A little about me: I never take anything I read as gospel. I am not a \\"pagan\\" and I do not identify myself with any particular path. I'm a wandering mystic. I just kind of read everything and take what rings truth in me and assimilate it into my personal belief structure.This book fills a very real need in mystical literature for people like me. I am the sort of person who generally prefers cities over the country (although I do enjoy returning to nature occasionally) and so it is hard for me to connect with very nature oriented pagan literature. When you spend most of your days walking around a city, full of concrete, alley ways, faces, and buildings you don't often run into a babbling brook, or a natural clearing of trees, or a patch of clover. It's just a different world and Raven Kaldera expertly shows that spirituality can be found anywhere, even in a dirty alleyway when Skram whispers in your ear and you notice a shadowy figure a ways away and suddenly feel you should be elsewhere. Why can't cockroaches and squirrels and pigeons be totem animals? Some of my friends respect this book merely due to how perfectly his description of the squirel totem person fits me. LOLThis is not for the average tree-hugging dirt worshiping hippie nature child pagan. This is for those of us who just march to the beat of our own drummer and find spirituality EVERYWHERE we go, not just in the places you'd expect to find it.Give this book a chance. Seriously. This guy has some fantastic ideas even if you don't adopt his beliefs in rote."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"While this book does feature references to three-form deities divided into God and Goddess, it is not appropriate for most Wiccans or those working from a Wiccan background; nor is it appropriate for those who think religion or spirituality need to be taken seriously to be legitimate. This doesn't make it a bad book (it's actually excellent, in my opinion), and it doesn't make people who dislike it bad people; I would also say that the New Testament is not appropriate for Jews, although it is written as dealing with the same deity.This is a book for the sacred fool, the polytheists who incorporate humor into their practice, the pagan on a budget who can't afford (and doesn't want) to practice skyclad in an open field on a full moon night surrounded by silver tools. It's a book for people who-- like me --find carbonated energy drinks to be just as appropriate sacrifices to certain spirits as mead and wine are to others."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"All too often books on magick are set in some utopian rural environment. The reality of it is, most of us live either in cities or suburbs. We don't deal on a daily basis with the gods of woodland and field, we deal with the gods of concrete and mass transit.Kaldera and Schwarzstein have put together a great field manual for the urban pagan. Everything from protecting oneself from the dangers of the city to dealing with the urban gods Squat, Scram, Skor and their consorts.This is a good starting point for the newly-pagan urban dweller as well as an excellent reference for the more advanced practitioner seeking to adapt zir practice to an urban environment.Definitely a keeper!"},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"I actually had pretty high hopes for this book based on the description, mixed with concerns that it was, when all was said and done, published by Llewellyn, whose output has been pretty spotty in quality for the most part.Unfortunately, this turns out to be one of those books that was clearly put out in a hurry to appeal to the teenage goth Wiccan-wannabe crowd. The treatment of what could be an interesting subject is, at best, superficial and, at worst, sketchy and incomplete. There is, for an example, a mention of the possibility of using a \\"warding sigil\\" hidden behind a picture in a frame to unobtrusively protect one's workspace. There is, however, no corresponding mention of what a \\"warding sigil\\", how one is created, how one is used, or anything else having to do with that subject anywhere else in the book.A lot of it is, to be kind, just plain silly, at best.For example, the authors propose a rather different set of threefold gods and goddesses for the urban environment. These include \\"Skor\\", the goddess of dumpster diving, \\"Squat\\", the goddess of parking spaces and \\"Screw\\", apparently the god of one-night stands.The authors advise us that one can, for instance, find a random sexual partner on short notice by asking \\"Screw\\" for what you want, tying a knot in anything made out of latex (a substance evidently sacred to this particular deity) and leaving the knotted object in a random location. If I'd only known this in high school!There are much better books on basic magic available than this one. Try Jan Fries' \\"VIsual Magick\\". You might actually learn something useful, something you won't experience reading \\"Urban Primitive\\"."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"I've been a practicing pagan my entire life (over 30 yrs) and, yes, I'm also a 2nd gen pagan. I read just about any book I can find on paganism in the hopes of not only gaining new insight into my own beliefs, but also finding good \\"beginner\\" books to recommend. I'm especially on the look out for books that help to adapt traditional beliefs/practices into modern living. This is certainly not one of them!! The best one I've read yet is \\"Living the Martial Way : A Manual for the Way a Modern Warrior Should Think\\" by Forrest E. Morgan. A book that should be required reading for most young men, but certainly capable of giving any reader food for thought.The \\"authors\\" start off making broad sweeping generalities about pagans; stating most of us are relatively uneducated, underemployed and therefore need to learn the proper techniques of scavaging which based on this book will border on petty theft. They encourage people interested in becoming a pagan to deface others property by writing \\"magical\\" symbols or words on doorways and stairwells ... It's called graffitti not a blessing. Then they go on to talk about their own personally made up deities of \\"Skwat, Skor & Skram\\" which are insults to the actual deities that oversee those aspects of your life. These \\"authors\\" give all pagans a bad name, and I shudder to think what a newbie or god-forbid a christian fundamentalist would think after reading this pile of manure. Don't we have enough problems trying to be taking seriously by maintstream society without publishing a book that makes us all out to be nothing more then juvenile deliquents??I think I got to the 4th chapter before I just couldn't read anymore of this dribble ...

If you don't want to invoke a dragon to protect your car, do something different, for Hel's sake!I'm not into body mod, myself, but found the section on clothing useful. Besides, temporary tatoos work as well as ink.Using clear, charged vegetable oil to mark public areas with protective sigils is not 'graffiti' as one reviewer suggested. Using already existing graffiti for an altar or personal sigil is preferable to making any more, however.Author Michael Cochrane (Naked Magic) says that if you can name something, you can workWith it. Why can't there be a spirit of parking spaces, trashpicking, The Inner Voice, etc., by whatever name you choose to give it? Incidentally, there's great power in play and humor. Advice to critics: get some.In other words, take whatever you can use, if anything, and leave the rest.For the record, I liked City Pagan, also, even if it wasn't quite the hoot."},{"Title":"The Urban Primitive: Paganism in the Concrete Jungle","review":"Many Pagans are striving to for the spirit of getting back to nature. Within the Pagan community the wooded area of nature is extolled over the vices of the city. Yet if you really think about it most pagans live in the city. In ancient times there Pagan temples developed in big cities not out in forests. This book written by Raven Kaldera and Tannin Shcwartzstein is a survival guide for poor and down on their luck pagans who live in the city. Besides who says cities are so bad after all they are vibrant filled with energy and with lots of people it is very easy for a Pagan to go by unnoticed.In many ways this book functions as a sort of beginners guide for Pagans and magical workers. The first thing a pagan wants to learn about is spells. There are two types of spells one type relies upon your own energy and the other type gets assistance from deity. To do an effective spell you first generate energy. 2)Move the energy to where you want it to go. 3) bounce back effects from the spell.With spell crafting there are two modes of thinking. One is that rituals items are not needed save only their value in unlocking the power from the unconscious. Tools are just props and their power is dependent on what they mean to the user. The second view it that ritual items do give their energy towards a goal especially if you are more ceremonial.The viewpoint in this book is on practicality and tend toward the first mode of thinking in both instances. the authors are really into relying on their own juice to power up a spell. You do not have the ingredients needed for a magical working heck use substitute which they give you enough of.Cannot afford expensive ritual items have no fear substitute can be found in trash dumps and garage sales. Plastic cups can be used for a chalice, plastic knifes for an athame, cigarette buts to represent fire. Salt packets for earth elements and cheap incense for air. Cities and areas within the city have their own spirit. These spirits can become your ally and the authors advise leaving offering. Different and ancient deities can be reached at various places in the city. Go underground ora subway to reach Hades, a library for Athena, Hospitals for Hesceplius. For Aphrodite you can give gift with the expectation of nothing in return to working girls.Contacting the element is rather unique for air obviously leaving offering or requests in the wind can be efective. But their are mini rituals for using the telephone and stereo. For fire turn on a candle or gas stove. For water there are lake and Oceans but also running faucet and land is about anywhere.Contacting the dead is risky business and they do not like to be disturbed. Not all dead people are nice and most of our beloved who have passed on have reincarnated in to another life. It is ok to leave offering for the dead and maybe we can ask blood relative who we had a good relationship with for help.The authors talk plenty about body modification and tattoes. I have a personal bias against that unless done in a cultural context so that rather turned me off. At least they address safety concernsThe authors have developed a paradigm which can be effective in accessing the subconsious if not the super natural. Their totem consists of city animals and what their attributes are. I tend to see myself as a raccoon. They also have a triple Goddess and triple god. Once again their own paradigm. I will let you read more to find out.I found the book interesting and I did pull some useful suggestions from it. Their path may not be for every pagan. Many of us {Pagans are not into body mod and feel that we would rather deal with traditional deities and leave offering in our home. After all Gods can be present anywhere no? Perhaps what I am learning from all this is that the power to change or transform our lives comes from within."},{"Title":"Dirt Rich","review":"Sam Sheridan gets back from the trenches of WW1 and marries his hormone driven girlfriend, Georgia.

In it, Dr. Orlinsky traces the steps of the Jewish people from their early origins in the Fertile Crescent, through Egyptian captivity, the Exodus, the period of the Judges, the Kingdom, the Babylonian exile and eventually to the Restoration.Like many scholars, Dr. Orlinsky dismisses the historical credibility of the supernatural events recorded in the Bible and doubts the direct, personal interaction between God and people. Even so, he affirms the Bible as \\"constituting unusually reliable historical documents of antiquity.\\" This good little book is an easy to read, relatively short survey of the Old Testament.

This book presents the story of an ambitious abbess on the road to sainthood a la Catherine of Siena and her fall from grace as she becomes too powerful for the comfort of her male collegues. It is the story of the making and unmaking of a saint. This is one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Immodest Acts: The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy","review":"In the year 1600, at the tender age of nine, Benedetta Carlini was sent to a nunnery in the small city of Pescia in north-central Italy. What today might be considered cruel and highly unusual was then a way for Benedetta's somewhat well-to-do parents to provide their daughter with protection. After several years at the nunnery which Brown describes as fairly unremarkable, Benedetta began to have a series of increasingly disturbing visions, including being sexually harassed by demons. Sister Benedetta was eventually assigned a companion named Bartolomea Crivelli (also a sister in the convent) whose presence, as the subtitle hints at, would later become problematic for her. Bartolomea's job was to assist Benedetta through her \\"periods of ecstasy,\\" and was present when she supposedly received the stigmata and exchanged mystical hearts with Christ.Naturally, this caught the attention of a Counter-Reformation Catholic Church whose main goal was maintaining a sense of propriety. Two separate people (men, naturally) were set out to Pescia to investigate what was happening. Stefano Cecchi was the first to investigate Benedetta over a number of visits throughout late 1619. Cecchi's main purpose was to ensure that she was remaining within theologically accepted boundaries, which she was extremely conscious of doing, knowing that moving outside of them would have put her reputation, and more importantly her life, in danger. Cecchi, satisfied that Benedetta was not a heretic, left quietly to resume his position as the provost of Pescia. At least for a while, things appeared to return to normal inside the convent.At some time between August 1622 and March 1623, the papal nuncio sent several representatives, led by Alfonso Giglioli, to examine Benedetta's claims again. In 1620, she had become an abbess at the incredibly young age of thirty, but had been deeply troubled by the recent death of her father. The nuncio's representatives proceeded much in the same way as in the earlier set of visits. Their final ruling on Benedetta's case isn't even given until the beginning of the epilogue:\\"The story of Benedetta Carlini is shrouded in mystery for the next forty years. No records exist of the nuncio's pronouncements, and it is only the chance survival of one fragment of one nun's diary that allows us to know the outcome. On August 7, 1661, that nun, whose name has not come down to us, wrote in her diary: \`Benedetta Carlini died at age 71 of fever and colic pains after eighteen days of illness. She died in penitence, having spent thirty-five years in prison'\\" (p. 132).At this point, you might be wondering, \\"And the lesbianism? What about the lesbianism?\\" Its relevance and Brown's discussion of it are extraordinarily fleeting. Bartolomea gave testimony that Benedetta sexually molested her and engaged in frottage with her while possessed by the spirit of a male demon known as Splenditello. While Benedetta and Bartolomea's sexual behavior merits perhaps a few sentences in the book, in the Introduction and peppered throughout the text, Brown discusses how Benedetta used Splenditello's \\"maleness\\" as a foil to explain away her rape of Bartolomea (and according to Bartolomea's testimony, that's exactly what it was). The book remains ambiguous as to whether Benedetta deliberately used her male demon as an excuse, or whether she actually thought he possessed her, but the nuncio's representatives seem unconvinced as they accuse her of \\"pretending\\" to be a mystic, and being a \\"woman of ill repute.\\"One wonders what Brown's motivation was in giving the book such a gratuitous title. The content of the book, a scholarly interpretation of a set of documents couched deep in the State Archive of Florence entitled \\"Papers relating to a trial against Sister Benedetta Carlini of Vellano, abbess of the Theatine nuns of Pescia, who pretended to be a mystic, but who was discovered to be a woman of ill repute,\\" isn't really commensurate with the sensationalism of the title. The book provides an intelligent analysis of a lot of topics, from early seventeenth-century life to cultural assumptions of sex and gender. I almost wished the publishers would have chosen one of those horribly academic titles to give a better impression of what it was all about. I vote for \\"Transgressing Normative Gender Identities Through Self-Conscious Afflatus in Renaissance Italy.\\" But then someone's going to pick it up thinking that \\"afflatus\\" means something dirty. Sometimes you just can't win."},{"Title":"Immodest Acts: The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy","review":"This book is a fabulous depiction of the Italian nun, Benedetta Carlini, whose drive for ambition in the Catholic church drove her to get the help of her lesbian lover to create the illusion of stigmata. Through this, she moves to new heights of power and respect in the church and brings money and fortune to the church...but upon accusations and scrutiny, she's brought down to pay for her ambition. The story is a tenderly told one. It has feminist elements and deals with the desperate desire of spoils, along with a not-so-pretty picture of the Church."},{"Title":"Immodest Acts: The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy","review":"I read a lot about this period in history so this book was a bit out of the ordinary but interesting."},{"Title":"Immodest Acts: The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy","review":"This is the true story of a mother superior named Sister Benedetta Carlini and another nun from a small village near Florence in 17th century Italy who basically liked to rub bodies together in bed until they reached orgasm. This if course was a big no-no if you're a nun sworn to chastity. People found out and there was a trial in which the private sex life of these two nunnies was exposed. The scandal made them both lose their reputations. This is one of the earliest and most sensationalistic accounts of lesbian love on record. The fact that it was between two nuns makes it just that much more shocking and intriguing.(...)"},{"Title":"La Doctora: The Journal of an American Doctor Practicing Medicine on the Amazon River","review":"I ordered this book after visiting the Amazon and Dr. Smith's clinic.

She cured my husband's plantar fascitis with a shot of lidocaine which we feel enabled him to walk properly and thus stretch the fachitis. It cost 25cents for the lidocaine and needle and he had spent way more of that in the States with a cordisone shot,MRI, special night boot, creams to rub on his foot, etc. In any event we love this woman and have begun a correspondence with her and her foundation. Her book tells how she left a thriving practice in Wisconsin to come to the Amazon and open a clinic. She is a very special lady. Her story moves quickly and is interesting. If you ever were tempted to do good in the world this woman takes you step by step on her journey. Truth is often better than fiction."},{"Title":"La Doctora: The Journal of an American Doctor Practicing Medicine on the Amazon River","review":"This is a well written book that engages the reader in life on the river and the problems and innovative solutions the author achieved.I visited her clinic and it is wonderful the care the people can receive."},{"Title":"La Doctora: The Journal of an American Doctor Practicing Medicine on the Amazon River","review":"La Doctora was on a reading list and was by far the favorite of every reader.

Her story is fascinating and is one I find myself telling people about. Linnea has a great sense of humor and an amazing ability to adapt to conditions and be creative. Here is a woman who is working hard on adapting to a different culture while being true to herself and saving lives and making lives better in the process."},{"Title":"La Doctora: The Journal of an American Doctor Practicing Medicine on the Amazon River","review":"This is an inspiring book that's a pleasure to read. It gives the reader the vicarious enjoyment of being part of a noble endeavor. In an age of &quot;road rage&quot; and the obsessive accumulation of more and more things (which often do not make us happy), it's exhilarating to experience a taste of Dr. Linnea's life.Dr. Linnea shows us how one can give up almost all the material possessions and creature comforts of the modern world and still find meaning, happiness, and personal fulfillment. Dr. Linnea has created for herself a significant life. A life with much to teach a troubled world.While missionaries have long sacrificed themselves to serve God, win the eternal salvation of lost souls, and earn a place in the pantheon of saints, Dr. Linnea does it for the pure humanity of the effort. Goodness is indeed its own reward in this Amazon outpost.Because of Dr. Linnea's &quot;wonderful life&quot;, many lives have been enriched and some even saved. More importantly, countless hours of suffering have been alleviated. This is the most humane thing: ending or reducing pain. We all have to die but we shouldn't have to suffer or endure years of pain when a cure is available. Dr. Linnea provides the cures that often would not be provided otherwise.She treats the sick and asks nothing in return; she allows her patients to keep their personal integrity; she respects their beliefs; she grants them respect and maintains their dignity; I think this could be called love.On the surface, this book is about a one woman medical practice hidden in the Amazon rain forest. Beneath the surface, however, it is about finding meaning in a world that too often seems to be without meaning. Dr. Smith's &quot;life-example&quot; has the power to let you view your own life differently; perhaps with a clearer insight. With one brave decision, everything can change. For Dr. Smith and thousands of her patients, the change has had life-sustaining significance.I felt a similar elation reading this book that I experienced when the US Women's Soccer Team won the World Cup. I was proud that our young women could show the world such excellence in a non-American sport. What else would this generation of young American women do in the future now that they saw what they could do? It is the power of their &quot;example&quot; that is so exciting. I stood and cheered in the privacy of my living room.Dr. Linnea is such an example, as well. She's one of our own; a human we can be proud of -- a human we would gladly point to if Extra Terrestrials came to earth and wanted to interview an exemplar human being for the Encyclopedia Galactica. Better yet, she is in &quot;real time&quot;; she is alive and still &quot;on-mission&quot;. You can be a part of her life. You can support her efforts. You can even bring her medicine if you visit the Amazon -- as some adventurous tourists do. You can visit her website (run by her relatives in the USA.)As a bonus, the book is very well written and designed. It is also moderately priced.La Doctora demonstrates the best in mankind. The message is optimistic; the ending, happy. Reading it may make you happy. And maybe, as in my case, it may make you want to stand and cheer as you finish the last page.Keep up the good work Dr. Linnea and please write a sequel. Feeling good and feeling proud and feeling optimistic is definitely worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"La Doctora: The Journal of an American Doctor Practicing Medicine on the Amazon River","review":"It wasn't so long ago that I had the privilege of meeting Linnea in Peru. She was just coming back from a fundraising journey to the States, where she received a prize of recognition for her selfless work in Amazonia. I was with a tour group that was to stay at several Amazonian jungle lodges. The Amazon was in it's annual flood stage and the only way any of us could get around was by small boat. La doctora Linnea had her own dugout which she paddled to and from the clinic, the lodge and her patients all by herself, in a dress. She wore skirts almost entirely because of the humidity and local custom. The only women who wear shorts or pants in Amazonia are tourists and scientists. Every evening Linnea would come to the lodge for a bit of relaxation and conversation with whomever was staying there, but one couldn't help but notice how more comfortable she was in the company of the locals and guides. The Ribiernos [local river dwellers] didn't ask rude or probing questions. They were friendly without conpromising her privacy.This ingrained need to keep part of herself to herself comes through in the book she's written. She's happy to talk about her work and her love of the people, but reveals little of her previous life. I recommend this book for the incredible story, the sense of place, to learn about people we would otherwise never know. She may not speak book-learned Spanish, but communicates fluently with her friends and patients. As she writes, she arrived in Peru speaking no Spanish."},{"Title":"La Doctora: The Journal of an American Doctor Practicing Medicine on the Amazon River","review":"As the author of a book about the same region, HIDDEN AMAZON, I found Linnea Smith's book fascinating. From Wisconsin, Linnea tells why she has gone to the Amazon (she's still there) and how she feels about the conditions, the jungle, and the people. Perhaps most instructive is her detailed account of the medical conditions she encounters and how she treats them under the most primitive conditions. She works, lives, and eats at Explorama Lodge, a popular stop for trekkers in the area. This is one of the few jungle lodges with a doctor on the staff. And LA DOCTORA is one of the best books about the rain forest and its medical services."},{"Title":"La Doctora: The Journal of an American Doctor Practicing Medicine on the Amazon River","review":"To be honest, I was a little hesitant buying this book. I've read about 15 books on the Amazon and I thought this just might be another recap of the same journeys that I've read about. This was not the case at all. Once I picked up this book, I couldn't put it down. It was so well written, it kept me glued to every page. I couldn't help reading page after page to see what was going to happen next.I have visited the area that the author was working in and her story made me feel as though I was back in the jungle with her, experiencing all that she wrote about. I felt connected to her and the way she viewed the U.S. after vacationing in Peru. Although she doesn't come right out and &quot;badmouth&quot; the US, she does point out just how many comforts we take advantage of. She eludes to the emptiness we feel as Americans, having every material possession known to man, and still being unhappy. She discusses her hesitantcy to leave her American life behind in pursuit of a dream that seemed crazy at in point. In the final analysis, her story is a perfect example of how one person can make a difference."},{"Title":"La Doctora: The Journal of an American Doctor Practicing Medicine on the Amazon River","review":"This is a light-hearted and easy read. I am a physician who enjoyed the medical aspects of this fellow physician's adventures, but it can easily be enjoyed by non-medical readers as well."},{"Title":"La Doctora: The Journal of an American Doctor Practicing Medicine on the Amazon River","review":"I met La Doctora just as the book was being written. (I believe it was ghost written, which is probably not unusual.)Jackie and I spent a few days at Explorama and talked at some length with Dr. Linnea. This book is not embellished in any way. This is an accurate account of life in that part of the world.Her descriptions of places were perfectly clear to me, since I've been there. It's hard to know how these descriptions will play out in the mind's eye of other readers. The beginning of the book was particularly fascinating.Our face-to-face meeting left me with the impression that she is not trying to run away from society, not trying to crusade for the underprivileged, not trying to be &quot;holier than thou&quot;. She really likes what she is doing. The book confirms this.When you read this book you are looking inside La Doctora. Nothing is hidden. There are no pretenses. She is simply good people.Incidently, she wanted the book named &quot;At the River's Edge&quot; and the publishers wanted &quot;La Doctora&quot;. The publishers won."},{"Title":"La Doctora: The Journal of an American Doctor Practicing Medicine on the Amazon River","review":"Linnea Smith's story captures you from the very beginning. Telling of her experiences as a physician in the Amazon jungle often keeps you on the edge of your seat. Taken directly from her journals, it discusses her experiences over a 7 year period of practicing medicine in the jungle without all the current medical technology. She also talks of the natives, their beliefs and some difficulties encountered because of the disparity of cultures. This book is an easy and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"La Doctora: The Journal of an American Doctor Practicing Medicine on the Amazon River","review":"This is somewhat of a minority viewpoint in comparison to the previous five customer reviews already written. I read this book because of the local publicity it received here in Wisconsin, the fact that I have been in Peru and in Amazon region (though not the same part as Dr. Linnea), am interested in Latin American culture, and speak fluent Spanish.Dr. Linnea doesn't. The one complete Spanish sentence in the book contains a major grammar error that most students wouldn't make mid-way through their first semester of college Spanish. Of the isolated Spanish words she uses, she gets a couple wrong. She can be forgiven for this. She obviously managed to communicate adequately with her patients and she's a physician, after all, not a linguist. I'm aware this seems like nitpicking, and this is not my reason for a mere 3-star review.What I find lacking in this book is emotional engagement with the reader. I liked this book passably, but wanted to like it so much more. Dr. Linnea is really the only character in it and she seems to be a rather private person. She gives us her opinions much more than her feelings. Maybe this is typical of the majority of physicians. We never really get to know her patients or any other person in the book. If she develops close relationships, we don't learn of them. Some patients improve and survive, some die, but it's a bit like a catalogue of people who barely have names or faces and come through her office (or she goes to them). I'm also interested in medicine and geography in general, and a book in a similar vein, that of a doctor practicing &quot;backwoods medicine&quot; that is truly wonderful (and that I'd hoped this one would resemble) is Dr. Abraham Verghese's MY OWN COUNTRY. (He treats AIDS patients in Appalachia in the mid-1980s.) Perhaps he's atypical in the way he becomes personally/emotionally involved with his patients or in the way that he is able to put human faces and lives on a disease and write about it all. Dr. Linnea, in spite of being a wonderful person who has done dangerous, extremely outstanding work, is not able (or chooses not) to do what Verghese did in his book.Unlike another customer who reviewed this, I definitely don't think this was ghost-written. Dr Linnea is right there, revealing not one iota more than she wants to. I think the &quot;problem&quot; can be seen right in her acknowledgements, when, regarding her publishers, she writes that they &quot;gave me unlimited latitude in what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it.&quot; Sorry, but this book needed much more editorial guidance. She's a physician, not a professional writer, and though this effort is quite passable, it could have been so much better.The book is informative, educational up to a point, gives a good perspective on &quot;jungle&quot; medicine&quot; vs. the US mainstream practice thereof, and is culturally sensitive. (Though at one point I winced, when she said that the inhabitants, almost all of whom live in abysmal poverty, &quot;seemed happy.&quot; This made me think of 19th century slaves in the US who, many contended &quot;seemed happy.&quot;) There are a few funny moments, especially when Dr. Linnea describes w/ dead-on accuracy her encounters with the Peruvian bureaucracy, redtape and corruption.All in all, well worth reading, but don't expect great emotional engagement or gripping human drama."},{"Title":"La Doctora: The Journal of an American Doctor Practicing Medicine on the Amazon River","review":"I met Dr Smith last month at her new clinic while vacationing on the Amazon River. This book was especially meaningful since we were in many of the places she talks about. I can understand completely why she came to the region for a vaction but never left. Her book provides a beautiful insight into the Amazon region and it's people. The Peruvian people in the Amazon, have very little by American standards, but they appear to be very content and happy with the lives they lead. And she chronicles this beautifully in her book, both the positive and the negative aspects of practicing, with very little equipment or supplies.She provides, from an outsiders perspective,the problems with practicing medicine not knowing the language and have to go thru so much 'red tape' to get the supplies and the Peruvian medical degree needed to legally treat the people she cared about.Fortunately she has been able to develop a great support system in Wisconsin, people who are able to acquire the supplies needed to built and outfit her new clinic.

Such is the case with Barbara Campbell's HEARTWOOD.I read this book over the course of a weekend in spring but for all I knew, I was not sitting in my backyard with the drone of cars and leaf-blowers and other modern \\"conveniences\\" competing for my attention. Instead, I was transported to the land of the Oak-Lord and the Holly-Lord where a Midwinter battle determined the advent of spring or the curse of a world locked in the frozen grip of winter.And it is \\"heart\\" that is the key word in this novel. While the fantastic descriptions will delight and frighten, the characters, from the troubled hero, Darak, to the wise, but aging Tree-Father,Struath, to the sadistic villain Morgath --all-- are \\"known\\" to us on some level. And that, in my opinion, is this author's greatest gift. Even the god Trickster, cunning, conceited and unpredictable as he is, reminds us of the times we wonder if our Maker doesn't have an unusual sense of humor.If you want to experience a seemingly lost world where the changing seasons are greeted with hope, awe and wonder versus large appliance sales, read HEARTWOOD. I can't wait for Ms. Campbell's next book."},{"Title":"Heartwood: Trickster's Game #1","review":"Heartwood offers us a world where magic, shamans, spirits and gods are not metaphors to explain reality, but ARE reality. Heartwood tells the story of the spring that will not come because the battle between the sacred trees of the people has not gone according to custom. The balance of nature is off and a brave band of folk go off into the endless winter to see if they can set it right. On their journey they meet gods who walk the earth: a delightful Trickster, whose charm and sense of humor can almost make you forget the mischief he makes; a villain who can shape-shift by taking over the bodies of any living creature; a spirit-guide who offers assistance to the aging shaman. These classic elements of so many earth-based religions are here treated as reality, with sometimes terrifying...and always exciting...consequences."},{"Title":"Heartwood: Trickster's Game #1","review":"After the darkest night of the year, imagine it never got brighter.Faced with the unimaginable, Darak sets out to both return balance to his world and save the brother who's caught up in the struggle. The characters are richly drawn, from the haunted Darak to the dark and oh so enticing Morgath.One of my biggest problems with fantasy novels is that the women seem to just be there to worry about the hero, hope he likes them, and get rescued. In Heartwood, Griane is as strong as Darak. They're delightful characters to revisit again and again. Heartwood was a fantastic read."},{"Title":"Heartwood: Trickster's Game #1","review":"The tribe of the Oak has suffered tremendous losses due to plague but they still intend to observe the midwinter ritual where the Oak-Lord and the Holly-lord battle. Oak defeats Holly so that spring will arrive. Darak the hunter is not looking forward to this ritual because his beloved brother Tinnean will become Tree-Brother, apprenticed to the Tree father and will owe his allegiance to his master instead of his family.When it is time to travel to the dimension where the First Forrest lives, Darak refuses to join them and witness the loss of the brother who will be part of yet separate from the tribe. Something goes wrong at the ritual and the Oak and Tinnean disappear. Tinnean's body is inhabited by the Holly-Lord while the Oak and Darak's brother are in the land of Chaos, put there by the spirit of Morgoth, the evil Tree-Father, who held the position before Strauth killed him. Darak and his allies prepare to do battle to bring Tinnean back into his body and finish the rite so spring will return.Think Jean Auel and Judith Tarr and readers will have some idea what HEARTWOOD is all about. The setting feels prehistoric with magic an everyday occurrence. Darak is a strong stubborn man who loves deeply and wants to keep those he cares about close to him safe; when his brother is in danger he is willing sacrifices himself to free his sibling from the enemy. Barbara Campbell creates characters readers will care about and produces a storyline that grabs reader interest.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Born In Secret (Firstborn Sons) (Silhouette Intimate Moments)","review":"Walker James has the assignment to infiltrate a Middle Eastern Terrorist organization called the Brothers of Darkness so that he may locate and destroy an anthrax lab before a deadly plot decimates the majority of the country's population. Walker's delinquent childhood and experience as a thief hold him in good stead as he walks the shadowy world of espionage. Indeed, Walker fits well into a world without the clarity of black and white, preferring to walk the ambiguous gray areas. He's earned the nickname The Ghost for his ability to slip in and out of seemingly impenetrable places. While he works well alone or as a part of a team, he's not prepared for his new partner. Jasmine LeBarr outmaneuvered him three years ago, and he's never forgiven her.Jasmine goes undercover as an emissary called Rose Mahrain with Walker accompanying her as her driver. She has a gift for gaining people's trust, and of getting them to underestimate her, which she uses to her advantage. While Walker calls her an opportunist who will go any length to get what she wants, Jasmine actually adheres carefully to her own moral code. Walker is dangerous to her well being as any man she's ever brought down. He's already hurt her once with his callous dismissal, and she refuses to be that vulnerable again. Indeed, their lingering attraction may prove to be the most dangerous aspect of the mission.Kylie Brant weaves an intriguing web of danger in this timely tale of terrorism and romance in BORN IN SECRET. Unfortunately, while the theme of first-born sons frames the narrative, it does not affect the plot as a whole, resulting in a tacked on feeling at the end. Nevertheless, BORN IN SECRET is a highly believable, vividly realized tale. The fast paced plot and the strong characterizations are nicely balanced, resulting in a tale at once deadly, yet richly balanced by powerful emotions and physical attraction. Jasmine is a vivacious and strong heroine who refuses to allow Walker's scathing comments regarding their shared history get to her. In addition, she knows exactly how to apply her feminine wiles to great advantage to the men she encounters. Further, Walker's James Bond-like charisma and looks, complete with cool spy toys, makes him a memorable hero. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Born In Secret (Firstborn Sons) (Silhouette Intimate Moments)","review":"Born in Secret was the first book that I have read by Kylie Brant.

After a hundred pages, however, I felt a sinking sensation as I realized that this story could not possibly have a happy ending. Bell had done such an excellent job realizing his characters that I felt deeply involved in their lives. After the horrendous atrocities of slavery and the slave revolts and subsequent battles, it seemed that the island was finally at some sort of peace.But what a price! Then as the French arrived to re-assert their primacy and General Louveture succumbs to hubris the precarious peace falls apart and the bloodshed begins again with blacks against whites.This last book completes the trilogy and tells a story that few of us know anything about. Haiti is a huge mystery to me and these books helped me understand a little why this country is the way it is. The legacy of slavery and the battles that were required to end it as well as the enduring suspicians between white and black are lessons for all of us even at this time (maybe particularly at this time)."},{"Title":"The Stone that the Builder Refused: A Novel","review":"The three novels in this series are the best historical novels I have ever read. They deal with a horrifying event, the slave rebellion in Haiti. Bell does not flinch from the horrors the contending groups and individuals inflicted on each other. The historical background is well covered in the plot and appendix. Written by a master novelist. Bell also covers fascinating subjects like the Voodoo mythos that still exists in Haiti today. Reading this novel, one begins to understand the chaos of Haiti today. A country born in this much bloodshed and hatred is destined for more. In terms of gallons of blood spilled, our own revolution was a mere skirmish.If you are at all interested in Haiti, race, relations, history, or just reading a good story, you should read this and the other two novels in the series, All Souls Rising and The Master Of The Crossroads."},{"Title":"The Stone that the Builder Refused: A Novel","review":"This book was a masterful finish to a fantastic trilogy! If the subject were not somewhat obscure I am certain this series of books would be already be an American classic. I am so thankful for Professor Bell's exhaustive research and unparalleled writing skills. He brings the Haitian revolution to life. I have traveled back and forth to Haiti over the past 20 years and I will never look at the country or it's people in the same way! His development of characters and the seamless flow between chapters kept me in avid anticipation of my nightly reads. I am lost at the moment for what to read next!!

I still have some of the original issues of this sucker. I'm just too scared to take them out of their apocalypse-proof mylar bags. SOUTHERN KNIGHTS was one of the indie comics I faithfully tracked when I was a kid in the '80s, along with ELEMENTALS, MAGE, JUSTICE MACHINE, NEXT MEN and such. The Southern Knights stood out in several ways and certainly provided a refreshing contrast from the stuff then being produced by Marvel and DC. For one thing, half the team wore costumes. The other half opted for civilian wear. In fact, the happy-go-lucky Kristin represented her Clemson U. ties.THE SOUTHERN KNIGHTS GRAPHIC NOVEL reprints the very rare, first two issues which featured the Southern Knights or, going by its original title, THE CRUSADERS (until Archie Comics' strident call of copyright infringement dictated a name change). Based out of Atlanta, Georgia, they were called \\"The #1 Super Team of the South\\" and, disappointingly, their adventures lasted a mere 36 issues. A pursuit of a carful of kidnappers proves to be the catalyst for the team's formation, and I know it's a bit of a stretch that these innocent bystanders would turn out to have extraordinary abilities, but that's the magic of comic books.This abduction caper would introduce us to already established superhero, Electrode, whose civilian identity is physicist and comic book enthusiast David Shenk. It's amazingly cool that David's origin is that he actually applied his smarts to give himself electrical super-powers. Electrode is team leader, by default, really. He just wanted it more. Connie Ronnin is an Olympic-level swordswoman who wields a psychic sword (years later the X-Men's Psylocke would steal her thunder). She's sort of the damaged type, psychologically. On the other hand, Kristin Austin couldn't be more carefree... and super-strong... and bullet-proof. Hands down the awesomemest character of the bunch is Dragon... who is a friggin' dragon who'd been around for longer than 1200 years! The very cool thing about him is that this isn't a guy who turns into a dragon, but a dragon masquerading as a human. It's pretty amusing that his human identity is that of Mark Dagon, romance novelist who looks like Burt Reynolds. Heh. The Southern Knights' fifth member, the young 18th century wizard Aramis Merrow, won't make his appearance until issue #5. Anyway, the fantastic group dynamics is one of the reasons this title is so fondly remembered by those who remember it.In their debut, our heroes come together and nab the kidnappers and even land a sponsor. In the second issue, our heroes foil a bank robber who can manifest his victim's darkest fear. And they lose their sponsor (who was sort of a heel, anyway). They also lose their team name of \\"Crusaders,\\" something which is addressed in a nifty bit of meta storytelling by writer Henry Vogel. I don't know if Vogel did anything else later in the comic book field, but with SOUTHERN KNIGHTS he penned stories that were charming and kinda made fun of all those postmodern \\"real world\\" superheroes. Jackson \\"Butch\\" Guice, before he became a name, handled the artwork for the first issue and provided rough layouts for the second one. This graphic novel also comes with Henry Vogel's foreword in which he relates his inspirations for the Southern Knights.SOUTHERN KNIGHTS, being one of them impoverished ventures that existed paycheck to paycheck, had no choice but to go the black & white route. Don't let that stop you from trying it out, though. It's \\"The #1 Super Team of the South,\\" y'all."},{"Title":"Lost Indianapolis (IN) (Images of America)","review":"I live in the Indianapolis area, so this book is extra special. The photographs are amazing. It tells the story of the old Indianapolis and how life used to be in our fair city. The canal is lovely to look at now, but the author takes us back to when the canal was used for trade. You can still shop at LS Ayres in the suburbs, but you can't shop in the store downtown in all it's history and glory. shopping used to be a big event. This book is wonderful. The stories are told in a way to take you back in time. Who knew Indianapolis had interurbans &amp; streetcars? Now I Know...."},{"Title":"Lost Indianapolis (IN) (Images of America)","review":"Loved the book - cover to cover. The pictures are great too. Anyone interested in the Indianapolis area, especially it's beginnings, would do well to buy this book. I have actually purchased 5 additional books to give as Christmas gifts!"},{"Title":"Lost Indianapolis (IN) (Images of America)","review":"I grew up in Indianapolis and really enjoyed reading about all of the things that have gone away since I was a little kid. I used to love Burger Chef, and the downtown Ayres store. I remember the Riverside Amusement Park sitting closed there for years when we would pass it going out to the Speedway.The author also has a webpage called &quot;Lost Indiana&quot; which talks about some of the Lost Indy topics, but also some other neat sites in the rest of the state. You could google this to find it."},{"Title":"Lost Indianapolis (IN) (Images of America)","review":"\\"Lost Indianapolis\\" is part of the very large \\"Images of America\\" series of books that feature historical photos of landmarks of a city or group of people and tell part of the history as well. From time to time \\"then and now\\" photos are included as well so that the reader can see how things have changed.\\"Lost Indianapolis\\" is a great book for those with an interest in Indianapolis for two reasons:1) The photographs. They are interesting and very well-chosen to add to the text. I have seen books of this sort that seem to have random pictures tossed in with the text.2) The text. McDonald has chosen several interesting topics to tell some of the story of the city. This is not a complete history by any means, but he does a thorough job of telling episodes in the city's history.Topics covered in the book include: the central canal, Union Station, the Interurban system, the Stutz company, Carl Fisher, Riverside Park, Burger Chef and Market Square Arena.The Interurban system was an electrical train system that ran from Indianapolis and connected with similar systems all over Indiana, Illinois and Ohio. McDonald tells the story in both a thorough and interesting way, including how the electrical plants required to power the trains eventually started to sell their extra energy to nearby customers and morphed into two modern-day utility companies still operating in the state.The history of the Stutz Company is interesting because it begins to tell the story of Indianapolis and its love affair with the automobile. The Stutz Bearcat was the most famous car to come out of the factories that still stand on Capitol Avenue (they now house offices and a series of art studios).McDonald also tells the story of Carl Fisher, an automotive pioneer in many ways - he had one of the first car dealerships in the world, he sold parts, including the first working headlights and the electric starter. Most importantly, he was part of the team that created the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and began the tradition of the Indianapolis 500 in 1911. He includes a great action photo of Fisher testing out the track before it was paved with more than 3 million bricks in 1911.I very much enjoyed the section on Burger Chef as well. I did not realize that one of the warehouses I drive by from time to time on West 16th street was actually the corporate headquarters of Burger Chef! I have fond childhood memories of the Fun Meal at Burger Chef featuring the characters Burger Chef & Jeff - the forerunner to the McDonald's Happy Meal. Lost Indianapolis details the growth of company and the men who founded it. Interestingly, they had made several fast food kitchen devices to make things like soft-serve ice cream, shakes and flame-broiled hamburgers and started the first Burger Chef as a showcase restaurant to demonstrate their products. It was so successful they decided to franchise their system.\\"Lost Indianapolis\\" is marred by several typographical errors, but the good information and interesting stories more than made up for that."},{"Title":"Lost Indianapolis (IN) (Images of America)","review":"Thanks to all who have made this book one of the best selling titles on Indianapolis.

There are also a couple of other editing errors.What happened? Very simply the final edited version was not the one printed! Though a mixup with the publisher, one of the pre-edited versions was actually printed.The good news: the next printing of the book has the errors corrected.

Loaded with photos mostly from the Indiana Historical Society, it really brings home the feel of life in Indianapolis way back when. Unfortunately, as one other reviewer noticed, the book is chock full of grammatical and typographical errors, which make it somewhat painful to read. Hoosiers are already known for having an exceptionally poor education system, and this book will not lead anyone to believe differently. Definitely worth reading, but not worth the price, as it leaves much of the city's history unexplored and unaccounted for."},{"Title":"Lost Indianapolis (IN) (Images of America)","review":"I truly enjoyed the concept of this book. I agree with the previous reviewer that the photographs are exceptional in that they often depict the history of a subject as well as the present.I am quite disappointed, however, in the editing (or lack thereof) of the book. It appears that the manuscript was put together in haste. The editor and/or the publisher really fell short of their job.Because I was born, and still live in Indianapolis - and my family history began in this city around 1850 - I looked forward to reading each of the chapters. Unfortunately, the frequent grammatical and typographical errors really distracted from the content. If the work had been edited, it would have a home among other treasures on my bookshelf. It is sad, however, that I would be expected to pay even Amazon's discounted price for a piece that could have truly been a treasure - if someone had just taken the time to edit it."},{"Title":"Eyewitness Travel Phrase Book: European (14 languages)","review":"It's a great size, very small but thick with info.

While many authors have explored various aspects of Lincoln and his administration, Segal's innovative approach provides an objective assessment of the political and social dynamics that surrounded Lincoln's decision-making throughout his presidency. By chronologically organizing excerpts from personal interviews and narrative accounts, \\"Conversations with Lincoln\\" captures Lincoln's valiant effort of uniting the United States while steadfastly working to protect the integrity of the Constitution. Lincoln's own thoughts provide rare social commentary as well as vivid insight into one of America's greatest leaders. I sincerely recommend this book to anyone interested in gaining a more accurate perspective of both Abraham Lincoln and the United States during this extraordinary time period."},{"Title":"Conversations With Lincoln","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. In particular, I thought the author gave us a unigue look into the selection of a President's cabinet. Also, Lincoln's ups and downs with the various General's during the Civil War was clearly depicted. The conversations with approach is a good one that is vastly different than the normal biography."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"This book collects together Paine's Common Sense (which was instrumental in collecting and gathering America's attention to the benefits of strict independence from Great Britain); his letters or series entitled &quot;the American Crisis,&quot; which galvanizes his previous topics; gives a brief account of his engineering work for arches bridges; provides another span of letters on his involvement in the French Revolution, and finishes with his Age of Reason, in which he examines and debunks the Bible. Though his reasoning and conclusions may alarm some and even offend others, his thinking and writing is lucid and cogent, and for reflective minds will provide much food for thought. Accused of sophistry and impudence by some of his contemporaries, his reasoning is normally sound and simple, as he inquires into the root of things, and only seldom does he make debating points fit only for the playground. A sensible and likable man, Paine's writing should engage any American for its historical sense, any lover or researcher interested in human rights and the hope of removing human misery, and any person interested in reading the entertaining but vital arguments of a man whose love of liberty and order forced him late in life to become one of America's most influential revolutionary and socially-minded voices."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"A &quot;must have&quot; for any legitimate personal &quot;library&quot;.Paine's thoughts are important reading for every person who would call himself educated and versed in the history of ideas about how society should organize -- particularly &quot;Common Sense&quot; and &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;. I myself would have included him in Stephen Covey's &quot;Wisdom Literature&quot; (&quot;First Things First&quot;). Carl Sagan cites him (&quot;The Demon Haunted World&quot;) in support of his own reflections on &quot;the God hypothesis&quot;.COMMON SENSE speaks to form and purpose of government and was the pivotal Revolutionary pamphlet in which Paine disected and debunked the legitimacy of monarchy, giving voice to the growing feelings in the Colonies that being ruled by the King of England had become obsolete. Paine's articulation served to &quot;tune&quot; the chorused voices of the Colonies, which before his writing, were loud but out of tune. (War was underway, but the Colonies not well organized in a joint defense.) COMMON SENSE even has a refreshed relevance in the aftermath of the 9/11/01 tragedies in New York, as we re-examine some of our institutions.THE AGE OF REASON will be disagreeable reading to devout followers of any organized religion -- particularly Christians -- as it is Paine's book-by-book disection and denunciation of the Bible (and, by extension, the &quot;scriptures&quot; of all other religions) as a collection of fables, nurtured through the ages for corrupt purposes of church leaders (starting hundreds of years BC). But, almost by definition, an educated person MUST acknowledge disagreeable ideas and THEN make disposition of them Once in a while &quot;disagreement&quot; is even persuaded to new thinking, n'est ce pas?.This edition is a particularly excellent resource for these pieces and Paine's other writings. It is scrupulously based on the best discoverable versions, with meticulous notes documenting the sources.The physical quality of the printing and binding is premium in every aspect, and will last for generations. Truly a &quot;library&quot; quality volume, far superior to the typical &quot;best seller&quot; construction."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"Thomas Paine's greatness lied in his ability to take the abstract ideas of the American Revolution and make them graspable by all of his time, while infusing them with the moral passion that they truly deserved. Paine is one of the great masters of ideas taken into action.His immortal opening of the \\"American Crisis\\" was like new fuel to a dying flame. \\"These are the times that try men's souls,\\" he wrote, and his arguments for continuing the revolution reminded the patriots of the meaning of their fight. And Paine could not have been timelier-his words came at a time when the success of the revolution seemed much in doubt.Perhaps more than any man, he breathed new life into the patriots though his keen analysis and moral passion. 225 years later, he still gives life to the idea of America, even as our freedoms come under increased threat.Thomas Paine is required reading for any student of America who wishes to understand the ideas from which America was made real."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"Thomas Paine was the most consistent and important of all the American Founding Fathers. He consistently spoke up in favor of liberty and freedom; for example, his opposition to the institution of slavery (which he argued was immoral and un-Christian and thought it quite contradictory to claim to be a Christian on the one hand and support slavery on the other hand) - Paine also spoke up in support of women's rights, freedom of thought, the poor, etc.The important thing about Paine is that he practiced what he preached, as opposed to just about every other founding father (e.g., Jefferson saying all are \\"created equal\\" but owning slaves, or Adams \\"dismissing\\" his wife's assertion that they too should be included in the political process). I don't think we ought to condemn those individuals for the beliefs that they had, indeed they were products of their time period - and they are worthy of study. However, I also believe that we should praise those who were able to step out of that period and see things as they are, this is what Paine was able to do.If you doubt Paine's importance in the history of American independence, consider the following; probably no other phamphlet brought the idea of independence to the mind of the colonists like Paine's \\"Common Sense\\" did and it was Paine's \\"Crisis #1\\" that was read to Washington's soldiers before they prepared for the biggest fight of the American Revolution. Paine's defense of the French Revolution in his \\"Rights of Man\\" sparked off a publication war that has yet to be matched and his \\"The Age of Reason\\" delineated the philosophical ideas that most of the founding fathers had with regard to religion (regardless of what the religious right would have you to believe).Paine's mistake was not believing what most of the founding fathers believed, that the \\"common man and woman\\" was not intellectual enough to handle the arguments that he (and the others) were advocating. It was his consistency which brought about his downfall - this is a shame, because he is one of the most important thinkers to come out of the Revolutionary Period in American history."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"This volume is of great value to anyone who's interested in the foundations of this country. Paine was far ahead of his time in so many areas, for example in his vocal criticism of slavery. This country owes a debt to him in the profound impact he had on those who wrote the constitution and declaration of independence. The closing work of this volume, The Age of Reason, was, for its time, a very courageous indictment of the bible. It was written toward the end of Paine's life. There have been many men of courage and conviction, but Paine also had a profound honesty and the gift of a great intellect which allowed to express his ideas clearly.The binding, cover, and paper of this volume are of the highest quality. The volume is smaller than the typical bestseller hardback, both in length, width, and thickness. But its slenderness is due to high quality of the very thin paper--the book has over 900 pages. I liked its small size because it makes it comfortable to read."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"When I started reading Common Sense I had a hard time because the text was so dense, but when I decided to read it aloud, the text came to life--it was like discovering Shakespeare. Actually, the second set of texts is a collection of about ten essays called \\"The American Crisis\\" (numbered 1-10), and I thought these were even better. In them Paine tries to convince the American public that Great Britain doesn't have a chance against the 13 Colonies. Sort of like the Iraqi Information Minister telling his people that the Iraqi's will \\"roast the American soldier's stomaches in hell\\", while American shells explode in the background, shaking the building he's speaking from. The oratory of other greats such as Jim Carvill and Muhammad Ali came to mind, too, but the text is so well written, as to approach Shakespeare.\\"These are the times that try men's souls: The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from service of his country; but he that stands it NOW, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.\\"It's almost comical, in retrospect, because he address a few essays directly to the British General in charge, Sir William Howe. To the most powerful general in the world he says, \\"England was never famous by land; her officers have generally been suspected of a cowardice, have more of the air of a dancing-master than a soldier, and by the sample we have taken prisoners we begin to give the preference to ourselves.\\"He does make good points, but the abuse, both exaggerated and level-headed, just goes on and on. It was truly a pleasure to read. And even though the pages turned slowly, it just felt good to savor his words.The book is about 800+ pages, so reading the whole collection like a novel is just too much work for most. The varied texts (about 35 in total) are arranged chronollgically, which is nice. Besides Paine's major works, Common Sense, The Crisis, the Rights of Man, The Age of Reason, there is also a nice smattering of smaller essays.Additionally, there are very helpful footnotes in the back of the collection, but there are no numbers within the text; the notes are listed by page and line number.The essays were written about very topical subjects, so it is most helpful to have done a fair amount of general reading before attempting to tackle Paine so you know what he is talking about, though the notes do help. There is also a very nice chronolgy of Paine's life in the back, as well.It was an absolute pleasure reading these primary source texts. I understand now why Common Sense sold 120,000 copies within months of being published and what an essential role Thomas Paine played in keeping up the spirits of the colonists during the very discouraging early years of the War of Independence.A previous reviewer commented on how the high-quality, super-thin pages made the text small, light-weight, and easy to read. I'd have to agree."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"Before reading the Collected Writings of Thomas Paine, I understood very little about him. Though his language and vocabulary are a little dated, his deep wisdom and understanding of the human condition shines through remarkably as if he were alive today. If only he were. What would he think of our current state of affairs? The best part of the collection has to be both parts of The Age of Reason. If this isn't required reading in school, it should be.

Some of his deficiencies stand out markedly in &quot;Age of Reason,&quot; where his attempts to discredit what he calls &quot;the stupid texts of the bible&quot; actually highlight his own misunderstanding and the gaps in his education (which was largely self-achieved). His natural wit comes to the fore in his superb Revolutionary War propaganda pieces ridiculing the British generals who were then besieging the colonists. And his extreme bravery and committment to principle appears in his speech, when serving as a delegate to the French Assembly just as the Reign of Terror was beginning, pleading for the life of Louis XVI . Eric Foner has chosen the pieces well and supplies excellent notes, and the volume is up to the usual high typographical and binding standards of the Library of America. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"Thomas Paine was an Englishman whose writings had a profound effect on the American Revolution and in the debate in the English speaking world on the French Revolution. This wonderful volume from the Library of America provides his major writings in one volume. Knowing these works is important to your understanding of what ideas were in circulation at the time of our founding and what was being debated on both sides of the Atlantic.\\"Common Sense\\" takes on the idea of monarchy and of American Independence with arguments that amount to no more than common sense. Paine takes apart the idea that monarchy comes from God using the logic of the current English constitution and its internal checks wondering why a form that comes from God would need such a check. As for American Independence, he points out that a small island might need protection from a greater power, but why would a continent need protection from a small island. He also points out that our previous dependence on Britain is not reason to continue the relationship. Children begin as helpless babes, but do not drink milk forever. The time inevitably comes when the child must take its place in the world as an independent adult. There is much more to his arguments, but this gives you a sense of how he argues. This tract was printed many times and made a huge noise in the world.\\"The Crisis\\" or \\"The American Crisis\\" is a series that reports on aspects of the War for Independence that began in December of 1776 when things were not going all that well for the Americans. The first in this series begins with the famous sentence, \\"These are the times that try men's souls.\\" And goes on about the summer and winter soldier.\\"The Rights of Man\\" is Paine's argument for the French Revolution and specifically taking on the arguments of Edmund Burke against what was going on in France after their Revolution. In my view, Paine is pretty much off the rails here, especially when he lists the rights declared by the French. For example, compare number three of these declarations with the American notion that man is sovereign whose rights are given him by God. The French say, \\"The nation is essentially the source of all sovereignty; nor can any INDIVIDUAL, or ANY BODY OF MEN, be entitled to any authority which is not expressly derived from it.\\" Oy. Anybody see tyranny justified in that one?In \\"The Age of Reason\\" Paine takes on sectarian religion and all orthodox Christianity, which Paine does not like. He advocates a Deism as superior to all religions. Sigh.Anyway, these are important essays and had a big impact in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and are a part of our history. Students of our history need to know these works.This fine edition also has notes on the text and a chronology of Paine's life."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"Mr Foner has put together a wonderful collection of the major writings of Thomas Paine.

But also several shorter one, a few letters and other writings. I think for every historystudent of that age, looking for some thoughts in the pure sense of the enlightenment. Thomas Paine is your man."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"Some of Paine's arguments state that he can't accept the revelations of others because he cannot be assured of THEIR credibility. This comes from a man that failed out of school at 12 years old, failed at every job he attempted, and is only remembered for his statements in support of the American Revolution, which he only was apart of for a few years before it took place.Much of Paine's arguments contain fallacies. His belief of an Age of Reason is not supported by logical or reasoning abilities. One example is the logical fallacy Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (after this therefore because of this). One of Paine's arguments is that Satan was punished by being sent to a pit; Paine then states that the Greek god Jupiter punished his opponent (giants) by confining one under a mountain (Paine claims resulted in volcanoes). Paine claims that BECAUSE the legend of Jupiter imprisoning his rival allegedly preceded the concept of Satan being imprisoned that the Christian belief in Satan must have been derived out of the Jupiter legend. Paine's assumption excludes the fact that earthy crimes committed throughout all ages have had punishment or prison associated with them, and the claim that the Jews would have had to study Greek mythology to create their own beliefs is a complete hypothesis on Paine's part.Paine's statements are wishy-washy to say the least. He makes statements that the Bible is only hearsay and has no merit, and then at other times makes statements based on Biblical passages as though they were a matter of fact. He states that Jesus was a great teacher, and that he (Paine) is going to stick with the philosophy of Thomas (doubting Thomas) and demand to see proof of everything. If Paine's theories were true that the Bible was only hearsay, he would have no way of judging what Jesus taught as his (Paine's) beliefs do not allow for Jesus or Thomas to have even existed.A very interesting thing to note about Paine's beliefs is that if you apply his beliefs to his own work then you would PROVE in Paine's view point that HE never existed. Paine states that you cannot believe that Paul wrote the books of the New Testament attributed to him therefore the Bible is not true. This same principle can be applied to Paine's work to challenge Paine's very existence. None of us personally met Paine or verified that his writings were his own; we only have writings that we are told were written by Thomas Paine by others, and that the writings contained Paine's beliefs. If you apply this type of reasoning to Paine's own work then you would have to conclude that Paine's work might be a complete fabrication, and that there is no proof that he even lived that does not come from hearsay or documentation of other men.In LIFE AND WRITINGS OF THOMAS PAINE it says: \\"Deism teaches us that God is a God of truth and justice. Does the Bible teach the same doctrine? It does not.\\"This concept of God being a God of Justice and Truth is taken from the Revelations of the Bible and not from the Deist's use of Reason. By simply observing Creation to understand God as Deist claims you would not come to the understanding of God as a God of Justice and Truth. The world is not naturally just. If you base your religion on observing nature you are more likely to conclude that God is growing people in order to eat them, as that is what is observable in nature. Human's raise animals for food and are not concerned about providing the animals with truth and justice. These traits cannot be determined by observing the movements of the sun or the actions of man.Observing the nature of man; to rob, rape, and kill would appear to be a natural state of man, as these actions have been recorded throughout all history and still exist today. If Deists hold to the belief of judging God by observing the creation without giving any thought to Biblical Revelation then there is not cause to label such actions as sin. Revealed religion is what labels these instincts as sin. Paine's view originates in his Quaker up bringing, which he then perverts and intermixes with his concept of Reason to make up his odd belief and questionable belief system.Paine also rests some of his arguments on the new definition that he gives to the word Revelation. He redefines the word to meet his desires. The problem with this argument is that when debating the usage of a word relating to a topic thousands of years earlier it is necessary to use the definition of word at that time. By changing the definition of the word thousands of years later you do not invalidate how it has been used for centuries. This argument is also a logical fallacy called the Straw man in which Paine creates his own new definition of the word and argues against his own definition and not the actual topic.Much of Paine's view on Reason comes from ethnocentric thinking that He (educated to the level of a 12 year old boy) has a superior ability to think than those who have lived in the past. Paine views himself as an enlightened thinker when in fact the opposite is true. He values the usage of Reason in gaining wisdom, but the Reason that Deism promotes is ignorance. It involves a lack of study or research, and is simply the concept of \\"Believe whatever you reason without considering anything other than your own opinions\\", and leaves man to his own devices. The problem is that the Bible documents the results of man being left to his own devices, and if REASON were really being applied then an enlightened thinker would STUDY and learn from the mistakes of those of the past to prevent themselves from falling into the same snares.There is nothing enlightened about reasoning through ignorance. Much of Paine's problems with Christianity are not actually with the Word of God (as Paine claims they are), but are against man's hypocrisy and use of religion wrongfully. The Bible is also against these things, so Paine's attacks on the Bible are misdirected. Paine's argument that Christianity is wrong simple because other religions exist is foolish. One would not assume that all foods are poisonous simply because some of them are. If you do not want to eat poisonous food the answer does not lie in blindly making up your own recipes and biting into them hoping you wouldn't die, but lies in studying the good and bad recipes to determine where the poison is in order to use the correct recipe that will allow you to live; that is how REASON is to be used intelligently. If you are an enlightened thinker then you would analyze, evaluate, contemplate, understand, and reason to determine the truth. Making up your own philosophy based on what feels good to you is not enlightenment, and it is not even a new way of thinking; this error is commonly documented in the Bible.Paine's arguments show only a superficial understanding of the Bible. If he were to put effort into studying the Bible and applying reason to it then his questions and objections to it would be answered. He would also be able to answer why some religions are false ones and why they are so. As it is Paine argues that all religion say they are right and since they all cannot be right Paine assumes that none of them can be right. This is another error in his reasoning. Certainly there are an infinite number of examples of people doing things wrong, but someone else being capable of doing it right."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"This book is a great read.

And when you understand the specifics involved in the Baptist situation, it becomes terribly obvious that the agenda to discredit the Judeo- Christian founding of the United States has been afoot for some time.Likewise, with Thomas Paine you get several of his works in 1 volume. Beautifully bound book, I particularly like the older, slip-case versions. Here are some of the most impactful and well-known writings of Paine, and if you are looking to build your Founders library like I am, you could do alot worse than getting this book.I'm not sure how many other Greats are in this series, but I'm looking next at finding Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln.If you are fan of Liberty, and love the founding of this Great Nation, then you can't go wrong owning the writings of the actual men that created it."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"Thomas Paine strikes a (still) powerful blow for Jeffersonian values and deism.

He was one of America's most brilliant and inspiring writers. That is if you don't read any of 'RICKYTHEREADER's reviews. RICKYTHEREADER has reviewed exactly four books on the amazon website, all about Paine and all delving into proselytizing (over 50 mentions of the bible or Jesus between the four reviews). Further, he's obsessed with the fact that Paine failed out of school at the age of 12. Does this mean we must discount his body of work? Einstein was a slow learner, perhaps that 'lightbulb' idea wasn't quite as good as we all thought. Hey, think what you want, but disliking someone's views has little to do with the quality of their work. Especially of someone as deservingly revered as Paine. If he's such a mediocre writer, why did RICKYTHEREADER dig into FOUR of his books? I love Paine, but I've not read that many! My message to RICKYTHEREADER: Love God if you wish, but don't write reviews with an agenda. Write a review of the work."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"Thomas Paine, especially in The Age of Reason, did not put forth completely original ideas. Many of his contemporaries had the same critisms that Paine did in regard to organized religion especially Christianity. However, Thomas Paine organized such thoughts in a way that they were accessible to common men. Unfortunately his brave and inspirational work was his downfall. Closeminded and fearful citizens, like RICKITHEREADER in our modern times were frightened that perhaps Paine was tearing a hole the the fabric of their blind faith and because of this, Paines' last work, The Age of Reason, left him to die alone and impoverished. He was abandoned, even by his intellectual contemporaries, most who agreed with him but were not brave enough to voice their beliefs in the common vernacular. I was inspired by Paine who wrote, \\"My mind is my own church,\\" which was not the voice of an atheist but the voice of a man who really did know the \\"truth\\" and his true path. Unlike RickitheReader, I have read both the bible and Paine with an open mind and heart. The joy of reading is the ability to let it lead you to new places. Thomas Paine would have said it better. Read this compilation and it will lead you to new places, wherever your faith is."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"On the plus side, the work is extremely thorough and a very aesthetically pleasing printing. It's 900 pages, yet the book is nicely compact.I don't base my rating so much on the content itself; after all, it's difficult to argue too much with the importance of Thomas Paine, whether you agree with the tenor of his ideas or not. Plus, how do you rate, say, a personal letter?I give this a tepid review because I find the editing lacking. Despite the big name, the book is, essentially, a collection of his writings, with little else. \\"Great\\" you may say; I simply note, don't be swayed by having Eric Foner's name attached to this. For the most part, you will be on your own to determine the context of the individual pieces. For a professional historian, that may be fine, but for an amateur like myself, it became frustrating. Foner has included a section \\"Note on the Texts\\" and a section \\"Notes.\\" But all the first section really gives is the publication date and where the item first appeared; the notes themselves are quite sparse and aren't footnoted in the text (hence, you have no idea while you read the text whether there's a note or not). To give an example of the problem with context, a sample selection: \\"Response to 'Observation on the American Revolution.'\\" The entry begins, \\"Mr Dunlap...\\" If you turn back to the \\"Notes on the Text,\\" Foner's only context for this 6-page letter is when and where it was first published. Not helpful. One can read between the lines that it's a response to something (\\"Observation...\\") that was published somewhere, by someone (\\"Mr Dunlap?\\"). But Foner doesn't tell us what that was. Nor does he even explain who it's too. Maybe historians can readily look at the date and see Mr. Dunlap and know who off the top of their head who \\"Mr Dunlap\\" is. I can't. This is one example out of about 50. Virtually every non-obvious/major work in the book, I had to turn to Wikipedia to try to figure out who he's writing or responding to.That being said, I appreciated the chronological organization of it - it's interesting to see the man progress over time... or regress, depending on your point of view."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"Paine's \\"Age of Reason\\" was a mind-blowing revelation for me, so I'll focus mainly on that in this review. Although he has little formal education (fortunately it doesn't require much to know that hearsay, even the printed variety, is not always accurate), Paine is a brilliant independent thinker who advocates critically and intelligently evaluating the Bible. He dismisses the need to insist on divine explanations for what is simply the warlike, violent behavior of a typical tribal society, and shows his unique ability to filter the positive aspects of Biblical teaching (i.e. kindness, mercy, regard for one's neighbors) from the more mythological aspects of it (creationism, the fall of Satan, etc.).While it can be argued that because none of us have physically met Thomas Paine and thus have no reason to believe that he is truly the author of these works (just as we have never met Jesus and have no reason to believe that he said or did anything recorded in the Bible), this doesn't really matter. Just like Paine points out that he can take the positive aspects of Jesus' teachings and employ them whether or not he believes in Jesus himself, so can we take the positive aspects of Paine's writings and employ them whether or not we believe that he ever existed.Another thing about \\"Age of Reason\\" that I found particularly gripping is Paine's ability to focus on the big picture regarding nature, rather than the individualized picture. That is, while nature may not seem fair to each of us individuals who suffer and are unhappy, it is fair in a larger sense. While no other species but humans have developed the technology to (mostly) beat the system, for every species there is a species which it preys upon and which preys upon it. Until humans developed the scores of vaccines and weapons and mass production of food that we have, we were just as much a part of this natural balance as any other creature. Every species was equally liable to suffer extinction or overpopulation, and one's rising or falling were based on simple natural laws that applied to everyone -- there is no magic. It is this \\"justice\\" that, I believe, Paine was talking about, not that there is no pain or struggle. Every species has both a degree of robbing, raping, and killing, as well as a degree of giving, nurturing, and reproducing. It's all part of the cycle, and while it is painful, it is neither good nor bad.Anyway, though Paine tends to go off on nitpicking Biblical tangents, the underlying point of Age of Reason is fairly straightforward: the various fallacies and cruelties of the Bible do reveal it as simply another human manuscript, no more divine and no less insightful than any other, and one can and should glean the good while straining out the bad, feeling no obligation to piously swallow it all whole if one does not agree. Or, in a phrase: think critically."},{"Title":"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","review":"Thomas Paine was one of our founding fathers, was a \\"true child of the Enlightenment\\" and believed in the primacy of reason. Through his writings, especially \\"Common Sense,\\" and \\"The American Crisis\\" (\\"these are the times that try men's souls,\\") he became the \\"voice\\" of the American Revolution.He was a brilliant writer who appealed to a mass audience and was far ahead of his time. Carl Sagan tells us that he \\"courageously opposed monarchy, aristocracy, racism, slavery, superstition and sexism when all of these constituted the conventional wisdom.\\"In \\"The Rights of Man\\" he defended the egalitarian principles of the French Revolution against the conservative Edmund Burke.He turned his attention to religion in the \\"Age of Reason\\" and it remains his most controversial work. While he does briefly discuss Islam (which he calls the \\"Turkish\\" church), the book is mainly a long polemic against Judeo-Christianity and, especially, a critique of the \\"holy\\" books of those religions viz. The Old Testament, The New Testament and the Epistles of St. Paul. It is a tour de force and deserves an honored place in the library of those who believe that all the religions of man are human inventions, all are part of human evolution, and none of them have any supernatural content whatsoever.It is better to read Paine in his own words so here, for your edification, are a few \\"Gems from the Age of Reason.\\" Unfortunately it is only possible to scratch the surface in this short review.Old Testament - \\"Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more half the bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon than the word of God.\\"Books of Moses -\\"The five books of Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) are spurious and Moses is not the author of them. Still further, they were not written in the time of Moses, not till several hundred years afterwards; that they are no other than attempted history of the life of Moses, and of the times in which he is said to have lived; and also of the times prior thereto, written by some very ignorant and stupid pretenders to authorship several hundred years after the death of Moses; as men now write histories that heppened, or are supposed to have happened several hundred or several thousand years ago.\\"New Testament - \\"The presumption is that the books called the evangelists and ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were not written by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John and that they are impositions. The disordered state of the history of these four books, the silence of one book upon matters related in the other, and the disagreement that is to be found among them implies that they are the productions of some unconnected individuals many years after the things they pretend to relate, each of whom made his own legend; and not the writings of men living intimately together as the men called the apostles are supposed to have done.\\"Jesus Christ - \\"Had it been the object or intention of Jesus Christ to establish a new religion, he would undoubtedly have written the system himself or procured it to be written in his lifetime. But there is no publication extant authenticated with his name. All the books called the New Testament were written after his death. . . . These books do not give a history of the life of Jesus Christ, but only detached anecdotes about him. It appears from these books that the whole time of his being a preacher was not more than eighteen months; and it is only during this short time that those men became acquainted with him. They make mention of him at the age of twelve years, sitting, they say, among the Jewish doctors, asking and answering questions. . . .From this time there is no account of him for about sixteen years. Where he lived or how he employed himself during this period,is not known. Most probably he was working at his father's trade, which was that of a carpenter. It does not apear that he had any school education, and the probability is that he could not write for his parents were extremely poor.\\"St. Paul - \\"The character of the person called St Paul, according to the accounts given of him, has in it a great deal of violence and fanaticism. He had persecuted with as much heat as he preached afterwards. The stroke he had received, had changed his thinking wihout altering his constitution; and, either as a Jew or a Christian he was the same zealot. Such men are never good moral evidences of any doctrine they preach. They are always in extremes, as well of action as of belief.\\"Invented religions - \\"All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish appear to me to be no other than human inventions set up to enslave and terrify mankind and monopolize power and profit. I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\\"Dark Ages - \\"Latter times have laid all the blame upon the Goths and Vandals, but however unwilling the partizans of the Christian system may be to acknowledge it, it is nevertheless true, that the Age of Ignorance commenced with the Christian system. There was more knowledge in the world before that period than for many centuries afterward.\\"Morality - \\"As to the fragments of morality that are irregularly and thinly scattered in the old and new testaments they make no part of this pretended thing, revealed religion. They are the natural dictates of conscience and bonds by which society it held together, and without which it cannot exist, and are nearly the same in all religions and all societies. In revealed religion morality is banished to make room for an imaginary thing called faith.\\"Mystery - \\"the word mystery cannot be applied to moral truth any more than obscurity can be applied to light. The God in whom we believe is a God of moral truth and not a God of mystery or obscurity. Mystery is the antagonist of truth. It is the fog of human invention that obscures truth and represents it in distortion.\\"To Thine Own Self Be True - \\"I do not condemn those who believe in established religions. They have the right to their beliefs. But it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe.\\""}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],P={key:0},x={key:1};function q(n,o,s,c,r,i){const u=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",R,[(e(!0),t(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),y(u,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",x,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",P,"See more"))],8,E)):p("",!0)])}const C=d(L,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-773f10c8"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/2.md","filePath":"guide/2.md"}'),D={name:"guide/2.md"},W=Object.assign(D,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(C)]))}});export{j as __pageData,W as default};
