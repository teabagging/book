Smith was curious about the big rigid airships of the 1920s and 1930s. He wondered why they had disappeared from the scene of aeronautics. Two of them, the Akron and the Macon, had actually hangared airplanes. Why had such an airplane-carrying airship not been accepted? His inability to find answers to his questions in existing airship literature prompted his extensive research on the subject.

Her numerous paintings lovingly depict the foods and hand-crafted objects used in popular ritual and devotion. In her later life, she produced a number of hauntingly surreal compositions that show vibrant tableaux of typically Mexican foods before barren, somber-hued landscapes with unusually deep perspectives.This book, based on the first comprehensive presentation of her oeuvre in New York, confirms Izquierdo's place in the history of Mexican art. In addition to bringing together some sixty outstanding paintings and works on paper by the artist, the book features three essays on her life and work: curator Elizabeth Ferrer presents an overview of Izquierdo's oeuvre; art historian Olivier Debroise analyzes the artistic relationship between Izquierdo and her mentor Rufino Tamayo, and Elena Poniatowski explores Izquierdo's position as a woman in the Mexican art world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y31dAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+True+Poetry:+The+Art+of+Maria+Izquierdo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reinventing Sunday: Breakthrough Ideas for Transforming Worship","description":"Explores the purposes and possibilities of the worship experience in ways that inspire people to make worship at their church all that it can be.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eZyom-l7tGgC&dq=Reinventing+Sunday:+Breakthrough+Ideas+for+Transforming+Worship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spivakovsky Way of Bowing (Yost Violin System)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oiHGMgEACAAJ&dq=The+Spivakovsky+Way+of+Bowing+(Yost+Violin+System)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Newhall Incident: America's Worst Uniformed Cop Massacre","description":"Retells the circumstances of the Newhall incident in which four California Highway Patrolmen were gunned down when they stopped two armed men at midnight on April 5, 1970","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dhkBAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Newhall+Incident:+America%27s+Worst+Uniformed+Cop+Massacre&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Founding Father: The story of Joseph P.

Ten months later, after one of the most extensive manhunts in nineteenth-century Louisiana, public shock and outrage reemerged when two teenage brothers from France, Ernest and Alexis Blanc, were arrested for the crime. William Arceneaux sets the story of Begnaud's murder, the Blanc brothers' trial, and the media circus surrounding it all against the backdrop of Acadian history -- from the 1604 establishment of a French colony in the Canadian maritime provinces to the eventual creation of a \\"New Acadia\\"in South Louisiana.

As He sat on the Mount of Olives, where in the future His feet shall stand in the day of His manifestation, He prophesied concerning the destruction of the magnificent temple building, and His disciples questioned Him, saying, \\"'Tell us when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign of Thy coming and of the end of the age?\\" (Matt. 24:3, R. V., margin). In answer to their questions, the Lord, looking through the years to the consummation of the age, pointed out certain unmistakable signs by which believers were to know when the age was drawing to a close. He saw kingdom rising against kingdom, and nation against nation. He heard the sound of war and rumors of war. He saw pestilence and earthquake, Bolshevism, Communism, anarchy, lawlessness. He saw a time of trouble, the like of which has not yet been known, a time which He called \\"the great tribulation.\\" He spoke plainly concerning these matters in order that the believers in every age might be fully instructed. Among these conditions and events the Lord warned His disciples concerning the religious conditions that would prevail in the end time. \\"False Christs, and false prophets, shall arise,\\" He declared. So great will be their delusions at that time that \\"if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.\\" The Holy Spirit, coming on the day of Pentecost, heralded through Paul, Peter, James, and John, and the other inspired writers, the same warning, making it known that toward the end of the age the great foundational truths of the gospel will be denied. The word \\"Denial\\" will characterize the religious condition of Christendom when those closing days become reality. The days in which you and I are living are days in which Christians need to know their Bibles, for the only way by which we may know whether or not a system of teaching is of God is by viewing the system through the lens of Holy Writ--reading the system in the light of the Bible and not reading the Bible in the light of the system. Because of the crying need of Biblical light on these erroneous teachings, I gave a series of addresses in the Church of the Open Door, on \\"The Cult Kingdom,\\" selecting ten of the most damaging heresies for discussion. When people saw them revealed in the searchlight of God's Word a large number of men and women, held in their grip, were mercifully delivered. This created a wide-spread interest among God's children, culminating in a demand for the printing of these addresses so that others, caught in the meshes of false doctrine, might also find freedom. I was about to comply with this request when I discovered a book compiled by William C. Irvine, called \\"HERESIES EXPOSED.\\" This book completely covers not only the ten cults I exposed, but many others, so instead of publishing my addresses I have arranged with the writer to allow me to print this special edition of his excellent work. By so doing we meet the demand of friends for this material and provide my radio audience with another valuable book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BgE1uQEACAAJ&dq=Heresies+exposed%3B:+A+brief+critical+examination+in+the+light+of+the+Holy+Scriptures+of+some+of+the+prevailing+heresies+and+false+teachings+of+today&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Analysis of Mind","description":"An unabridged edition with updated footnotes and layout, to include: Recent Criticisms of \\"Consciousness\\" - Instinct and Habit - Desire and Feeling - Influence of Past History on Present Occurrences in Living Organisms - Psychological and Physical Causal Laws - Introspection - The Definition of Perception - Sensations and Images - Memory - Words and Meaning - General Ideas and Thought - Belief - Truth and Falsehood - Emotions and Will - Characteristics of Mental Phenomena","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4dYLAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pocket Scots Dictionary (Scots Language Dictionaries)","description":"Of late, religion seems to be everywhere, suffusing U.S. politics and popular culture and acting as both a unifying and a divisive force. This collection of manifestos, Supreme Court decisions, congressional testimonies, speeches, articles, book excerpts, pastoral letters, interviews, song lyrics, memoirs, and poems reflects the vitality, diversity, and changing nature of religious belief and practice in American public and private life over the last half century. Encompassing a range of perspectives, this book illustrates the ways in which individuals from all along the religious and political spectrum have engaged religion and viewed it as a crucial aspect of society. The anthology begins with documents that reflect the close relationship of religion, especially mainline Protestantism, to essential ideas undergirding Cold War America. Covering both the center and the margins of American religious life, this volume devotes extended attention to how issues of politics, race, gender, and sexuality have influenced the religious mainstream. A series of documents reflects the role of religion and theology in the civil rights, feminist, and gay rights movements as well as in conservative responses. Issues regarding religion and contemporary American culture are explored in documents about the rise of the evangelical movement and the religious right; the impact of \\"new\\" (post-1965) immigrant communities on the religious landscape; the popularity of alternative, New Age, and non-Western beliefs; and the relationship between religion and popular culture. The editors conclude with selections exploring major themes of American religious life at the millennium, including both conservative and New Age millennialism, as well as excerpts that speculate on the future of religion in the United States. The documents are grouped by theme into nine chapters and arranged chronologically therein.

As Turner discovers where these men have landed on the checkerboard of life, he learns about compassion, tolerance, and second chances, and overcomes his fear of death.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EHDKFAC8B0oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Critical Perspectives on Harry Potter (Pedagogy and Popular Culture)","description":"Rev. ed. of: Harry Potter's world. 2003.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DhtZmAEACAAJ&dq=Critical+Perspectives+on+Harry+Potter+(Pedagogy+and+Popular+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Turquoise Tattoo","description":"Fledgling P.I.

The subject of recombinant DNA technology is no longer limited to the research laboratory; it is being discussed in ever-widening medical circles. Introduction to Molecular Medicine is especially written for the physician who is not a genetics expert but wishes to understand this new science and find entry to the more specialized publications. The first chapters present the basic concepts of the human genome and gene regulation. Subsequent chapters consider how today's new approach can be applied in areas such as forensic medicine, transplantation medicine, drug manufacture and genetic engineering. For example, a major section on cancer explores the diagnosis of leukemia and lymphoma through the detection of gene rearrangement and oncongeny mutation. One feature that will especially interest pathologists, pediatricians and residents is the discussion of diagnostic tests that are used in current practice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4zagBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Prepare for Sat II: French (Barron's How to Prepare for the Sat II French)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Hb_BAAAACAAJ&dq=How+to+Prepare+for+Sat+II:+French+(Barron%27s+How+to+Prepare+for+the+Sat+II+French)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beau Geste","description":"In the first place, there was the old standing trouble about the Shuwa Patrol; in the second, the truculent Chiboks were waxing insolent again, and their young men were regarding not the words of their elders concerning Sir Garnet Wolseley, and what happened, long, long ago, after the battle of Chibok Hill. Thirdly, the price of grain had risen to six shillings a saa, and famine threatened; fourthly, the Shehu and Shuwa sheiks were quarrelling again; and, fifthly, there was a very bad smallpox ju-ju abroad in the land (a secret society whose \\"secret\\" was to offer His Majesty's liege subjects the choice between being infected with smallpox, or paying heavy blackmail to the society). Lastly, there was acrimonious correspondence with the All-Wise Ones (of the Secretariat in \\"Aiki Square\\" at Zungeru), who, as usual, knew better than the man on the spot, and bade him do either the impossible or the disastrous. And across all the Harmattan was blowing hard, that terrible wind that carries the Saharan dust a hundred miles to sea, not so much as a sand-storm, but as a mist or fog of dust as fine as flour, filling the eyes, the lungs, the pores of the skin, the nose and throat; getting into the locks of rifles, the works of watches and cameras, defiling water, food and everything else; rendering life a burden and a curse. The fact, moreover, that thirty days' weary travel over burning desert, across oceans of loose wind-blown sand and prairies of burnt grass, through breast-high swamps, and across unbridged boatless rivers, lay between him and Kano, added nothing to his satisfaction. For, in spite of all, satisfaction there was, inasmuch as Kano was rail-head, and the beginning of the first stage of the journey Home. That but another month lay between him and \\"leave out of Africa,\\" kept George Lawrence on his feet. From that wonderful and romantic Red City, Kano, sister of Timbuktu, the train would take him, after a three days' dusty journey, to the rubbish-heap called Lagos, on the Bight of Benin of the wicked West African Coast. There he would embark on the good ship Appam, greet her commander, Captain Harrison, and sink into a deck chair with that glorious sigh of relief, known in its perfection only to those weary ones who turn their backs upon the Outposts and set their faces towards Home. Meantime, for George Lawrence--disappointment, worry, frustration, anxiety, heat, sand-flies, mosquitoes, dust, fatigue, fever, dysentery, malarial ulcers, and that great depression which comes of monotony indescribable, weariness unutterable, and loneliness unspeakable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XiKRCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Southerners at War: The 38th Alabama Infantry Volunteers","description":"The 38th left Mobile in 1863 with 830 eager soldiers only to surrender in May 1865 with only 80 combat-hardened veterans.

He received his Bachelors of Divinity, as well as Ph.D's in Psychology and Philosophy, from Faith Theological Seminary in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Dr. Stranges was a member of the Mayor's Advisory Council of Los Angeles, and a member of the American Association for Social Psychology. He also held a Ph.D. from the National Institute of Criminology, in Washington, D.C., and was an accredited Diplomat of the American Academy of Professional Arts. Dr. Stranges authored several books on scientific and religious subjects, including his classic \\"The Stranger at the Pentagon,\\" which tells the unusual story of a spaceman named Valiant Thor. Because Thor was a real person, who appeared in a public on a few occasions (including at the United Nations headquarters in New York City), the legend of the Stranger at the Pentagon has grown, becoming a real head-scratcher for 21st-century UFO researchers. Today, it is still one of the hottest topics in ufology, having spawned various other books, documentaries, and even feature Hollywood films. What exactly happened to Valiant Thor? Did he get back on his spaceship and return to his home planet, or did he help the U.S. government set up alien-human hybrid experimentation in remote underground bases? Or was he imprisoned - thrown in the clink - by those in the government who have been fighting UFO Disclosure all these years? Since no one knows how long an alien can live, could Valiant Thor still be alive today, in 2016, somewhere in - or under - our nation's capitol? This special reprint - the 6th revised edition from 2001 - features an introduction by Dr. Harley Byrd, nephew of Admiral Richard E. Byrd, and an epilogue by Valiant Thor himself, as well as several interesting photos, covering years of ufological history. A must-have for the serious paranormal researcher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KaM2vgAACAAJ&dq=Stranger+at+the+Pentagon,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pattern Sheets of Origamic Architecture","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jYi5NwAACAAJ&dq=Pattern+Sheets+of+Origamic+Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Left out: The politics of exclusion : essays, 1964-2002","description":"\\"One would be hard-pressed to name a more admirable contemporary American example of the intellectual engage than Martin Duberman. Historian, playwright, memoirist, biographer, social commentator, teacher, activist and assured podium performer, Duberman is an unapologetic, uncategorizable and nonsectarian radical whose constant questioning of conventional wisdoms - even on the left - has made him one of this country's pre-eminent participants in the political and cultural wars that have riven public life.\\"a__In These Times\\"A marvelous collection of a lifetime of courageous writing by a deeply moral and reflective man who has engaged the greatest struggles of our times with an unflinching nerve, a wise heart and a brilliant intellect informed at all times by compassion.\\"a__Jonathan KozolThe lives of a__outsidersa__ have been the focus of Martin Duberman's work as a public intellectual for the past four decades. Best known for his biography of Paul Robeson, Duberman highlights the \\"banding together\\" of the excluded in Left Out. These identity-based movementsa__black power, gay liberation, feminisma__have created a vital and controversial change in American consciousness in recent decades. Duberman's collected essays trace this evolution of thought to the history of dissent from abolitionism through the New Left to today's organizing.Presenting summations of Duberman's views on such matters as race, foreign policy, gender and sexuality, Left Out offers incisive analyses of the split between class-based and identity-based politics on the Left. The \\"godfather\\" of the gay studies movement, Duberman has taken many brave and prescient stands. His writing shows why he is considered a deeply moral and wise man.

What makes computer programs fast or slow? To answer this question, we have to get behind the abstractions of programming languages and look at how a computer really works. This book examines and explains a variety of scientific programming models (programming models relevant to scientists) with an emphasis on how programming constructs map to different parts of the computer's architecture. Two themes emerge: program speed and program modularity. Throughout this book, the premise is to \\"get under the hood,\\" and the discussion is tied to specific programs. The book digs into linkers, compilers, operating systems, and computer architecture to understand how the different parts of the computer interact with programs. It begins with a review of C/C++ and explanations of how libraries, linkers, and Makefiles work. Programming models covered include Pthreads, OpenMP, MPI, TCP/IP, and CUDA.The emphasis on how computers work leads the reader into computer architecture and occasionally into the operating system kernel. The operating system studied is Linux, the preferred platform for scientific computing. Linux is also open source, which allows users to peer into its inner workings. A brief appendix provides a useful table of machines used to time programs. The book's website (https://github.com/divakarvi/bk-spca) has all the programs described in the book as well as a link to the html text.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=87UsDwAAQBAJ&dq=Computer+architecture+(Computer+science+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Business Writing Makeovers: Shortcut Solutions to Improve Your Letters, E-Mails, and Faxes","description":"Do you want to save time and boost your career when you write at the office?

By moving beyond state-dominated,  top-down  interpretations of international relations and exploring instead the engagement and mobilization of whole societies and cultures, it presents a radical new approach to the study of propaganda and American foreign policy and redefines the relationship between the state and private groups in the pursuit and projection of American foreign relations. In a series of valuable case studies, examining relationships between the state and women s groups, religious bodies, labour, internationalist groups, intellectuals, media and students, this volume explores the construction of a state-private network not only as a practical method of communication and dissemination of information or propaganda, but also as an ideological construction, drawing upon specifically American ideologies of freedom and voluntarism. The case studies also analyze the power-relationship between the state and private groups, assessing the extent to which the state was in control of the relationship, and the extent to which private organizations exerted their independence.

Dangerous, filthy, and falling apart, garbage piled on its streets and entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble; New York s terrifying, if liberating, state of nature in 1978 also made it the capital of American culture. Over the next thirty-plus years, though, it became a different place kinder and meaner, richer and poorer, more like America and less like what it had always been. New York, New York, New York, Thomas Dyja s sweeping account of this metamorphosis, shows it wasn t the work of a single policy, mastermind, or economic theory, nor was it a morality tale of gentrification or crime. Instead, three New Yorks evolved in turn. After brutal retrenchment came the dazzling Koch Renaissance and the Dinkins years that left the city s liberal traditions battered but laid the foundation for the safe streets and dotcom excess of Giuliani s Reformation in the  90s. Then the planes hit on 9/11. The shaky city handed itself over to Bloomberg who merged City Hall into his personal empire, launching its Reimagination. From Hip Hop crews to Wall Street bankers, D.V. to Jay-Z, Dyja weaves New Yorkers famous, infamous, and unknown Yuppies, hipsters, tech nerds, and artists; community organizers and the immigrants who made this a truly global place into a narrative of a city creating ways of life that would ultimately change cities everywhere. With great success, though, came grave mistakes. The urbanism that reclaimed public space became a means of control, the police who made streets safe became an occupying army, technology went from a means to the end. Now, as anxiety fills New Yorker s hearts and empties its public spaces, it s clear that what brought the city back proximity, density, and human exchange are what sent Covid-19 burning through its streets, and the price of order has come due. A fourth evolution is happening and we must understand that the greatest challenge ahead is the one New York failed in the first three: The cures must not be worse than the disease. Exhaustively researched, passionately told, New York, New York, New York is a colorful, inspiring guide to not just rebuilding but reimagining a great city.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HC7uDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roosevelt and Hopkins - An Intimate History (Revised Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HAc0nQEACAAJ&dq=Roosevelt+and+Hopkins+-+An+Intimate+History+(Revised+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Not Afraid of Flavor: Recipes from Magnolia Grill","description":"A savory collection of more than 125 recipes from the Magnolia Grill showcases the flavors, ingredients, and culinary expertise that makes this North Carolina eatery a great repository of Southern cuisine.

Highly recommended.\\" Library Journal (starred review) In this gorgeously written and spellbinding historical novel based on Pride and Prejudice, the author of The Clergyman s Wife combines the knowing eye of Jane Austen with the eroticism and Gothic intrigue of Sarah Waters to reimagine the life of the mysterious Anne de Bourgh. As a fussy baby, Anne de Bourgh was prescribed laudanum to quiet her, and now the young woman must take the opium-heavy tincture every day. Growing up sheltered and confined, removed from sunshine and fresh air, the pale and overly slender Anne grew up with few companions except her cousins, including Fitzwilliam Darcy. Throughout their childhoods, it was understood that Darcy and Anne would marry and combine their vast estates of Pemberley and Rosings. But Darcy does not love Anne or want her. After her father dies unexpectedly, leaving her his vast fortune, Anne has a moment of clarity: what if her life of fragility and illness isn t truly real? What if she could free herself from the medicine that clouds her sharp mind and leaves her body weak and lethargic? Might there be a better life without the medicine she has been told she cannot live without? In a frenzy of desperation, Anne discards her laudanum and flees to the London home of her cousin, Colonel John Fitzwilliam, who helps her through her painful recovery. Yet once she returns to health, new challenges await. Shy and utterly inexperienced, the wealthy heiress must forge a new identity for herself, learning to navigate a  season  in society and the complexities of love and passion. The once wan, passive Anne gives way to a braver woman with a keen edge leading to a powerful reckoning with the domineering mother determined to control Anne s fortune . . . and her life. An extraordinary tale of one woman s liberation, The Heiress reveals both the darkness and light in Austen s world, with wit, sensuality, and a deeply compassionate understanding of the human heart.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u1_bDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American artillery and the medal of honor (M-49)","description":"The purpose of this study, commissioned by the Army, was to document the process by which the Congressional Medal of Honor was awarded from December 7, 1941, through September 1, 1948; to identify units in which African Americans served; to identify by name all black soldiers whose names were submitted for the medal and to document any errors in the processing of their nominations; and to compile a list of all black soldiers who received the Distinguished Service Cross, the second highest award.

Sandra Cisneros Fifteen-year-old Ana Cancion never dreamed of moving to America, the way the girls she grew up with in the Dominican countryside did. But when Juan Ruiz proposes and promises to take her to New York City, she has to say yes. It doesn t matter that he is twice her age, that there is no love between them. Their marriage is an opportunity for her entire close-knit family to eventually immigrate.

Lonely and miserable, Ana hatches a reckless plan to escape. But at the bus terminal, she is stopped by Cesar, Juan s free-spirited younger brother, who convinces her to stay. As the Dominican Republic slides into political turmoil, Juan returns to protect his family s assets, leaving Cesar to take care of Ana.

King Henry VI is married by proxy to Margaret of Anjou. French, beautiful and unpopular, her marriage causes a national uproar. At the same time, the infant Margaret Beaufort is made a great heiress and suddenly becomes the most important commodity in the nation. Her childhood is lived in remote, echoing castles, while everyone at King Henry's court competes to be her guardian and engineer an advantageous alliance with her uncle, the Duke of Somerset. With the collapse of Henry VI's hold on France, discord among the English nobles breaks out into civil war. Henry becomes the mad king, and Margaret of Anjou declares herself Queen Regent, left alone to fight for her son's position as rightful heir.

But, after walking on hot coals, following gurus, making lists, learning in their sleep, and reading every book ever written on self-improvement, most people are still stuck in the same self-defeating patterns they were in before. Now there's hope. Workshop facilitator and author Jim Britt has helped thousands of people achieve happiness and fulfillment in their lives by teaching them how to use their inherent authentic power to attract what they desire. Britt reveals how most people allow daily dramas-relationship dramas, health dramas, work dramas, and spiritual dramas-to get in the way of achieving happiness.

In this extraordinary work Nietzsche traces his life, work and development as a philosopher, examines the heroes he has identified with, struggled against and then overcome - Schopenhauer, Wagner, Socrates, Christ - and predicts the cataclysmic impact of his 'forthcoming revelation of all values'. Both self-celebrating and self-mocking, penetrating and strange, Ecce Homo gives the final, definitive expression to Nietzsche's main beliefs and is in every way his last testament.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-g33KQ-osykC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tan veloz como el deseo: Una Novela (Spanish Edition)","description":"En una novela anterior ?Como agua para chocolate? su autora construy  un relato magn fico en torno a la vida de su madre.

In this classic work, world-renowned scholar Adin Steinsaltz answers the major questions asked by modern Jews about the nature of existence in God's universe. The title The Thirteen Petalled Rose is taken from the opening of the classic Jewish text on mysticism, the Zohar, and refers to the \\"collective souls of the Jewish people,\\" which scholars have likened to the fullness of a rose and its thirteen petals. Along with a new preface by the author, this edition contains a new chapter on prayer that provides the most up-to-date account of the Kabbalistic view of devotion. Another new chapter recounts and interprets the prophet Elijah's Introduction to the Zohar. \\"Steinsaltz possesses a mind of the quality that occurs perhaps once or twice in a generation, or several generations.... In [The Thirteen Petalled Rose] one can encounter the classical Jewish mystical view of reality, delineated lucidly, concisely, profoundly and, what is so rare, believingly. It is an utterly authentic expression of Judaism yet so unknown even among the well-informed and therefore so necessary, so welcome.\\" (Herbert Weiner, Oxford University)","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yHkMtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Thirteen+Petalled+Rose&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fight Back and Win: My Thirty-year Fight Against Injustice--and How You Can Win Your Own Battles","description":"Voted by her peers as one of the best lawyers in America, and described by Time magazine as \\"one of the nation's most effective advocates of family rights and feminist causes,\\" Allred has devoted her career to fighting for civil rights and has won hundreds of millions of dollars for victims of abuse. She has taken on countless institutions to promote equality, including the Boy Scouts, the Friars Club, and the United States Senate. And as the attorney for numerous high-profile clients including Nicole Brown Simpson's family, actress Hunter Tylo, and Amber Frey, Scott Peterson's girlfriend Allred has helped victims assert and protect their rights. Throughout her memoir, Allred offers colorful sometimes shocking examples of self-empowerment from her personal and professional life. Presenting nearly fifty of her most memorable cases, Allred takes us deep inside the justice system to show how it's possible to win even in the face of staggering odds.

Isn t it odd and reminiscent of the hand of God that the director of the leading organization on family turned out to be a guy whose own background as a kid and son were pretty messed up? Or could it be that successful parenting is discovered not in the perfect, peaceful household but in the midst of battles and messy situations, where God must constantly be called to the scene?

Maybe even because of them. It s not about becoming a perfect father. It s about trying to become a better father, each and every day.

With inviting, even dramatic, prose, it recounts the story of the great Apostle to the Nations. This is no dry tome or ponderous biography. Nor is its subject a \\"safe\\" historical figure, irrelevant to the issues of today: St. Paul remains controversial. Some scholars claim he \\"invented\\" Christianity. They believe his message radically departed from what Jesus taught. The Christian faith, so the claim runs, is the creation of Paul's religious experience, not the doctrine of Jesus. Callewaert rejects this theory, as do many other scholars. His interpretation rests on the Bible and the abiding tradition of the ages, rather than tendentious theories or ideologically-motivated revisions. Yet Callewaert's work is no anti-scholarly screed. The World of Saint Paul provides a popular, yet expert account of the Apostle and his age. For those who know little about St. Paul-which includes many Christians-it is a superb introduction. \\"In my presentation of St. Paul, I have tried to absorb the spirit of his epoch as far as I could, and put less trust in the present-day judgments than in the abiding traditions of the ages. If I have perhaps evoked a little too much history and pursued rather too long a road in regions so rich with a past, I have always made sure to trace a path which brings us back to this intrepid and tenacious Jew who will steadily appear in stark relief.\\" From the Preface","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=64xHDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cemetery Nights (Poets, Penguin)","description":"From the fabulous storytelling of our dreams to the mute passions of domestic life, Stephen Dobyns explores a full range of human experience in these narrative poems.

Part craft and part science, part blue-collar and part white-collar, technical work demands skill and knowledge but is rarely rewarded with commensurate status or salary. The book first considers the anomalous nature of technical work and the difficulty of locating it in any conventional theoretical framework. Only an ethnographic approach, studying the actual doing of the work, will make sense of the subject, the authors conclude. The studies that follow report daily practice filled with disjunctures and ironies that mirror the ambiguities of technical work's place in the larger culture. On the basis of those studies, the authors probe questions of policy, management, and education. Between Craft and Science considers the cultural difficulties in understanding technical work and advances coherent, practice-oriented insights into this anomalous phenomenon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Di5zDwAAQBAJ&dq=Between+Craft+and+Science:+Technical+Work+in+the+United+States+(Collection+on+Technology+and+Work)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Haunted Lakes: Great Lakes Ghost Stories, Superstitions and Sea Serpents","description":"Presents a collection of legendary tales and ghost stories that focus on the Great Lakes Region.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W4_hAAAAMAAJ&dq=Haunted+Lakes:+Great+Lakes+Ghost+Stories,+Superstitions+and+Sea+Serpents&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harry Potter und der Feuerkelch (German Audio CD (20 Compact Discs) Edition of \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\")","description":"Improve your balance, strength, focus and martial skills as you master this elegant and effective weapon of Gong Fu with America's most respected author and teacher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DKgAAAAACAAJ&dq=Harry+Potter+und+der+Feuerkelch+(German+Audio+CD+(20+Compact+Discs)+Edition+of+%22Harry+Potter+and+the+Goblet+of+Fire%22)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Vitamins and Minerals","description":"Shows readers how to get all the vitamins and minerals they need from the food they eat, without the use of supplements, and offers comprehensive information on each essential vitamin and mineral, including the best sources of each nutrient.

While describing the history of Portugal from antiquity to the present, the author - without going 'into ecstasies' - has attempted to bring into perspective those many aspects of Portugal's past most likely to interest the educated visitor. Portugal has been a country in her own right since early in the 12th century. Long referred to as being 'Britain's oldest ally', but often placed in the shade of Spain, she deserves equal attention. Whether it be her outstanding voyages of discovery, or the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, or her more recent bloodless 'revolution', Portugal has remained in the limelight of European history.Complete and concise history right up to contemporary eventsA-Z Historical GazetteerList of Monarchs/Presidents/Prime Ministers","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HytbPgAACAAJ&dq=Portugal:+A+Traveller%27s+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"What Is Random?: Chance and Order in Mathematics and Life","description":"In this fascinating book, mathematician Ed Beltrami takes a close enough look at randomness to make it mysteriously disappear.

Her multidimensional reading of the Bible draws on a tradition much older than that of the West while it simultaneously incorporates the insights of contemporary feminist and Third World theologies. Seeing herself as \\"wanderer\\" between the worlds of East and West, Pui-lan Kwok draws on the work of contemporary biblical scholars, as well as the millennia-old commentaries on the Book of Change, the Dao de Jing, and the Bhagavad Gita. Her creativity and imagination come into play as she gradually, inseparably links reader, text, and context. The first three chapters locate the context from which she approaches the Bible as an Asian woman. Pui-lan considers Asian traditions as well as the social biography of Asian peoples and discusses the complex issues of using the Bible in feminist theology. Chapters Four and Five approach the unique Asian context with its long traditions of orality and exegesis of ancient scriptures. Chapter Six analyzes the challenges of Asian critics to western interpretations of scripture and raises sharp issues of colonial oppression. Finally, Discovering the Bible in the Non-Biblical World shows how the multiple oppressions of women provide a context for rediscovering the Bible's liberating message. \\"Must reading for anyone engaged in biblical studies, cross-cultural education and feminist theology.

These discoveries appear to be critical for implementing perpendicular magnetic recording into an actual disk drive. This book addresses all the open questions and issues which need to be resolved before perpendicular recording can finally be implemented successfully, and is the first monograph in many years to address this subject.

Although many people view virtual reality as a totally new phenomenon, it has its foundations in an unrecognized history of immersive images. Indeed, the search for illusionary visual space can be traced back to antiquity. In this book, Oliver Grau shows how virtual art fits into the art history of illusion and immersion. He describes the metamorphosis of the concepts of art and the image and relates those concepts to interactive art, interface design, agents, telepresence, and image evolution. Grau retells art history as media history, helping us to understand the phenomenon of virtual reality beyond the hype. Grau shows how each epoch used the technical means available to produce maximum illusion. He discusses frescoes such as those in the Villa dei Misteri in Pompeii and the gardens of the Villa Livia near Primaporta, Renaissance and Baroque illusion spaces, and panoramas, which were the most developed form of illusion achieved through traditional methods of painting and the mass image medium before film. Through a detailed analysis of perhaps the most important German panorama, Anton von Werner's 1883 The Battle of Sedan, Grau shows how immersion produced emotional responses. He traces immersive cinema through Cinerama, Sensorama, Expanded Cinema, 3-D, Omnimax and IMAX, and the head mounted display with its military origins. He also examines those characteristics of virtual reality that distinguish it from earlier forms of illusionary art. His analysis draws on the work of contemporary artists and groups ART+COM, Maurice Benayoun, Charlotte Davies, Monika Fleischmann, Ken Goldberg, Agnes Hegedues, Eduardo Kac, Knowbotic Research, Laurent Mignonneau, Michael Naimark, Simon Penny, Daniela Plewe, Paul Sermon, Jeffrey Shaw, Karl Sims, Christa Sommerer, and Wolfgang Strauss. Grau offers not just a history of illusionary space but also a theoretical framework for analyzing its phenomenologies, functions, and strategies throughout history and into the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7OYaXjE5_lcC&dq=Behind+Bars:+a+Panorama+of+Prisons+Through+the+Ages&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treehouse tales (The Muffin family picture Bible)","description":"Contemporary tales about the Muffin family are correlated with related stories from the Bible.

This is the memoir of the undisputed top gun of World War I s aerial war, Captain Manfred von Richthofen, who shot down 80 Allied aircraft. Originally published in German in late 1917 as Der Rote Kampfflieger (The Red Air Fighter), it was a runaway bestseller. The English language edition followed in 1918 without any official deal with the German publishers as it was argued that Richthofen s accounts of combat against the Allied air force aircraft provided valuable intellilgence to use against the enemy. Originally a cavalryman, Manfred transferred to the Imperial German Army Air Service in May 1915 and quickly distinguished himself as a fighter pilot. During 1917 he became leader of Jagdgeschwader 1. It was better known as the  Flying Circus  because of its aircraft s bright colors and because the squadron moved like a traveling circus, from place to place as a self-contained unit so that it appeared wherever the fighting was the thickest. It would be operating at Verdun one week only to be north of Arras the next. A few days later, it would be down on the Somme. Richthofen was a brilliant tactician, although his modus operandi was as simple as it was deadly. Typically, he would dive from above to attack with the advantage of the sun behind him (the victim would not see him coming, blinded by glare), with other pilots of his flying circus covering his rear and flanks. By 1918, he was regarded as a national hero in Germany and held the country s highest honor, the  Blue Max.  Richthofen was well-known in the Allied countries and a respected advisor of military aviators. Newly illustrated with twenty-one contemporary images. Includes many of the Red Baron s eighty combat reports, contemporary interviews with a selection of his surviving victims, and an extra chapter on the death in combat of von Richthofen.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=utgvEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Henry Ward Beecher: An American Portrait","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Collusion: Memoir of a Young Girl and Her Ballet Master","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Barron's How to Prepare for Sat II: Spanish (Barron's How to Prepare for the Sat II Spanish)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Eqoo_YHv114C&dq=Barron%27s+How+to+Prepare+for+Sat+II:+Spanish+(Barron%27s+How+to+Prepare+for+the+Sat+II+Spanish)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kerygma and Myth: A Theological Debate","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Dn89AAAAYAAJ&dq=Kerygma+and+Myth:+A+Theological+Debate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just a Dream","description":"When he has a dream about a future Earth devastated by pollution, Walter begins to understand the importance of taking care of the environment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KqEdBwAAQBAJ&dq=Just+a+Dream&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psychopathology of everyday life,","description":"This early work by Sigmund Freud was originally published in 1901 and we are now republishing it with a brand new introductory biography.

S. Naipaul and author of Firefles and The Chip-Chip Gatherers. Fireflies, his first novel, published in 1970 and longlisted for the 'Lost Man Booker Award' in 2010, is set in Naipaul's native Trinidad. It includes a new foreword by Amit Chaudhuri. The Khojas are Trinidad's most venerated Hindu family. Rigidly orthodox, presiding over acres of ill-kept sugarcane and hoards of jewellery enthusiastically guarded by old Mrs Khoja, they seem to have triumphed more by default than by anything else. Only 'Baby' Khoja, who is parcelled off into an arranged marriage with a blustering bus driver, proves an exception to this rule. Her heroic story - of resourcefulness, strength and survival - is the gleaming thread in Shiva Naipaul's ferociously comic and profoundly sad first novel.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sLqBuDYVL78C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Little Big Hill","description":"The battle that unfolded at the Little Big Horn River on June 25, 1876, marked a watershed in the history of the Plains Indians.

This volume seeks to explain the circumstances culminating in the near-destruction of the 7th Cavalry Regiment by a close examination of timing, setting every event to a specific moment based on accounts of the battle's participants.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vVyQBQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Little+Big+Hill&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seven Wild Pigs","description":"A collection of stories, many in rhyme, about such things as a hungry crocodile, a foolish artist, the value of drinking apple juice, and how it feels to be a bottle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IXWXPAAACAAJ&dq=Seven+Wild+Pigs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Man: The Dwelling Place of God","description":"Man: the Dwelling Place of God, A.W.

He sees the Holy Spirit as \\"buried dynamite\\" in the modern church. A.W. Tozer discusses a force powerful enough to blow open spiritual pitfalls that plague the stagnant believer but is largely unrealized in today s world. This devotional goes through many of the defining characteristics of the Holy Spirit. Each day emphasizes a building of the believer's internal altar; to hunger and thirst after the Spirit of God. A.W. Tozer simplifies many of the basic aspects of the Christian faith, asserting that there is even no worship without the Holy Spirit. This yearlong devotional will leave you with a greater sense of your place in the Kingdom of God, as well as a fellowship with God s Spirit. After all, we are to \\"enter into the fullness of the Spirit so that God s Son may be glorified in us!\\" \\"Tozers ability to separate the wheat from the chaff; the lesser from the greater; reflects his great vision of God.\\" - Dr. Erwin W.

According to such spiritualities, the most important fact about human beings is that we are sinners in need of salvation. In From Image to Likeness, William Simpson suggests that our human natures are unfinished and that the Christian spiritual journey finds its fullest expression when one's life reflects God's creative and sustaining activity. We are already bearers of the divine image because we are God's creatures, and we resemble that from which we came. We grow into the divine likeness as we cooperate with grace and begin to manifest God's presence in the world.By emphasizing the incarnational aspects of the Christian message, Simpson offers a traditionally rooted alternative to these Augustinian spiritualities. Here, the spiritual journey emerges not as a flight from one's wounded and corrupt nature, but as the ongoing discovery of one's true nature as a child of God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fgLzPAAACAAJ&dq=From+Image+to+Likeness:+The+Christian+Journey+into+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Slave and Citizen: The Classic Comparative Study of Race Relations in the Americas","description":"Originally published in 1947, Slave and Citizen is a classic in the field of comparative slave history and race relations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TVFXLt7y1HoC&dq=Slave+and+Citizen:+The+Classic+Comparative+Study+of+Race+Relations+in+the+Americas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Origins: Today's science, tomorrow's myth : an objective study of creationism, evolution, and catastrophism","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mayZPQAACAAJ&dq=Origins:+Today%27s+science,+tomorrow%27s+myth+:+an+objective+study+of+creationism,+evolution,+and+catastrophism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wreckage of Agathon","description":"A wonderful exploration into the maturation process across the course of human life.

Do you feel like no one understands where you're coming from? Now there's a blueprint that can offer you comfort, motivation, and real solutions. When Yasmin Shiraz launched Mad Rhythms, a hip-hop magazine aimed at college students, she visited youth organizations and colleges across the country to teach young people how to effectively pursue their dreams. Drawn to Yasmin's confidence and determination, young women in particular sought her opinion on topics such as body image, popularity, dating, sexuality, child-parent relationships, and social and academic pressures. Yasmin could easily speak to those issues. She struggled with many of the same concerns when she was younger. Inspired by the common threads connecting each generation, Yasmin developed The Blueprint for My Girls to help young women discover who they are, develop a sense of self, and stay positive. In the book, Yasmin pairs her personal stories with 99 \\"expressions\\" designed to help readers deal with situations they may not feel comfortable discussing with friends and family. Each expression is accompanied by exercises to help readers progress on their journey. Staying real without being preachy, The Blueprint for My Girls will be a solution giver, a problem solver, and a friend in need for generations to come.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f0ou5mLAoNMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Environmental Ecology, Second Edition: The Ecological Effects of Pollution, Disturbance, and Other Stresses","description":"Thoroughly revised and significantly expanded, the Second Edition of Environmental Ecology provides new case studies and in-depth treatment of the effects of pollution and other disturbances on our oceans, lakes, forests, and air.

A Polish Son in the Motherland is the story of a search for roots and for the reasons why one family s ties were severed more than fifty years ago. Along the way, we see what half a century of communism did to Poland and how the residue of World War II lingers. The author s search begins inauspiciously, but he soon meets a local wine merchant and her son, who are eager to reveal the secrets of Nowe Miasto Lubawskie, the town near which his grandmother was born. After he moves in with Adam, a local entrepreneur who trades in everything from shoes and cosmetics to computers and jam, he begins to master his ancestral language and learn the ways of the community from Adam s mother, who loves long walks in the woods and meals made from what she picks there. Kniffel s search for a connection to Poland is propelled by memories of the stories his grandmother told him about her emigration to Michigan in 1913. While his family eludes him, the adventure becomes an investigation into the relationship between mothers and the legacy they give their sons. Poles who emigrated to America, the author concludes, must have been particularly good at assimilating into American culture. Less than fifty years after his maternal grandparents arrived in the United States, barely a trace of their Polishness existed in their grandchildren. Through his grandparents  struggles, their children became American and created a new world for themselves and their descendants. In returning to Poland himself, Kniffel sought and found a bridge to the  Great Migration  that changed the lives of so many millions and millions yet to come.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IGwY0etjdUEC&dq=A+Polish+Son+in+the+Motherland:+An+American%27s+Journey+Home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pandora Key (Alex Shanahan)","description":" A thriller with suspense, intelligence, and compassion  (Alafair Burke, New York Timesbestselling author of The Wife).

When Ball Four was published in 1970, it created a firestorm. Bouton was called a Judas, a Benedict Arnold, and a  social leper  for having violated the  sanctity of the clubhouse.  Baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn tried to force Bouton to sign a statement saying the book wasn t true. Ballplayers, most of whom hadn t read it, denounced the book. It was even banned by a few libraries. Almost everyone else, however, loved Ball Four. Fans liked discovering that athletes were real people often wildly funny people. David Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer for his reporting on Vietnam, wrote a piece in Harper s that said of Bouton:  He has written . . . a book deep in the American vein, so deep in fact that it is by no means a sports book.  Today Ball Four has taken on another role as a time capsule of life in the sixties.  It is not just a diary of Bouton s 1969 season with the Seattle Pilots and Houston Astros,  says sportswriter Jim Caple.  It s a vibrant, funny, telling history of an era that seems even further away than four decades. To call it simply a  tell all book  is like describing The Grapes of Wrath as a book about harvesting peaches in California.  Includes a new foreword by Jim Bouton s wife  An irreverent, best-selling book that angered baseball s hierarchy and changed the way journalists and fans viewed the sports world.

Known internationally for two of the films she made for him, Triumph of the Will and Olympia, Riefenstahl's demanding and obsessive style introduced unusual angles, new approaches to tracking shots, and highly symbolic montages. Despite her lifelong claim to be an apolitical artist, Riefenstahl's monumental and nationalistic vision of Germany's traditions and landscape served to idealize the cause of one of the world's most violent and racist regimes. Riefenstahl ardently cast herself as a passionate young director who caved to the pressure to serve an all-powerful F hrer, so focused on reinventing the cinema that she didn't recognize the goals of the Third Reich until too late. J rgen Trimborn's revelatory biography celebrates this charismatic and adventurous woman who lived to 101, while also taking on the myths surrounding her. With refreshing distance and detailed research, Trimborn presents the story of a stubborn and intimidating filmmaker who refused to be held accountable for her role in the Holocaust but continued to inspire countless photographers and filmmakers with her artistry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ql_FeGlS2oIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Life of Mozart (Musical Lives)","description":"A biography of Mozart, placing his life within the history of his revolutionary age.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UZkq414Q0X0C&dq=The+Life+of+Mozart+(Musical+Lives)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sand dune pony,","description":"Sand Dune Pony is the story of a boy named Pete and a wild mustang pony set in what is now Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado.

Established in 1916, BMW is one of the auto and motorcycle industry's oldest and most-respected car and motorcycle manufacturers. Over the past century, the company went through myriad developments. The BMW Century chronicles this remarkable transportation company through images of the cars and motorcycles it manufactured, from the 1923 R32 motorcycle to sleek electric cars of today. This handsome volume is filled with images, history, and in-depth looks at the incredible machines BMW created year after year. The BMW Century showcases how the company's new visionary team systematically rebuilt BMW in the post-World War II years into the spectacular success we know today - that is, a company with sales projected to be upwards of two million cars annually by 2016, led by its 3-series, the best-selling luxury-performance car in the world. BMW's motorcycle division is no less legendary. It began with the 1923 avant-garde R32, which featured a 180-degree, horizontally opposed twin, the engine configuration that would become BMW's hallmark. Along the way, BMW would use that configuration to power groundbreaking machines like the R90S, R100RS, and R80GS. Beginning in 1983, they would add three- and four-cylinder machines to their offerings, culminating in today's spectacular S1000RR sport bike. From the pre-war motorcycles to the iconic R-series twins of the 1970s and 80s to the mighty M-series cars and superbikes of today, The BMW Century offers a full review of German engineering at its finest. The book is illustrated with hundreds of historic, contemporary, and racing photographs - many sourced from BMW's archives - and detailed text relating the BMW's full history. This is the one volume no BMW aficionado can be without.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vNUsDQAAQBAJ&dq=Ultimate+Performance+Cars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Julianna Could See","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XKHAHMhZd1QC&dq=What+Julianna+Could+See&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quantitation of valvular regurgitation by echo doppler: An in vitro study","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KL2-tgAACAAJ&dq=Quantitation+of+valvular+regurgitation+by+echo+doppler:+An+in+vitro+study&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What I Believe","description":"Introduces Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Shinto, and Taoism through the eyes of young members of those faiths.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5QoUGWPv7EAC&dq=What+I+Believe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Second Evil (Fear Street Cheerleaders, No. 2)","description":"Eager to put her sister Bobbi's tragic death behind her, Corky Corcoran rejoins the Shadyside cheerleading squad and becomes friends with Kim and Debra, but a series of murders could dampen her hopes.

Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming  unstuck in time.  An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut s writing the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as  the kind of writer who made people young people especially want to write.  George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be  the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.  Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era s uncertainties.  Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.

The illegitimate child of an impoverished and indifferent mother, Williams began performing publicly at the age of seven when she became known admiringly in her native Pittsburgh as \\"the little piano girl of East Liberty,\\" playing one day for the Mellons at bridge teas and the next in gambling dens where the hat was passed for change. She grew up with the jazz of the early part of the century, championed by the likes of Earl Hines and Fats Waller, yet unlike so many other musicians of her time, she was open to new forms in jazz -- she was an early champion of bop, and a mentor and colleague to its central figures, such as Thelonius Monk and Bud Powell -- and in broader musical styles as well (after her conversion to Catholicism, she wrote masses and other sacred music). Most of the other famous women in jazz -- Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald -- have been singers. Williams was instead a phenomenal pianist who performed solo, with small groups and big bands, in vaudeville and clubs, and on numerous records. But she is equally well known today as a composer and arranger of remarkable versatility and power, having worked with, among others, Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman. Her compositions have been recorded by artisits as varied as Marian McPartland, Dizzy Gillespie, Nat \\"King\\" Cole, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, and herself -- and, more recently, by cutting-edge players Geri Allen and Dave Douglas. But Williams was more than \\"just a musician\\"; her interests were catholic in both senses, and she struggled to combine her love of music with her love of God. She was a tireless humanitarian, and made ongoing attempts to help dozens of down-and-out musicians; in the 1950s, her apartment was, at times, virtually a rehab. Though she was often in emotional despair, she found comfort for her many disappointments and hurts not only in her music but in her spirituality. Linda Dahl, granted unprecedented access to the large Williams archive, has given us the whole of Williams's very full life, from her often harrowing days on the road to her tumultuous marriages and love affairs, from the ups and downs of her unique fifty-year career to the remarkable spirituality that came to inform both her daily life and her music. This is a striking protrait of one of our least understood and most important musicians.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BWs_2NLIUFUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Steve Kaufman's Four-Hour Bluegrass Workout","description":"(Homespun Tapes).

Being a mother of a child with special needs who has been on a gluten free and dairy free diet for the past several years, I thought it would be a great idea to bring forward some of the well known as well as lesser known recipes from parts of Asia. All of the recipes in this book are tried and tested with very little substitutions made so they taste as they traditionally should. The book features recipes from parts of Asia (India, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia). The recipes have been categorized as appetizers, main courses and desserts. The recipes are written keeping in mind that a child/person with allergies to gluten and dairy is easily included at the dinner table. Recipes featured in this book range from Vegetable Pulao to desserts like mango custard and bur bur cha cha. This book is ideal for people who love Asian food and is a handy guide for simple everyday cooking.

Lisander, the poet laureate, trades the golden laurel crown of yesteryear for a career as a rock musician. Dina, once the squirrel-costumed prostitute of Marina s zoological luxury brothel, is now the mistress of the radish processing plant. Nelson goes nuts for the squirrel and Bernab? poses as a Nazi concentration camp survivor. The civic leaders who resort to the wilderness of Lake Okeechobess spend their days planning the liberation of their homeland while their wives toil in the radish plant and find consolidation in their shared memories of the Xawa Ladies Tennis Club and their canasta parties. While Holy Radishes is a parable of the Cuban immigrant community, it is, foremost, the story of Nelly Pardo, a dreamer who envisions herself in the paradise called Mondovi, where she has an intimate relationship with Rigoletto, her truffle-loving pet pig. And it is to fulfill her dreams for a better world that she will team up with redneck ex-cheerleader Mrs. James B. III who fabricates a mythical antebellum past to rival that of the immigrants. This unlikely alliance reflects the capacity of women to endure, survive, and overcome.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f-u2ZzdAzqQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"And There Was Light...Autobiography Of Jacques Lusseyran...Blind Hero Of The French Resistance...Second Edition,Revised 2005","description":"This handbook in practical spirituality proposes that the level of stress, violence, fear and disconnect from Nature in the global society has risen in direct proportion to a fall in the collective level of conscious awareness. In order to reverse this trend a conscious impulse is required. Human beings need to rediscover the mystical underpinning of all religions and the engine of spiritual transformation: the art of presence. Only by learning to be present and stay present is it possible to dissolve harmful energy - in the form of false opinions and negative feelings - and create positive energy that imbues actions with intelligence, compassion and respect for the sacredness of all life. To this end, a practice in sensory awareness is offered. It is called 'the Pause'. Pausing affirms the body-mind continuum by empowering the senses as conduits of conscious awareness. When pausing is then applied to ordinary activities such as speaking, working, thinking and relating to others, spiritual evolution accelerates. The fruit of a re-awakened life is healing   for ourselves, for society, and for the entire Earth community.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NtH4LZI_PYUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","description":"New York Times bestselling author Christina Dodd, one of the most acclaimed authors of historical romance, makes a dazzling foray into contemporary fiction in this intriguing and sensuous novel about a hard-working young woman who mistakenly falls in love with Boston's wealthiest bachelor.

How we understand the communities we lead informs the many practical judgments we make about directions to take, structures to create, processes to initiate, and values to uphold. Bennett argues that faculty may understand their departments or institutions in one of two ways: as simply aggregations of individuals or as communities of intertwined persons. From these views, two different leadership values and positions emerge. The first disposes us toward seeing academic conflict as inevitable and elevates heroic leadership styles where power is understood in terms of advancing one agenda over competitors. The second underwrites leadership as supporting openness to others and emphasizes the vital contributions that can follow. By providing specific illustrations of the two modes of leadership and the nature of hospitality and openness, Academic Life presents a strong platform from which to build a rich and rewarding academic community.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qDRWAAAACAAJ&dq=Academic+Life:+Hospitality,+Ethics,+and+Spirituality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Voices of Babylon","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fM-NzQEACAAJ&dq=Voices+of+Babylon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Born to Slow Horses (Wesleyan Poetry Series)","description":"Winner of the Griffin International Poetry Prize (2006) Kamau Brathwaite's Born to Slow Horses is a series of poetic meditations on islands and exile, language and ritual, and the force of personal and historical passions and griefs.

But when we mentally grasp and emotionally cling to our wants and worries with all our energy, we lose our own enlightened freedom and healing power, only to gain stress and exhaustion, suffering and overexcitement, like the turbulent waves rolling on the surface of the ocean. Our minds possess the power to heal pain and stress, and to blossom into peace and joy, by loosening the clinging attitudes that Buddhists call \\"grasping at self.\\" If we apply the mind's healing power, we can heal not only our mental and emotional afflictions, but physical problems also. This book is an invitation to awaken the healing power of mind through inspiring images and sounds, mindful movements, positive perceptions, soothing feelings, trusting confidence, and the realization of openness. The healing principle on which these exercises are based is the universal nature and omnipresent power envisioned in Mahayana Buddhism. Yet for healing, we don't have to be believers in any particular faith. We can heal body and mind simply by being what we truly are, and by allowing our own natural healing qualities to manifest: a peaceful and open mind, a loving and positive attitude, and warm, joyful energy in a state of balance and harmony.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gvVHdGjZNSgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leo the lioness","description":"Tibb is a Leo and Leos are as fierce as they come Thirteen-year-old Tibb knows she has the best sign of the zodiac.

The result of more than eleven years of deep investigation on the subject, this New History is by far the best available in the 21st century. It studies specifically the vibrato and its evolution. A study of the main violin schools of the world, with special emphasis in their evolution, and the direct conexi n teacher-pupil. In the course of this history we will see how the great performers became, often, the great masters of new great violinists, who, in their turn, became the teachers of new superlative performers, and so on, in an uninterrupted chain of teacher-pupil intercommunication, the interrelation of whom is carefully studied, to higlight the evolution of the main violin playing schools. For each violinist we give a list of all the valuable instruments they owned and played, i.e. Stradivarius, Guarneri del Gesu, etc.. Such a complete and interesting information is not available in any other history. Contains a list of cassettes we have gathered for the better understanding of our players. Designed to be easily read by everyone, it has not complicated esoteric terms, but is written in plain words that everybody will understand. There is no need to be a professional musican to enjoy it. All you need to be is a music lover. But the main novelty is the sensational discovery of the real founder of the modern-vibrato violin school, with all kind of evidence, even written authentic letters that attest to it. This violinst is unknown in the present time. Contains very useful graphs of all the main schools, for an easy understanding of their evolution. Contains an encyclopaedia of all terms and names of the book that are not sufficently explained in it. Here the reader will be acquainted with the meaning of many musical terms that, although well know to musicians, are not so much known to others, who not being musicians, are, nevertheless, music lovers. But the encyclopaedia contains much more than that: men of letters, politicians, personalities, singers, pianists, composers, painters, etc. are duly explained in it. Done with loving care it sometimes surpasses its parent the book. Contains five sensational, unpublished, autographed letters by Kreisler, that will make readers tremble, plus the contentent of many other unpublished ones, by the most important musicians of the second half of the XIX century. Contains a series of very captivating collateral disquisitions on Modern abstract art; composer versus interpreter; the use of ornamentation; the easiness to reed music; Ingres and his violi; lisztomania and others. In a word, this \\"New history\\" is new because: It studies in depth the vibrato and its evolution. Links teachers to pupils, who become teacher in their turn, in a comprehensive general outlook of schools' evolution. It provides us with the list of all the valuable instruments of all our fiddlers. Contains a list of recommended cassettes, as musical examples. Easy to understand by every one, it avoids esoteric, pedantic terminology, and is written in plain laguage. It discovers, for the first time in history, the true founder of the vibrato, with all sort of evidence. With useful graphs of the main schools. Contains an encyclopaedia, which no other book of the genre has. The autographed unpublished letters of Kreisler will give the creeps to the reader.

Henrik Ibsen in A Doll s House A Doll s House, the three-act play by Henrik Ibsen, which premiered at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1879, is one of the most well-known and frequently performed of modern plays. It richly displays the genius with which Ibsen pioneered modern, real?istic prose drama. The play is significant for the way it deals with the fate of the central character Nora, a married woman, who at that time in Norway lacked opportunities for self-fulfillment in a male-dominated world. Ibsen was inspired by the belief that  a woman cannot be herself in modern society,  since it is  an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint.  \\\\ The play aroused great controversy at the time, as it concludes with Nora leaving her husband and children because she wants to discover herself. The outrage went far beyond the theater to the world of news?papers and society. In Nora, Ibsen epitomized the human struggle against the humiliating constraints of social conformity. Even today many agree that the theme of the play is the need of every individual to be able to find out the kind of person he or she is and to be allowed to become that person.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LjXfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Helpful Ghost (Haunting Regency Romance)","description":"Harry, a ghost visible only to those in love, attempts to solve the love puzzle involving Becky Beal; her betrothed, Lord Andrew Marleigh; her true love, the butcher's son; and Lord Andrew's true love (and Becky's sister), Alice.

There, circa 1742, he marries Anne Lincoln. Anne is the daughter of Mordecai Lincoln II, a land baron and ironmaster, and first wife Hannah Salter, the daughter and granddaughter of a powerful New Jersey political family; destined to become the great-great grandparents of the nation s 16th president. Although William and Anne would have eleven children, after years of struggle the only child who would survive to adulthood would be their second child, Benjamin. Their trials are further complicated by the 1736 death of Mordecai, which had left his second wife, the former Mary Robeson, widowed with three young boys to rear alone. When she decides to remarry, William is drawn into a contract, devised to protect the inheritance of Mordecai s sons, wherein he agrees to relinquish fifteen years of his life tethered to the yoke of the Lincoln legacy. He would not be freed from that promise until 1757, when the youngest of Anne s half-brothers reached the age of twenty-one. In 1765 the immigration of his dearest friend and brother-in-law,  Virginia John  Lincoln, to the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, brings a restlessness for William, which is quelled only by realizing an earlier ambition. 1768-80 finds William Tallman as the proprietor of an  Inn  in Reading, Pennsylvania, located approximately ten miles from his newly constructed stone residence, built on the site of the old Lincoln log house, on the banks of Amity s Schuylkill River. Then, as Colonists can no longer deny that they are at war with England, in 1779, with an attack on Georgia s Savannah, Thomas Jefferson, the governor of Virginia, calls for the enlistment of all able-bodied men. Answering the \`Patriot Cause  of the American Revolution, William and Anne s son, Benjamin, now the husband of Dinah Boone, and the father of seven surviving children, joins De Best s Troops of the First Partisan Legion, leaving his father to cope with matters in Amity Township, and the Inn in Reading. After the war, Benjamin returns to his family, immigrants to the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, where he and his father, William Tallman, establish plantations, comparable to that of  Virginia John,  i.e., Anne s brother, Benjamin s uncle, and William s brother-in-law. The Linville Creek Baptist Church is the heart of the community, where Deacons John Lincoln, Jr. and Benjamin Tallman, supported by his wife, the former Dinah Boone, cousin of Daniel, become pillars of that admirable institution. There, also, Ben and Dinah s progeny become acquainted with the Harrison family, founders of Harrisonburg, Virginia  relationships which, ultimately, result in the marriages of five of their children: three daughters and two sons. Then, with the turn of the century, now president, Thomas Jefferson begins a westward movement. Land offered at $2 per acre begins the  Western Fever.  A tide of settlers flow out onto Zane s Trace, the trail that will deliver them to Ohio, a state in the unbroken wilderness of the Northwest Territory. There, as settlers, they will begin anew the task of settling another frontier, as the nation pushes ever westward toward the Pacific.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cUeOAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Digital Property: Currency of the 21st Century","description":"This timely book shows readers that their creative work--whether a photo, a painting, music, data, or a new game--is like money in the bank, and controlling its content means big profits.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xuezlCW7DYoC&dq=Digital+Property:+Currency+of+the+21st+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Magic mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest","description":"This field guide contains more psychoactive mushrooms from the Pacific Northwest than any book previously published.

Imagine waking in a hospital bed to find your frail, pale arm punctured by an IV transferring fluids and nutrients into your weak, stiff body. What happened? You re an adult, age twenty-six, and you just had a seizure precipitated by your chronic, secretive, decades-long struggle with unacknowledged eating disorders. You have no friends and no normal young-adult experiences. Living Full is written by Danielle Sherman-Lazar, a woman who passed through the eating disorder crucible to recovery, sharing the most intimate and shameful details of her mental illness. Living Full is Danielle s story. Eating disorders in young adults are hardly talked about, but are pervasive. Eating disorders are kept hidden out of shame. A groundbreaking 2012 study published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders found that about thirteen percent of women over age fifty exhibit eating disorder symptoms. Living Full chronicles the author s step-by-step descent into the full-blown eating disorder nightmare and her path to recovery. Recovery comes from the Maudsley Approach, a regimen of supervised controlled eating or refeeding by out-patient helpers that eventually can result in recovery.

Val: I found out in jail. Why do so many lesbian women engage in sexual behavior that puts their health, even their lives, at risk? Many know they re at risk, yet somehow feel safe enough to behave as if there is no reason to practice safe sex. Lesbian Women and Sexual Health: The Social Construction of Risk and Susceptibility examines how lesbian women perceive their level of risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It describes how their perceptions of risk and susceptibility are shaped by factors such as sexual identity, cultural themes, and community knowledge and how those perceptions impact on the very real HIV/STI risks that lesbian women face. The genesis of Lesbian Women and Sexual Health: The Social Construction of Risk and Susceptibility lies in Kathleen Dolan s exploratory study of this under-researched area, in which 162 structured interviews and 70 in-depth interviews were conducted with women who self-identify as lesbians. What these women have to say will inform, educate, and probably surprise you. Tables and figures make complex data easy to access and understand. Lesbian women construct and label their identities and actions in complex ways that may lead to risky behavior. In the words of the women surveyed and in Dr. Dolan s insightful commentary this book explores the ways in which lesbian women construct their perceptions of risk and susceptibility to seek answers to questions that include: Do many lesbian women see themselves, to an extent, as immune to HIV contraction? How does their self-constructed sense of risk and susceptibility lead to making dangerous choices? Why, in spite of their professed willingness to engage in protective actions, do many lesbians not actually do so? Why do many lesbian women, and some of the health care professionals who serve them, feel that pap smears are not necessary for women who have sex only with other women and what are the consequences of this opinion? What is the relationship between drug/alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors in lesbian women? Lesbian Women and Sexual Health: The Social Construction of Risk and Susceptibility is an important resource for women s/lesbian health advocates, health care professionals, and courses in gay/women s/medical studies. It addresses gaps in the existing research to enhance our understanding of the physical and mental health status of lesbian women, of risk factors and protective actions regarding HIV and STIs, and of the conditions for which protective actions actually reduce risk. Use it to update your knowledge of this under-studied area at the intersection of physical, emotional, and sexual health.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3NQJBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Talmud, The Steinsaltz Edition: A Reference Guide (English and Hebrew Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x6LJMgEACAAJ&dq=The+Talmud,+The+Steinsaltz+Edition:+A+Reference+Guide+(English+and+Hebrew+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"East Wind: West Wind","description":"In her acceptance speech upon receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature, Pearl Buck said, \\"The mind of my own country and of China, my foster country, are alike in many ways, but above all, in our common love of freedom.\\" \\"East Wind: West Wind\\" embodies this love of, and struggle for, freedom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VPkAjwEACAAJ&dq=East+Wind:+West+Wind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fair Ways: How Six Black Golfers Won Civil Rights in Beaumont, Texas (Centennial Series of the Association of Former Students, Texas A&M; University)","description":"Annotation In the summer of 1955, six African American golfers in Beaumont, Texas, began attacking the Jim Crow caste system when they filed a federal lawsuit for the right to play the municipal golf course. The golfers and their African American lawyers went to federal court and asked a conservative white Republican judge to render a decision that would not only integrate the local golf course but also set precedent for desegregation of other public facilities. In Fair Ways, Robert J. Robertson chronicles three parallel stories that converged in this important case. He tells the story of the plaintiffs-avid golfers who had learned the game while working as caddies and waiters-of their young lawyers, recent graduates from Howard University law school, and of the Republican judge just appointed to the bench by President Eisenhower. Using public case papers, public records, newspapers, and oral histories, Robertson has recreated the scene in Beaumont on the eve of desegregation. Fair Ways gives a vivid picture of racial segregation and the forces that brought about its end.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LjAY_h0KxXQC&dq=Fair+Ways:+How+Six+Black+Golfers+Won+Civil+Rights+in+Beaumont,+Texas+(Centennial+Series+of+the+Association+of+Former+Students,+Texas+A&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Trees (The Luthier's Diary Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vy4CHQAACAAJ&dq=Two+Trees+(The+Luthier%27s+Diary+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Changing of the Guard (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 8)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dTXoswEACAAJ&dq=Changing+of+the+Guard+(Tom+Clancy%27s+Net+Force,+Book+8)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bloodsworth Island","description":"Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online.

The early residents of what is now known as Hoopers Island were the Yaocomaco People. According to some local folklore, the land was purchased from the Yaocomaco tribe for five woolen blankets. Hoopers Island is considered the oldest settled area in Dorchester County. The namesake of the islands is Henry Hooper.

By blending ideas borrowed from Christianity with traditional beliefs, they transformed ?high? gods or a distant and aloof creator into a powerful, activist deity that came to be called the Great Spirit. These revitalization leaders sought to regain the favor of the Great Spirit through reforms within their societies and the inauguration of new ritual practices. Among the prophets included in this study are the Delaware Neolin, the Shawnee Tenkswatawa, the Creek ?Red Stick? prophets, the Seneca Handsome Lake, and the Kickapoo Kenekuk. Covering more than a century, from the early 1700s through the Kickapoo Indian removal of the Jacksonian Era, the prophets of the Great Spirit sometimes preached armed resistance but more often used nonviolent strategies to resist white cultural domination. Some prophets rejected virtually all aspects of Euro-American culture. Others sought to assure the survival of their culture through selective adaptation. Alfred A. Cave explains the conditions giving rise to the millenarian movements in detail and skillfully illuminates the key histories, personalities, and legacies of the movement. Weaving an array of sources into a compelling narrative, he captures the diversity of these prophets and their commitment to the common goal of Native American survival.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5BzSkvwNOD0C&dq=Prophets+of+the+Great+Spirit:+Native+American+Revitalization+Movements+in+Eastern+North+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Danish Proverbs (Danish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dxBePQAACAAJ&dq=Danish+Proverbs+(Danish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your Mummy Is a Nose Picker (L.A.F.

As little hurts and disappointments accumulate and her heart hardens, a woman s loneliness and vulnerability take over, and she might find emotional fulfillment elsewhere, perhaps in even a casual encounter with another man. When the marriage enters this realm of real danger, the woman believes it will be less painful to walk away than try to work on it. With heart and wisdom, Dr. Steve Stephens and Alice Gray offer practical advice for how to stop this epidemic of walk-out women. They outline the warning signs of severe marital discontent and share how to reconnect with your spouse, communicate your hurt, and open your heart. If both partners are willing to work at it, any marriage can be saved. Are You Even Thinking About Walking Out?  I m at the point where I don t think it is worth the effort anymore.   The only reason I m staying is because of the children.   Surely God doesn t want me to be this unhappy.  Every woman longs to be appreciated, valued, and cared for. When these needs go unmet, she may be tempted to leave the husband she once loved but walking out is seldom the path to happiness. Like trusted friends, Dr. Steve Stephens and Alice Gray offer wise and gentle advice to restore hope to your marriage. You ll discover proven methods for how you can move toward each other rather than away, build up instead of tear down, and find love rather than lose it. Story Behind the Book Although a growing number of women are walking away from their marriages, there are no books to help them realize that this is not the path to happiness. A woman s discontentment settles like dust on furniture, and although she tries, she fails to make her husband understand. His responses seem too little and too late. Many women mistakenly believe it is easier emotionally to leave the marriage than try to restore it. We want a woman to realize that even when her heart seems closed to her husband, there is a way to open it and become one again. Loss of love does not equal loss of marriage. Loss of hope does not mean the relationship should be abandoned.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z7lkSbUj430C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death Rites","description":"Set against Iceland's stark landscape, Hannah Kent brings to vivid life the story of Agnes, who, charged with the brutal murder of her former master, is sent to an isolated farm to await execution.

This developing \\"interest\\" in interest appears to be linked to an increasing concern for studying the individual in context, examining affective variables as opposed to purely structural features of text, analyzing the interrelationship of cognitive and social development, understanding practical applications of theories of motivation, and recognizing the importance of developmental psychology for the study of learning. This book addresses both how individual interest and interest inherent in stimuli (books, text, toys, etc.) across subjects affect cognitive performance. While the book's particular emphasis is on theory-driven research, each of the contributing authors offers a unique perspective on understanding interest and its effects on learning and development. As such, each has contributed a chapter in which particular questions in interest research are described and linked to a clearly stated theoretical perspective and recent findings. Relevant material from the broader literatures of psychology and education are analyzed in the context of these discussions. In addition, the introductory and concluding chapters build on the contributions to the volume by providing the basis of a coherent view of interest across genres such as stories and expository text, and domains as varied as play, reading, and mathematics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LubJAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Schooling Children with Down Syndrome: Toward an Understanding of Possibility (Special Education Series)","description":"This engrossing volume explores Down syndrome and disability in the cultural context of school.

For anyone who has wondered Why does everyone else seem to be able to make romantic relationships work, and I can t? What s wrong with me? Why is love so hard? Psychologist and bestselling memoirist Kerry Cohen is all too familiar with the questions she often hears from her clients and has asked herself. Even though sex and love are some of the most universal, sought-after experiences we have, many of us lack the tools and understanding to approach them in a healthy way. Without knowing it, many people struggling with sex and love actually fall somewhere on the spectrum of sex and love addiction (SLA). Sex and love addiction is still wildly misunderstood. It s shrouded in secrecy and shame, and many counselors lack the training to address it leaving people who need help without resources. Yet SLA isn t a binary of you are or you aren t, rather, it s a spectrum. Kerry Cohen knows this all too well as both a therapist and someone who identifies on the SLA spectrum. Based on research and her own clinical experience, Crazy for You dives into SLA and provides an inclusive framework for understanding relationships, along with practical exercises and advice for self-assessment, discovery, and healing: Part one explains the sex and love addiction spectrum, helping you determine where you fall on it and how you got there Part two introduces strategies for breaking the spell of sex and love addiction, like behavior modifications and self-awareness techniques Part three teaches you how to navigate healthy, safe, and fulfilling relationships","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jNzKDwAAQBAJ&dq=Crazy+for+You&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Hit Singles 4 Ed: Top 20 Charts from 1954 to the Present Day","description":"(Book).

Utilizing his knowledge of White Magic, he fights an unrelenting battle against vampires, death-hounds, body-snatchers and members of the nefarious Black Lodge. Well-written and briskly paced, these twelve stories stand on their own merits - but there is more to these tales than meets the eye. Dion Fortune was herself a mage, a high initiate of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and founder of the Society of the Inner Light. The tales she tells are based on real events, and she uses 'The Secrets of Dr Taverner' as a vehicle to introduce the reader to magical practices and many arcane principles of occult law. Each story in this collection is a complete case, as gripping and as entertaining as the stories of Sherlock Holmes. They take you into the inner worlds of the human mind - a world full of strange twists and unexpected happenings!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h3ywBgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Secrets+of+Dr.+Taverner&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Champagne Girl","description":"Love under the Texan sky Underneath her bubbly carefree facade, there was more much more to the champagne girl.

Temporarily, this is home for Julia, who has joined her husband Roddy at the behest of the RAF. Although she can accept the pomposities of service life, Julia's honesty and sense of humour prevent her from taking her role as seriously as her husband, that leader of men, might wish; for Roddy, merely love cannot suffice - he needs homage as well as admiration.

Every woman has something to say on the subject of her mother. In fact, many of us spend our lives trying to figure out just how we are like--or unlike--them. And yet, as intricate as the ties that bind mothers and daughters can be, most women never let go of the desire to really know their mothers. In How I Learned to Cook and Other Writings on Complex Mother-Daughter Relationships, women authors explore what is perhaps the most complicated of family relationships. In this elegant collection of writings, daughters describe their relationships with mothers whose own lives sometimes stood in the way of their ability to fill society's ideal of what a good mother should be. With critically acclaimed authors--including Jamaica Kincaid, Paula Fox, and Alice Walker--sharing the page with emerging writers, How I Learned to Cook proves that every daughter has much to discover and understand about her mother.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x-QyAAAACAAJ&dq=How+I+Learned+to+Cook:+And+Other+Writings+on+Complex+Mother-Daughter+Relationships&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fishes of the Central United States","description":"The quality of the 163 color drawings is so astonishing technically and aesthetically superior to photographs - that it's a shame that it confines itself to those species most likely to be caught for fun by sportsmen.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JkgWAQAAIAAJ&dq=Fishes+of+the+Central+United+States&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gauguin Answer Sheet (The Contemporary Poetry Series)","description":"The painting Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? by Paul Gauguin, intended as the painter's final artistic testimony, is the inspiration and framework for this book. In one way, The Gauguin Answer Sheet focuses on the intricate details of the painting and offers its lush Tahitian landscape and characters--a black dog, a pair of conspirators, a shy woman, a pleading goddess, and a crouching mummy, among many others. In another sense, Dennis Finnell deeply probes the underlying implications--and personal associations--the painting offers. The poem's own questions, suggested by those in the painting's title, are concerned with origins, identities, and futures--of the poet and others. Finnell reflects on the plight of the characters portrayed in Gauguin's painting and imagines their thoughts and feelings about life in the world outside. Along with his ruminations on these imagined characters, Finnell visits his own family history, reflecting on the lives of earlier generations, to affirm the shared nature of each individual's origins and identities. Through his poetry, time and space, painting and history, and imagination and reality interconnect and offer an unusually imaginative, surprising work of art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sKSVXv3r0FgC&dq=The+Gauguin+Answer+Sheet+(The+Contemporary+Poetry+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Incredible Super Marketing, Godfather Principles and Accounting & Finance for Scarecrows Web Biz 3 Course + Resource Guide","description":"In this groundbreaking book, Sabri Suby, the founder of Australia's #1 fastest growing digital marketing agency, reveals his exclusive step-by-step formula for growing the sales of any business, in any market or niche!

A provocative look at the Russian people","description":"This is a true story of two siblings, Sophie and David, who are separated by the Bolshevik Revolution and World War I. Sophie and her family immigrated to America in 1913, but David stayed in Russia, and was drafted into the tsar's army. Their families stayed in touch until the mid 30s, when one could be arrested for receiving mail or packages from America or Germany. Then silence. For a long time, the relatives in America thought their cousins were dead. The silence was broken sixty years later, when Donna and Lilli, granddaughters of Sophie and David, providentially met in Germany. Born only one day apart, the two cousins have each exchanged information about what happened during those years of separation and silence. They write, visit back and forth, and even took a frightening trip to Russia, where Donna began to understand what the family had to endure under Communism. In these pages, you will meet Russian rulers from Catherine the Great to Mikhail Gorbachev, and see how their decisions impacted our cousins who still lived in Russia. The Iron Curtain lifts for us to get a glimpse of what life was like in Russia after Sophie immigrated before WWI and the Berlin Wall came down in 1989. Donna and Lilli have joined together to tell the many dramatic stories in the family's fight for survival.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vzggy-YFH1MC&dq=Russia:+Broken+Idols,+Solemn+Dreams.+A+provocative+look+at+the+Russian+people&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Performance by Design: Computer Capacity Planning By Example","description":"Practical, real-world solutions are given to potential problems covering the entire system life cycle.

Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family. When the money ran out, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town Rex had tried to escape.

In Mental Reality, Galen Strawson argues that much contemporary philosophy of mind gives undue primacy of place to publicly observable phenomena, nonmental phenomena, and behavioral phenomena (understood as publicly observable phenomena) in its account of the nature of mind. It does so at the expense of the phenomena of conscious experience. Strawson describes an alternative position, \\"naturalized Cartesianism,\\" which couples the materialist view that mind is entirely natural and wholly physical with a fully realist account of the nature of conscious experience. Naturalized Cartesianism is an adductive (as opposed to reductive) form of materialism. Adductive materialists don't claim that conscious experience is anything less than we ordinarily conceive it to be, in being wholly physical. They claim instead that the physical is something more than we ordinarily conceive it to be, given that many of the wholly physical goings on in the brain constitute literally are conscious experiences as we ordinarily conceive them. Since naturalized Cartesianism downgrades the place of reference to nonmental and publicly observable phenomena in an adequate account of mental phenomena, Strawson considers in detail the question of what part such reference still has to play. He argues that it is a mistake to think that all behavioral phenomena are publicly observable phenomena.This revised and expanded edition of Mental Reality includes a new appendix, which thoroughly revises the account of intentionality given in chapter 7.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-Ud3rg2Qn1gC&dq=Mental+Reality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Points of issue: A compendium of points of issue of books by 19th-20th century authors","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gWdVnF9orOQC&dq=Points+of+issue:+A+compendium+of+points+of+issue+of+books+by+19th-20th+century+authors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Probable Cause (Silhouette Intimate Moments)","description":"Once there had been something between them, something so strong that Lindsey phillips believed it would last a lifetime.

The question of Paul's Jewishness is therefore raised with a new urgency. What kind of a Jew was Paul? Why do we find so many coherences between his language and thought with that of the Community of the Renewed Covenant (i.e. the Essenes)? One of the essays, 'Paul and Qumran', suggests that the Dead Sea Scrolls offer valuable clues to understanding Pauline language and thought. If, in fact, there was contact between Paul and the Essenes, where would it have taken place? If such meetings were held, possibly, in the Essene Quarter of Jerusalem, is there a connection between that area and the location of the earliest Christians in Jerusalem? And what kind of Christians were they and how did they impact on the Apostle's missionary activity? In connection with this discussion of Paul and Judaism, a number of challenges are offered to the so-called 'New Perspective on Paul', especially in the work of E.P. Sanders and James D. G. Dunn, to suggest that a closer study of the Dead Sea Scrolls raises serious questions about the appropriateness of their interpretation of both Judaism and Paul, as well as opening new perspectives that will necessitate not only the rethinking of second temple Judaism, but also the origins of earliest Christianity and the relationship between them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sse_R-zGWgsC&dq=Paul:+Thessalonica+and+Early+Christianity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Late for School","description":"Oh no!

It is a study of the influence of culture and religion - particularly of traditional African cultures and Christianity - on African women's lives. Mercy Amba Oduyoye illustrates how myths, proverbs, and folk tales (called \\"folktalk\\") operate in the socialization of young women, working to preserve the norms of the community. Daughters of Anowa reveals how global patriarchy manifests itself in these social structures, in both patrilineal and matrilineal communities. Organized as a narrative in three cycles, Daughters of Anowa demonstrates how folktalk alienates women from power, discourages individuality and encourages conformity. It also considers the possibilities for the future. Oduyoye posits that change will come about only when the daughters of Anowa (the mythic representative of Africa itself) confront the realities of culture and religion in perpetuating patriarchal oppression and work to realize the goal of a new woman in a new Africa.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JMPYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Daughters+of+Anowa:+African+Women+and+Patriarchy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Things I Want Most","description":"The remarkable story of a couple who risked everything to open their home--and their hearts--to answer an abandoned child's wish.

But she can always look back at the list she keeps in her green notebook to remember the things that will stay the same. The first and most important: Mom and Dad will always love Bea, and each other. When Dad tells Bea that he and his boyfriend, Jesse, are getting married, Bea is thrilled.

Evolution is an unchallengeable scientific fact, isnt it? Not in this noveland not in this world, either. If evolution is a scientific fact, wouldnt we have lots of fossils of intermediate life forms by now? Take the classic idiocy we were all taught, that dolphins and whales are \\"mammals that returned to the sea.\\" Really? If mammals \\"returned to the sea,\\" wouldnt you expect to find at least one fossil of a creature half way between a whale and a land mammal? But try to picture what such a poor creature would look like, and you realize such a thing couldnt be viable. A horse with fins? A dolphin with legs? Whos kidding whom? Species dont change form gradually over time, as we were all taught, but suddenlydramatically. This might happen some day, even to our own species. What if women the world over started having babies who were different in appearance, in abilitiesand in the way they think? Would such a new species be mankinds salvationor mankinds destroyer? This is the world of the near future, a world in which a great Transfigurationa complete change in life formshas occurred. But before I tell you any more about the setting of the novel, consider where you learned about how the world works: the public schools. Did it ever strike you that, when children loathe school, when a five year old cries and screams at the prospect of leaving home and has to be literally dragged off to school like a lamb to the slaughterthat he may be trying to tell you something? It may be that children understand the true nature of school much more profoundly than adults. For public schools, you see, are not so much centers of learning as centers of indoctrination. The lessons learned in public schools are obedience to authority and subservience to the group. Children, when they are young, resist this with all the rebellion they can muster. We, as adults, accept it. But suppose our new humanoid speciescalled the Kethdont think the way most of us do? Suppose they resisted all the attempts to indoctrinate them? Oh, they pretend to go along with submission to authority, but at heart, theyre rebels. They develop their abilities, they broaden their minds, and they wait. Like the Keth, the Founding Fathers were rebels at heart. Unfortunately, their ingenious system for restraining tyrantsconstitutional lawhas been eroded over time. Today, were only a crisis away from having full tyranny restored. Great thinkers like the founding fathers are rebels in the deepest sense. They are the states worst nightmare. That nightmare is one in which people understand things as they are, stand up, and say no. The usual reaction to free people saying no is total subjugation, as when the South tried to go its own way. But usually, the state tries to prevent such actions by using a thousand ingenious mind tricks. Like Patriotism: the unquestioning support for your rulers wishes. Or Service to Country: the willingness to march off to far corners of the globe to be blown to bits in service to democracy. The Keth, being gifted in understanding, dont fall for such games. Not even the most common trick: believing you can be better off by accepting stolen loot from the government, like a dog panting for a few more scraps from his master. The Keth pretend to go along, waiting for their chance. Most people, of course, fall for these old games, but if youve read this far, youre probably one of the rare ones who dont. The story of Transfiguration is the story of breaking free. You will read how the Keth are rounded up and sent to specialized schools to make them more pliable and socialized. You will read how they struggle to improve their minds, despite the efforts of their teachers to hold them back.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2-piMWnVD8MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Up the Chimney","description":"Press the sound button to hear Santa sneeze!

She's done so as a stand-up comic, a sitcom star, and a sports commentator for years now, and in the process she's gained a huge fan base nationwide. Now that she's conquered television, she's applying her genius to her first book, Yeah, I Said It. Here, Wanda presents hilarious and uncensored commentary on sex, family, politics, celebrities, and much more than she could ever say in a sound bite. But then again, she's a genius with a sound bite too. Here's what she says about men and football. \\"I used to think that football took place in this overbearing male-only environment that bled masculine domination. But the more I attend, the more I realize these football fans could actually be experiencing the straight man's gay pride parade. You see men painting each other's faces in bright colors. You see men proud to wear another man's last name on their shirt. You see some men wear no shirt at all....Hot wieners on every corner as you walk up to the main competition. Men open the back of their trunks for a little tailgating.\\" Here's what she says about women: \\"Women are taking stripper classes in hopes their men will stop going to strip clubs....You can't compete with those strippers....You gotta have...the stripper mentality. In other words, the ability to lie like a dog for a measly buck. A stripper will tell your man anything for a dollar. 'Oow, I thought you were Brad Pitt.' \\" An uproarious and irreverent collection from one of today's foremost comedic talents, Yeah, I Said It is Wanda Sykes at her uncensored best. Here, she channels her sharp wit into funny bits on the truth as she sees it from the halls of government in Washington, D.C., to the red carpets and boardrooms of Hollywood. Imbued with her razor-sharp voice, these essays showcase Sykes's sidesplitting candor and her trademark brand of comedy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QONDnvXwuvAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Writer's Response: A Reading-Based Approach to College Writing","description":"Teaching students how to write about what they have read, while not ignoring the importance of personal experience as a source of reading, makes this writing text unique in the market.

Val: I found out in jail. Why do so many lesbian women engage in sexual behavior that puts their health, even their lives, at risk? Many know they re at risk, yet somehow feel safe enough to behave as if there is no reason to practice safe sex. Lesbian Women and Sexual Health: The Social Construction of Risk and Susceptibility examines how lesbian women perceive their level of risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It describes how their perceptions of risk and susceptibility are shaped by factors such as sexual identity, cultural themes, and community knowledge and how those perceptions impact on the very real HIV/STI risks that lesbian women face. The genesis of Lesbian Women and Sexual Health: The Social Construction of Risk and Susceptibility lies in Kathleen Dolan s exploratory study of this under-researched area, in which 162 structured interviews and 70 in-depth interviews were conducted with women who self-identify as lesbians. What these women have to say will inform, educate, and probably surprise you. Tables and figures make complex data easy to access and understand. Lesbian women construct and label their identities and actions in complex ways that may lead to risky behavior. In the words of the women surveyed and in Dr. Dolan s insightful commentary this book explores the ways in which lesbian women construct their perceptions of risk and susceptibility to seek answers to questions that include: Do many lesbian women see themselves, to an extent, as immune to HIV contraction? How does their self-constructed sense of risk and susceptibility lead to making dangerous choices? Why, in spite of their professed willingness to engage in protective actions, do many lesbians not actually do so? Why do many lesbian women, and some of the health care professionals who serve them, feel that pap smears are not necessary for women who have sex only with other women and what are the consequences of this opinion? What is the relationship between drug/alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors in lesbian women? Lesbian Women and Sexual Health: The Social Construction of Risk and Susceptibility is an important resource for women s/lesbian health advocates, health care professionals, and courses in gay/women s/medical studies. It addresses gaps in the existing research to enhance our understanding of the physical and mental health status of lesbian women, of risk factors and protective actions regarding HIV and STIs, and of the conditions for which protective actions actually reduce risk. Use it to update your knowledge of this under-studied area at the intersection of physical, emotional, and sexual health.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3NQJBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"VLSI Design (VLSI Circuits)","description":"This book provides insight into the practical design of VLSI circuits.

In 13 B aktun, Gaspar Pedro Gonz lez turns to the traditional Mayan belief system to navigate this uncertain future. The term 13 B aktun refers to the thirteenth cycle of 144,000 days in the Mayan Long Count Calendar. Many scholars believe that this cycle is set to end on December 21, 2012. Framed as a fictional dialogue between a contemporary Mayan father and son, the book explores such questions as  Will life continue on Earth?  and  Will there be another creation at the end of this era?  The father imparts the knowledge of his ancestors and shares his direct mystical experiences that bring alive traditional beliefs about creation and the divine purpose of humanity, the Earth, and the universe. Through the father s poetic words, the author helps us to critically reflect on our existence, the state of the modern world, and human destiny. In addition to ancient Mayan wisdom, 13 B aktun incorporates the insights of modern philosophers, scientists, and religious texts concerning consciousness, human behavior, and predictions for the future. What unifies all of these sources is the message that despite our existing world dilemmas, there is still time to change our ways. The only book on 2012 by a Mayan author, 13 B aktun draws on the storytelling experiences of the author s childhood and his academic research as an adult. Countering the widespread hype and misinformation surrounding 2012, Gonz lez blends past and present thought into a persuasive plan for moving into the new era.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_rjI3zLYVekC&dq=El+calendario+maya:+Su+origen+y+su+filosofia+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Extreme Adobe Premiere Studio Techniques","description":"A guide to mastering the features of Adobe Premiere Pro offers examples and insider techniques on such topics as editing, mixing audio, compositing, adding effects, correcting color, exporting media, and managing workflow.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0OV5AgAAQBAJ&dq=Extreme+Adobe+Premiere+Studio+Techniques&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cell-Driven Church: Bringing in the Harvest","description":"Step-by-step, how-to information enables readers to put these vital principles into practice as they peek into the heart of a successful American church.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8Tb5PAAACAAJ&dq=The+Cell-Driven+Church:+Bringing+in+the+Harvest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life Lessons with Max Lucado: Book Of Psalms","description":"Worship is a daunting task. For that reason, God gave us the Psalms. This collection of hymns and petitions was written over a span of centuries, in many different settings, by kings such as David and Solomon and commoners like Asaph, Heman, and the sons of Korah. Some of the psalms are defiant; others are reverent. Some are meant to be sung; others are to be prayed. Some are intensely personal; others are written as if the whole world is to use them. But all have one purpose  to help us express our hears to God. So don t just read these psalms but actually pray them along with the saints who composed them. As you do, you will experience their energy, appreciate their honesty, and enjoy their creativity. The Life Lessons with Max Lucado series brings the Bible to life in twelve lessons filled with intriguing questions, inspirational stories, and poignant reflections to take you deeper into God s Word. Each lesson includes an opening reflection, background information, an excerpt of the text (from the New International and New King James versions), exploration questions, inspirational thoughts from Max, and a closing takeaway for further reflection.

Thumbnail Sketches of 164 Patriots","description":"Do you know who the founding fathers are? Did you know that Robert Morris was essentially the first Secretary of the Treasury. Did you know that only two men signed all three of the great documents of our republic. Some of the founding fathers were lost at sea, one just disappeared and was never heard from again, some went to debtors' prison for land speculation, and others gave all they had for the cause of liberty, including their lives. The founding fathers came from all walks of life and were enflamed with the cause of liberty. Some are well known, like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, but most remain obscure, such as Button Gwinnett from Georgia or Thomas Nelson, Jr., from Virginia. However, if the founding fathers had not made the sacrifices necessary to obtain liberty and had not shown the wisdom to form and maintain the union, we would not be the freest people in the world. It is important that we keep the memory of them alive. This book provides essential information on each of the founding fathers, listing their major public accomplishments. It is organized by state and can be read quickly, putting pertinent information at your fingertips. You will not have to sort through numerous documents to find basic information. Besides the sketches, the book supplies a synopsis of the events surrounding the men involved, and provides a set of definitions and an index to aid the reader.

The first sounds from the street had told me, according to whether they came to my ears dulled and distorted by the moisture of the atmosphere or quivering like arrows in the resonant and empty area of a spacious, crisply frozen, pure morning; as soon as I heard the rumble of the first tramcar, I could tell whether it was sodden with rain or setting forth into the blue. And perhaps these sounds had themselves been forestalled by some swifter and more pervasive emanation which, stealing into my slumber, diffused in it a melancholy that seemed to presage snow, or gave utterance (through the lips of a little person who occasionally reappeared there) to so many hymns to the glory of the sun that, having first of all begun to smile in my sleep, having prepared my eyes, behind their shut lids, to be dazzled, I awoke finally amid deafening strains of music. It was, moreover, principally from my bedroom that I took in the life of the outer world during this period. I know that Bloch reported that, when he called to see me in the evenings, he could hear the sound of conversation; as my mother was at Combray and he never found anybody in my room, he concluded that I was talking to myself. When, much later, he learned that Albertine had been staying with me at the time, and realised that I had concealed her presence from all my friends, he declared that he saw at last the reason why, during that episode in my life, I had always refused to go out of doors. He was wrong.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E9SAzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Captive+(Large+Print)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Volume Cycles In The Stock Market: Market Timing Through Equivolume Charting","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VOrUAAAACAAJ&dq=Volume+Cycles+In+The+Stock+Market:+Market+Timing+Through+Equivolume+Charting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roaming 'round Holland","description":"Toeristische gids in de Engelse taal voor buitenlanders die Nederland wensen te bezoeken of daar tijdelijk willen verblijven.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gck3IDSn78wC&dq=Roaming+%27round+Holland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"IPO and Equity Offerings (Securities Institute Global Capital Markets)","description":"The IPO (Initial Public Offering) market is coming back and there is strong underlying demand for equity financings in Europe and the USA.

Led by the shaykhs of the Golden Chain-inheritors of spiritual knowledge from Prophet Muhammad-the Naqshbandi Order has always played a central, pivotal role in the life of people in the Muslim world and survived the turmoil and tribulations of the past century to remain one of the few authentic mystical traditions maintaining a living link with its ancient past. The extraordinary vision of the Naqshbandi Saints was manifest in their establishment of fixed devotions and daily practices firmly rooted in the Qur'an and Sunnah of the Prophet. These practices have enabled devout seekers to awaken certainty of belief and to attain stations of nearness to the Divine Presence. The renewed prominence of this order at the turn of the 21st century, due to the indefatigable striving of Mawlana Shaykh Muhammad Nazim al-Haqqani, signals an impending change to our society in which aspirants to Divine Service will be granted to transcend the bounds of the physical senses in order to fulfill the unexplored potential in each human heart. The Naqshbandi Devotions are a source of light and energy, an oasis in a worldly desert. Through the manifestations of Divine Blessings bestowed on the practitioners of these magnificent rites, they will be granted the power of magnanimous healing, by which they seek to cure the hearts of mankind darkened by the gloom of spiritual poverty and materialism. We pray that each person who picks up this book of devotions with sincere intention to observe any of its efficacious practices will receive a portion of the blessings and manifestations bestowed on the greatest saints of earlier times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zzxUSTpTZ6UC&dq=The+Naqshbandi+Sufi+Tradition+Guidebook+of+Daily+Practices+and+Devotions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A LITTLE BIT COUNTRY","description":"Dumplin' meets Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda in this heartfelt and funny contemporary romance inspired by Dollywood, about two boys who fall in love against the backdrop of a country music-themed amusement park, from debut author Brian D.

In the dark, honeycomb districts of the lower city, Boston Turrow is searching desperately for black-market meds for his epileptic sister when he encounters one of the many ways Creo can kill a person.

Long before Pantsuit Nation, before the Women s March, and before the #MeToo movement, women s anger was not only politically catalytic but politically problematic. The story of female fury and its cultural significance demonstrates its crucial role in women s slow rise to political power in America, as well as the ways that anger is received when it comes from women as opposed to when it comes from men.  Urgent, enlightened realistic and compelling Traister eloquently highlights the challenge of blaming not just forces and systems, but individuals  (The Washington Post). In Good and Mad, Traister tracks the history of female anger as political fuel from suffragettes marching on the White House to office workers vacating their buildings after Clarence Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court. Traister explores women s anger at both men and other women; anger between ideological allies and foes; the varied ways anger is received based on who s expressing it; and the way women s collective fury has become transformative political fuel. She deconstructs society s (and the media s) condemnation of female emotion (especially rage) and the impact of their resulting repercussions. Highlighting a double standard perpetuated against women by all sexes, and its disastrous, stultifying effect, Good and Mad is  perfectly timed and inspiring  (People, Book of the Week). This  admirably rousing narrative  (The Atlantic) offers a glimpse into the galvanizing force of women s collective anger, which, when harnessed, can change history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JZ2nDwAAQBAJ&dq=Mad+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Authentic Beauty: The Shaping of a Set-Apart Young Woman","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Endurance","description":"Are you a triathlete, runner, cyclist, swimmer, cross-country skier, or other athlete seeking greater endurance?

But the excavations on her new cabin unearth a decades-old skeleton entombed in a crumbling basement wall -- along with a butterfly pendant necklace worn by the alleged victim of a brutal serial slayer who preyed on area women twenty years earlier. Pulled once more into a murder investigation against her will, Jessie fears a grim, half-forgotten nightmare has been reborn. For, in this stark and lonely place, in the first days of the all-too-brief Alaskan summer, another woman has disappeared without a trace. The signs suggest the unthinkable: an insatiable human monster has returned. And the clues she's uncovering hint that Jessie Arnold may well be his next victim.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HzMsaVd5mI4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mandarin Chinese dictionary: Chinese-English","description":"This handy Mandarin dictionary allows you to look up words quickly and easily and be understood while speaking.

Is it to be explained by environmental pressures on our ancestors a million years ago, or is it a cultural invention of more recent origin? In The Evolution of Morality, Richard Joyce takes up these controversial questions, finding that the evidence supports an innate basis to human morality. As a moral philosopher, Joyce is interested in whether any implications follow from this hypothesis. Might the fact that the human brain has been biologically prepared by natural selection to engage in moral judgment serve in some sense to vindicate this way of thinking staving off the threat of moral skepticism, or even undergirding some version of moral realism? Or if morality has an adaptive explanation in genetic terms if it is, as Joyce writes, \\"just something that helped our ancestors make more babies\\" might such an explanation actually undermine morality's central role in our lives? He carefully examines both the evolutionary \\"vindication of morality\\" and the evolutionary \\"debunking of morality,\\" considering the skeptical view more seriously than have others who have treated the subject. Interdisciplinary and combining the latest results from the empirical sciences with philosophical discussion, The Evolution of Morality is one of the few books in this area written from the perspective of moral philosophy. Concise and without technical jargon, the arguments are rigorous but accessible to readers from different academic backgrounds. Joyce discusses complex issues in plain language while advocating subtle and sometimes radical views. The Evolution of Morality lays the philosophical foundations for further research into the biological understanding of human morality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3nk5Lq2hY9EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Small World","description":"A New York Times Editor's Choice!

In a book that offers tools for predicting the long-term viability of a range of organizations, Maryann Barakso traces the political development of NOW. According to Barakso, NOW's activities and the stances it has taken throughout its history have been shaped primarily by the organization's internal political system. Established during the group's founding period, NOW's governance structure consists of a set of principles and institutional rules that continue to guide the group's internal political dynamics and its decision-making. Focusing on interactions between NOW leaders and rank-and-file members, Barakso reveals how the organization's internal structure affects its development and its participation in the wider political arena. The author also reveals why strategic change has always been such a contentious issue for the organization, the ways in which NOW enhances civic and political engagement, and the limits on NOW's future mobilizing capacity. Governing NOW contributes to a deeper understanding of membership-based voluntary associations: why they choose some goals and tactics over others, why they invest resources as they do, and why they join or abstain from coalition politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mpRlDwAAQBAJ&dq=Governing+NOW:+Grassroots+Activism+In+The+National+Organization+For+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Woman's life in colonial days","description":"Classic study suggests that, in spite of hardships, many American colonial women led rich, fulfilling lives.

Simon looks at his distinguished and varied career, continually asking himself whether (and how) what he learned as a scientist helps to explain other aspects of his life. A brilliant polymath in an age of increasing specialization, Simon is one of those rare scholars whose work defines fields of inquiry. Crossing disciplinary lines in half a dozen fields, Simon's story encompasses an explosion in the information sciences, the transformation of psychology by the information-processing paradigm, and the use of computer simulation for modeling the behavior of highly complex systems. Simon's theory of bounded rationality led to a Nobel Prize in economics, and his work on building machines that think based on the notion that human intelligence is the rule-governed manipulation of symbols laid conceptual foundations for the new cognitive science. Subsequently, contrasting metaphors of the maze (Simon's view) and of the mind (neural nets) have dominated the artificial intelligence debate. There is also a warm account of his successful marriage and of an unconsummated love affair, letters to his children, columns, a short story, and political and personal intrigue in academe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dFgwBQAAQBAJ&dq=Models+of+My+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Microsoft Windows XP in 21 Days","description":"John guides the reader through the new and unfamiliar Windows interface, while introducing the new features.

Cottingham contests the lesbian significance of the mainstream media's 'lesbian chic' phenomenon which, she argues, is less a manifestation of lesbian cultural power than a commodification of lesbianism whose primary purpose is to disempower and marginalize lesbians, and all women, who threaten the existing political structure. The author suggests that the threat actual lesbians (as opposed to their mass media simulacra) pose to the social and sexual economy of contemporary society should be refocused into a radical new definition of feminist politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TWgbAAAAYAAJ&dq=Lesbians+Are+So+Chic+(Listen+Up!)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Professional dispensing for opticianry","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8FllPwAACAAJ&dq=Professional+dispensing+for+opticianry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secrets Within: A Dynasty Built on Lies Has Nothing to Fear but the Truth","description":"Tamara Vandelier returns to her family's Australian estate, determined to make her hated mother, the ruthless and determined Eleanor Vandelier, pay for the pain of her lost childhood.

State of the Union is a reality check that provides the factual basis for policy analysis.\\" Peter Gottschalk, Boston College State of the Union: America in the 1990s is the definitive new installment to the United States Census Series, carrying forward a tradition of census-based reports on American society that began with the 1930 Census. These two volumes offer a systematic, authoritative, and concise interpretation of what the 1990 Census reveals about the American people today. ?Volume One: Economic Trends focuses on the schism between the wealthy and the poor that intensified in the 1980s as wages went up for highly educated persons but fell for those with less than a college degree. This gap was reflected geographically, as industries continued their migration from crumbling inner cities to booming edge cities, often leaving behind an impoverished minority population. Young male workers lost ground in the 1980s, but women made substantial strides, dramatically reducing the gender gap in earnings. The amount of family income devoted to housing rose over the decade, but while housing quality improved for wealthy, older Americans, it declined for younger, poorer families. ?Volume Two: Social Trends examines the striking changes in American families and the rapid shifts in our racial and ethnic composition. Americans are marrying much later and divorcing more often, and increasing numbers of unmarried women are giving birth. These shifts have placed a growing proportion of children at risk of poverty. In glaring contrast, the elderly were the only group to make gains in the 1980s, and are now healthier and more prosperous than ever before. The concentrated immigration of Asians and Latinos to a few states and cities created extraordinary pockets of diversity within the population. Throughout the 1990s, the nation will debate questions about the state of the nation and the policies that should be adopted to address changing conditions. Will continued technological change lead to even more economic polarization? Will education become an increasingly important factor in determining earnings potential? Did new immigrants stimulate the economy or take jobs away from American-born workers? Will we be able to support the rapidly growing population of older retirees? State of the Union will help us to answer these questions and better understand how well the nation is adapting to the pervasive social and economic transformations of our era.

The devastation she would bring to the New York and New Jersey was widespread and unimaginable. Though warnings had been issued for days and many evacuated their homes and offices, thousands stood in the path of one of the strongest storms in the history of America. Winds on Long Island reached 90 mph. Large sections of Lower Manhattan flooded. Fire in Queens destroyed more than 100 buildings. In New Jersey, 2.6 million homes were without people and nearly 40 people were killed. A 50-foot piece of the Atlantic City Boardwalk washed away and half the city of Hoboken was under water. Hundreds of thousands were left without power and water, with dwindling food supplies. Amidst this devastation, Sandy inspired courage and hope in many New Yorkers, giving them the will to triumph against incalculable odds. Seeking shelter and the basic necessities of life, thousands continued to fight on to simply survive the harshest of conditions and help others do the same. These gripping moments of ruin and recovery are captured in \\"Sandy: A Story of Complete Devastation, Courage, and Recovery,\\" which features award-winning stories and nearly 100 vivid full-color images from the \\"New York Post.\\" A portion of the proceeds from the sale of each book will be donated to the Mayor's Fund for New York City and Hurricane Sandy New Jersey Relief Fund.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=itYWXjJNo9IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Wouldn't Die: A Memoir","description":"This unusual autobiography begins with the author looking back on his early life and wondering how it is possible that he lived to see his first birthday.

Now, redressing the balance, there is an explosion of interest in the self-conscious emotion. Much of our psychic lives involve the negotiation of shame, asserts Michael Lewis, internationally known developmental and clinical psychologist. Shame is normal, not pathological, though opposite reactions to shame underlie many conflicts among individuals and groups, and some styles of handling shame are clearly maladaptive. Illustrating his argument with examples from everyday life, Lewis draws on his own pathbreaking studies and the theory and research of many others to construct the first comprehensive and empirically based account of emotional development focused on shame. In this paperback edition, Michael Lewis adds a compelling new chapter on stigma in which he details the process in which stigmatization produces shame.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e7qYIOlO8X4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anatomy of Lisp (McGraw-Hill computer science series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u7FQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Anatomy+of+Lisp+(McGraw-Hill+computer+science+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark Assassin (William Monk Series)","description":"On a patrol boat near Waterloo Bridge, police superintendent William Monk notices a young couple engaged in an intense discussion.

We read and read, trying to understand why we had to die in our early twenties. We felt the clock ticking away towards our death, every sound of the clock shortening our lives.  So wrote Irokawa Daikichi, one of the many kamikaze pilots, or tokkotai, who faced almost certain death in the futile military operations conducted by Japan at the end of World War II. This moving history presents diaries and correspondence left by members of the tokkotai and other Japanese student soldiers who perished during the war. Outside of Japan, these kamikaze pilots were considered unbridled fanatics and chauvinists who willingly sacrificed their lives for the emperor. But the writings explored here by Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney clearly and eloquently speak otherwise. A significant number of the kamikaze were university students who were drafted and forced to volunteer for this desperate military operation. Such young men were the intellectual elite of modern Japan: steeped in the classics and major works of philosophy, they took Descartes   I think, therefore I am  as their motto. And in their diaries and correspondence, as Ohnuki-Tierney shows, these student soldiers wrote long and often heartbreaking soliloquies in which they poured out their anguish and fear, expressed profound ambivalence toward the war, and articulated thoughtful opposition to their nation s imperialism. A salutary correction to the many caricatures of the kamikaze, this poignant work will be essential to anyone interested in the history of Japan and World War II.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dFB7UHgRhvAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Civilization and its Discontents, pb, 1962","description":"The field of phenomenological psychopathology (PP) is concerned with exploring and describing the individual experience of those suffering from mental disorders. Whilst there is often an understandable emphasis within psychiatry on diagnosis and treatment, the subjective experience of the individual is frequently overlooked. Yet a patient's own account of how their illness affects their thoughts, values, consciousness, and sense of self, can provide important insights into their condition - insights that can complement the more empirical findings from studies of brain function or behaviour. The Oxford Handbook of Phenomenological Psychopathology is the first ever comprehensive review of the field. It considers the history of PP, its methodology, key concepts, and includes a section exploring individual experiences within schizophrenia, depression, borderline personality disorder, OCD, and phobia. In addition it includes chapters on some of the leading figures throughout the history of this field. Bringing together chapters from a global team of leading academics, researchers and practitioners, the book will be valuable for those within the fields of psychiatry, clinical psychology, and philosophy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7CaeDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Krik?

The former is explained by the fact that the theory is a quotient of oriented cobordism localised away from 2, the latter by the fact that the coefficients coincide with a ring of modular forms. The aim of the book is to construct this cohomology theory, and evaluate it on classifying spaces BG of finite groups G. This class of spaces is important, since (using ideas borrowed from \`Monstrous Moonshine') it is possible to give a bundle-theoretic definition of EU-(BG). Concluding chapters also discuss variants, generalisations and potential applications.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L7TkBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The press and the cold war","description":"This is a study of the British state's generation, suppression and manipulation of news to further foreign policy goals during the early Cold War. Bribing editors, blackballing &quote;unreliable&quote; journalists, creating instant media experts through provision of carefully edited &quote;inside information&quote;, and exploiting the global media system to plant propaganda--disguised as news--around the world: these were all methods used by the British to try to convince the international public of Soviet deceit and criminality and thus gain support for anti-Soviet policies at home and abroad. Britain's shaky international position heightened the importance of propaganda. The Soviets and Americans were investing heavily in propaganda to win the &quote;hearts and minds&quote; of the world and substitute for increasingly unthinkable nuclear war. The British exploited and enhanced their media power and propaganda expertise to keep up with the superpowers and preserve their own global influence at a time when British economic, political and military power was sharply declining. This activity directly influenced domestic media relations, as officials used British media to launder foreign-bound propaganda and to create the desired images of British &quote;public opinion&quote; for foreign audiences. By the early 1950s censorship waned but covert propaganda had become addictive. The endless tension of the Cold War normalized what had previously been abnormal state involvement in the media, and led it to use similar tools against Egyptian nationalists, Irish republicans and British leftists. Much more recently, official manipulation of news about Iraq indicates that a behind-the-scenes examination of state propaganda's earlier days is highly relevant. John Jenks draws heavily on recently declassified archival material for this book, especially files of the Foreign Office's anti-Communist Information Research Department (IRD) propaganda agency, and the papers of key media organisations, journalists, politicians and officials. Readers will therefore gain a greater understanding of the depth of the state's power with the media at a time when concerns about propaganda and media manipulation are once again at the fore.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_c-qBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Insight Pocket Guide Quebec (Insight Guides)","description":"Insight Guides Explore Qu bec Travel made easy.

The link between changes in birth and mortality rates on the one hand, and dependency ratios on the other, is first discussed, then empirical evidence on the effects of dependency ratios on net foreign asset positions and on consumption is presented.

He draws on material from two interrelated projects: micro-studies of the rural mafia in Sicily, and banditry in the Dutch republic, each set in its historical context. Blok discusses the social role of marginal people, such as those in 'infamous occupations' from chimney-sweeping to prostitution, arguing that the most despised members of society are often the most indispensable. He examines how nicknames reflect and reflect on cultural codes, and how the authority of female rulers throughout the centuries has relied on their singleness. The book also includes studies of the social meanings of violence, including public executions, rural banditry, and the minor differences which underlie violent conflicts. Drawing on the work of thinkers from Georg Simmel to Norbert Elias, Anton Blok explores the complex interrelations between honour and violence in European societies. This highly original work will be of great interest to scholars and students of history, anthropology and sociology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OPJZjUi0eBkC&dq=HONOUR+AND+VIOLENCE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whose Side Are You On?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AK6jzgEACAAJ&dq=Whose+Side+Are+You+On%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Filmography of Social Issues : A Reference Guide","description":"A user friendly reference guide to 100 of the most socially significant films, exploring twenty important issues that recur in these films.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ueJkAAAAMAAJ&dq=Filmography+of+Social+Issues+:+A+Reference+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elementary Linear Algebra, Second Edition","description":"\\"Based on the recommendations of the LACSG, this introduction to linear algebra offers a matrix-oriented approach with more emphasis on problem solving and applications and less emphasis on abstraction than in a traditional course.

This is inevitable due to the false belief held by almost everyone: that American capitalism is democratic and freedom loving. This book aims to shed some light on that misconception and take some air out of the balloon. As a foundation for the discussion, the book traces in broad outline the histories of work and belief. It denies that the Christian religion is Christian and shows that Jesus Christ was a pacifist and a liberal and that his words and nature are barely represented, if at all, in the dogmas and practices of those who call themselves Christians in today s America. The labels seem to be opposites: democracy and totalitarianism; capitalism, communism, fascism. But in practice, all the politico-economic systems we have on earth today have ended up looking disturbingly similar. While there are important differences, the author claims that they all consist of \\"ruler-owners\\" and bosses at the top - money kings - and powerless workers and consumers at the bottom. He also contends that workers and consumers are the only necessary parts of a natural economic system and that corporations are an artificial and tyrannical imposition based on greed and dominance. He urges the defeat of the \\"corporate collective\\" with its tiered arrangement of work and wealth, with only the \\"fit\\" and \\"successful\\" at the top as supervisors and the rest of us beneath them as servants, wage slaves, or even chattel slaves. In short, this book is radical and extreme in its view of all the world s systems as authoritarian despite their differing economic, political, and religious conglomerations. As a foundation for the discussion, the book traces in broad outline the histories of work and belief. It denies that the Christian religion is Christian and shows that Jesus Christ was a pacifist and a liberal and that his words and nature are barely represented, if at all, in the dogmas and practices of those who call themselves Christians in today s America. Attacking the dominant institutional belief systems regarding work and religion, this book spares no existing supervisory arrangement and suggests the peaceful unraveling of authority structures and a new form of egalitarian cooperation. Since this book is extreme in its condemnation of existing supervisory arrangements and authority structures, it should be interesting - perhaps dismaying - to everyone who is dissatisfied with their own subservience to others whether at work, in church, or in any political party. Anyone who yearns for relief from entangling authority should find this book at least stirring, if not entirely convincing. It presents new ways of looking at the world and at all systems of control and belief. Those who like ideas and those who do not quite fit into the molds into which they have been placed will find the writing refreshing and stimulating. The ideas in this book were influenced by Thomas Piketty s Capital in the Twenty-First Century, Noam Chomsky s Power & Prosperity, Daniel Guerin s Anarchism, Michael Perelman s The Invention of Capitalism, F.A. Hayek s The Road to Serfdom, Karen Armstrong s A History of God, Hugh J. Schonfield s Those Incredible Christians, and by such television programs as Amy Goodman s Democracy Now and the Rachel Maddow show on MSNBC. The Libertarian belief system is at the heart of many of the contrary arguments presented in this book and its baleful influence can be seen in just about any of the writings, presentations, speeches, and gatherings of Republicans. It is the number one enemy of democracy in America today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MtIoCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rand McNally Turner Chicago Street Guide (Streetfinder Atlas)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QMThAAAAMAAJ&dq=Rand+McNally+Turner+Chicago+Street+Guide+(Streetfinder+Atlas)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fool in Love: One Man's Search for Romance . . . or Something Like It","description":"The delirious pursuit of love is a search that inevitably takes us all both down the well-beaten path and into new, uncharted territory.

On a journey that took him from the porn sets of Los Angeles to the gangsta rappers of Memphis, from a convention of UFO contactees in Arizona to Northern Idaho for a festive get-together of neo-Nazis, he asked what 'weird people' have to tell us about our own secret natures.

Certain forms of personal righteousness have become to a majority of the community almost automatic. But we all know that each generation has its own test, the contemporaneous and current standard by which alone it can adequately judge of its own moral achievements. To attain individual morality in an age demanding social morality, to pride one's self on the results of personal effort when the time demands social adjustment, is utterly to fail to apprehend the situation.

Yet, despite their persistence, the reasons for deeply destructive behavior still elude contemporary psychological theories. Based on his four decades of clinical experience, humanistic psychoanalyst Dr. Carl Goldberg uses case studies of apparently irredeemable and dangerous people from all walks of life to dramatically demonstrate that even those who have led destructive lives can escape evil and be restored to more hopeful, compassionate, and responsible lives. Crucial to a probing examination and successful treatment of the dark side of life, Dr. Goldberg shows in his case studies, is addressing important psychological and philosophical issues ignored by contemporary psychologists and psychoanalysts. The Evil We Do is a book full of telling insights about the most troubling aspects of human nature-knowledge that is essential if American society is ever to deal effectively with the violence that plagues it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cv7aAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Evil+We+Do:+The+Psychoanaysis+of+Destructive+People&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Thousand Bells at Noon: A Roman Reveals the Secrets and Pleasures of His Native City","description":"G. Franco Romagnoli was a mere youth when he left Rome for America, where he made a name for himself as a cookbook author, television personality, and restaurateur. But the love of his native city brought him back to Rome for an extended stay, allowing him to rediscover the sights, smells, and sounds of this urban paradise. In A Thousand Bells at Noon, Romagnoli shares with readers his visceral and emotional experiences in Rome: its ancient streets and modern shops; it parks; caf s, and hidden gardens; its grand public squares and sacred spaces. As he relives moments from his childhood, reconnects with old friends, and sees through new eyes a modern city steeped in history, you will fall in love with Romagnoli's Rome -- a wondrous place like no other on earth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=veyz7DKQ14MC&dq=A+Thousand+Bells+at+Noon:+A+Roman+Reveals+the+Secrets+and+Pleasures+of+His+Native+City&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"At the Table: The Autobiography of the World's #1 Rated Bridge Player","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=znirswEACAAJ&dq=At+the+Table:+The+Autobiography+of+the+World%27s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stupa and its Technology: A Tibeto-Buddhist Perspective (Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts)","description":"Among all the religious monuments of the world, the stupa has the longest uninterrupted historical development. Though modelled after the Indian prototype, the stupa architecture was developed in all the countries where Buddhism had flourished. Over time, the structural shape of the stupa underwent significant modifications in India and the other Asian Buddhist countries.The present study shows how Tibet became a treasure house of Buddhist culture and literature--highlighting important texts dealing with stupa architecture. Various ritual activities associated with the construction of the stupa are described along with the eight fundamental types of Tibeto-Buddhist stupas and their main structural components. A survey of the stupas found in the upper Indus Valley in the Leh region of Ladakh shows their similarity to the Tibeto-Buddhist tradition. The value of the book is enhanced by an appendix with English translation of four important Tibetan texts preceded by transliteration.This monograph is the first in the new sub-series of the IGNCA on the Buddhist stupas, which would not be restricted to India alone. It is hoped that such studies will enable the art-historians and archaeologists to understand this important structural form in totality in relation to its wide geographical spread and the distinctive features of particular developments in different countries.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G8_HCReikaQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nathan Hale: Patriot Spy (On My Own Biography)","description":"Recounts the life of Revolutionary War hero Nathan Hale, whose decision to become a spy for General George Washington cost him his life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VZ2du_1HGdAC&dq=Nathan+Hale:+Patriot+Spy+(On+My+Own+Biography)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jade Mountain : A Chinese Anthology : Being Three Hundred Poems of the T'ang Dynasty, 618-906","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pDQqAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Jade+Mountain+:+A+Chinese+Anthology+:+Being+Three+Hundred+Poems+of+the+T%27ang+Dynasty,+618-906&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ice Pick Artist: A Carl Wilcox Mystery (Carl Wilcox Mysteries)","description":"Bruce Murphy's Encyclopedia of Murder and Mystery is a comprehensive guide to the genre of the murder mystery that catalogues thousands of items in a broad range of categories: authors, titles, plots, characters, weapons, methods of killing, movie and theatrical adaptations.

Into that unsteady atmosphere, which would soon enough erupt into another conflict with Britain in 1812, Dolley Madison arrived, alongside her husband, James. Within a few years, she had mastered both the social and political intricacies of the city, and by her death in 1849 was the most celebrated person in Washington. And yet, to most Americans, she's best known for saving a portrait from the burning White House, or as the namesake for a line of ice cream. Why did her contemporaries give so much adulation to a lady so little known today? In A Perfect Union, Catherine Allgor reveals that while Dolley's gender prevented her from openly playing politics, those very constraints of womanhood allowed her to construct an American democratic ruling style, and to achieve her husband's political goals. And the way that she did so by emphasizing cooperation over coercion, building bridges instead of bunkers has left us with not only an important story about our past but a model for a modern form of politics. Introducing a major new American historian, A Perfect Union is both an illuminating portrait of an unsung founder of our democracy, and a vivid account of a little-explored time in our history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QEMCTXHPsnAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The world of Currier & Ives,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XnsSAAAACAAJ&dq=The+world+of+Currier&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Basketball","description":"\\"Irreverent in approach, these guides include tips and advice from leading authoritimes, aiming to help with life's big decisions and challenges, as well as hobbies.

Far removed from falling bombs, the wealthy elites of  Happy Valley  indulged in morphine, alcohol, and unrestricted sex, often with their friends  spouses. But the party turned sinister in the early hours of a January morning for Josslyn Hay, Lord Erroll, who had been enjoying the favors of the beautiful young wife of a middle-aged neighbor. Hay was found dead, a bullet in his brain. The murder shocked the close-knit community of wealthy expatriates in Nairobi and shined a harsh light on their louche lifestyle. Three decades later, author James Fox researched the slaying of Lord Erroll, an unsolved crime still sheathed in a thick cloud of rumor and innuendo. What he discovered was both unsettling and luridly compelling. White Mischief is a spellbinding true-crime classic, a tale of privileged excess and the wages of sin, and an account of one writer s determined effort to crack a cold and craven killing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3cdcAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Colonial Legacy in Caribbean Literature","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pMfuzAEACAAJ&dq=The+Colonial+Legacy+in+Caribbean+Literature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rise of New York Port, 1815-1860","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IW4TAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Rise+of+New+York+Port,+1815-1860&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thailand's Boom and Bust: Revised Edition","description":"Completely revised since its first publication in 1996, this book is about the transformation of a country over one roller-coaster decade.

How can a human being attain the Word of God? In what manner does God, when conceived as eternal and transcendent, address corporeal, transitory creatures? What happens to God's divine Truth when it is beheld by minds limited in their power to apprehend, and influenced by the intellectual currents of their time and place? How were these issues viewed by the great Jewish philosophers of the past, who took the divine communication and all it entails seriously, while at the same time desired to understand it as much as humanly possible in the course of dealing with a myriad of other issues that occupied their attention? This book offers an in-depth study of prophecy in the thought of seven of the leading medieval Jewish philosophers: R. Saadiah Gaon, R. Judah Halevi, Maimonides, Gersonides, R. Hasdai Crescas, R. Joseph Albo and Baruch Spinoza. It attempts to capture the \`original voice' of these thinkers by looking at the intellectual milieus in which they developed their philosophies, and by carefully analyzing their views in their textual contexts. It also deals with the relation between the earlier approaches and the later ones. Overall, this book presents a significant model for narrating the history of an idea.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HbQqBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Suncatchers: Poems","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rLRGAAAACAAJ&dq=Suncatchers:+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mistletoe Daddy (Sex Single Dads) (Harlequin American Romance)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bqz3PAAACAAJ&dq=Mistletoe+Daddy+(Sex+Single+Dads)+(Harlequin+American+Romance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sales Closing For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","description":"The ideal introductory reference on salesforce.com now fully updated throughout!

This volume should appeal to students and scholars in anthropology, linguistics, education, urban studies, and African-American studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_-hUpnoOuC0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bill Sienkiewicz Sketchbook (Vol. 1)","description":"\\"Originally published in single magazine form as Stray Toasters #1-4 by Graphitti Designs\\"--Indicia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cT4lQQAACAAJ&dq=The+Bill+Sienkiewicz+Sketchbook+(Vol.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Off the Record: What Wall Street Doesn't Want You to Know","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Spanish Verbs","description":"Choose Barron s for language learning--a trusted resource for over 50 years!

Small Things in Silence surveys the 20-year career of one of Japan's most important photographers. Yamamoto's portraits, landscapes and still lifes are made into small, delicate prints, which the photographer frequently overpaints, dyes or steeps in tea. Edited and sequenced by Yamamoto himself, this volume includes images from each of the photographer's major projects--Box of Ku, Nakazora, Kawa and Shizuka--as well as installation shots of some of Yamamoto's original photographic installations, and, in this new edition, seven new images and a new cover. In the words of Yamamoto himself: I try to capture moments that no one sees and make a photo from them. When I see them in print, a new story begins. Masao Yamamoto (born 1957) lives and works in Japan. He has published numerous books, including a previous edition of Small Things in Silence (RM/Seigensha, 2015) and Tori (Radius Books, 2016). His work is held in the collections of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the International Center of Photography, New York, and others.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QFUTzgEACAAJ&dq=A+Box+of+Ku&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mosby's Pharmaceutical Nursing Textbook & Study Guide Package","description":"No nursing student should leave home without this book!

Why should the United States care? Why is Latin America relevant to U.S. economic growth in global competition? In Greater America: A New Partnership for the Americas in the 21st Century L. Ronald Scheman argues that our future lies not in Europe, Asia, or the Middle East but right here in our own backyard the Western Hemisphere. He shows how the political and cultural legacy of colonization, immigration, assimilation and pluralism binds North, Central and South America, and how the trends in market growth and resources make the Americas a rich prize in global trade. Despite the tendency of many northerners to underestimate our ties, we are closer to our southern cousins than to any other societies. That relationship will be increasingly stronger given the growing and irrepressible influence of Latino and Caribbean populations in the U.S. For Latin America, the linkage to the U.S. is essential for attracting investment and creating the jobs necessary to overcome its oppressive heritage of poverty and to provide opportunity for a young population that will increasingly expect a better standard of living. Most important, Greater America demonstrates how closer ties with Latin America will help build a stronger U.S. economy while reducing illegal immigration and drug trafficking. He argues that only a NATO-like coalition in the Americas will defeat the drug traffickers, and that a major program to build infrastructure is essential to make trade agreements work. This book celebrates the contribution of the Americas as one of the more important factors in the spread of human freedom in the last half millennium. It makes the case for the unlimited potential of the Americas and shows how it can be unleashed through greater political and economic integration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sh8UCgAAQBAJ&dq=Dancing+at+Halftime:+Sports+and+the+Controversy+over+American+Indian+Mascots&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brain and Bannister's Clinical Neurology (Oxford Medical Publications)","description":"This textbook emphasizes the fundamental attraction of neurology: the balance between clinical history, often with subtle psychological aspects; and knowledge of the basic anatomy and physiology of brain function.

The concert and the live album, At Folsom Prison, propelled him to worldwide superstardom. He reached new audiences, ignited tremendous growth in the country music industry, and connected with fans in a way no other artist has before or since.

I ll Be Seeing You moved me and broadened my understanding of the human condition.  Wally Lamb, author of I Know This Much Is True Elizabeth Berg s father was an Army veteran who was a tough man in every way but one: He showed a great deal of love and tenderness to his wife. Berg describes her parents  marriage as a romance that lasted for nearly seventy years; she grew up watching her father kiss her mother upon leaving home, and kiss her again the instant he came back. His idea of when he should spend time away from her was never. But then Berg s father developed Alzheimer s disease, and her parents were forced to leave the home they loved and move into a facility that could offer them help. It was time for the couple s children to offer, to the best of their abilities, practical advice, emotional support, and direction to, in effect, parent the people who had for so long parented them. It was a hard transition, mitigated at least by flashes of humor and joy. The mix of emotions on everyone s part could make every day feel like walking through a minefield. Then came redemption. I ll Be Seeing You charts the passage from the anguish of loss to the understanding that even in the most fractious times, love can heal, transform, and lead to graceful and grateful acceptance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yr7NDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Warren Cook Book (Seventh Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MdHiAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Warren+Cook+Book+(Seventh+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Little Night Magic (Harlequin Temptation)","description":"Dani Karlinski can't help it.

For his second book, Wolfe traveled from La Jolla to London in search of new lifestyles. The Pump House Gang is the result: a collection of essays that chronicles life at the end of the 1960s, written with all the panache and perceptiveness that made Wolfe one of our greatest American journalists. Running throughout The Pump House Gang is a central theme of Wolfe s writing: status. He discusses the 1960s phenomenon of retreating from conventional social hierarchies, which Wolfe calls  starting your own league.  Surfers, motorcyclists, lumpen-dandies, and stay-at-homes everybody s doing it. Except for die-hards in the crumbling old social worlds of New York and London, where the confusion is so great that nobody can tell whether this is really the path to the top they ve taken or just the service elevator.

You've heard all the football clich s: \\"Their offense is too predictable,\\" or \\"They've got to win the turnover battle,\\" or \\"They didn't make any halftime adjustments.\\" Perhaps you've heard them so often that you've come to see them as obvious truths. Phil Simms, after an illustrious career as a Super Bowlwinning quarterback and a broadcaster, is here to tell you that these -- and many other blanket statements taken as gospel -- are all myths, and whoever says them has no idea of what they're talking about. Drilling deep into the core of football, Simms also shows the hidden signs that players look for that can determine the outcome of a game. Whether it's discovering how a linebacker positions his feet before he blitzes or how to react if the safety is eight or nine yards from the line of scrimmage, knowing these \\"dirty little secrets\\" gives players and their coaches a tremendous advantage. In addition, Simms shares his insights into the enormous challenges coaches face in today's game, evaluating the top coaches and what makes them successful. He takes a look at some of the greatest players he's played with and against, and what he misses most about the game -- waking up Monday mornings feeling beat up and sore. He looks at the next generation of football players -- his son, Tampa Bay's Chris Simms, among them. Through it all, Simms shares stories from his playing days with Bill Parcells and the New York Giants, and the inside access he's had as an announcer for one of the top NFL broadcasting teams in football. Fun and lively, Sunday Morning Quarterback should be required reading for anyone who loves football.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kzvu6Cr48sgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Struck","description":"THE MIDDLE OF nowhere just got a lot more interesting!

How do they induce syntactical rules from the bewildering linguistic input that surrounds them? The major debates in language acquisition theory today focus not on whether there are some sensitivities to syntactic information but rather which sensitivities are available to children and how they might be translated into the organizing principles that get syntactic learning off the ground. The Origins of Grammar presents a synthesis of work done by the authors, who have pioneered one of the most important methodological advances in language learning in the past decade: the intermodal preferential looking paradigm, which can be used to assess lexical and syntactic knowledge in children as young as 13 months. In addition to drawing together their groundbreaking empirical work, the authors use these results to describe a theory of language learning that emphasizes the role of multiple cues and forces in development. They show how infants shift their reliance on different aspects of the linguistic input, moving from a bias to attend to prosodic information to a reliance on semantic information, and finally to a reliance on the syntax itself. Viewing language acquisition as the product of a biased learner who takes advantage of the information available from a variety of sources in his or her environment, The Origins of Grammar provides a new way of thinking about the process of language comprehension. The analysis borrows insights from theories about the development of mental models, models of early cognitive development and systems theory, and is presented in a way that will be accessible to cognitive and developmental psychologists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xt5IrzR3vCIC&dq=The+Origins+of+Grammar:+Evidence+from+Early+Language+Comprehension+(Language,+Speech,+and+Communication)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Technological Issues in Broadcast Education","description":"Illuminates the educational settings that have been created and enhanced by the emergence of new broadcast-related technologies and offers innovative suggestions on ways for broadcasting programs to grow and thrive in the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yiVDwMuDgWwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contract as Promise","description":"Contract as Promise is a study of the philosophical foundations of contract law in which Professor Fried effectively answers some of the most common assumptions about contract law and strongly proposes a moral basis for it while defending the classical theory of contract. This book provides two purposes regarding the complex legal institution of the contract. The first is the theoretical purpose to demonstrate how contract law can be traced to and is determined by a small number of basic moral principles. At the theory level the author shows that contract law does have an underlying, and unifying structure. The second is a pedagogic purpose to provide for students the underlying structure of contract law. At this level of doctrinal exposition the author shows that structure can be referred to moral principles. Together the two purposes support each other in an effective and comprehensive study of contract law. This second edition retains the original text, and includes a new Preface. It also includes a substantial new essay entitled Contract as Promise in the Light of Subsequent Scholarship--Especially Law and Economics which serves as a retrospective of the work accomplished in the last thirty years, while responding to present and future work in the field.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KM8YBwAAQBAJ&dq=Contract+as+Promise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Ship's Tale","description":"Maritime Fiction all ages.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WRI4AAAACAAJ&dq=A+Ship%27s+Tale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mothers: A Loving Celebration","description":"Paintings by Gustav Klimt, Claude Monet, H.

And how can job interviews be structured so that they are fair and effective? The Psychology of Job Interviews is the first book to provide an accessible and concise overview of what we know. Based on empirical research rather than second hand advice, it discusses the strategies and tactics that both applicants and interviewers can use to make their interviews more successful; from how to make a good first impression to how to decide which candidate is the best fit for the role.

Governor Charlie Baker, one of the most popular governors in the United States, with a reputation for getting things done, wants to put the service back into public service: \\"Wedge issues may be great for making headlines,\\" he writes, \\"but they do not move us forward. Success is measured by what we accomplish together. Our obligation to the people we serve is too important to place politics and partisanship before progress and results.\\" For the Governor and his longtime associate Steve Kadish, these words are much more than political platitudes. They are at the heart of a method for delivering results and getting past politics the two developed while working together in top leadership positions in the public and private sectors. Distilled into a four-step framework, Results is the much-needed implementation guide for anyone in public service, as well as for leaders and managers in large organizations hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. With a broad range of examples, Baker, a Republican, and Kadish, a Democrat, show how to move from identifying problems to achieving results in a way that bridges divides instead of exacerbating them. They show how government can be an engine of positive change and an example of effective operation, not just a hopeless bureaucracy. Results is not only about getting things done, but about renewing people's faith in public service. Empty promises feed disengagement when instead we need confidence in our government and the services it delivers. When a mob attacked the US Capitol Building on January 6, 2021, the very core of our democracy and our sense of government were threatened. Demonstrating that government can work the goal of this book is vital to ensuring the future of our democracy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YrRbEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Broken Cord","description":"The controversial national bestseller that received unprecedented media attention, sparked the nation's interest in the plight of children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, and touched a nerve in all of us.

At first, he said, only a few will be aware of it, but in time more and more people--regardless of religious affiliation--will be strengthened, comforted and infused by the Christ's living presence. Such \\"Damascus experiences,\\" bespeaking a new natural clairvoyance, Steiner argues, will become increasingly common. \\"The Christ will become a living comforter,\\" he writes. \\"However strange it may seem, it is nevertheless true that often when people, even in considerable numbers, are sitting together not knowing what to do and waiting, they will see the etheric Christ. He will be there, will confer with them, and will cast his word in such gatherings.

They show you how to use the turner's gouge and master one of the most difficult of tools, the skew chisel.

The country was apparently tranquil. Everybody knows how the Tariff and Labour questions were settled. The war with Germany, incident on that country's seizure of the Samoan Islands, had left no visible scars upon the republic, and the temporary occupation of Norfolk by the invading army had been forgotten in the joy over repeated naval victories, and the subsequent ridiculous plight of General Von Gartenlaube's forces in the State of New Jersey. The Cuban and Hawaiian investments had paid one hundred per cent and the territory of Samoa was well worth its cost as a coaling station. The country was in a superb state of defence. Every coast city had been well supplied with land fortifications; the army under the parental eye of the General Staff, organized according to the Prussian system, had been increased to 300,000 men, with a territorial reserve of a million; and six magnificent squadrons of cruisers and battle-ships patrolled the six stations of the navigable seas, leaving a steam reserve amply fitted to control home waters. The gentlemen from the West had at last been constrained to acknowledge that a college for the training of diplomats was as necessary as law schools are for the training of barristers; consequently we were no longer represented abroad by incompetent patriots. The nation was prosperous; Chicago, for a moment paralyzed after a second great fire, had risen from its ruins, white and imperial, and more beautiful than the white city which had been built for its plaything in 1893. Everywhere good architecture was replacing bad, and even in New York, a sudden craving for decency had swept away a great portion of the existing horrors. Streets had been widened, properly paved and lighted, trees had been planted, squares laid out, elevated structures demolished and underground roads built to replace them. The new government buildings and barracks were fine bits of architecture, and the long system of stone quays which completely surrounded the island had been turned into parks which proved a god-send to the population. The subsidizing of the state theatre and state opera brought its own reward. The United States National Academy of Design was much like European institutions of the same kind. Nobody envied the Secretary of Fine Arts, either his cabinet position or his portfolio. The Secretary of Forestry and Game Preservation had a much easier time, thanks to the new system of National Mounted Police. We had profited well by the latest treaties with France and England; the exclusion of foreign-born Jews as a measure of self-preservation, the settlement of the new independent negro state of Suanee, the checking of immigration, the new laws concerning naturalization, and the gradual centralization of power in the executive all contributed to national calm and prosperity. When the Government solved the Indian problem and squadrons of Indian cavalry scouts in native costume were substituted for the pitiable organizations tacked on to the tail of skeletonized regiments by a former Secretary of War, the nation drew a long sigh of relief. When, after the colossal Congress of Religions, bigotry and intolerance were laid in their graves and kindness and charity began to draw warring sects together, many thought the millennium had arrived, at least in the new world which after all is a world by itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QbOODAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales of a traveller,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S7QNAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Serial","description":"Are you into Living Together Relationships?

From a succession of glittering, cosmopolitan capitals, Islamic empires lorded it over the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia and swathes of the Indian subcontinent. For centuries the caliphate was both ascendant on the battlefield and triumphant in the battle of ideas, its cities unrivalled powerhouses of artistic grandeur, commercial power, spiritual sanctity and forward-looking thinking. Islamic Empires is a history of this rich and diverse civilization told through its greatest cities over fifteen centuries, from the beginnings of Islam in Mecca in the seventh century to the astonishing rise of Doha in the twenty-first. It dwells on the most remarkable dynasties ever to lead the Muslim world - the Abbasids of Baghdad, the Umayyads of Damascus and Cordoba, the Merinids of Fez, the Ottomans of Istanbul, the Mughals of India and the Safavids of Isfahan - and some of the most charismatic leaders in Muslim history, from Saladin in Cairo and mighty Tamerlane of Samarkand to the poet-prince Babur in his mountain kingdom of Kabul and the irrepressible Maktoum dynasty of Dubai. It focuses on these fifteen cities at some of the defining moments in Islamic history: from the Prophet Mohammed receiving his divine revelations in Mecca and the First Crusade of 1099 to the conquest of Constantinople in 1453 and the phenomenal creation of the merchant republic of Beirut in the nineteenth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mP-EDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Berbers+and+the+Islamic+State:+The+Marinid+Experience+in+Pre-Protectorate+Morocco&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shy Man's Guide to Success With Women","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gimuPAAACAAJ&dq=The+Shy+Man%27s+Guide+to+Success+With+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contract Surgeon","description":"An old man tells the story of his days as a surgeon with the army, fighting Indians, and of his friendship with Crazy Horse, the Sioux chief, whom he treated in the last days of his life.

This work is based on field research conducted by the author during his nine-year residency in the Western Arctic. Zellen discusses the major conflicts facing Alaskan Natives, from the struggle to regain control over their land claims to the Native alienation from the corporate structure and culture and the resulting resurgence in tribalism. He shows that while the forces of modernism and traditionalism continued to clash, these conflicts were mediated by the structures of co-management, corporate development, and self-government created by the region's comprehensive land claims settlements. Breaking the Ice gives testimony to the achievements of Alaskan Natives through peaceful negotiation, and argues that the age of land claims has transmuted this same tribal force into something else altogether in the North: a peaceful force to spawn the emergence of new structures of Aboriginal self-governance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s3YsHFVnghYC&dq=April+Operation+(RCMP+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","description":"A boy grows to manhood while attempting to subdue the evil he unleashed on the world as an apprentice to the Master Wizard.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FD72ekYZqIkC&dq=A+Wizard+of+Earthsea+(The+Earthsea+Cycle,+Book+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Introduction to the Philosophy of Law","description":"Pound, Roscoe.

Utilizing the knowledge gained from many years of using the I Ching in her practice, psychotherapist Sarah Dening provides, with this translation, a valuable resource not only for help with life's extraordinary passages but something that should be consulted daily as one would a trusted friend. Dening details how to use and read the I Ching's hexagrams and gives insight on how to relate the ancient wisdom of the I Ching's hexagrams to the trials and tribulations of everyday modern life. The Everyday I Ching fills the long-standing need for a clear, focused rendering of the I Ching-one which makes its timeless wisdom accessible to everyone.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CuqT4VplYasC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lord Jim","description":"Parce qu'un jour il a  t  lache, abandonnant au naufrage un navire et sa cargaison de p lerins, Jim erre de port en port, cachant sa honte.

It was an army that studied the conduct of war at the highest levels, planning for the destruction of its opponents during the early stages of a war. On some occasions, this principle succeeded brilliantly. On others, its details were flawed and the results were disastrous.This new and exciting publication from seasoned historian and author Bryan Perrett charts the ups and downs of the German army from the days of Frederick the Great to the dying days of World War Two. It passes through the Napoleonic period, takes in the growth of war machinery under the leadership of Clausewitz and Moltke and acquaints the reader with the various victories won against Austria in 1866 and France in 1870. It then moves forwards into the twentieth century, following the course of the Imperial German army, its successes and ultimate failure in the Great War, its recovery in the inter-war years and its final destruction under the leadership of Hitler.rnrnThe book is written for the professional and the general reader alike in the easy, readable style that has ensured Bryan Perrett's international popularity as a military and naval historian.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ht47BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fishing Yellowstone National Park","description":"Fishing Yellowstone National Park is the definitive access guide for the Park's angling opportunities","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_YsmtAEACAAJ&dq=Fishing+Yellowstone+National+Park&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Victor Book of the Opera","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QQJFAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kudzu Cuisine","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CNWdAAAACAAJ&dq=Kudzu+Cuisine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blackrock: Original Screenplay (Currency Screen Plays)","description":"Nick Enright (1950-2003) was one of Australia?s most significant and successful playwrights. As a writer, director, actor and teacher he influenced theatre in Australia for thirty years. Enright wrote more than fifty plays for the stage, film, television and radio, translated and adapted more, and taught acting to students in varied settings, both in Australia and the United States. His writing repertoire included comedy, social realism, farce, fantasy and the musical.

For most Africans, incomes are lower than they were two decades ago, health prospects are poorer, malnourishment is widespread, and infrastructures and social institutions are breaking down. An array of factors have been offered to explain the apparent failure of development in Africa, including the colonial legacy, social pluralism, corruption, poor planning and incompetent management, limited in-flow of foreign capital, and low levels of saving and investment. Alone or in combination, these factors are serious impediments to development, but Claude Ake contends that the problem is not that development has failed, but that it was never really on the agenda. He maintains that political conditions in Africa are the greatest impediment to development. In this book, Ake traces the evolution and failure of development policies, including the IMF stabilization programs that have dominated international efforts. He identifies the root causes of the problem in the authoritarian political structure of the African states derived from the previous colonial entities. Ake sketches the alternatives that are struggling to emerge from calamitous failure--economic development based on traditional agriculture, political development based on the decentralization of power, and reliance on indigenous communities that have been providing some measure of refuge from the coercive power of the central state. Ake's argument may become a new paradigm for development in Africa.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VbMxhKsa05YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of American Law: Third Edition","description":"Renowned legal historian Lawrence Friedman presents an accessible and authoritative history of American law from the colonial era to the present day.

Doby went on to be a seven-time All-Star center fielder who led the Indians to two pennants. In many respects Robinson and Doby were equals in their baseball talent and experiences and had remarkably similar playing careers: both were well-educated, well-spoken World War II veterans and both had played spectacularly, albeit briefly, in the Negro Leagues. Like Robinson, Doby suffered brickbats, knock-down pitches, spit in his face, and other forms of abuse and discrimination. Doby was also a pioneering manager, becoming the second black manager after Frank Robinson. Well into the 1950s Doby was the only African American All-Star in the American League during a period in which fifteen black players became National League All-Stars. Why is Doby largely forgotten as a central figure in baseball s integration? Why has he not been accorded his rightful place in baseball history? Greatness in the Shadows attempts to answer these questions, bringing Doby s story to life and sharing his achievements and firsts with a new generation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2y4oDwAAQBAJ&dq=Thirty+Tons+a+Day:+The+Rough-Riding+Education+of+a+Neophyte+Racetrack+Operator&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"\\"Come and See\\" Kids: The Life of Jesus (Catholic Bible Study for Children)","description":"Full of Bible stories, coloring pages, and fun and easy crafts, this activity book for little ones ages 3?-7 is designed to accompany the adult study The Gospel of John. 100 perforated pages","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o3bDJ0afDIIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy (Vampire: The Masquerade)","description":"What are we?

Neatly folded and carefully tucked away, all were addressed to the village innkeeper's daughter, Celestine. All but one were proposals of marriage. Celestine Chaumette (1844-1933) was to reject each of these suitors to wed another; yet she preserved the letters, keeping them throughout her long life. Something about the letters, about the woman who had so clearly cherished them, fired the historian's curiosity and the novelist's imagination. With a house in Chassignolles, Celestine's village, Ms. Tindall would spend years searching in dusty archives and farmhouse attics, probing the memories and myths of the men and women from the village and the surrounding countryside. The treasure she unearthed reaches far beyond the mystery of Celestine to tell of a vanished way of life, of a century of revolutionary change--and of the strange persistence, despite all, of the past. The result is both moving and profound. It is, as M.R.D. Foot wrote in the London Spectator, \\"a touching picture of a world we have lost [and] social history at its best.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qUOwBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Radar Analysis","description":"The 2nd Edition of this popular textbook is a major revision.

Chapters on Fletcher Henderson, Coleman Hawkins, Red Norvo, Art Tatum, Big Sid Catlett, Benny Carter, and Louis Armstrong mix personal anecdotes with critical comments that only a fellow jazz musician could relate. A section on Ellington and the Ellington orchestra profiles Ben Webster, Harry Carney, Tricky Sam Nanton, Barney Bigard, and Duke himself, with whom Rex Stewart was a barber, chef, poker opponent, and third trumpet. Finally, he recounts the stories of legendary jam sessions between Jelly Roll Morton, Willie the Lion Smith, and James P. Johnson, all vying for the unofficial title of king of Harlem stride piano.

In \\"Restore the Future,\\" author Donald H. Young seeks to galvanize the American people to guarantee a traditional future for our children and grandchildren through participation in a nonviolent Second American Revolution. This Revolution of the people is as justified as the first one, and it would be accomplished by using the extraordinary voting power granted to them by the Constitution to restore constitutional government. Without this Revolution, it can truly be said that the best days of the United States are behind it. In this treatise, he: reviews historical forms of government and shows how the founding documents created the pinnacle of the development of government to date; follows the outline of the Declaration of Independence in describing the many grievances we have with our government today, based on its extraordinary departures from the founding documents, which justify the Revolution; discusses religion, its importance to the Founders, the elemental morality it provides, and the importance of morality to the necessary function of society; discusses the nature of liberty, how it is different from freedom, and why maximizing liberty is one of the primary responsibilities of government; outlines the derivation of and the importance of the rule of law to the functioning of a society; highlights the tragic failure of American education by global standards; communicates the rationale for and critical importance of free enterprise and free trade and why free enterprise is the greatest engine for economic growth and personal development in the history of the world; provides a roadmap for the accomplishment of the Revolution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aeY9qRF_xCoC&dq=Restoring+The+Future&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Werewolf of Paris","description":"Endore's classic werewolf novel - now back in paperback for the first time in over forty years - helped define a genre and set a new standard in horror fiction The werewolf is one of the great iconic figures of horror in folklore, legend, film, and literature. And connoisseurs of horror fiction know that The Werewolf of Paris is a cornerstone work, a masterpiece of the genre that deservedly ranks with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Endore's classic novel has not only withstood the test of time since it was first published in 1933, but it boldly used and portrayed elements of sexual compulsion in ways that had never been seen before, at least not in horror literature. In this gripping work of historical fiction, Endore's werewolf, an outcast named Bertrand Caillet, travels across pre-Revolutionary France seeking to calm the beast within. Stunning in its sexual frankness and eerie, fog-enshrouded visions, this novel was decidedly influential for the generations of horror and science fiction authors who came afterward.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zrVGEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","description":"The hero, Daniel Deronda, adopted son of an English aristocrat, discovers his Jewish heritage and with that his heritage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zUdrBsuRurkC&dq=Daniel+Deronda+(Novels+of+George+Eliot)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lucy Maud Montgomery: A Writer&#8217;s Life (Snapshots: Images of People and Places in History)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Unseen Danger: A Tragedy of People, Government, and the Centralia Mine Fire","description":"The true story of the Centralia mine fire; a government's indecisiveness and a town's struggle for survival.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s_WiQgAACAAJ&dq=Unseen+Danger:+A+Tragedy+of+People,+Government,+and+the+Centralia+Mine+Fire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","description":"Argues that students are missing out on learning fundamental skills because of the emphasis on becoming computer literate.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3UTH2byTsvwC&dq=High+Tech+Heretic:+Why+Computers+Don%27t+Belong+in+the+Classroom+and+Other+Reflections+by+a+Computer+Contrarian&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Henry the Eighth and his court: An historical romance","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2VRHAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","description":"Revised to reflect critical trends of the past 15 years, the third iteration of this widely adopted critical edition presents the 1831 text of Mary Shelley's English Romantic novel along with critical essays that introduce students to Frankenstein from contemporary psychoanalytic, Marxist, feminist, gender/queer, postcolonial, and cultural studies perspectives.

Written by an experienced authority on matrices and statistical theory, this handbook is organized by topic rather than mathematical developments and includes numerous references to both the theory behind the methods and the applications of the methods. A uniform approach is applied to each chapter, which contains four parts: a definition followed by a list of results; a short list of references to related topics in the book; one or more references to proofs; and references to applications. The use of extensive cross-referencing to topics within the book and external referencing to proofs allows for definitions to be located easily as well as interrelationships among subject areas to be recognized. A Matrix Handbook for Statisticians addresses the need for matrix theory topics to be presented together in one book and features a collection of topics not found elsewhere under one cover. These topics include: Complex matrices A wide range of special matrices and their properties Special products and operators, such as the Kronecker product Partitioned and patterned matrices Matrix analysis and approximation Matrix optimization Majorization Random vectors and matrices Inequalities, such as probabilistic inequalities Additional topics, such as rank, eigenvalues, determinants, norms, generalized inverses, linear and quadratic equations, differentiation, and Jacobians, are also included. The book assumes a fundamental knowledge of vectors and matrices, maintains a reasonable level of abstraction when appropriate, and provides a comprehensive compendium of linear algebra results with use or potential use in statistics.

Yet shyness can be cured, says Dr. Philip Zimbardo, the nation's leading authority on shyness. With co-author Shirley Radl, Dr. Zimbardo presents a program for overcoming and preventing shyness from infancy to adulthood. The Shy Child is based on pioneering research conducted at the Stanford Shyness Clinic, including surveys of people in the U.S. and abroad; interviews with children, parents, and teachers; and systematic experimental research that compared the behavior of shy to non-shy people. This book documents which parenting 'style' encourages self-confidence in a child, and provides methods for building a child's trust and self-esteem. It explores the role that school plays in contributing to a child's shyness, and suggests ways to improve the quality of the classroom experience for every child. The Shy Child is the only book to provide an effective program for conquering shyness in childhood, before it has a chance to limit a child's options and determine the course of the child's life.

For them, the inherent drive to cross-dress is often more powerful than sexual drive itself. This phenomenon has often been confronted with both ignorance and prejudice. Transvestites have been subjected not only to discrimination but also to criminal prosecution for following what, for them, was an inborn inclination. Dr. Hirschfeld created this book to establish a body of knowledge about an often misunderstood topic and to strip away long held prejudices. This classic gender study, first published in Germany in 1910 and newly translated, explores all aspects of transvestism: social, physical and emotional. Transvestism is a firmly rooted psychological phenomenon and cultural tradition, in spite of religious, legal and social sanctions. Written 80 years ago, this book was and still is the most comprehensive treatise on the subject of transvestism, illustrating that while styles have changed, the enthusiasm of devotees has not. Part I introduces transvestites with sympathetic, often amusing case histories, defines symptoms, and explains their basic, erotic character. Part II explores the forceful drive to cross-dress and examines clothing as a form of expression of personality. Part III addresses the historical, legal, anthropological, and social aspects of transvestism, and includes fascinating chapters on transvestism as it relates to the Bible, law and criminality, and women in the military. This book conclusively demonstrates that transvestism is a natural extension of the infinite variations of human personality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fffZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Transvestites:+The+Erotic+Drive+To+Cross+Dress+(New+Concepts+in+Human+Sexuality)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This Is Mozambique","description":"The blue water of the Indian Ocean, a warm tropical sun and endless beaches framed with tropical vegetation are but some of the attractions of Mozambique.

In these four dialogues, Plato develops the Socratic belief in responsibility for one's self and shows Socrates- condemned to suicide by his fellow Athenians-living and dying under his own philosophy. In Euthyphro, Socrates debates goodness outside the courthouse; Apology sees him in court, rebutting all charges of impiety; in Crito, he refuses an entreaty to escape from prison; and in Phaedo, Socrates faces his impending death with calmness and a skillful discussion of immortality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FXKlEoGlUzEC&dq=The+Last+Days+of+Socrates&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Structured Products","description":"This book is essential in understanding, investing and risk managing the holy grail of investments - structured products.

There is a careful analysis of Soviet foreign policy alongside the inception of the Bolshevik state with its global manifesto of revolutionary change; Stalin's struggle to survive the twin threats of a revisionist Germany and militant Japan through alliance with the capitalist states; the expansion of Soviet power in the closing stages of World War II and the subsequent Cold War; the Soviet search for some form of accommodation with the West from the 1960s onwards; the attempts of successive leaderships to find a way of regenerating the failing Soviet system and the impact of economic weakness on Soviet behaviour in both the Third World and Eastern Europe. Based on a wide range of sources, including Russian materials that have become available since the end of the Cold War, this work differs from many standard accounts in its emphasis of the factional nature of decision-making over external strategies and its description of competing strains in Soviet thinking about the outside world.--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t0emtAEACAAJ&dq=Russia+and+the+World+1917-1991+(International+Relations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Writing for Children & Other People","description":"Bestselling author of 89 published books for children, Robyn Opie Parnell, can show you how you can easily write for children - and make money from your passion!

She focuses on the works of five schools of thought and ten well-known Chinese thinkers from Confucius to Han Feizi to the the Later Mohists. Lu identifies seven key Chinese terms pertaining to speech, language, persuasion, and argumentation as they appeared in these original texts, selecting ming bian as the linchpin for the Chinese conceptual term of rhetorical studies. Lu compares Chinese rhetorical perspectives with those of the ancient Greeks, illustrating that the Greeks and the Chinese shared a view of rhetoric as an ethical enterprise and of speech as a rational and psychological activity. The two traditions differed, however, in their rhetorical education, sense of rationality, perceptions of the role of language, approach to the treatment and study of rhetoric, and expression of emotions. Lu also links ancient Chinese rhetorical perspectives with contemporary Chinese interpersonal and political communication behavior and offers suggestions for a multicultural rhetoric that recognizes both culturally specific and transcultural elements of human communication.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lw9hEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Akshay Vastu Arvind","description":"This two-volume work presents a comprehensive survey of all the ways people celebrate religious life around the globe. ?

Although America's reaction to the attack was intense and the search for the missing child as highly publicized as the later Lindbergh kidnapping, little was known or understood at the time about why or how the tragedy had occurred. Marc Simmons sheds the first light on the McComas family's fatal path and gives the first complete picture of circumstances surrounding this tragic event. From long-buried fragments, Simmons reconstructs the events of that fateful day, as well as the U.S. Army's first legal \\"hot pursuit\\" of an Apache raiding party into Mexico that followed. The puzzle of why a reputably wise and able man would lead his family into such a fatal predicament and the ironic circumstance of young Charles McComas's death at the hands of U.S. troops illustrate that past events were as complex and sometimes as confusing as those today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7mRJfZP_e7IC&dq=Massacre+on+the+Lordsburg+Road:+A+Tragedy+of+the+Apache+Wars+(Elma+Dill+Russell+Spencer+Series+in+the+West+and+Southwest)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Family To Be (The Daddy Club) (Harlequin American Romance)","description":"Harlequin American Romance brings you four new all-American romances for one great price, available now!

The women of the Bible lived timeless stories by examining them, we can understand what it means to be a woman of faith. People unfamiliar with Scripture often assume that women play a small, secondary role in the Bible. But in fact, they were central figures in numerous Biblical tales. It was Queen Esther s bravery at a vital point in history which saved her entire people. The Bible contains warriors like Jael, judges like Deborah, and prophets like Miriam. The first person to witness Jesus  resurrection was Mary Magdalene, who promptly became the first Christian evangelist, eager to share the news which would change the world forever. In The Women of the Bible Speak, Fox News Channel's Shannon Bream opens up the lives of sixteen of these Biblical women, arranging them into pairs and contrasting their journeys. In pairing their stories, Shannon helps us reflect not only on the meaning of each individual s life, but on how they relate to each other and to us. From the shepherdesses of ancient Israel who helped raise the future leaders of the people of God, to the courageous early Christians, the narrative of the Bible offers us many vivid and fascinating female characters. In their lives we can see common struggles to resist bitterness, despair, and pride, and to instead find their true selves in faith, hope, and love. In studying these heroes of the faith, we can find wisdom and warnings for how to better navigate our own faith journeys. The Women of the Bible Speak outlines the lessons we can take from the valor of Esther, the hope of Hannah, the audacity of Rahab, and the faith of Mary. In broadening each woman s individual story, Shannon offers us a deeper understanding of each, and wisdom and insights that can transform our own lives today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YCb9DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Gardener's Handbook of Plant Names: Their Meanings and Origins","description":"DIVFirst compact dictionary to combine definitions of botanical names in general usage with derivation, facts, and lore, plus guides to pronunciation.

From the smallest gnat to the largest aircraft, all things that fly obey the same aerodynamic principles. In The Simple Science of Flight, Henk Tennekes investigates just how machines and creatures fly: what size wings they need, how much energy is required for their journeys, how they cross deserts and oceans, how they take off, climb, and soar. Fascinated by the similarities between nature and technology, Tennekes offers an introduction to flight that teaches by association. Swans and Boeings differ in numerous ways, but they follow the same aerodynamic principles. Biological evolution and its technical counterpart exhibit exciting parallels. What makes some airplanes successful and others misfits? Why does the Boeing 747 endure but the Concorde now seem a fluke? Tennekes explains the science of flight through comparisons, examples, equations, and anecdotes. The new edition of this popular book has been thoroughly revised and much expanded. Highlights of the new material include a description of the incredible performance of bar-tailed godwits (7,000 miles nonstop from Alaska to New Zealand), an analysis of the convergence of modern jetliners (from both Boeing and Airbus), a discussion of the metabolization of energy featuring Lance Armstrong, a novel treatment of the aerodynamics of drag and trailing vortices, and an emphasis throughout on evolution, in nature and in engineering. Tennekes draws on new evidence on bird migration, new wind-tunnel studies, and data on new airliners. And his analysis of the relative efficiency of planes, trains, and automobiles is newly relevant. (On a cost-per-seat scale, a 747 is more efficient than a passenger car.)","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lt4PQPDhX5YC&dq=The+Simple+Science+of+Flight&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On City Streets An anthology of Poetry","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RWmBnQEACAAJ&dq=On+City+Streets+An+anthology+of+Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Close Friends","description":"If you've ever loved a dog, a cat, an old barn, or a place in the country, you will love CLOSE FRIENDS.

Equally significant, it is the first book to explain how and why the Portuguese were not able to modernize their trade system when faced with crisis conditions. The distress that confronted the Portuguese following the arrival of the Dutch and English, seen here as partly military but fundamentally economic and organizational, reached its decisive stage in the 1620s and early 1630s. The Portuguese attempted to combat the crisis by creating their own India Company. The story of that company and the reasons for its failure are thoroughly investigated as Disney looks at its antecedents, composition, activities, and weaknesses. The author has unearthed much new statistical material from widely scattered manuscript sources and in doing so sheds new light on related problems and issues, such as institutional relations between Spain and Portugal, the careers of individual merchants, and the nature and difficulties of viceregal government in Portuguese India.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MOkcAAAAMAAJ&dq=Twilight+of+the+Pepper+Empire:+Portuguese+Trade+in+Southwest+India+in+the+Early+Seventeenth+Century+(Harvard+Historical+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Starfleet Dynamics: A Starfleet Academy Reference Guide & Textbook (25th Anniversary Collector's Edition, ST VI: TUC, Stardate 9200)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LWZNHAAACAAJ&dq=Starfleet+Dynamics:+A+Starfleet+Academy+Reference+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Hundred Hungry Ants","description":"This tale of ants parading toward a picnic is  one of those rare gems capable of entertaining while it instructs  (Middlesex News).

That distinctive mission cannot be forced into an either/or framework but rather a both/and calling. It is a commitment to Jesus Christ himself, who is both fully God and fully human and who for Christian educators is both light and life. This multi-authored volume, with dynamic contributions from entry-level faculty members to seasoned scholars, explores the question of the Christian faith s place on the university campus, whether in administrative matters, the broader academic world, or in student life.

It shows that they were original thinkers, with a profound reverence for the text of the Scriptures, and minds keenly tranined to discuss what ultimate truths were expressed in the scriptural text and what reality should be ascribed to Christian religious experience. The results indicate that a good deal which is assumed in current theological text-books needs to be revised. The Fathers had to reconcile monotheism with faith in a Trinity of divine Persons. In the process, they pursued many lines of inquiry, often only to discard them after trial, but after following various clues and making various intellectual adventures they reached a solution of the problem, which was both true to their data and philosophically reasonable. Though the bulk of the book is concerned with the third and fourth centuries, during which the creeds were in the process of formulation, the story is carried down to the eighth century where the progress of original thought came to a standstill. It is shown that a great change came over the philosophical tradition during the sixth century, and owing to the consequent growth of formalism, a genuine outbreak of tritheism occurred. The book ends with the account of how this outbreak was met and overcome, largely through the efforts of a thinker whose very name is unknown, and whose book has only survived under the name of another man.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bztKAwAAQBAJ&dq=God+in+patristic+thought&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Does Not Condemn: The World, the Flesh, and the Devil According to Platonism, Christianity, Gnosticism, and 'A Course in Miracles'","description":"This book explains in the depth the non-dualistic metaphysics of A Course in Miracles, and its integration with living in this illusory world.

This collection can only enhance that reputation.  The New York Times Book Review Author and travel writer Paul Theroux does what no one else can: he travels to the isolated, unusual, and fascinating spots of the world, and creates an elegy to them that makes readers feel they are traveling with him. Evocative, breathtaking, intriguing, here is the armchair traveler's guide to the sites of the world he makes us feel we know. Praise for To the Ends of the Earth  Reads like a wonderful novel.  The Pittsburgh Press  Powerful . . . This compendium unequivocally offers insight into the mind of a foremost American fiction writer who became an accidental tourist.  The Christian Science Monitor  Theroux is a wonderful traveling companion. . . . To the Ends of the Earth combines the best of his travel writing. . . . With him the reader shares a conversation with a sultan on a polo ground in Malaysia; hears people  mourn with firecrackers, scattering cherrybombs on the tombstone  in a Chinese cemetery in Singapore; feels overdressed around nudists in Corsica; sees sandbagged houses and bombcraters left in Vietnam on a cold December day in 1973.  The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star  Travel writing at its best . . . As you travel voyeuristically with Theroux, across the vast wastelands of interior China, the convoluted cultures of Latin America or campy seacoast towns of England, you're struck with his slightly jaundiced eye for the overlooked but telling detail, his skeptic's ear for the offhand but important comment.

London was still recovering from the devastation of World War II when another disaster hit: for five long days in December 1952, a killer smog held the city firmly in its grip and refused to let go. Day became night, mass transit ground to a halt, criminals roamed the streets, and some 12,000 people died from the poisonous air. But in the chaotic aftermath, another killer was stalking the streets, using the fog as a cloak for his crimes. All across London, women were going missing--poor women, forgotten women. Their disappearances caused little alarm, but each of them had one thing in common: they had the misfortune of meeting a quiet, unassuming man, John Reginald Christie, who invited them back to his decrepit Notting Hill flat during that dark winter. They never left. The eventual arrest of the \\"Beast of Rillington Place\\" caused a media frenzy: were there more bodies buried in the walls, under the floorboards, in the back garden of this house of horrors? Was it the fog that had caused Christie to suddenly snap? And what role had he played in the notorious double murder that had happened in that same apartment building not three years before--a murder for which another, possibly innocent, man was sent to the gallows? The Great Smog of 1952 remains the deadliest air pollution disaster in world history, and John Reginald Christie is still one of the most unfathomable serial killers of modern times. Journalist Kate Winkler Dawson braids these strands together into a taut, compulsively readable true crime thriller about a man who changed the fate of the death penalty in the UK, and an environmental catastrophe with implications that still echo today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2mARDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of John Yardley","description":"Gathers the paintings of the watercolor impressionist and examines his motivation and techniques","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VfdVPgAACAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+John+Yardley&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Statistics and Econometric Models: Volume 1, General Concepts, Estimation, Prediction and Algorithms (Themes in Modern Econometrics)","description":"This two-volume work aims to present as completely as possible the methods of statistical inference with special reference to their economic applications.

Twenty years later, Eden runs a successful catering company and dreams of opening a restaurant. Since childhood, she has heard from her father only rarely, just enough to know that he s been living on the streets and struggling with mental illness. But lately there has been no word at all. After a series of failed romantic relationships and a health scare from her mother, Eden decides it s time to find her father, to forgive him at last, and move forward with her own life. Her search takes her to a downtown Seattle homeless shelter, and to Jack Baker, its handsome and charming director. Jack convinces Eden to volunteer her skills as a professional chef with the shelter. In return, he helps her in her quest.

Eihei Dogen: Mystical Realist is a comprehensive introduction to the genius of this brilliant thinker. This thirteenth-century figure has much to teach us all and the questions that drove him have always been at the heart of Buddhist practice. At the age of seven, in 1207, Dogen lost his mother, who at her death earnestly asked him to become a monastic to seek the truth of Buddhism. We are told that in the midst of profound grief, Dogen experienced the impermanence of all things as he watched the incense smoke ascending at his mother's funeral service. This left an indelible impression upon the young Dogen; later, he would emphasize time and again the intimate relationship between the desire for enlightenment and the awareness of impermanence. His way of life would not be a sentimental flight from, but a compassionate understanding of, the intolerable reality of existence. At age 13, Dogen received ordination at Mt. Hiei. And yet, a question arose: \\"As I study both the exoteric and the esoteric schools of Buddhism, they maintain that human beings are endowed with Dharma-nature by birth. If this is the case, why did the buddhas of all ages - undoubtedly in possession of enlightenment - find it necessary to seek enlightenment and engage in spiritual practice?\\" When it became clear that no one on Mt. Hiei could give a satisfactory answer to this spiritual problem, he sought elsewhere, eventually making the treacherous journey to China. This was the true beginning of a life of relentless questioning, practice, and teaching - an immensely inspiring contribution to the Buddhadharma. As you might imagine, a book as ambitious as Eihei Dogen: Mystical Realist has to be both academically rigorous and eminently readable to succeed. Professor Hee-Jim Kim's work is indeed both.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bUAq8JqRqTIC&dq=Dogen+Kigen+Mystical+Realist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moon Handbooks Maui: Including Moloka'i and Lana'i","description":"Looking for more than the standard itinerary?

Beginning in the mid-1960s, the practice of medicine in the United States underwent a most remarkable--and thoroughly controversial--transformation. The discretion that the profession once enjoyed has been increasingly circumscribed, and now an almost bewildering number of parties and procedures participate in medical decision making. Well into the post-World War II period, decisions at the bedside were the almost exclusive concern of the individual physician, even when they raised fundamental ethical and social issues. It was mainly doctors who wrote and read about the morality of withholding a course of antibiotics and letting pneumonia serve as the old man's best friend, of considering a newborn with grave birth defects a \\"stillbirth\\" thus sparing the parents the agony of choice and the burden of care, of experimenting on the institutionalized the retarded to learn more about hepatitis, or of giving one patient and not another access to the iron lung when the machine was in short supply. Moreover, it was usually the individual physician who decided these matters without formal discussions with patients, their families, or even with colleagues, and certainly without drawing the attention of journalists, judges, or professional philosophers. The impact of the invasion of outsiders into medical decision-making, most generally framed, was to make the invisible visible. Outsiders to medicine--that is, lawyers, judges, legislators, and academics--have penetrated its every nook and cranny, in the process giving medicine exceptional prominence on the public agenda and making it the subject of popular discourse. The glare of the spotlight transformed medical decision making, shaping not merely the external conditions under which medicine would be practiced (something that the state, through the regulation of licensure, had always done), but the very substance of medical pract","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mx0uDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on The Importance of Being Earnest (Cliffsnotes Literature)","description":"The Importance of Being Earnest is a play by Oscar Wilde. it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personae in order to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humor, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus that it was the culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play. The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde's career but also heralded his downfall. The Marquess of Queensberry, whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde's lover, planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show. Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission. Soon afterwards their feud came to a climax in court, where Wilde's homosexual double life was revealed to the Victorian public and he was eventually sentenced to imprisonment. His notoriety caused the play, despite its early success, to be closed after 86 performances. After his release, he published the play from exile in Paris, but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GFNoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Detroit Divided (Multi City Study of Urban Inequality)","description":"Unskilled workers once flocked to Detroit, attracted by manufacturing jobs paying union wages, but the passing of Detroit's manufacturing heyday has left many of those workers stranded. Manufacturing continues to employ high-skilled workers, and new work can be found in suburban service jobs, but the urban plants that used to employ legions of unskilled men are a thing of the past. The authors explain why white auto workers adjusted to these new conditions more easily than blacks. Taking advantage of better access to education and suburban home loans, white men migrated into skilled jobs on the city's outskirts, while blacks faced the twin barriers of higher skill demands and hostile suburban neighborhoods. Some blacks have prospered despite this racial divide: a black elite has emerged, and the shift in the city toward municipal and service jobs has allowed black women to approach parity of earnings with white women. But Detroit remains polarized racially, economically, and geographically to a degree seen in few other American cities.

With its first edition, The Longman Anthology of British Literature created a new paradigm for anthologies. Responding to major shifts in literary studies over the past thirty years, it was the first collection to pay sustained attention to the contexts within which literature is produced, even as it broadened the scope of that literature to embrace the full cultural diversity of the British Isles. Within its pages, canonical authors mingle with newly visible writers; English accents are heard next to Anglo-Norman, Welsh, Gaelic, and Scottish ones; female and male voices are set in dialogue; literature from the British Isles is integrated with post-colonial writing; and major works are illumined by clusters of shorter texts that bring literary, social, and historical issues vividly to life. The Fifth Edition builds on the pioneering features of the previous four editions, expanding the strong core of frequently taught works while continuing to lead the way in responding to the shifting interests of the discipline.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yz-gKQEACAAJ&dq=The+Longman+Anthology+of+British+Literature+(The+Early+Modern+Period)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wedding Details FAQ's","description":"Wedding planning answers and questions from the top 6 experts at weddingdetails.com, covering Etiquette, Mother-of-the bride matters (Goodall), Music and Dance, Traditions and Culture, Photography/Videography, and honeymoon travel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hCzPAQAACAAJ&dq=Wedding+Details+FAQ%27s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Angels' War Against God","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mzQEAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Angels%27+War+Against+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fan","description":"Arch and unrepentant, Will Leitch, founding editor of Deadspin.com, is the mouthpiece for all the frustrated fans who just want their games back from big money, bloated egos, and blathering sportscasters.

He did so by wedding the language of common speech to metrical verse, creating a medium that could accommodate tales of courtly romance, bawdy fabliaux, astute psychological portraiture, dramatic monologues, moral allegories, and its author s astonishing learning in fields from philosophy to medicine and astrology. Chaucer s accomplishment is unequalled by any poet before Shakespeare and in The Canterbury Tales and Troilus and Cressida ranks with that of the great English novelists. Both The Canterbury Tales and Troilus and Cressida are presented complete in this anthology, in fresh modern translations by Theodore Morrison that convey both the gravity and gaiety of the Middle English originals. The Portable Chaucer also contains selections from The Book of Duchess, The House of Fame, The Bird's Parliament, and The Legend of Good Women, together with short poems. Morrison's introduction is vital for its insights into Chaucer as man and artist, and as a product of the Middle Ages whose shrewdness, humor, and compassion have a wonderfully contemporary ring.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0hy3q85lptAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"City Peregrines: A Ten-Year Saga of New York City Falcons","description":"This is more than a story of how the world's most spectacular aerial predator invaded and took over New York City.

Both of these scripts yield clues of great historical importance. Fischers previous decipherment, of a Cretan artefact called the Phaistos Disk, provided the key to the ancient Minoan language and showed it to be closely related to Mycenaean Greek. Fischer's decipherment of Rongorongo shows that it was not merely a mnemonic device for recalling memorised texts, but was actually read and used for creative composition. This is the exciting story of these two decipherments, by the man who now must rank as the greatest glyphbreaker of all time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rHsiBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Singing Sea/El Mar que Canta (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NXDxHIpAKm0C&dq=Singing+Sea/El+Mar+que+Canta+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LETTERS FROM ICELAND","description":"Shares, in prose, verse, and photographs, the impressions of the authors as they journeyed through Iceland","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zqxZAAAAYAAJ&dq=LETTERS+FROM+ICELAND&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"High-Tech Heretic: Reflections of a Computer Contrarian","description":"The author of Silicon Snake Oil offers a provocative and controversial critique of the educational applications and benefits of computers and provides a commonsense look at how technology can be best utilized and controlled in the modern world.

Monica Toft introduces and tests a theory of ethnic violence, one that provides a compelling general explanation of not only most ethnic violence, civil wars, and terrorism but many interstate wars as well. This understanding can foster new policy initiatives with real potential to make ethnic violence either less likely or less destructive. It can also guide policymakers to solutions that endure. The book offers a distinctively powerful synthesis of comparative politics and international relations theories, as well as a striking blend of statistical and historical case study methodologies. By skillfully combining a statistical analysis of a large number of ethnic conflicts with a focused comparison of historical cases of ethnic violence and nonviolence--including four major conflicts in the former Soviet Union--it achieves a rare balance of general applicability and deep insight. Toft concludes that only by understanding how legitimacy and power interact can we hope to learn why some ethnic conflicts turn violent while others do not. Concentrated groups defending a self-defined homeland often fight to the death, while dispersed or urbanized groups almost never risk violence to redress their grievances. Clearly written and rigorously documented, this book represents a major contribution to an ongoing debate that spans a range of disciplines including international relations, comparative politics, sociology, and history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KK6zpgy_CiAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fractal and Chaotic Properties of Earthquakes (Lecture Notes in Earth Sciences)","description":"This book deals with the application of fractal and nonlinear time-series analysis to seismicity and earthquakes within the framework of earthquake prediction research.

In 1803 President Thomas Jefferson selected his personal secretary, Captain Meriwether Lewis, to lead a voyage up the Missouri River to the Rockies, over the mountains, down the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean, and back. Lewis and his partner, Captain William Clark, made the first map of the trans-Mississippi West, provided invaluable scientific data on the flora and fauna of the Louisiana Purchase territory, and established the American claim to Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Ambrose has pieced together previously unknown information about weather, terrain, and medical knowledge at the time to provide a vivid backdrop for the expedition. Lewis is supported by a rich variety of colorful characters, first of all Jefferson himself, whose interest in exploring and acquiring the American West went back thirty years.

Charles K. Armstrong contends that a major source of North Korea's strength and resiliency, as well as of its flaws and shortcomings, lies in the poorly understood origins of its system of government. He examines the genesis of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) both as an important yet rarely studied example of a communist state and as part of modern Korean history. North Korea is one of the last redoubts of \\"unreformed\\" Marxism-Leninism in the world. Yet it is not a Soviet satellite in the East European manner, nor is its government the result of a local revolution, as in Cuba and Vietnam. Instead, the DPRK represents a unique \\"indigenization\\" of Soviet Stalinism, Armstrong finds. The system that formed under the umbrella of the Soviet occupation quickly developed into a nationalist regime as programs initiated from above merged with distinctive local conditions. Armstrong's account is based on long-classified documents captured by U.S. forces during the Korean War. This enormous archive of over 1.6 million pages provides unprecedented insight into the making of the Pyongyang regime and fuels the author's argument that the North Korean state is likely to remain viable for some years to come.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Bq6dDgAAQBAJ&dq=The+North+Korean+Revolution,+1945-1950+(Studies+of+the+Weatherhead+East+Asian+Institute,+Columbia+University)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Experiment (Double Fastback Horror Series)","description":"Many students get their first real taste of reading for pleasure when they pick up a Fastback.

From high-profile women's professional leagues to high-school-level champions, girl athletes are acheiving record breakthroughs. Witness, for example, the first spectacular season of the WNBA, or the celebrated victories of women's teams at the 1996 Olympics. The female athlete is a new media darling especially beloved of today's teenage girls, who are almost as likely to have pictures of Rebecca Lobo, Mia Hamm, or Gabrielle Reece on their walls as posters of Leonardo DiCaprio. So it seems paradoxical that many books and studies attest to a truly sobering picture of girls' lives. With her book Reviving Ophelia, Mary Pipher was only the latest in a string of theorists to describe the dramatic ways in which girls loose self-esteem during the critical years of adolescence, contributing to eating disorders, drug problems, and chronic depression in many young women. In Raising Our Athletic Daughters, journalists Zimmerman and Reavill set out to talk with girls and their parents about how sports can transform girls' lives. Here are firsthand stories from the inner cities and rural playing fields across the nation, offering compelling evidence that participation in athletics makes an extraordinary difference in the lives of young girls, from reducing pregnancy rates and substance abuse to increasing college attendance. Raising Our Athletic Daughters is a clarion call for all those eager to help their children succeed and level the playing field, at last.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ucE3oBhXaRkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mermaid's Three Wisdoms","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R9_SSAAACAAJ&dq=The+Mermaid%27s+Three+Wisdoms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Minsk","description":"An educational cookbook, aimed at the descendants of those who carried their cuisines on journeys far from their original homes, pays tribute to traditional Jewish cuisine and heritage through recipes that have been brought to life for a whole new generation of cooks and can be used on holidays or any other day of the year. 20,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s_9vDwAAQBAJ&dq=Minsk&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tozer CD-ROM Library (Version)","description":"The Tozer CD-ROM Library is a searchable database containing the vast majority of Tozer's written works.

So why has he accepted a case for $4.30? And why have the last two people to hire him been ruthlessly murdered? Wolfe suspects the answers may lie in the story of a twelve-year-old boy who turns up at the door of his West Thirty-fifth Street brownstone. In short order, Wolfe finds himself confronted by one of his most perplexing and pressing cases, involving a curious set of clues: a gray Cadillac, a mysterious woman, and a pair of earrings shaped like spiders dipped in gold. The case is all boiling down to a strange taste of greed and a grumpy gourmand s unappeasable appetite for truth. Introduction by Linda Barnes  It is always a treat to read a Nero Wolfe mystery.

His fascinating anecdotal history is constructed around the personal passions and signal contributions of the resort's three successive owners: New York aristocrat and Union Pacific Railroad chairman Averell Harriman, Los Angeles land developer and Olympic skier Bill Janss, and self-made Salt Lake City oil man and hotel magnate Earl Holding. Sauter lavishes special attention on recounting how Harriman's founding vision was, with breathtaking alacrity over eleven months in 1936, translated into the unique, opulent, and acclaimed reality that formed the enduring base for the spectacular resort we know today.Splendidly endowed by both nature and culture, Sun Valley and its environs are surrounded by four magnificent mountain ranges (one incorporating Bald Mountain, regarded by many as the premier ski mountain in the world) that are watered by four diverse, revered fishing streams, their beauty protected forever by virtue of their abiding largely on federal lands. It possesses a colorful history that includes Native Americans, fur trappers, late-19th century miners and railroaders, early-20th century sheep barons, and, since the 1930's, a low key but glamorous life that has drawn not only the top European and domestic figures in the sport of skiing but also the rich, the celebrated, and the accomplished-among them Ernest Hemingway and Marilyn Monroe, the founders of Facebook and Microsoft, and the author of this book's foreword, Clint Eastwood, to name a few-to this exceptional place. Complementing Sauter's lively text is an offering of stunning vintage and contemporary images, many of them fresh to print, that capture the landscape, the history, and the individuals that have and continue to make Sun Valley an American original.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tt79ygAACAAJ&dq=Sun+Valley&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Memos to the President: Management Advice From the Nation's Top CEOs (Wiley Audio)","description":"Eavesdrop in the corridors of power . . .

The economic model promoted by the behavior economy is a model where behavior is the only goal of our actions, and where intrinsic motivation is the key to participation, engagement, and the satisfaction of multiple dimensions of value. Value Creation and the Internet of Things describes value delivery and consumption, and the mechanisms by which new value is captured and created, in enterprises dedicated to competing and prospering in this new environment. This book is significant in the context of the Internet of Things becoming mainstream, forcing organizations to re-examine their value creation methodologies in light of new consumer behavior and expectations. The Internet of Things will reframe the existence of the ones enriched by it. It will do so not because it can, but because our motivation will demand it. This is a book about reframing reality for new and incumbent organizations. The reality to reframe is not an imaginary one, but the immediate reality in which one operates: the behavior economy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aiqrCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Elementary Introduction to the Theory of Probability (Dover Books on Mathematics)","description":"This compact volume equips the reader with all the facts and principles essential to a fundamental understanding of the theory of probability. It is an introduction, no more: throughout the book the authors discuss the theory of probability for situations having only a finite number of possibilities, and the mathematics employed is held to the elementary level. But within its purposely restricted range it is extremely thorough, well organized, and absolutely authoritative. It is the only English translation of the latest revised Russian edition; and it is the only current translation on the market that has been checked and approved by Gnedenko himself. After explaining in simple terms the meaning of the concept of probability and the means by which an event is declared to be in practice, impossible, the authors take up the processes involved in the calculation of probabilities. They survey the rules for addition and multiplication of probabilities, the concept of conditional probability, the formula for total probability, Bayes's formula, Bernoulli's scheme and theorem, the concepts of random variables, insufficiency of the mean value for the characterization of a random variable, methods of measuring the variance of a random variable, theorems on the standard deviation, the Chebyshev inequality, normal laws of distribution, distribution curves, properties of normal distribution curves, and related topics. The book is unique in that, while there are several high school and college textbooks available on this subject, there is no other popular treatment for the layman that contains quite the same material presented with the same degree of clarity and authenticity. Anyone who desires a fundamental grasp of this increasingly important subject cannot do better than to start with this book. New preface for Dover edition by B. V.

Yet few people today are familiar with the majority of tales from the two early volumes, since in the next four decades the Grimms would publish six other editions, each extensively revised in content and style. For the very first time, 'The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm' makes available in English all 156 stories from the 1812 and 1815 editions. These narrative gems, newly translated and brought together in one beautiful book, are accompanied by sumptuous new illustrations from award-winning artist Andrea Dezs?. From 'The Frog King' to 'The Golden Key, ' wondrous worlds unfold--heroes and heroines are rewarded, weaker animals triumph over the strong, and simple bumpkins prove themselves not so simple after all. Esteemed fairy tale scholar Jack Zipes offers accessible translations that retain the spare description and engaging storytelling style of the originals. Indeed, this is what makes the tales from the 1812 and 1815 editions unique--they reflect diverse voices, rooted in oral traditions, that are absent from the Grimms' later, more embellished collections of tales. Zipes's introduction gives important historical context, and the book includes the Grimms' prefaces and notes.

Since the death of her husband, her high-school-age son, Nate, has developed a rebellious streak, constantly falling in and out of trouble. Her kindhearted younger son, Danny, though well behaved, struggles to pass his remedial classes. All the while, Sarah must make ends meet by running a catering business out of her home. But when a shocking and unbelievable revelation rips apart the family of her closest friend, Sarah finds herself welcoming yet another young boy into her already tumultuous life. Jordan, a quiet and reclusive elementary-school boy and classmate of Danny's, has survived a terrible tragedy, leaving him without a family. When Sarah becomes Jordan's foster mother, a relationship develops that will force her to question the things of which she thought she was so sure. Yet Sarah is not the only one changed by this young boy, and as the delicate balance that holds her family together begins to falter, the Ladens will all face truths about themselves and one another -- and discover the power of love to forgive and to heal. Powerful and poignant, The Kindness of Strangers is a shocking look at how the tragedy of a single family in a small suburban town can affect so many.

Early human remains are restricted in distribution to Africa and the acquisition of an upright bipedal striding gait, the hallmark of humanity, appears to be at least circumstantially linked to the reduction of equatorial forests and the spread of grasslands on that continent. The diverse Lothagam fauna documents the end-Miocene transition from forested to more open habitats that were exploited by grazing horses and antelopes, hippos, giant pigs, and true elephants. It also includes spectacularly complete fossil carnivore skeletons and some of the oldest human remains. Enlisting a team of highly qualified specialists, this book provides the geologic context and dating framework for the Lothagam fossiliferous sequences, describes the immense diversity of vertebrate fossils recovered from the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene sediments, and synthesizes the results to interpret the changing paleoenvironments that prevailed at this site.

Leaving was especially hard because Mariquita felt that she had played an influential role in transforming Buenos Aires from a Spanish colonial outpost into a brilliant capital in a world of republics. Juan Manuel de Rosas s version of order alienated Mariquita, who chose self-imposed exile in Montevideo over living under Rosas s stifling rule. The struggle went on for nearly two decades until Mariquita finally came home for good in 1852 while Rosas went into exile. Mariquita s and Juan Manuel s lives corresponded with the major events and processes that shaped the turbulent beginnings of the Argentine nation, many of which also shaped Latin America and the Atlantic World during the Age of Revolution (17501850). Their lives provide an overarching narrative for Argentine history that both scholars and students will find intriguing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MJawDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holy Writ as Oral Lit: The Bible as Folklore","description":"This book helps us resolve some of the mysteries and contradictions that evolved during the Bible's pre-written legacy and that persist in the Great Book today. Most biblical scholars acknowledge that both the Old and New Testaments were orally transmitted for decades before appearing in written form. With great reverence for the Bible, Dundes offers a new and exciting way to understand its variant texts. He uses the analytical framework of folklore to unearth and contrast the multiple versions of nearly every major biblical event, including the creation of woman, the flood, the ten commandments (there were once as many as eleven or twelve), the names of the twelve tribes, the naming of the disciples, the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord's Prayer, and the words inscribed on the Cross, among many others.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JftPCdyMs5wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Threshold to Music","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SQ5ZAAAAYAAJ&dq=Threshold+to+Music&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The province of jurisprudence determined: And The uses of the study of jurisprudence (Library of ideas)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r7cLAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+province+of+jurisprudence+determined:+And+The+uses+of+the+study+of+jurisprudence+(Library+of+ideas)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knowledge and Power in Morocco: The Education of a Twentieth-Century Notable (Princeton Studies on the Near East)","description":"This intensive social biography of a rural Moroccan judge discusses Islamic education, the concept of knowledge it embodies, and its communication from the early years of colonial rule in twentieth-century Morocco to the present.

For a century the Winnebagos (Ho-Chunks),?Mesquakies (Fox), and Sauks successfully confronted waves of French and British immigration by diversifying their economies and commercializing lead mining. Focusing on personal stories and detailed community histories, Murphy charts the changed economic forces at work in the region, connecting them to shifts in gender roles and intercultural relationships. She argues that French, British, and Native peoples forged cooperative social and economic bonds expressed partly by mixed-race marriages and the emergence of multiethnic communities at Green Bay and Prairie du Chien. Significantly, Native peoples in the western Great Lakes region were able to adapt successfully to the new frontier market economy until their lead mining operations became the envy of outsiders in the 1820s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HHO2QkQNQ7YC&dq=A+Gathering+of+Rivers:+Indians,+Metis,+and+Mining+in+the+Western+Great+Lakes,+1737-1832&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Self Mutilation","description":"Over Half a Million Copies Sold--an Honest-to-Goodness Bestseller Darrell Huff runs the gamut of every popularly used type of statistic, probes such things as the sample study, the tabulation method, the interview technique, or the way the results are derived from the figures, and points up the countless number of dodges which are used to full rather than to inform.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OVclAgAAQBAJ&dq=Self+Mutilation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quick and Easy Flying Origami","description":"Containing designs for more than 20 types of airborne models, from birds to planes, this new addition to the Quick & Easy Origami series has all the necessary materials, including an instruction manual and 90 sheets of colorful origami paper.

What should be the relationship of American Jews to Israel? Can the American Jewish community collectively sustain and pass on to the next generation a sufficient sense of Jewish identity? Jews in America are in a period of unprecedented status and impact, but for many their identity as Jews--religiously, historically, culturally--is increasingly complicated. Many are becoming Jews without Judaism. It appears success and acceptance will accomplish what even the most virulent anti-Semitism never could---if not the disappearance of Jews themselves, the undermining of what it means to be Jewish. In this thoughtful, personal, deeply-reasoned book, Robert Mnookin explores the conundrums of Jewish identity, faith and community in America by delving deep into Jewish history, law, and custom. He talks to rabbis, scholars, and other Jews of many perspectives to explore the head, heart, and heritage of Judaism and confronts key challenges in the Jewish debate from the issue of intermarriage to the matter of Israeli policies. Mnookin shares provocative stories of the ways American Jews have forged (or disavowed) their Jewish identity over the past half-century, including his own to answer the standing question: How can Jews who have different values, perspectives, and relationships with their faith, keep the community open, vibrant, and thriving?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J3RPDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Step One to Seattle Booklet","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Crib Notes for the First Year of Fatherhood: A Survival Guide for New Fathers","description":"Addressing the emotional, financial, and logistical issues of being a new father, DeMorier has filled his new book with practical advice (formulas for saving money for baby, for example) as well as funny send-ups of new fathers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZbYBAAAACAAJ&dq=Crib+Notes+for+the+First+Year+of+Fatherhood:+A+Survival+Guide+for+New+Fathers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enchantment","description":"In Enchantment, Orson Scott Card works his magic as never before, transforming the timeless story of Sleeping Beauty into an original fantasy brimming with romance and adventure.

Solomon has successfully demonstrated this method by restoring health where there was little, if any, hope, and improving the quality of life for tens of thousands.
